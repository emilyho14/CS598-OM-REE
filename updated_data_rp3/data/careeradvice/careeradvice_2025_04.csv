1kbutuw,My job is ruining my mental health.....,"I have been in my current position for almost 3 years and I have been absolutely miserable the entire time but it has gotten really bad over the past year. It was almost bearable when I was able to WFH two days a week, then it was only one, and now I'm pretty much in the office everyday. I am completely burned out, this company has a ""lean and mean"" business model so I am overworked in terms of work load and work long hours. I have zero work/life balance and literally collapse into bed when I get home from work. I no longer have any hobbies or work out because I don't have the energy and I barely have energy to visit with friends and family on the weekends. My social life is down the tubes. Lately I've even been having trouble finding energy to do even the most basic chores like cleaning and laundry. I'm depressed, I've gained weight, and I have non-stop anxiety.

I have been looking for another job for almost a year but I've never encountered a job market like this one. I've applied to hundreds and hundreds of jobs, I had a few interviews here and there (that didn't amount to anything) but I've noticed over the past 2-3 months that I'm not even getting any call backs anymore. I'm even willing to take a paycut. I hate to quit my job and then blow through my entire life's savings because it will probably be near impossible for me to find another job when I'm unemployed if I'm already having this much trouble while I already have one....I don't know what to do....I already did FMLA leave last September for a month....I was a little more rejuvenated for like a month or two when I came back and then I was right back to square one....should I ask HR for a position elimination or mutual separation so I could at least collect unemployment?",rosechardonnay1966,10,1.0,4,1746056400,2025-04-30 23:40:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbutuw/my_job_is_ruining_my_mental_health/,4,2025

I know it's normal for a 20-year-old girl not to have everything figured out with her career, but I feel like I have no direction and no one to help me. I dropped out of university because I felt pressured to join, so I did a random course. I ended up hating it and leaving, which I don't regret.

1kbu546,Received reasonable assurance letter for 25-26 school district sub job: sign it as backup or resign?,"Just received a reasonable assurance letter for the 25-26 school year as a substitute teacher for a school district which says that we get continued employment with the district if we sign it, and they will also send out emails asking about summer school in a couple of weeks.

The new job is at-will, limited term/extra help and temporary, lasting a maximum of less than 2 years and they can terminate if you don’t pass the assessments during the training bootcamp in the first 5 months, and there’s no PTO approved in the first 5 months.

1kbu4gh,First job after graduation,"Hi all.
I’m about to graduate next Saturday as an optometrist, and I still do not have a job lined up. I have truly terrible anxiety, and no living parents or close relatives to get advice from. I’m going to lay it all out for you and I welcome everyone’s thoughts -harsh or otherwise.

Due to not having any close family, I am not tied to any specific state to live. I have done about 10+ interviews so far, ranging from one coast to the other, and have been offered a job at each location. I am down to two (or three?) options at this point. 

One option has very low pay (70k, 3 days a week) and I have to work there until mid 2027. The area is LCOL, and I could do fill in work in the area 2 days a week that would bring in an extra 50k per year.
This option is a fantastic practice, filled with very well trained staff who all get along fantastic. The doctor I would be working under is an expert in her field, and is willing to take me on in a way where half the time we would be seeing patients together, as I learn what she knows. 
I believe I would be able to learn everything on my own, but working under this doctor will fast track that. I was top of my class in both didactics and clinicals, so this would not be hand holding, but more so to learn a specialty service.

Option 2 is 5 days a week, including Saturdays, but pays 180k a year (with benefits, 200k). This office will require me seeing more patients per hour, and the staff is not as well trained as at the other office. Camaraderie isn’t really there, everyone clocks in and clocks out, but gets along fine. Also located in a relatively LCOL area.

My student debt is 380k, cc debt is 15k, and car debt is 20k. I have 25k in savings, so I have a little bit of time deciding what I’m going to do.

Third option is saying no to either option, and continuing the nightmare of doing more interviews, looking for a middle ground of sorts. 

Should I go for the place where I LOVE the people I will be working with, and already know the flow and how everything works -even though that’ll require a drastic decrease in pay.
Or should I be responsible, and go for the money that I know will allow me to pay off my debt faster -even though I know my day to day may be much less enjoyable.

Tldr version:
What’s more important (when you have a mountain of debt looming over you and no support), money or happiness?",Eyeballwizard_,1,1.0,0,1746054370,2025-04-30 23:06:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbu4gh/first_job_after_graduation/,4,2025

1kbsxnm,"two companies, same OTE, one remote one hybrid","I was laid off in the middle of February and, after a few months of applying and interviewing with around 10 companies, I finally landed two offers. I actually started the Company 1 2 days ago but I just got an offer from Company 2, who I’ve been interviewing with since the end of February. I’m stuck trying to figure out what’s best long term.

Here’s the breakdown:

Company 1:

* well known company - (not industry standard but top 3 amongst competitors)
* OTE: $160k (uncapped)
* Base Salary: $110,000
* $2,500 sign on bonus
* Ramp: $1,000/month commission for the first 3 months
* Schedule: Hybrid — 2-3 days in the field, 1 day in the office
* Sales Motion: Prospecting heavy (mostly outbound and in the field)
* would use my own car for transportation ($400 monthly for travel)
* $50 towards internet bill

Company 2:

* start up company
* OTE: $160k (uncapped)
* Base Salary: $80,000
* Ramp: 75% of commission guaranteed for 3 months
* Schedule: 100% remote
* Sales Motion: All inbound leads
* would buy me a new iphone to use for demos

1kbsphp,Advice for a CAD job,"In two weeks, I'm starting a completely different job than the one I've had up until now, since i left college three years ago. 

The job is primarily 3d design with Siemens NX, especially for making molds and some piece machining, all geared toward working with resins and fiberglass. 

I'm somewhat insecure about having left a job where I felt i had everything under control for one where I won't be able to apply anything I've learned so far. For engineers who've had jobs like that, what advice would you give if they had to start over, or what key things should I know? 

I'd also appreciate any courses you know are reliable about the CAD program, since my experience ends with the use of SolidWorks in college - I know is easy to find plenty of them on the internet but these types of courses usually do not have much depth or are extremely expensive for what they offer.

1kbsd4a,Why would a manager switch between ignoring you and then being overly pushy about personal information?,"My manager will avoid me for weeks and then they will insist on me sharing very personal information during meetings.

Also- usually our meetings only happen when my manager's boss pushes for it- like once when there was a pretty big miscommunication which caused the manager's boss to realise that we weren't properly communicating. Or when a coworker shared concerns with the manager's boss.

And I know my manager doesn't have bad intentions. Genuinely they mean well and they are doing their best. But it is really confusing how they can go from ignoring me to insisting on me making myself vulnerable in a pretty pushy way. And afterwards we are back to ignoring each other. I like my manager- but I don't want to be around someone that is avoiding me.

1kbrf1x,Working full time feels like the death of learning,"I (22F) have been in a full time job (data analyst) for almost 6 months. Before I did a masters in maths and then when straight into this job. I do like the job, mainly because it has a great work life balance, but I don’t LOVE it. 

Pros:
- work life balance
- I get to use some maths
- pay is fine
- stable job with room to grow
- technically it helps people

Cons
- 1h20 commute
- I don’t feel like I’m “learning” which I really enjoy doing 
- don’t see the effects of my “helping people”
- not using nearly as much maths as I want

I had an idea of working part time at my job and then doing a part-time degree in something completely different, like art history. I’d do badly in it but given that I’ll probably never pay of my student loans anyway, it feels almost free to get a degree. And not learning anything at my job has given me this empty feeling that there’s so much knowledge I don’t have, but have the ability to consume and I’m wasting my life by not consuming it. 

I think this would make me proud looking back at my life when I’m 70: contribute to something greater than the self which I think can be achieved either by
(A) doing something to help people 
(B) absorbing as much knowledge as possible

1kbq7bk,How to get past freeze response at work?,"
How do people with anxiety deal with their freeze response while at work? 

I like my career in theory, but I have pretty bad anxiety that is specific to being at work (I don’t currently experience an atypical level of anxiety in other areas of my life.) I’m very sensitive to my boss’ tone/mood, since it’s usually an indicator of how the rest of the day or week will go. If I get an email where she is being snappy, or if I can tell she’s in a bad mood and probably going to get annoyed at me over every minor thing, I go into freeze mode and it becomes extremely hard to work. It feels like my brain starts moving at a much slower pace and my nervous system is screaming too loudly for me to even be able to read properly. Of course, freezing up doesn’t exactly help me stay in her good graces on those days, and I need to figure out how to power through my freeze response so I can still get my work done in time. So far, I have just been trying to use the days she’s not here to cram in as much work as possible (even putting in unpaid hours 👎 ) in case she’s in a bad mood when I next see her and I can’t work efficiently. I don’t have any communication issues with my coworker (we are actually highly compatible and encouraging of each other) so when it’s just the two of us my work is faster and higher quality, which helps me stay afloat. But ultimately, doing things this way is is not sustainable and I’m super burned out just 2 years into the job.

How do you manage your freeze response enough to continue working if this is something you deal with? ",timorousworms,2,1.0,2,1746044111,2025-04-30 20:15:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbq7bk/how_to_get_past_freeze_response_at_work/,4,2025
1kbpujh,Next question: would you help the hub who's replacing you because they're already falling behind?,"My manager is having a moral dilemma, I am not. He is wanting to help them and I said absolutely not.


(background he is the art director I'm a senior designer. Marketing is getting flamed and most jobs are off to a hub in India) 


In my last post, I ended up using chatgpt to fill out the spreadsheet so thanks to those who suggested it. It took ten minutes.


We are currently working with a major clothing line for a collab. The clothing brand requested 9 animated graphics all with html embedded into it so when a customer clicks on the graphic it goes to the collab site. It's not animation intense per say, just needs to be done in Adobe Animate for the html. 


This was requested back on 3/30. I originally was assigned it but it was then decided it would go to the hub to start the process of getting to know their work style.


For me, 9 animated graphics with html embedded would take roughly 2ish weeks between me animating them to my manager approving. 


Today it is 4/30. They are due 5/2.


They hub doesn't even have one done. They have ONE storyboard for it. They keep saying they don't understand or need more time. We ask them daily for updates and we get no reply. Or when we do they say they are working on it now and will see a proof soon but we never do. 


My manager wanted me to do it for them. I told him no. I said the company needs to realize this is the future with no local marketing department. Also we are suppose to be off boarding our projects now anyway. He still is like half and half wanting me to do them but sort of gets where I am coming from? 


I feel like I shouldn't do them. They hub is taking over so they can work with them. I'm not suppose to be getting projects now anyway since the transition and training has begun. 


I will say though, if these ads don't launch on time we are not in compliance with our contract and they have the right to fine/sue us.

1kbpbo9,Started a new job but might quit b/c I don’t want to relocate,"I was laid off in March about the same time I received a new job offer for a role that is at a large well known company but I’d have to relocate. 

Looking at the job market I was terrified I wouldn’t be able to find another job and being laid off the same week I got the offer I decided I should take it. The offer is relatively equal to where I was and included a sign on bonus and relocation is covered. 

I’ve just started this new job remotely while I have to work on getting things prepared to relocate - including selling my home. While learning this new role I am filled with dread about the move. I haven’t been excited about this role at all because I just can’t get excited about selling my home and leaving my friends and family. Everyone keeps telling me that I’ll love it once I’m there and settled. That I could do it for a year or two and move back and get a different job. And sometimes I think, okay maybe I could do that. But by the end of the work day I’m back to - I just don’t want to do this. 

Am I crazy? Should I just suck it up and try this? 

I also might just be having a midlife crisis because I keep thinking I just don’t want to be in these big corporate roles anymore. I’m so burnt out from my last job and I feel like I don’t even know what I like in life anymore.

1kbodqz,Fired after 25 days- keep on LinkedIn & Resume? How do I Talk About it in Interviews?,"
I was fired after 25 days. Should I list this job on my resume and LinkedIn, or leave it off completely? How do I approach interviews?

I recently left a stable job in D.C. for a new position and was terminated 25 days after being hired, after only working 19 days in the actual role. 

They cited performance as the reason, but I’m confident that wasn’t the case based on my proven track record, the very short amount of time I was there, and the fact that the company was clearly disorganized and not prepared to support a new hire.

What I need your help with:
I’m struggling to figure out the best strategy for applying to jobs now. Should I mention this short-term role at all? And if I do, how do I handle the fact that I was terminated? I don’t know if it’s better to acknowledge the job and risk questions about the termination, or leave it off and explain the gap another way. I’ve laid out my thinking below. 

Please let me know any advice or experiences you have about how I should approach this. It would be a HUGE help.

Option 1: Include the job on my resume and LinkedIn

Pros:
1. It would present a clear timeline
2. It reflects a title and salary increase that could help with future negotiations. It shows that I advanced from associate to senior level.

Cons:
1. This is a lie- I was terminated, not laid off
2. If a future employer follows up with my previous company, they may confirm the dates I worked there but potentially also mention that I was terminated, which would conflict with anything I say about being laid off

A: List the job and note that I was terminated
- I’m concerned this would immediately hurt my chances of being considered for a future job

B: List the job and say I was laid off
-This could play well because of the number of layoffs happening right now in D.C. and the current job market
But there’s a chance that if a recruiter follows up, they could find out I was actually terminated, which could reflect poorly on my character and disqualify me from the role
- Do you think this is likely, or that saying I was laid off would raise many follow-up questions?

Option 2: Leave the job off entirely
- If I go this route, I need to explain the gap starting in March 2025. These are the possible explanations I’m considering:

A. Say I took time off to explore a career shift
- This might make more sense if my next role looks different from my past experience, but I’m not sure if it’s strong enough to justify the gap

B. Say I took time to travel and think through next steps
- Not sure if this adds value to the point above. 
- I’m hesitant to go with this because I think it might land well at a mission-driven workplace but could raise questions about commitment and reliability at a more traditional one. I’m applying to both so I could adjust the approach depending on what makes sense. Thoughts?
- I might have a hard time pulling it off because it align with my personality (low risk tolerance), and the roles I’m targeting focus on strategy and planning. - Also, does job-quitting level travel mean going out of the country? 

C. Say I took time to help a sick family member (adding that I was looking for a career change or position that better suits my long-term goals). 
- This is partially true… I’ve helped care for a relative with Alzheimer’s but no where near to this degree. However, this option fits my personality and may come off more genuine than saying I was traveling. I could also say that before quitting, I was passively exploring new roles to show I was already considering a change, but my relative’s health unexpectedly declined and they needed more care, which is why I didn’t secure a new position before leaving.

Conclusion: 
I’d really appreciate hearing how you would interpret each option and your advice for the stages of the interview process below. 

APPLICATION REVIEW 
(I need to decide this before I can keep applying for jobs)

1. What should I include on my resume and LinkedIn?

2. What would you think if you saw a short role listed versus seeing a gap with no explanation?

3. What kinds of questions would you have based on what’s included or left off?

4. Which version would be more likely to get a call back?

INTERVIEW PROCESS: 
1. Which version would feel easier for me to talk through without raising concerns?

2. If this gap came up in an interview, what would you want to know first?

3. If I leave off the position that I was fired from and say I took time to care for a sick relative, what would you ask next? Would that seem believable? 

4. If I say I was laid off, would you take that at face value or ask for more details? Would you expect me to explain what kind of layoffs happened and why I was part of them?

5. If I say I took time to travel or figure out my next step, what details would you want to know? (I have traveled no where so good to memorize). Would you expect a big change in direction? 

6. How much detail is too much when explaining travel/relative/lay off like this?

Thanks so much for reading. Any help is sincerely appreciated.

I know that anything other than saying I was terminated isn’t honest and I am very uncomfortable with that. But I need to do something, this whole thing has left me financially and emotionally drained. I left a stable job, was let go without severance or unemployment eligibility, and now I’m paying out of pocket for health care and at risk of losing housing. I am trying my best to move forward, but I’m completely stuck on how to proceed. Thanks again. Seriously any thoughts here will be extremely helpful.

1kbo755,Stay for the raise or switch jobs for growth?,"Hi, I need some advice. Should I stay at my current company, which is offering me a raise, or switch to a job that potentially offers more growth but pays less?

A brief summary of my story:
	•	I’ve been working remotely as a developer for 3 years.
	•	I started at 120 k, then went up to 155 k, and now I’m at 180 k.
	•	The company is small (about 60 people), and besides me there is only one other developer with a similar specialty.
	•	Every raise I’ve received came right after I mentioned I wanted to leave.
	•	The problem is I feel unimportant and undervalued: I don’t know what’s going on in the company, the work culture is poor, and communication between remote and in-office employees is almost non-existent.
	•	Often I have nothing to do because nobody checks in on me. I’ve gotten lazy—I make good money and don’t have to do much.
	•	Each time I wanted to quit for these reasons, but I was convinced to stay with money. I’m afraid I’m not growing, and if I lose my job, I’ll be in trouble.

Recently I got a new offer: 140 k to start, but a much more demanding role. I don’t know many of their technologies, so there’s a good chance for growth. At the same time, there’s a risk they won’t extend my contract after probation.

I accepted and put in my resignation today. My boss then offered me 215 k to stay.

I’m totally torn—should I stay and stagnate, or take a pay cut and try something new?

1kblmao,What could I say in the email to the recruiters?,"I went to college outside of Illinois for undergrad and I returned to my parent’s house in Chicago, after finishing. It’s been a few years since I graduated from college and I have been jobless ever since. I received a quantitative degree and I had wanted to go into tech (specifically data analytics). However, I have been unsuccessful; the tech industry is currently having massive layoffs and many, many people also want to go into tech. As a result, I am shifting towards other fields such as the warehouse and restaurant industry.

I attended a job fair last week. There weren’t a lot of companies present but there was one supply chain/warehouse company and I spoke to a recruiter representing the company. I still visited the other non-warehouse/restaurant companies/organizations, briefly discussed my interest in data analytics, and exchanged contact info with the recruiters because I would still like to pursue data analytics again in the future. 

Even though my main priority is getting a job in the warehouse/restaurant industry, I would still like to send an email thanking the recruiters (of non-warehouse/restaurant companies/organizations) for speaking with me at the job fair and express that I am interested in working with them in the future.  In addition, I would like to ask a few other questions such as what tools the companies use in their data analytics department.

1kblipr,Help me to choose between offer and current role,"I’m looking for guidance on what to do in my situation.

I have been an engineer all of my career, but last ~5 years I’ve been starting to think that being a team leader - manager - would interest me.

Last three years I’ve been in a more leading engineer role. I joined my current company because they offered me much better pay and more responsibilities than previous company I worked for. The industries and company sizes are different. However, I’ve been quite frustrated with the ways of working and lack of motivation of develop the processes of my current company.

A managers position from my previous company, where I worked several years, came available. I applied, got interviewed, and finally got the offer. Here starts the hesitating: the offered salary is the same as in my current job even though the new job is a manager of a team of 10 engineers. Also, the industry/company is very sensitive for world economics and big (negative) occurences in the world. This might be seen in furloughs, not paying bonuses, or similar.  

I don’t know what to do. I don’t like how’s it going in my current job, but the same salary they’re offering for the new role is making me hesitant. The salary is decent, I’m living a good life, so it’s not that I would need to abandon anything from my life. At the same time I really would like to step up to be manager and get that experience.

I’m thinking of accepting the offer and looking how it goes, but I wouldn’t want to have the mindset of changing job again after two years.

1kblg07,Career change/growth,"I wouldn’t quite call it a career change—it's more of an employment change. I graduated college in 2020 with a degree in Media and Communication. It took me about two years post-graduation to land a job in my field. During that time, I worked in the service industry and only had a few internships on my resume. The job hunt after college was incredibly tough, especially with everything being remote due to COVID.

Eventually, I got an opportunity in my field, and within a year, I was promoted to a director-level role. I’ve been with the same organization for nearly three years now—just over two as a director. While I’m proud of the progress I’ve made, I’m starting to feel stuck. There isn’t much room for growth here, and while the pay and benefits are okay, they’re just not enough to support me long-term, especially living in the D.C. area.

I currently make around $73,000 annually with benefits, but between rent, student loans, and general living expenses, saving money has been difficult. My car is also on its last leg, and to be honest, my salary just isn’t cutting it now that I’m fully on my own. Unfortunately, this isn’t a great time to ask for a raise, as my organization is facing budget cuts—and even if one were approved, it likely wouldn’t be significant.

I’m considering making a move, but I’m nervous. With less than five years of experience and only one company on my resume, I worry I’ll only be seen as an entry-level candidate and will be only offered less than what I make now. I’m also anxious about going through the same wave of rejections I faced after graduation.

I don’t expect a transition to be easy—I just want some honest input. Does it seem realistic to look for a new role now? Should I just stay put for a couple more years and be grateful for what I have? What’s the best way to position myself for a new role and to enhance my resume?

1kbl80s,Should I move on to better opportunities,"I recently started working for an HVAC company that designs and builds control panels, primarily serving the oil and gas industry. My background is in electrical drafting—specifically in substation work—with about seven years of experience, and I’m currently about a year away from completing my degree in Electrical Engineering. I took this position under the impression, based on what was discussed during the interview, that I would be mentored and supported in growing toward a designer or engineering role.

Since starting, however, a few concerns have come up. On my first day, I was told to come in at 8 a.m., so I assumed that was the standard schedule. After arriving at 7:45 the following day, I was pulled aside by the engineering manager, who said the regular hours were actually 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. with an hour lunch. He mentioned this was explained in the interview, but if it was, I genuinely don’t remember—especially considering there was about a month-long delay between my offer and start date due to staffing agency issues and the time it took to clear drug screening (which I eventually completed directly through the employer due to delays).

Later, I learned that Saturday shifts are also required, from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m.—again, something I wasn’t told until after I had already committed. I showed up at 6 a.m. my first Saturday, unknowingly set off the alarm, and found out the hard way that my code only opens doors, not the alarm system. This wasn’t covered during orientation, and the company ended up receiving a fine for the false alarm.

Work-wise, I’ve mostly been doing drafting and basic tasks, which I expected early on. I figured once I became familiar with their systems and structure, I’d be given more design opportunities as discussed. But I’ve noticed a pattern: when I ask for clarification on tasks—like verifying something for a client—the engineering manager often doesn’t want to take the time to explain it, even if it appears simple. Instead, he just takes it from me, handles it himself, and hands me more basic, repetitive work. This has made it difficult to grow in the way I was told I’d be able to.

All of this has left me feeling stuck. I know there’s a natural gap between being a drafter and becoming a designer, and another gap between designer and engineer. My goal is to bridge at least part of that before I graduate. My dad suggested that I start printing out drawings and studying the loops and equipment flows, which I think is a good way to learn independently.

Still, I can’t shake the feeling that I may have just been brought in to help during a busy period—and that once things calm down, I could be let go. That’s not the end of the world; I’m confident in my abilities and know there are great companies out there. It just feels harder these days to find one that’s truly committed to mentoring and development, especially when that commitment is part of the hiring conversation but not backed up in practice.",FeeBrilliant5684,0,0.5,1,1746031655,2025-04-30 16:47:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbl80s/should_i_move_on_to_better_opportunities/,4,2025
1kbl7g1,Can I Get an Honest Evaluation of My Career Path and What Opportunities I Can Realistically Aim For?,"Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate some honest feedback and career insight from people with more experience in the digital marketing, SEO, and content management world. I'm feeling overwhelmed, a bit burned out, and unsure what the next step in my career should be.



Here’s a quick breakdown of my experience:



Hospitality Management: I spent 4 years working as a restaurant manager, which gave me a solid foundation in leadership, team coordination, and dealing with pressure and chaos.



**Transition to Digital Marketing / SEO:**



Got hired at an SEO firm as a Content Publisher (editing and publishing blog posts).



Within 3 months, promoted to Content Writer.



After 6 months, promoted to Team Lead of 14 people (writers + editors), working across affiliate and SEO content in multiple niches.



I created AI writing prompts used company-wide, solved a wide range of team and content-related issues, and learned deeply about AI content (generation, detection, and optimization).



Eventually managed a team of 20 people (10 writers, 10 editors), set up content strategies and topic plans for multiple sites.



Conducted 50+ job interviews and personally trained each new team member that joined my team.



**Project-Based SEO Work:**



Led a single-site project with 11 team members and achieved strong growth in just 6 months due to strategy I personally designed.



Gained experience in WordPress site design and completed a 3-month technical SEO training with an official WordPress developer.



When a Google update deindexed many of our sites, I created emergency strategies and led a team of 26 people to redesign and repopulate 3 sites per day (design, content, interactivity).



We successfully recovered traffic on several of them, primarily due to my leadership and decision-making.



**Current Role:**



Promoted to Project Manager, while still managing the core office team of 13 people.



At one point, handled 5 client SEO projects; now leading 22 active projects, each with 2–3 people assigned.



Took a group of 13 and scaled our portfolio of 125 websites from 7,000 to 250,000 monthly visits over 5 months.



Gained experience with multiple CMS platforms (WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, PrestaShop), and tools like Plaky, Trello, and Slack.



Despite everything I've learned and accomplished, I’m exhausted and overloaded. I'm grateful for the opportunities, but I’ve hit a wall in terms of mental bandwidth and need a change.



**What I’m Looking For:**



Honest feedback - how valuable is my experience in the current job market?



What roles or salary range could I realistically aim for if I wanted to leave my current job?



Should I position myself as an SEO Specialist, Content Strategist, Project Manager, Operations Lead, or something else?



What kind of company size (startup vs agency vs corporate) might be a better fit for me?



Is remote work realistic for someone with my background?



Any red flags or areas where I should improve?



Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and offer guidance.

I'm mostly asking about transferable skills from the challenges faced while working in these companies.
To me it sounds like many of the challenges are related to distributed systems, requiring low latency.. (I'm talking about software engineering positions, no involvement in writing smart contracts)


Would the experience gained there be relevant, and would this be accepted or even well seen on a resume in case one would like to go back to regular big tech companies ?

1kbl2el,Should I stay on the partner track at my firm or take the leap and go solo?,"I’m a 33 year old tax attorney at a small-to-mid-sized public accounting firm in New York. I don’t hate my job—but I’m not passionate about it either. The bulk of my work feels routine, uninspiring, and mentally draining. I'd estimate that only about 25% of my billable hours are spent on projects I genuinely enjoy. The rest just feels like a grind.

Recently, I had my mid-year review and was promoted to manager. The managing partner even mentioned that they see me as being on the partner track—although realistically, that’s still 5–7 years away. It felt great to be recognized, but it also complicated things for me.

I’ve quietly been planning my exit. My original goal was to leave in a year or two and launch my own solo law practice, focusing exclusively on the work I’m passionate about. I’d love the freedom to choose my clients and the kind of work I take on, even if it means starting from scratch.

Now I’m torn. My new salary is excellent and will continue to increase. If I stick it out and eventually make partner, there’s serious seven-figure potential—life-changing money that would let my wife leave her job (which she’s not thrilled with either) and explore her own passions. We could maintain our lifestyle and have more freedom as a family.

But on the other hand, leaving would mean walking away from that financial security and starting from $0. There’s no guarantee I’ll ever reach the same income level running my own practice. Still, the idea of making my own decisions, working only on the cases I find meaningful, and building something of my own is really appealing.

Even if I make partner, I’d likely be a minority partner with limited influence over the firm's direction. I’d still have to work on projects I don’t enjoy just because they’re central to the firm’s business model.

I’m really struggling with this choice—stability vs. autonomy.

1kbkmo9,How do you deal with a boss who has ADHD?,"My boss has ADHD. I realized this after joining the company. He is not a bad person, in fact, he has been appreciative of my work. However, he can be unreasonable and difficult to deal with.

Our company is in a restructure/transitional phase, which I wasn’t aware of when I joined. He operated his business from overseas and just recently moved back to focus on expanding locally. Along with a few others, I was hired to head a department. I have only one word to describe the company - disorganized. Although my boss and another returning colleague have years of experience, they are unfamiliar with local laws and business practices.

After a few months of working with him, I’ve found that he is OVER passionate and OVER confident, lacks risk awareness and seems somewhat living in his own world. For example, he would instruct me to submit 'A' to the client. I explained that 'A' would not be acceptable contractually and it could backfire on us. I could go five minutes explaining to him and eventually he would always go something like ""Okay how about this, lets submit A. Lets do it."". It is as if he totally listens to what you're saying but his brain ran thousand miles of track when you are talking.

It confused me so much and exhausted me. Everything I've advised him turned out I was being right. Then he didn't understand why it is so and I had to explain to him again.

Do you have any suggestions for how to deal with a boss like this?",chromich_rache,1,1.0,6,1746030183,2025-04-30 16:23:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbkmo9/how_do_you_deal_with_a_boss_who_has_adhd/,4,2025
1kbkk2z,Transfer within company,"I made a move last year across the US within my company.  It was a promotion however I miss Texas and the North East isn't for me, nor are the people I work with, this area is so damn stressful and my amount of work I have and commute is just making me miserable.  I am in oil and gas and there isn't the security I had in Texas, however there is the same position I currently have that is available back in Texas that I am almost certain to get with my past relationship.  

Problem, I signed a two year deal to stay hear although I can have a VP sign off on my move and send me back.  If I put in for the position in TX I will have to notify my current director and that may cause some hostility.  

If I wait another year it won't kill me but my kids are getting older and I hate to pull them away from friendships, any other ways to look at this situation and navigate it?

1kbke6b,Should I tell my recruiters that I'll be starting school in the fall?,"So basically I work in Admin/HR in healthcare and was part of a staff layoff end of last year. Fast-forward, after one job fell through, I finally landed a contract job in March at a non-profit for 3 months. Well, due to cut backs, they have just reduced me to 2 months, ending May 30, and I'm going to start looking again.

The thing is, I recently got accepted into a full-time rad tech program and start in the fall, where I won't be able to work full-time while I attend. Super excited, but I'm guessing it's going to be pretty hard to find a position where the timing lines up, even for a contracted position. So I'm wondering if I should just keep that bit of info to myself while searching and just give them the required notice when I depart, or if it's better to be up-front?

I'm still not sure if I bruised his ego, hit a nerve from his past, or accidentally disrespected him. But being older doesn't give him the right to act like a child.

First Incident (Group Chat):  
Me: ""It's 8:30—why aren't the actors on set? We can't delay the shoot; the DOP needs to leave by 6 PM.""  
Him: ""What am I supposed to do? Drag them here by their heads?""

Was my question unreasonable? I responded:  
""You shouldn't say things like that. It's not okay.""

He snapped back:  
""If you've got money to pay them, then we'll talk about what's 'right and wrong.'""  
(Technically true—it's an internal project—but still a dick move.)

On Set, Before the Meltdown:  
He randomly confronted me about my shirt:  
Him: ""Why are you wearing that?""  
Me (confused): ""Uh… brand and quality""  
His tone wasn't curious—it was confronted like he had problem with the brand owner.

The Script Explosion:  
Me: ""Did you read the script?""  
Him: ""No time. Just explain it on set.""  
Me (frustrated): ""Then what was the point of me writing the script?""  
Him (lying): ""I sent it to the head department.""  
(Bullshit. They wouldn't have time either. And how the hell do you not check the script for character breakdowns? Did he expect me to spoon-feed him lines on set?)

Then—boom—he lost it:  
""I TOLD YOU WE DON'T READ! ARE WE SHOOTING OR NOT?""

Aftermath:

* Silence. Everyone froze.
* I held back from confronting him right then—no point fueling his tantrum else we will have a bigger problem with big boss, i deal with him after finish the shoot.

Post-Shoot Confrontation:

1. About the Shirt: His excuse: ""I thought you were promoting it."" Reality: His original tone was pure hostility.
2. About the Yelling: Me: ""That outburst was unprofessional."" (Others agreed.) I stayed calm but was ready to quit.

His Pathetic Defense:  
""You disrespected me. You called me out in front of everyone!""

Wait—he was mad about this\*\*?\*\*  
""What's the point of me writing the script if you didn't read it?""  
That set him off? He called me ""disrespectful and stupid,"" so I shot back:  
""You speak exactly like crazy.""  
(Did it hurt him? Not sure...)

The Fake Apology:  
I apologized if I crossed a line. He refused to—until I pressed him. Then, this half-assed admission:  
""And? I'm sorry, and?""

I offered a handshake. He took it. That was the end.",MisteryShiba,2,1.0,2,1746028686,2025-04-30 15:58:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kbk0tx/not_sure_if_i_handle_it_well_if_you_were_in_my/,4,2025

I’m asking for my mom. 

She recently accepted a job offer that a recruiter helped her secure. She has worked with this recruiter before and doesn’t want to jeopardize her relationship with the recruiter. 

She then received a better offer from another company (hybrid work schedule and slightly higher pay).  She had interviewed with that company prior to accepting the other offer and they took some time to get back to her with an offer. 

Looking for advice. We both believe the second offer is better for her overall but she is worried about burning bridges with the recruiter.

1kbjkra,No Long-Term Goals,"Last May I graduated with a BA in computer science, since then I spent 4 months looking for a software engineering job before stumbling into an IT job. My current job is fine, it's pretty slow but it's really low-stress. I know I don't want to stay here long term but I don't really know how to move forward.

Since high school my career plan was to become a software engineer, but after looking for a job and seeing what's going on with the job market that feels almost unattainable. I think I'm a qualified applicant but it's hard to get a foot in the door that I don't know what I can do to make myself stand out.

So now I feel a bit lost, do I pivot to focusing on IT and give up on the thing I planned for? Do I pivot to something else entirely?

My main concern with pivoting to IT is that I really enjoy programming and I don't want to set that aside. But right now I'm gaining tangible IT experience so I have a clearer path laid out for me. 

The tech job market feels so volatile that I don't want to put my eggs in any basket but at the same time, it's hard to not have something I'm working towards.

1kbjb7v,What to do about this situation with a pause?,"The gist is this: I got a masters and was working on my PhD in math, but my parent got a very serious cancer diagnosis so I had to move back to take care of them and be there for them. The parent has exceeded the odds, but it is starting to look not so hopeful anymore. I've been working some contract gigs and tutoring while going through all this, but my career has stagnated these past two years. I don't have anyone else to help with the parent, and while I could've been working for real, at no point did I know for a fact that things would've been smooth enough to maintain a full-time job. I'm already a few years into my 30s, so I don't think I have it in me to go back to school after this all is done. With all the stress and everything, I think I want to make good bucks working something I'm happy with and enjoy life. You know, live the quintessential American sitcom life.

My worry is that my clock might be too far back. If I go into some industry, I fear I'll be no better than any kid almost 10 years younger than me and I'll have to do several years of work to get to a good salary.

However I notice when similar occasions come and my colleagues are talking, they try to take the credit to themselves. Rarely undue credit, but not mentioning others.

I understand that as individuals they do need that recognition for eventual salary negotiation etc. but I can't imagine doing the same.

The result is that management kind of knows who did what but I have no recognizable achievement.

I don't mind that, but I feel that my strategy is not appropriate in this workplace, and frankly I'm doubting that my approach is realistic.

I found myself less eager to work with those individuals but it is hard to find people who actually like to be one in a collective and take shared ownership of a project.

I also enjoyed seeing other members of my team praised. I have brought up a coworker’s idea that was overlooked in meeting comments in the past and gave him credit. 

We got a new director recently and though my immediate supervisor has never changed, things feel very different. My supervisor has started presenting issues that I found to others like she found them or ideas I have like they are hers. When she describes them in meetings it seems clear that she doesn’t fully understand what she is talking about.

We have also had large departmental meetings where multiple teams and higher up positions like VP were present. These meetings opened up the floor to everyone regardless of position for strategic ideas/improving functionality, etc. I spoke up and two supervisors disagreed with me. Which is fine this is healthy. The VP then spoke up agreeing with me and stated examples of things in the past we had to similarly pivoted towards. Of the examples she used to defend the idea, 2 of the 3 were things I had brought to the table in the past. 

I enjoyed my position in the past, but I feel like quitting. I want to go to another department or to another company. I am underemployed for my education level.

When I first started, the senior of my team was very helpful as I got acclimated to my new accounts. now that I've been doing this job for more than a year, I don't need as much help as I did in the beginning. She is still overly helpful which is kind of annoying but she is my senior so I just accept that is part of her job.

She is always popping up in my slack messages to check on how my calls went and making suggestions for how I can do my reporting better. It really bothers me because most of the advice she gives me is not helpful or applicable to my clients. I've also noticed that if a question about one of my clients comes up in a group slack channel, she has started to answer on my behalf. The questions that come up are not urgent and I can't answer as fast as she can because her time zone is about 6 hours ahead of mine but I would answer them if she would just give me a chance. 

This team member and my senior both have a really annoying habit of over explaining things or trying to contribute to trainings that they aren't leading/don't know anything about. It really bothers me because of how patronizing it is.

The person managing money and hiring gave me a verbal job offer last week, and asked me to get back to them with salary expectations: One number that for slicing the pie equity/when funding comes in and another salary that i’m willing to take in the interim. I got a little mixed up in the convo, and so I sent him a DM afterwards asking if the (high) salary band for the equity decision should be where I also take my current comp ask from.

I haven’t gotten answers back for about a week, and have followed up a few times. This has become a pattern. In or first meeting ever, they said they’d have a decision back to me in a week. It took three months, with many DM’d follow ups going unanswered! They have apologized before, saying it’s the normal crazyness of starting a company that’s been delaying them.

However, when I began clearly contributing to the project (unpaid), that is when I heard back after three months. I’m told these contributions will be tallied and added to my equity, but I’m naturally hesitant to overcommit and only have some extra time to do so anyways.

So is there a good way to respectfully have this person respond in a more timely manner or do I need to play the game and contribute more so they feel a further need to secure me before I feel tired of free work?

Almost 6 weeks of PTO, fully remote, 5% 401K match, discounted healthcare, and more non-standard benefits. I consider the benefits to be worth 15-20K of value in total. 

I have a Job offer in hand for 110K. There is no standard bonus structure. Could range anywhere from 3K to 30K. Fully in person at an office 1-1.5hr away in traffic, no 401K, 2 weeks of PTO on an accrual basis each year, fully covered healthcare, and a few non-standard benefits. This would be around 5K in value assuming no bonus. However the growth potential is endless. I'm still early in my career so would learn a lot and the company has great people who said they would mentor and teach me to get to executive level. While everyone is nice, most of them are old people with 30-40 years of experience. 

I have a first round interview with another company that I like tomorrow. I previously interviewed with this company last year and went through all the round but unfortunately did not get it. This company would also pay somewhere aroud 110K but I'd have to relocate. I'm not sure about the benefits but the company is more like my current one so I'm thinking of something similar. They wouldn't be remote but it'll be hybrid. It's the same team that interviewed me last year and they were all nice, the office was great, and everyone was on the younger age range side so would be good for my social life since I'm returning to office.

I have a good relationship with my boss where he knows my goal is to go permanent and move up the ranks and he's morally supportive, however because of the economic recession and public budget cuts, there are no open opportunities to advance in terms of role and pay in the team this coming year.

My current contract is about to renew for another year with a laughable 2% pay bump but I however kept my options open and I applied for other internal positions and am on a verge of getting an offer for a higher title and annual pay bump by 15% allowing me to save a good amount per month, however this position is temporary for 1.5 years.

This sounds like a no brainer however I am receiving mixed reviews on the hiring manager with flaws compared to my existing boss and there is fear that the work may not be as satisfying as my current job.

My boss is aware of my pending offer and is working on a long-term growth plan to reach my goals plus achieving a permanent role however this is all on 'potential' with no timelines in place, again due to funding constraints.

So I'm at a crossroad: maybe if I stay at my current team for another 6+ months I will get all of my career promotional goals satisfied and continue the journey with an all-star team and work I know I enjoy but this is all potential; on the other hand, the new temporary opportunity may not satisfy my expectations for team, work, culture and may be more stressful in that regard but at the end of the day I will have more money and a title that will open more future opportunities.

1kbhngx,Need help as a first year CS/ Econ major think of switching out to med or law,"**Context**

So, I just finished my first year of college. I was a computer science and economics student. I had no idea what I wanted to do, I was good a math and science in highschool so I though I would do either engineering or med school. Thought that diping my toes and trying econ and cs would be nice. I have done really well in my class and build basic hmtl, css, javascript projects: calculator, weather app, and starting react.

**Problem:** 

But, i don't know if this is right for me. I enjoy the spirt of engineering and challenge myself, but with A.I  and I don't want to have the threat of layoff and unstablity over my head. Also perhaps realising that the job would be very tedious or like implementing an api, building a function, debugging alone. This rinse and repeat I dont know if I can do this for 40 years.

Developed a couple of good accounts and filled some local niches that weren't filled, good local posturing as well with some big projects in my state I knew were coming up.

My previous store manager at my current location seems to have hit it big, bought a ranch and offered me a ranch management position in wyoming.

Having never been asked to be a cowboy before, I internally immediately accepted it, externally ive only expressed a lot of interest, I'm not concerned about having or not having the skills for it, ill develop them quickly. 

I'm inclined to believe I'll succeed, or I'll do it for a couple of years and move back absolute worst case. I guess I'm just looking for some additional feedback to help finalize the decision?

The thing is, over the past month, I’ve been preparing for an online medical interpretation position that pays twice as much and requires half the working hours. The exam is in July, but there’s no guarantee I’ll pass—I already failed it once, although I was very unprepared back then. This time, I’m studying seriously and have more time to get ready.

By July, I’ll have a 9-month gap in my resume, which worries me since I’m a recent graduate. The LG job is just 10 minutes from home, so it would help fill that gap and give me financial stability in the meantime.

1kbeshh,"25M, lost 2 years to CAT prep, now feeling stuck and confused—what’s my best next step?","I graduated in 2023 with a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering. I got placed in an IT company, but the onboarding was delayed. I decided to prepare for CAT, and long story short, due to distractions, emotional stuff, and a lack of consistent effort, I ended up wasting two full years. Now I have zero work experience and a growing sense of anxiety.

I'm at absolute zero right now. No job, no MBA admit, and I'm extremely confused about what to do with my career.

I don't want to waste any more time going in the wrong direction. But what is the right direction? I was thinking of getting started in the analytics field. I looked up courses, and they're all so expensive with no placement guarantee. They all demand 10–12 months of commitment. Even the thought of being jobless for one more year is haunting me. And what if I lose interest in between and end up wasting more time and money?

My dad is pressuring me to take admission this year itself in any tier-3 MBA college. Coming from a tier-3 B.Tech background and considering what I've done to myself already, I just don't have the courage to do the same thing again.

I keep thinking about this all day, all night. I keep seeing videos of people preparing for UPSC, SSC, or Bank PO exams, or doing certifications like CFA — and I start to think, ""Okay... I'll prepare for this too,"" and it makes me feel alright for a couple of days. But then again, I know this is just wishful thinking, and it's not something I really want to do.

All this is mentally consuming. My mental health has been in shambles. I keep having bad thoughts, extreme thoughts, and somehow I'm just holding on.

I know there's no perfect plan, but I just want to avoid wasting another year being ""confused and doing nothing."" I’m open to working hard — I just need some direction and real-world perspective.

Has anyone been in a similar place and come out of it successfully?
Any practical suggestions or even tough truths would be appreciated.

A few years ago, I was you—stuck in a soul-crushing job as a web developer, working long hours for an e-commerce agency, feeling like my life was on autopilot. I’d go to the pub with coworkers who looked *dead inside*, and I knew I didn’t want that to be me in 10 years.   
  
I had this nagging feeling: “Is this it? Work, retire, die?”

Then I made a choice. I ditched the 9-5 and turned my skills into an online coaching business with the skills I already had. Now, I work from anywhere (but mostly my home office, while the kids are at school), make 5 figures a month, and help people like you break free from the corporate grind.   
  
My secret? I stopped trading time for money and started solving real problems for people who value my expertise.

If I’m stuck doing this forever, I know I’ll be disappointed in myself.

My husband and I have been trying for a baby for 2 years, and we’re currently doing IVF. That’s part of why I’ve stayed this long - remote work would make life easier once we (hopefully) have a baby, and this job offers stability.

But yesterday a friend reached out with an opportunity: a manager role in underwriting at a smaller insurance company. It’s a step up career-wise, and could open a lot of doors long term. Same pay, but it requires going into the office 4 days a week, with a 35-minute commute. My husband’s not thrilled, since we both work from home now and it would mean less flexibility, especially if we become parents soon.

1kbcguu,Desperate to leave zookeeping,"Any advice on a career change? Open to things adjacent to my current area, or something completely new.

Background is zoo keeping and animal management, maybe around 15 years with animals and 10 in zoos.

The work has included record keeping to a very high level, training colleagues, conservation planning, research planning, working with and arranging meetings with a wide variety of stakeholders, dealing with government legislation and inspectors. 

I have some management experience of paid staff and voluntary staff. I have no bachelors degree. Currently doing a masters in conservation but that doesn't mean I only have to work in conservation. 

I prefer jobs which have a lot going on where organisation is key. I can't cope with being bored all day.

I previously worked in a hotel where I manned reception and dealt with all the hotel ordering and such. I found this boring, even after people kept telling me it was going to be hectic and difficult. In the grand scheme of things if someone doesn't like the breakfast options in a hotel it really doesn't matter.

I desperately do not want to return to zookeeping. I really do not want to work with domestic animals either, I really don't want to deal with pet owners. I would prefer a desk based job. There's conservation positions within zoos but these are very very limited.

I once did one of those one on one careers counseling sessions and the lady said she thinks I would be good at disaster planning - but seems to do that you need to go and do a specific degree, there doesn't seem to be a non degree entry point for it. I don't want to do another course, I want to finish my current masters.

I can work anywhere in the EU and in the UK visa free.

But that's not possible on the weekends (I try to have a social life and spend lots of time with my boyfriend because I don't have time during the week. Our schedules usually don't line up).

- The environment: I used to love where I work. Slowly, the good people around me left. A couple good people are still here but are looking to get out ASAP. The industry I work in has become something I'm not proud of. 

I've also got issues with my boss now, after taking PTO days for interviews, I think he caught on.

I live in a beautiful part of the world where tourism is the main industry, and I genuinely really love promoting the area every chance I get. 
I see the change as a chance to step into tourism, and potentially have a job that I absolutely love. I’m fine with taking a financial hit, as it would mean a significant lifestyle improvement for me and a foot in the door of tourism. But I do want it to be worth it, and make sure that I am exchanging a good salary for a great lifestyle change. 
My question is - is Visitors Services actually a rewarding job, or am I seeing it through rose coloured glasses? In my mind, I see the role as a positive environment, helping tourists plan their day and spruiking local businesses, helping with transport and bookings etc. But is the reality very different? Are Tourist Information Centres just a venting place for lost and frustrated travellers? 
Keen to understand any first hand experiences in this kind of role (paid or volunteer).

1kb83bq,Feeling like a fish out of water in a new career — should I just cut my losses?,"Feeling overwhelmed and out of my depth in a new job — need to vent and maybe some advice

I’m currently in a job that I feel completely unequipped to do.

I was hired as a project coordinator for a massive residential construction project — one that involves a two-year timeline and hundreds of homes. The role requires significant travel and a heavy load of administrative work. I come from a background in hospitality and took this job hoping for a career change.

I don’t have formal education in project management, and I’ve been thrown into managing what my direct manager has described as “the biggest project the company has ever taken on.”. Not sure how the guy with the least experience in construction management is supposed to take the lead on this? 

To make things worse, the success of this project depends heavily on securing federal rebate funding, so there’s a lot riding on it. I’m feeling completely overwhelmed. My manager is scatterbrained and unapproachable, and despite everything on my plate, he expects me to take courses on top of traveling and handling all the admin.

I never received any real onboarding or training. I’ve made a few silly mistakes, which I own, but I’m now constantly anxious. The project is in motion, and I’m deeply questioning whether I should stay. The truth is — I don’t like the work, I don’t enjoy the lifestyle, and there are many technical aspects I simply don’t know how to handle.

Part of me wants to leave and go back to my old industry. I know it wasn’t perfect, but at least I didn’t feel like I was drowning every day.

1kb7usq,Former IT Professional turned Warehouse Operative - Can you help getting myself out of this mess?,"Many moons ago, I left University with a degree in Computer Networking and soon found myself in a promising career as a Software Tester for two large global companies. 

Unfortunately, on the second of those two jobs, I found myself stuck with a Manager who was god awful. She had been working with the company for 20+ years and found herself in the position with no real Managerial experience. She made my life hell and during the global pandemic, I handed in my notice as I was exhausted, stressed out, and even slightly depressed.

With the IT Sector here in the UK being in turmoil at that particular time and with a Mortgage to pay for, I got the first job that came up. That was working as a Warehouse Operative for a small family business. As much as it kills me to say it, I got far too comfortable and time flew by. I've now been working there for the past five years. It's been stress free this entire time but it's a dead end job. It's hard work and I've been unmotivated to make any changes. That was until recently.

After a major wake-up call this year and realising I want more for my life than this, I need to pull my finger out and get back into the IT sector. The issue is that I've been out of that line of work for so long now that I feel stuck and unsure what to do or say. 

Can I still get myself back into the IT sector? Will employers discredit my applications after seeing such a gap in my CV? Is there anyway round it? If so, what should I say? Should I even mention the warehouse work in my CV? If not, what would you say or do?

I haven't kept up with the technology so I'm unsure whether I should start doing courses while applying for jobs. I'm not on LinkedIn. I'm totally out of the loop.

If anyone could offer up some advice, it would be greatly appreciated as I know I need to get moving. I'm nearing 40 so I'm not getting any younger.

I work in a 900 bed hospitla and I have to do portables, inpatients (spines + pts over 350lbs), OR, and PEDS. My management has told us that with productivity, we are over budget but it feels like we are still overworked almost nightly especially with the employees we have that don’t want to do anything and yet, management won’t fix it after being told multiple times. I’ve had other coworkers say they’ve gone above our manager and whoever it was still didn’t do anything. Obviously every night it is different but normally i range from 15-35 x rays by myself throughout my whole 12 hour shift and that doesn’t include me either going to the OR or doing PEDS. I know this doesn’t sound like much but it still doesn’t change my mind when saying we’re overbudget because of how hard they are on people about getting OT. My normal shifts i work with 2 other techs and if one gets called to the OR 2 of us will take care of the portables and if PEDS calls it’s only me by myself taking care of the portables alone of the whole hospital. This doesn’t happen too often but we also have a older tech that doesn’t pull their own weight so it’s suffering pulling the weight of another. I have been on the lookout for new jobs as well just hard to give up the hourly rate i’ve gotten up to working here for the past 2 years.

1kb6d7q,What to do for my final internship?,"Hey everyone,

I’m heading into my final co-op term as an Accounting & Financial Management student. I’ve completed 3 finance-related co-ops — all solid on paper — but I’ve realized I haven’t found corporate work very fulfilling. I’m a hard worker, but I’ve always been more motivated by the idea of building something for myself and getting out what I put in — which isn’t always the case in corporate roles. To add I've always had a very high GPA both in high school and all of undergrad (3.8+).

I’ve also always had a big interest in cars growing up. I genuinely enjoy the process of interacting with customers, being on my feet, and staying active — rather than sitting behind a desk all day punching numbers into a spreadsheet. That contrast has become more and more clear after experiencing the corporate world.

Right now, I’m deciding between two very different options for my co-op term:

**Option 1: Remote FP&A Internship (Tech Startup – Workato)**  
I’ve been offered a Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) internship with Workato, a tech startup based in Palo Alto. It pays $22 USD/hour (\~$30 CAD). I was originally excited about the chance to live in California for the summer, but the role is now fully remote. I could still take a few business trips (at my own expense), and professionally, it’s a strong opportunity. Some people have told me it’s a “once in a lifetime” chance to work with a fast-growing tech company in Silicon Valley — and I see the value in that. That said, I’m in the EST timezone and would need to align with PST hours — meaning I’d be working 12–8 PM instead of a typical 9–5, which sounds like it might be a bit of a headache. I also worry that remote work might start to feel isolating or monotonous, especially since I tend to thrive in more hands-on roles.

**Option 2: Run My Own Used Car Dealership (Entrepreneurial Route)**  
My dad owns a mechanic shop with a small used car dealership attached. I’ve helped him sell cars here and there in the past, but now he wants to step away from the dealership side to focus solely on repairs. He’s offered me the chance to take it over this summer — managing everything from sourcing and listing cars to handling paperwork, researching market trends, interacting with customers, and running day-to-day operations. On top of that, he recently bought a second property that I could potentially grow into a full dealership location. I know running a full dealership is a lot different from just flipping a few cars — it comes with real responsibility, risk, and pressure — but that’s something I’m willing to take on. I feel like I’d regret it later in life if I spent my time working a boring corporate job and never challenged myself to see how far I could take a business I actually care about.

I’ve heard people say “the dealership will always be there” and that I could just do it after school — but if I already know I’m not sold on the corporate route, doesn’t it make more sense to start learning how to run a business now? It feels like a rare chance to gain real entrepreneurial experience and possibly build something long-term.

Would really appreciate any thoughts — do I go with the structured, prestigious internship or take the leap on something more hands-on and aligned with what I truly enjoy? Finance-related work has never felt that fulfilling to me, and I’ve always found myself getting annoyed over the way people act in corporate — the politics, the posturing, the lack of real ownership. I’ve just felt more energized doing sales, running things myself, and working directly with people. Also, I feel like I've always been influenced by those who do things because ""it would look sick on your resume"" rather than actually enjoying it

That said, I have to make a decision in the next few days — and part of me wonders if I should just take the internship, since it aligns with my field and could open doors down the line. Then after the term, I’d have the flexibility to explore whether running a business or going the sales route is what I really want to pursue post-grad.

If you’re feeling stuck, second-guessing everything, or just craving some clarity about what’s next, I built a (free!) AI tool to help. Think of it like chatting with a coach at 11pm when your brain won’t stop spiraling.

Here’s what it does:

* Asks thoughtful, reflective questions (not just “What are your skills?”)
* Helps you figure out where you are on the career stuck-to-clear spectrum
* Offers insights or next steps that aren’t generic fluff

It’s in beta, so I’m looking for a few people to test it out and share what’s helpful, and what needs work.  
It takes about 5 minutes, costs nothing, and might just leave you feeling a bit more clear (at least that's the point).

1kb45ou,Engineer who has fallen out of love with the profession,"Hi everyone,

I’m an early-career engineer with a diverse background across aeronautics and EV automotive, spanning roles in research, process, quality, and product engineering. With around six years of experience through internships and professional roles, I’ve achieved much of what I initially set out to do in this field—but I’ve come to realize it no longer brings me any fulfillment.

I studied Aeronautical Engineering with dreams of working at NASA. However, throughout college and internships, my passion started fading. I assumed it was just burnout from school, and that real-world work would reignite my drive. While the professional world was different, it only confirmed that the aerospace industry wasn’t the right fit.

After graduation, I landed a technician job that quickly promoted me to an engineering role. It was exciting—finally achieving my dream after years of effort. I stayed at that EV company for over four years, but over time, my enthusiasm for engineering steadily declined. I again chalked it up to burnout.

Today, I work in a six-figure role at a major OEM—and I’ve never been more unhappy in my career. The money doesn’t make up for the lack of interest I feel in engineering, especially in design, manufacturing, or development work. It’s become clear that I pursued engineering as a personal milestone, but now that I’ve reached it, it feels hollow.

On the personal side, I’m a new mother to a 13-month-old, and my husband is a stay-at-home dad. For the first time, we’re financially stable, and I don’t want to jeopardize that by making a sudden career move.

Here’s where I need advice: I want out of engineering, but I don’t know what direction to go in. I’m looking for adjacent roles where I can leverage my experience but move away from traditional engineering work—ideally without going back to school immediately. Long-term, I’d love to transition into research or data science, as I still enjoy learning and scientific problem-solving.

1kb3dmf,"19, pregnant, abt to be homeless!","Hello there, I’m ac19yr old who just found they were pregnant two months ago and along with that bombshell is the fact that I have to move again after moving for the 5 time in less than a year! I’m originally from Florida (not born, just lived there) but after graduating everything went downhill, me and my mom got evicted n then she started drugs shortly after I went to live with the rest of my family ever since… not long after I got kicked out again living with my ex just to leave there going to my moms friend house just to leave again.

Right after I left my moms friend house, I got robbed and lost my job, they took all my documents except my id, my ssn, diploma, passport, green card as well as all my bank cards. Luckily they got caught but that victory was short lived since I’m unable to get back anything that they took! The only thing I could get back was the money they used off of the card which wasn’t much and my bank account ended up getting closed down! 


Those documents meant life or death bc I was relying on getting into the military for financial support until I can get my life together, unfortunately it didn’t happen and it go to the point where I had to move from where I was again, I came to nyc for a new chance staying with my aunts best friend! A month later I found out my stepdad I haven’t contacted much since I got here died and I basically grew up with, I was heart broken, but it gets worse two weeks after friends from the same place as my stepdad died 3 to be exact one died before their birthday due to speeding and loosing control, I was scared after that, traumatized and very hurt! 


To think it would’ve gotten a little better I found out I was pregnant a little after and planned an abortion, the dad knows but he has no interest in this child and suggested to get rid of which I was on board with due to my situation however I cannot go through with taking my child’s life and due to the fact that I cannot let them know I have a child and the fact that my aunts friend said I had to leave bc she found out I was smoking n off work which is bc of the pregnancy and I was smoking bc it helped the nausea n I have a bad addiction anyways she found out and said I have to go back to Florida, I couldn’t find any jobs there and I most likely won’t going back! 

So my option was to look for shelters/help in NYC but I’ve been rejected due to not being a resident here! My abortion is tm and deciding last minute is nerve wracking but I don’t have it in me to take my child’s life as much as I’m not ready cannot do such a thing! Anyways bc of that decision I made things exponentially harder bc I’ll have to care for my baby while being homeless! I’m not on the streets yet thankfully and I’m searching every possible resource but I keeep coming up empty handed I’ve also thought of offing myself but I can’t do that either, in the end I’m just a scared, traumatized, and hurt little girl who needs help and a little girl who would hope that one day surviving all this I can make my little on proud!

What really makes me struggle with the job is just how many different jobs you are you responsible for as a CYF caseworker. CYF caseworkers are investigators, service coordinators, etc. all in one package. And the constant stress! Court is always looming around the corner, the days where I'm #1 for emergency on-sites are absolutely anxiety inducing, even when you get things done another 5 things seems to pop up and take it's place. Between all this my caseload never leaves my mind even when I'm not at work!

That's not to even mention that a lot of the referrals that we do get are from angry neighbors, family, custody disputes, school staff overreacting, etc. I hate having to essentially harass families over something that I don't even agree with personally. 

This job did really help me conquer my social anxiety and taught me a lot of very useful skills but, I think it's time to move on.

I make 80k a year, up from 55k a year when I first started. I feel like I haven't done anything new for the last 4 years though. The job is very monotonous and I'm not improving my skills.

I've made some pretty focused attempts to get a different job a couple of times throughout the last 3 years, and I've realized that I don't have the skills companies are looking for. I've grown very complacent. I complete my work in less than two hours and then do jack shit the rest of the work day, and I want to change that.

I do have a lot of savings and could live off what I have for at least 2 years.

I'm nervous about going back to an internship this late in my career, but I feel like waiting longer and not improving would be worse. I've tried somewhat to improve my skills on my own, but I'm not very self motivated and haven't accomplished much.

1kb2htv,Should I take a potential job offer or stay where I am? Need advice.,"
Hi everyone, I’m currently facing a career decision and would appreciate some outside perspective.

Right now, I’m running the local office of a big multinational company in a small country (not my home country). We’re going through a merger, and things are a bit messy. The company culture and values don’t feel aligned anymore, organisational structure is a chaos and while there’s hope that things might stabilize in the future, there’s no clear timeline for when or if that will happen.

Compensation-wise, my current salary should be higher. In theory, a raise is due, but since the merger, my former bosses (who were strong advocates for me) have lost a lot of influence. So it’s unclear if a raise will happen at all—or how much it would be.

Recently, I’ve been in talks with another multinational (same industry but different activities) that wants to open a branch here. I’d be responsible for launching and leading the local operation. While I haven’t received a formal offer yet, discussions are progressing well and I seem to be a strong fit due to my unique profile in this market. On top of that, the potential compensation could be almost double what I earn today.

I’m torn between waiting it out at my current role in hopes that the merger eventually brings clarity,cultural alignment and a better salary or taking a leap into something new and potentially more exciting—but also riskier.

Anyone been in a similar situation or have advice on how to weigh these options?

Thanks in advance!

1kb2213,I nearly finished my MBA. Now what?,"First of all, a few words about myself. I’m Italian, nearly 30 years old with a background in mathematical engineering and financial engineering (basically mathematics for finance). After I finished my studies, I joined a fintech startup in Switzerland building analytics for institutional investors - basically a smarter way to see how your portfolio is performing. I started as a quantitative analyst and was then promoted a couple of times until I reached the role of product manager, with a focus on developing tools for investors in PE and VC funds. It was an amazing learning experience: I often ended up with responsibilities that were well above my pay grade and had the opportunity to test my skills in different roles, from sales and client management to more standard product management tasks.
Flash forward four years: after a pretty bad acquisition by a larger player, I was laid off when they decided to close our Swiss office and offshore all development and product roles (in case you are wondering, no, it didn’t work out as they expected). At the same time I had also broken up with my ex (as we say in Italian, it always rains where it’s wet), so I decided to add a few more radical changes to my life and decided to pursue an MBA. I managed to be admitted to probably the best business school outside the US, and I’m now about to finish my last period. 
The initial plan was to use the mba to pivot to an investment role in PE or VC (especially the latter), but this is proving to be borderline impossible. The industry is still facing pretty severe headwinds, and since the company I worked for is pretty unknown my profile is considered second-class by most recruiters. Even warm introductions from previous clients have been pretty useless, and I’m now stuck in a weird position: I’m too much of a “finance guy” for tech and too much of a “techy guy” for finance (literal quote from one of the few recruiters I managed to have a chat with).
The easiest path would be to pursue another product manager role at a fintech, but in that case… what was the point of doing an MBA in the first place?  I’m scared of being pigeonholed if I accept another that is too similar to the one I had, but at the same time all my applications to positions that were even marginally different from mine didn’t even land me an interview. Should I just spend a couple more years in product and hope the economic cycle will pick up again? Or should I keep shooting for the moon even if it’s probably the worst moment in years to pivot to VC?

I do have a mechanical engineering degree and I just got a job as a project engineer. But right now I just feel clueless. I know I can learn, but I’m not sure where I want to go with this job, and caregiving was pretty shattering and I’m just glad to not be doing that, but its really hurt my sense of direction, and I don’t really have a figure to guide me (father had stroke), and now I live 4 hours from home and have no one close.

1kb1cn0,Bachelors in India Vs Europe Cse,"Hey everyone,  
I'm currently finishing my first year of CSE at VIT Vellore, and my family is planning to shift to Switzerland soon. This brings up a big question for me – should I continue my CSE degree here in India, or consider abroad (in Europe)?

Some of my main doubts are:

* Would doing my bachelor's in CSE from a good public university in Europe be better than completing it at VIT (in Terms of future opportunities)?
* If I study abroad and return to India after my bachelor's, will I still be able to get a good job here, or will companies prefer local graduates?
* How well do foreign CSE degrees (especially from EU countries) work in the Indian job market?

I’m really confused. If anyone has experience with studying in Europe or returning to India after a foreign degree, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1kb0m1f,Employer denied time off request but I have a new job lined up,"Hey all, I’ll give a basic rundown of my situation and am looking for advice on how to proceed in a situation I have never found myself in before.

I currently work at a company that has target closing dates for the prior month, so the beginning of the month is typically busy for all of us. I currently have 90 hours of PTO saved up because I rarely ask for time off. I have been working remote since an accident and am expected to return to in office work as of May 1st. I now live in a different city than which my job is located but within the same state. 

I have already secured a new job that starts on May 12th.

My original plan was to take PTO for a week, starting this coming Thursday and ending the next Thursday (May 1st - May 8th). Two reasons for this being because:

1. I don’t currently live in the same city as my job and they expect me in office on the 1st, and 

2. To visit my mother who is been in an extreme decline in health over the past month.

My employer has been aware of my mother’s sickness since I began there but do not know any updates because I like to keep my personal life separate from work.

On this coming Monday (March 5th) I was planning on putting my two weeks in even though I would be on PTO that day. When that week of PTO was up, I was going to head into the office on Friday May 9th to complete the workday and turn in my computer and access card. Following that I was planning on putting the last 40 hours of PTO in during the second week of my two week notice to begin my new job and not having a lapse in pay.

I made it clear that during the first week of PTO that I was more than happy to be available and accessible while also working on closing duties even though I was on PTO, because I did not want to leave my manager hanging but also needed the flexibility of being able to care for my mother during that time. I also was looking to use some PTO instead of letting it go to waste.

I spoke to my manger today and he was fine with the PTO request, and asked me to out it in so he could approve it. Unfortunately his manager told him to deny the request. At this point it does not matter to me because it is absolutely imperative that I visit my mother before I begin this new job.

I know people may criticize my plan as being unfair to the employer however I do want to clarify that this company has about 1,500 employees and I have been here for a year and a half, in which time the company has demonstrated multiple times that they could care less for me as an employee and wouldn’t hesitate to fire me which  was what prompted me to search for another job.

From my perspective I have three options:

1. Firmly state that I will be taking that time off regardless of the consequences and submitting my two weeks notice on Monday as planned anyway;

2. Put in my two weeks notice tomorrow morning and also firmly stating I will be taking that time off regardless;

If both those options were to fail then on to option 3:

3. Submit my resignation letter effective immediately.

I am asking for input as I know companies can make moves erratically and am looking for the best way forward to not leave my manager hanging and for my own befit of not wasting 90 hours of PTO while also having overlapping paychecks for as much financial security as I can get.

I would appreciate any and all input, advice, and opinions. Thank you in advance!",FewSleep9329,5,0.8600000143051147,24,1745964922,2025-04-29 22:15:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kb0m1f/employer_denied_time_off_request_but_i_have_a_new/,4,2025
1kb08fp,"No Clear Passion, Unsure What Career Path to Choose — Need Guidance Navigating This","Hi everyone,

I graduated high school last year and I’m currently on a sort of gap year, working on completing a few qualifications I didn’t finish during high school — mainly my IGCSEs and A Levels.

Lately, I’ve been feeling pretty lost when it comes to choosing a university major or figuring out what career path to pursue. I never really grew up with a strong passion for anything specific, and even now, nothing stands out as something I deeply enjoy or feel excited to chase long-term.

That said, I am someone who commits fully to anything I set my mind to — I always make sure I give it my all and make things happen. But I still struggle with the fact that I don’t know what exactly I want. I’m curious about many things, but I haven’t felt a strong connection to any one area that I could confidently pursue as a future career.

I’m also trying to be realistic — I want something that offers good job prospects and stability — but I don’t want to settle on a path just for the sake of practicality if it’s something I won’t enjoy at all.

If anyone has been in a similar situation, or has advice, tools, or even guiding questions that helped them figure things out, I’d really appreciate it. Just trying to get some direction and clarity during this time.

Thanks in advance for any insight you can share.

I’ve salary capped and everywhere else with my qualifications is about 5-10k lower than my current salary. Ive gotten consistent 3% raises but that’s all I have to look forward to. I’ve reached out to recruiters and they’re looking but my expectations are more than what they see in the market. My managers keep talking development in my department. I’ve been been doing the same job in my company for 3 years - that is bookkeeping. Before this it was AR/AP work. It’s so routine and tedious and I want out and hate going to work every day. We have a vacancy for a higher role accountant. I just spoke to my boss about if I can learn that job and rework my salary. She said no - that she wants someone who has experience in that field already that won’t need much training.  That was a gut punch. Like they don’t trust that I can grow. 

I have a BS in business management and minor in finance. Graduated 2018 and don’t feel like I’m using anything from my degree. It’s all been lost. I have some credit card debt (7k) and still paying off student loans(26k) so not sure if going back to school is an option.

Let me start by saying, I’m assuming that general rule is to not say you were fired in an interview, could raise big red flags.

But I don’t want to lie.

I was recently fired at my job for “not meeting expectations”, but I think there is more to that, since there is talk going around that the business is looking to cut corners and is struggling. Not trying to put blame on them and not me, but they have been firing a lot of people lately, so I’m not surprised. 

How should I go about interviewing?

I don’t think it’s a good idea to say I was fired. I’m thinking of going with the classic “I’m just looking for something new” when asked why I’m leaving my current/last position.

Any advice?

I interviewed for a sales position last week with three superiors and felt 2/3 were excited about me, even going as far as to assure that I’d definitely receive a phone call “next week”. 

The interviewers that were pleased with me were higher ups and the one I was unsure about, would be my direct superior.  She was bored/ despondent and when it was my turn to ask questions about the position, she couldn’t clearly articulate her answers with even the  higher ups stepping in to finish her answers. 

I followed up with a thank you email and received positive remarks. 

The next day(Friday) I missed a phone call without a voicemail and assumed it was spam. The following Tuesday, as I was waiting for a phone call or preferably an email, I was contacted by a mutual party that the missed call I received on Friday was indeed the company and that the despondent superior was the one that called and claimed to be  “concerned” she didn’t hear back. I promptly called the missed number and superior in question. They continued to say they were disappointed I hadn’t connect with the earlier as the position was filled. She continued to say that the hiring team felt I was “over qualified” and feared I’d “move up too quickly” and would need someone one to remain the role for extended amount of time. She ended the call saying that there are future higher positions opening up that would better fit my skill set and she would be in touch. 

I then sent email out to all hiring managers but feel it may have been a bit unprofessional. 

Here is what I sent out, 

“Greetings ###, #### and #####, 

 I first want to apologise for missing #### phone call last Friday. There was a miscommunication, and unfortunately, a missed opportunity.

 I had a chance to reconnect with ###earlier today, and I appreciate #### feedback about my qualifications and finding the right position that better suits my attributes. I would just like to reiterate that I am committed to any opportunity available to work within ###### sales team as I transition into a new industry. I understand with any entry level position available, a long-term commitment is crucial for growth, stability and building relationships with accounts. 

Thank you again for your time, consideration and I hope to have another opportunity to be a part of an already winning team.

1kavpe3,Breaking Into Urban Planning with a Late Start,"Hello, I’m someone who has always had an interest in geography, infrastructure, and cities. I just didn’t find out that there was a career that I could go into that deals with these things until a little later in life, after I had already ‘gone through’ college.

I graduated from high school in 2020 and initially went off to study Music Education, but I did not end up graduating due to an issue with my loans. I came back home and went to my local community college to study IT, and I have been working in the field for about 2 years now. It’s ok, but I don’t feel like I was meant to sit at a desk and stare at screens all day (I know every job has some element of this, but it’s literally the crux of IT work). I also find that my role is incredibly reactive – meaning I only have work to do when something goes wrong. So I spend a lot of time just sitting around at work with nothing to do.

I am about $55,000 in student debt at this point, and have lots of bills, so I can’t afford to go back to school full-time. I have one more semester at my community college until I graduate with my A.A.S. in IT.

As for my plan of attack, I think that I am going to start where I am. My community college offers an A.A.S. in Civil Engineering. I think my first step would be to enroll in this program. According to my calculations, I should be done with this program after a year and some change because of all the gen-ed classes that would already be knocked out. After finishing this program, I would look to move into a surveyor role, as I love being outside and I guess surveying is tangentially related to planning in that you are dealing with zones and different things that relate to the actual implementation of infrastructure and other types of projects.

While working as a surveyor, I think that I would try to go back to a four-year institution part-time and try to get my Bachelor’s in either Civil Engineering (transfer in the credits from my associate’s degree) or Geography (if I wanted a more humanities-based approach). After getting my Bachelor’s, I would start applying to planning jobs. If I can land some, great. If not, I would see about reenrolling to get my Masters in Urban Planning/Design Policy.

What do you guys think of this plan? Is it too idealist? Is there something that I am missing as an outsider?

I stumbled across a paramedic program that sounded interesting, so I applied to see what happened, which was a lengthy procedure. Fast forward to now, they want me to come in for a second interview, but I'm hesitant because I did a few of ride-alongs with a few agencies last month and really enjoyed it! This is something that I can see myself doing in the future. I've been training for the fitness exam.

1kavdcn,Out of Hours Call Support,"Looking for some advice. 

I work for a small company, only about 20 people. The company does wifi/connection services and offer a completely different consultant service. I'm in the non connections side with no involvement in connections.

Recently I've been added to a rota for tech support. One person checks if there are any calls or emails about connections issues in the evenings and over the weekend. Each person will do a week, every 9 weeks.

I've been here almost a year and have never been involved in this before. I have no interest in being involved and was hired for my expertise in a different field. I have a standard 9-5 contract.

The company already push overtime work in other areas and seem to continue to take take take.

I've recently become team lead and two of my guys are already doing this because they previously were on the connection side.

How do I push back professionally and state my case?

I've drafted an email around team area of focus and developing our skills in this area not overstretching.

1kat9x1,Engineering - Career Advice,"Hello everyone,

I think I've realized that I was not as passionate about Engineering as I thought I was. Maybe I've been looking in the wrong field or maybe I'm just scared but I came here to get a second opinion.

I graduated with a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I did really well in school and understood and even taught a lot of concepts to fellow students. I love solving problems and working with my hands especially. That said, I got my first job working for a display company, manufacturing displays for makeup department stores. It was cool at first but two years in and I really really hate it. The only part I tolerated was the active part of my job, programming CNC routing and building things out of plastic and metal and such. Otherwise, it was an endless grind working on monotonous SolidWorks modeling. It's become disengaging and I dread going into work.

That said, I tolerate field work. I feel I may want to do something more engaging or something less stressful, or maybe both. My hobby involves designing and building LEGO and selling custom kits, which is probably why I felt like Engineering might have been a fulfilling career choice for me, since I like building and designing things. I was considering learning how to design injection molded parts as a hobby.

Learning new skills to get to where I want to be is also not a problem. In my current job, I was thrown into the fire with no provided training on how to do my job. I figured it out on my own. It was not a pleasant experience which maybe explains why I am dreading going into something more complicated. Is this a universal experience when working at other corporations?

Are there engineering occupations that allow me to get up and move and to fix things with my hands, either on a production floor or outside in the field? Are there fulfilling occupations that are low to moderately stressful that support a good work/life balance? I don't mind doing office work either time to time, I just hate the idea of being glued to my desk for all of eternity. What are some skills I should learn to transition smoothly? Should I brush up on my math and physics skills? Where should I go from here? I would hate to be stuck in the display industry for all my life doing something I hate.

1kasff9,"I handed in my resignation at the HR department and now I need to tell my boss that I quit, but I'm afraid of their reaction","Last Thursday I handed in my resignation letter to the HR department, as neither my boss nor their boss was around. The head of HR accepted the resignation, but told me that I have to tell my boss about my resignation. I reluctantly agreed, since it's the only fair thing to do, before the resignation is communicated within the company.

Fast forward to today with two days into the new week and my boss returned from vacation with a very good mood. They were really chatty with me and I felt quite uncomfortable with it, because deep down I know that I have news to tell which aren't pleasant at all. The reason why I quit is primarily because my boss causes me a lot of psychological distress with micromanaging and not trusting me at all that I actually work when they aren't around. My boss is also impulsive and can snap at any given second if something doesn't suit them. Because of my boss' personality I feel very uncomfortable and borderline nauseous by telling them what's up and I'm afraid of their reaction. In a conversation with them and a different colleague I heard of various things like our team being already understaffed and with lots of projects going on, which causes me even more anxiety to just step up and say to them ""I quit."". The notice period is going to be 3 months and I don't know what will happen in that time.

1kaq3xh,Help me brainstorm a possible career switch - IT to IT adjacent or something different!,"I've been in career oaching for the past while because I'm miserable.

My eduational background is linguistics. I'm one of those people who looked at the options with the degree I had (chosen with my heart), took a deep sigh, and pivoted into something I knew made money. I learned to program, did IT helpdesk for a bit to have a job with downtime that let me study, worked my way up. Currently a senior dev in the corporate world, 4 years of relevant work experience (not counting the 1-2 years of IT helpdesk before that).

The company I work for is fine, great manager who's aware of my current mental state and really wants to help. He's looking for stuff within our dept that might be a better fit for me.

The deal seems to be (thanks to my coach <3):

* I have a super theoretical/analytical mind. Development/devops/IT just doesn't allow me to nerd out enough. Yes, I could search for the most efficient algorithms, the best possible solutions and all that jazz, but I crave abstract thinking.
   * Manager suggested IT architecture. More time writing, keeping up with trends, big picture thinking, experimentation. No day-to-day implementations, creating API endpoint number 3000, etc.
      * I'm open to that, but worried I just don't care enough, but maybe that's the looming burnout speaking.
* I am a creative person. Sounds dumb, maybe. I write fiction books in my spare time for fun, sing, and run TTRPG (think dungeons and dragons, call of cthulhu, etc) campaigns that I write all my own material for. Those things make me happy in a way nothing else ever has, and while I'm content keeping them as hobbies, that way of thinking is what I'm good at.
   * Of course, creative jobs don't hang on trees, and don't pay very well. I'd probably be very happy as a performer, author, or working with fiction and art in some way, but I would still need a day job even then.
* I am a ruthless editor/proofreader and enjoy that a lot, but not sure what to do with that. I'm a little disadvantaged here because I live in the Netherlands, but Dutch is not my native language. I do speak it fluently, but why would someone hire a Danish national to edit/proofread in Dutch? Maybe something English-based is an option, but probably fairly niche in my location (and, once again, competing with native speakers).
* I need to care. Emotionally. I get a bit of pushback from people when I say it, because 'it's just a job, you don't need to care', but it's important to me. I need to have a vision to buy into, be it my own or someone else's. It needs to *matter*. I don't need to be curing cancer, but someone's life will need to have improved because of my work, even if very minorly, even if it just made them smile.
* And finally: I happen to be visually impaired, and do not have or will ever get a driver's license, so anything with a lot of required travel is a no-go. WFH is the absolute best, bonus points of the company issues me a macbook, because my god those accessibility options are the absolute best.
   * I'm looking into working in the field of accessibility design, since that's very near and dear to my heart. I'm still furious that the official reddit app misses *basic* accessibility features, and yet they shut down the rest of the apps. Thankfully RedReader is still allowed to exist.
* I cannot stand having to argue with people. Debating and discussions are absolutely fine, but being tasked to convince unwilling parties (I work in security, no one wants to prioritise security...) sucks the absolute soul out of me. Unfortunately I'm good at it, or at least better than my average coworker, and so I end up being the face of an unpopular decision a *lot*, and this has been the case in every job I've had. Even at that IT helpdesk job, the difficult people got forwarded to me, because I could talk them into just letting us do our thing, no matter the cost to my own mental health.

1kapwj1,Law vs MBA in finance,"I have a bachelors in English literature. I'm looking to move into either law or get an MBA? Which path would you recommend?

I'm from India and I'm hoping to settle abroad. If I choose law, I'd have to study law in the country I wish to settle in. In case of India, I have the option of the 3 year llb, but graduates usually pursue litigation, and law firms generally prefer 5 year llb graduates. Also there are way too many lawyers now in India.  US and Canada are out of the question. Studying and becoming a lawyer in European countries would take a lot of time, and I've come across many comments in other post saying that the job market is bad for law, especially for foreigners. I'm willing to learn the language. UK seems the most time- effective path with 2 or 3 year degree and then the training contract, but there too, is the problem of getting employed. 

Mba in finance is because I'm hoping to work in something like investment banking. Getting into IB would be possible if I got into top b schools. Since I don't have a bachelors in commerce, I'd have to get a certificate like CA or CFA, get good grades etc. to get into good companies. This is regarding India. In US, your grad school is pretty much the only thing that matters, and I'm not sure about other places, but I think students focus more on getting a finance degree than an MBA

This is what I've understood about these two options in front of me. I'm confused as to which path should I follow. I'm leaning a bit more towards law, as my bachelors would be helpful in the field. A part of me wants to stay in India, because of the state the world is in right now, and I feel my home country would be the best place to be qualified to work in if things do start to go downhill with the world. Pls tell me the better option out of these two.

1kap1p5,Got job offer for a place I don’t want to live,"Hi everyone so I have a bit of a dilemma. So after looking for so many months I finally got a job offer but it’s in a different state three and a half hours away from my family and my friends.

So a quick backstory my family bought a house that’s on 50 acres of land in the middle of the woods. My parents knew how hard I was looking for a job and told me to apply around the area which I did because I didn’t think anything would happen. I applied to three jobs two of them rejected me and well one has given me an offer. And I didn’t realize this until I went up for an in person interview but the new house is 50 minutes away so it’s not even close and the road has tolls. That and my parents have said I would live in that house for a few months to make sure I was serious about the job.

And don’t get me wrong I think the house is beautiful but it’s not a place I want to live. So on one hand I have this 50 minute drive living on a 50 acre property in the middle of the woods away from my friends and family or I have my part time job at home facing the horrid job market again. And before anyone says just take the job and apply to jobs while you’re there the whole point of getting a job would be to STOP staring and refreshing LinkedIn not to keep doing it at a slower rate. Plus the job is on-site everyday so I probably won’t even have time.

So I’m not sure what to do

1kao8xw,Am I Crazy?,"I (27M) have been looking for other roles that will let me continue my experience growth as a younger professional. I have been stuck in a really niche realm of IoT / RF / Electrical field / Wireless Comm. Sys. engineering and it has felt like my knowledge growth has completely stagnated. I currently work fully remote and make 120k base and I just got an interview lined up for another role at a new company. This new role is returning to the office, (possibly for less pay), for a job that would put me in a new realm of engineering versus what I have 4 years of experience in.

Am I crazy for wanting to branch out and give up this fully remote role that I could do with my eyes closed? Or branch out, get away from the niche field I am currently in, and expand my experience as a engineer? Im torn because I think I would really enjoy this newer role and it would open up more opportunities for me down the line at this $50b+ comapny, but it would be super out of my comfort zone. I want to be challenged and work on exciting stuff but my current job is so cushy that its daunting to think of leaving.

I have talked to my current manager about working on other stuff. However, my experience is so niche, and the work that is hot right now falls within the experience I have. So this positions me as a SME on the subject and it feels like I am locked in. I have heard the promises of, well get you working on other stuff, we are expanding this part of the company so we can xyz yada yada yada. It has been ten months and I have been roped back into this work that just isn't challenging to me anymore or has a wide application outside of a handful of companies.

Any thoughts are helpful!

So basically my PIP has concluded. Passed all the tasks listed but still got the axe.

Few days ago, manager told me I have 2 options.

1. Tender resignation. (I have 60 days notice period)

2. Termination

  
Manager told me to choose (1) because termination will be bad for my employment record. Is this true? Will the termination details appear in my certificate of employment?

I read some Reddit posts about this case and most advices to get the termination benefits instead. Now, I don't have the details yet on this and I'm afraid termination period might be 30 days only? I need as much as time right now to apply for a new job.

1kamtx3,Do I need to work on improving my relationships at work or is it just the trauma talking ?,"
For context, my very first job was at a family run financial consulting firm where most of my coworkers and bosses were somewhat related to one another (and I was not). 

A couple years into my employment I got into a very silly disagreement with one of my colleagues who was related to management. This person was (genuinely) not doing their assigned work, which was as a result being given to me. The disagreement was quite small – basically just me telling them that I was tired of having to do their job. I’ll admit I was harsh in my tone but that’s it.

A couple weeks afterwards I got called into the managing partner’s office where I was served a formal warning saying that I would be terminated if I didn’t fix my attitude. Of course I fixed my attitude, but unfortunately for me everyone (and I mean it: everyone) at the firm knew that I almost got fired for “snapping” at my colleague. New hires would learn this fact about me before they even met me. I was obviously traumatized because this is not who I am and I regretted my actions but there was no way to undo them. So I looked for another job and ultimately left. 

Now I’m one year into my new job and I am supervising an intern on a project. This intern works for someone close to my former bosses at my previous firm. They’re doing a great job overall but a few days ago, they scheduled a meeting with a prospect and then called me 45 minutes before said meeting to tell me that they couldn’t go. I went myself and later that day I told one of my colleagues about it (not complaining, we were just chatting about our respective days). 

This colleague then proceeded to tell the intern’s boss about it, and I got called into their office because they wanted to know if there had been a problem with their intern. I told them no and everything seems fine now but I am riddled with anxiety because truthfully, I talked behind this intern’s back and am afraid of the consequences.

 I have now convinced myself that my former company’s gossip has reached the intern’s boss and that because of this incident, the gossip will spread at my current company too. 

Please give me a reality check: am I the problem? Or am I fine? Is this a big deal or am I making it a bigger issue than it is?",01515,2,1.0,4,1745930129,2025-04-29 12:35:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kamtx3/do_i_need_to_work_on_improving_my_relationships/,4,2025

1kak3p6,Marketing or strategy?,"Hi all. I come with 9 years of professional experience. 5 years with consulting (MBB) and 4 years in 2 corporate strategy roles. All across big MNCs.

As I’m hardworking and smart, I have excelled in all roles. Recently, I was offered a shift to marketing as recognition of my talent and with vision to develop me for future leadership roles. The transition to marketing is a step down as I reported directly to the CEO in my last corporate strategy role but here I report to a middle manager.

Just after 6 months of shifting, an international role came up in Strategy & Business Development. This role would entail working with different countries to drive strategic priorities. I have been selected for this new role but I’m afraid this role will just translate to making good PPTs and documents and not really OWNING or driving from the front seat.

I do lack hardcore commercial experience and that is the reason why i had taken up the marketing role in first place . I’m now extremely confused on what I should do.

I have listed the pros and cons. PS. My long term goal is to become a business leader - owning P&L of a country.

International strategy role: PROS: 1. High visibility, 2. Global market exposure, 3. Access to senior leaders

CONS: 1. Shift to a new country - husband’s job could become a road blocker, 2. No core commercial experience, 3. May set myself up for failure in future

Local Marketing role: PROS: 1. Adds depth to my profile, 2. Next steps are clear (can grow vertically or take a sales role), 3. Already recognised as talent in local country hence strong leadership support

CONS: 1. Low hierarchy role, 2. No clarity how long I’ve to do this role to move up the ladder, 3.

I'm in senior management, but the request still applies.  A few months ago, instead of me dropping everything and doing what the CEO wanted, I got a junior employee to do it; the CEO got what he needed but the CEO made it clear that he didn't think it appropriate for me to not drop everything for him anyway.

Would it be appropriate for me to mention these two situations to the CEO's close friends at work (so that the CEO knows that I do drop everything for him)?

1. My father was recently diagnosed with cancer.  I was at the doctor's office with him when he got the diagnosis.  The CEO emailed me, wanting to speak, so I dropped everything, ran out of the doctor's office and took the call from inside my car.  The CEO just wanted to read a one-sentence email (that he had sent) to me.

2. I was invited to a reception at which a member of a prominent royal family was in attendance.  (I'm in the US and the royal was visiting.)  The CEO wanted some internal reporting done, so I did it.  I missed meeting the royal at the reception because I arrived 70 minutes late.

Shouldn't I mention these things to the CEO's close friends, of course playing down the importance of what I missed? ""Oh, my father.  He's in good care and the doctor puts the diagnosis into written reports that I can get online so it's fine that I had to run out during the diagnosis.""

I will not have enough time to get my German/Swiss German proficiency high enough to get a job in content. Education is in Design and Business. What should I do?

---- 
I'm 25 and currently working as a Content Team Manager, managing an on-site content marketing team for a private company in international higher education in Sweden. Before I got promoted, I was working as a Content Designer. I've been in this company for 3.5 years.

While working, I am also pursuing my Masters in Digital Business.

Before that, I worked as a substitute teacher and freelance designer (both part-time while pursuing my studies in Interactive Media Design).

Next year I would like to move to Switzerland to live with my husband (he is Swiss). 

My concern is language. I will start learning German this August/September (as soon as I finish my master's), but there's no way I can gain enough proficiency to still work in Content. They usually require C1 AND close knowledge of Swiss German.

Which leaves the question... what career could I transition into where I can start working ASAP without THAT much local language needed? If at all possible, I'd like not having to start completely over as I'll have almost 5 years of experience by then.

My goal is to give people who are burned out, unfulfilled, lost, wanting more autonomy, etc. opportunities to explore what's out there before jumping into a role they know very little about.

My platform is more catered towards the sensitive, empathic, heart-led crowd - so I wanted your feedback if you resonate:

1kahekl,How Outplacement Services Can Make Career Transitions Less Stressful for Employees,"Career transitions—especially when they're unplanned—can be incredibly stressful for employees. I recently came across an article that dives into how outplacement services can truly support individuals during these tough phases, offering guidance, resources, and personalized coaching to help them land on their feet.

Some takeaways that stood out to me:

* Emotional support is just as important as career guidance.
* Tailored services like resume building, interview prep, and job search strategy can boost confidence and outcomes.
* Offering outplacement also reflects well on the employer’s brand and helps maintain morale among remaining staff.

I'm curious—have any of you had experience with outplacement services either personally or within your organization? What impact did it have?

1kahah9,How do I move on from leaving my perfect job and starting over,"Hey, so back in November I bought my first house. And at the same time I left my part time retail job somewhere I adored to something full time which offered me a serious amount of benefits and seemed like the right choice to hep pay all the bills and get my house renovated since it was a dump.

Well today I quit my job as I was utterly depressed and it gave me severe anxiety and now going back into a part time job in retail but somewhere else not the original place.

But I can’t stop thinking about how I really messed up and I should have stayed where I was before. I doubt a job will come back up at that original place as no one there wants to leave as it’s so cushy. And know I’m finding it hard to focus or do anything as I’m just so so sad that I left my perfect job and ended up worse off.

I think I’ll enjoy the new retail job I found as it’s a very similar job to the original one but it’s further out of town, with much more I convenient hours and I’m just miserable.

How do I let go and finish grieving the life and job I gave up?? I don’t feel like I will ever let it go.",khemmings94,4,1.0,7,1745907927,2025-04-29 06:25:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kahah9/how_do_i_move_on_from_leaving_my_perfect_job_and/,4,2025

1kagrcq,Coworker bringing personal baggage into work,"I have been working as an individual contributor  as a part of a small team (5-6 staff with a lead) for around a year now. I generally like my team, get along well with them, and even occasionally participate in extracurricular activities with them.

I, and honestly the team as a whole, do have a bit of an issue with the lead. She is a bit older than us (mid forties while we generally are mid twenties to early thirties), and she is, technically, very competent. She has been with the company since right around when it started (around 15 years), and is generally a great resource. 

But she has a habit of “over-sharing,” especially about her twelve year old son. He is, there is no nice way to say this, heavily overweight, and by all accounts having a tough go of it, especially at his age. Just bullying, loneliness, etc. I’ve met him a couple times, and he seems like a sweet enough kid, but I really don’t need to know about all his issues.

As an example, today I had a question about one of her areas of expertise. I went to ask her, and we spent maybe 15 minutes talking through my problem, and then 30+ minutes talking about her son and how he is trying a new diet and has lost five pounds or something. Meanwhile, we are in our busy season, and we both have more pressing matters. I try to disengage, but she doesn’t react well and almost always that leads to her over-apologizing about how she should not be taking up so much time, which is counterproductive.

I’m not the only one who has complained about this, and it has been brought up to both her and management, and while at times she has gotten better, it’s frustrating and hard to deal with. 

Now, I understand that ‘water cooler’ talk is a thing, and can empathize with her/her son. Being twelve is hard! And I do get the feeling she really doesn’t have much support. But it’s distracting, and honestly feels a bit invasive, especially as I do not feel like we have a close relationship on a personal level (we get along as coworkers, but that is it). I just don’t know how to address this issue without coming across as if I don’t care.",Guilty_Ad_3258,5,1.0,2,1745905761,2025-04-29 05:49:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kagrcq/coworker_bringing_personal_baggage_into_work/,4,2025

I did 3 internships during college, none of which had the ability to hire anyone afterwards. I've been unemployed for about 16 months now. I can't get fast food, retail, customer service, delivery, warehouse, delivery (I have perpetual motion sickness, so god knows how I could do this), etc. No matter how much I apply or dumb down my resume. And getting an entry level tech job is going to always be impossible. Now, in a year, in 10 years, in 40 years.  I'd love to get into the trades, but not only do I not really know how I'd get into that, but I won't be able to pay for any certifications or trade school.

I have zero assets aside from the clothes on my back and my phone. Zero loans, zero income. I've been sleeping on a park bench for a while. Combine that with how little I've been eating and my body is already forever ruined. Hell, my state ID is expiring next year. And I don't have the money to renew it. So I guess I'll eventually just get deported, and no one will ever hear from me again. Not that anyone is, anyways...

1kaffa8,Starting My First Job As a Contractor Then Full Time?,"Hello,

I'm a 3D artist who graduated last December. After 200+ applications, I finally landed a role. It's not exactly the field within 3D that I was hoping to get in, but I'm extremely glad I still got something, especially during this chaotic job market.

This job is a full-time, on-site role. The company is also preparing for its expansion to the USA, and its physical location is not quite ready yet. Because of this, and I also need to move out of state, they gave me a 3-month remote contractor position, so I can prepare for housing, etc.

Before they sent me the offer, the HR asked for a salary range, which I gave that I felt was reasonable, and they also seemed satisfied with the tone of it. Perhaps because it's a remote contractor position, the pay is pretty damn low and no benefits. After the 3 months, they'll do a performance review and see if they want to offer me a full-time employee position.  
  
It sort of concerns me that the pay is low and that this obviously doesn't guarantee a full-time position afterward, even though the job listing never mentioned this path of starting as a contractor to a full-time position. However, I think they offered this idea because they know I'm out of state. Also, they skipped the last technical interview after seeing my test assignment, and my manager said she and her boss were impressed, so it seems like they liked me enough. 

Is this a common practice to start as a contractor, then move on to a Full-Time employee? Should I be concerned about anything? Also, how accepting is it to switch between industries (my case would be medical to entertainment)?

  
Any advice would be helpful. Thank you for reading.",Square_Ingenuity8897,1,1.0,2,1745900620,2025-04-29 04:23:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1kaffa8/starting_my_first_job_as_a_contractor_then_full/,4,2025

Upon the offer I did mention I had a vacation scheduled for the summer and it was completely understood with enthusiasm that I should have a work-life balance. For these conditions as new hires, they advance 40 hours of PTO. I asked a coworker today to show me how to request time off. Upon the tutorial, she showed me a team calendar where you can see everyone's PTO. She mentioned she hopes it's not over the same time her and our other team member requested. Low and behold, of course it is. She's requesting Mon-tues for her birthday and he's requesting wed-Friday. My vacation is simply Mon-Fri. I dodged the question of ""what day do you need? I'm sure we can move stuff around."" I continued to avoid the question as I did not want to say the whole week and she suggested that maybe we talk about it with our boss tomorrow. To be fair, I totally see their side and how a new hire already needs a week off but that's the whole reason the hours are advanced and who knew I was gonna get the job. Anyone have any advice on how to navigate this conversation tomorrow?

1kae32p,Has anyone had success after many job failures?,"TLDR: Job failure - can anyone else relate? I’m hoping to get some advice or shared experience on this. Or at least a little perspective:

In 2021 I moved to my dream city. In 2022 I started working at what become a dream job and afforded me so much opportunity, including a nice salary and chance to travel. I loved the job, I loved my team and I was starting to really make strides in being a “successful” adult.

However, overtime things started going south. While I loved the idea of my dream city, the reality was I didn’t have a lot of connection or support in it. I was having trouble making friends, I stopped dating because the scene was so bleak, and I put everything I had into work. For awhile that was great - I was getting a lot of responsibility and the chance for cool experiences. But after about a year and a half I hit a point where I was burnt out. I wasn’t handling my job stress/anxiety as well, and in these tough times I didn’t have a lot of people I could immediately turn to in the same city for support. 

What ended up happening was I lost my dream job last summer. It was devastating to say the least. My whole point of reference in the city had become that job and suddenly it was gone. And it was gone because of my own mistakes and burnout. 

Afterwards, I absolutely panicked. I thought the most logical solution was to leave my dream city and move back to where I had lived previously. I had a good group of friends there, more space to think and get myself back together - it seemed like the right move. 

Of course, just because you leave a city doesn’t mean your problems stay behind. Moving back to my “old life” so-to-speak, did not provide any solution and instead has gotten me farther away from where I feel I really want to be. 

I was able to get a job a month after moving back but the company was chaotic and all over the place. In this particular situation I firmly believe I was not the problem, but the company was. As soon as I could, I found another opportunity and hoped for the best moving forward. 

But you guessed it - the next opportunity didn’t work out so well either. Going into it, things felt off but I will fully admit maybe I was still not in the right head space. I lasted about a month at the position, all the while not getting any helpful feedback or direction. In fact, I would get yelled at for mistakes I didn’t even know where mistakes yet because no one was providing any real training or guidance. I was expected to come into a very close-knit work place, with a very set way of doing things and automatically just know everything. I will readily admit, I failed at that. 

Since then I’ve been desperately trying to find a new position (I was rejected from unemployment because my time at the company had not been significant enough, which is adding to the desperation). I’ve applied to positions in the industry I’ve been in. I’ve thought outside of the box and tried to direct my experience towards industries that are hiring more. I’ve applied to be a barista, to work in fast-food, to do grocery-store check-out, even to be a tour guide at a local city attraction. All I’ve gotten back is rejection.

Through all of this, I have realized my mistakes and the part I played in ending up where I’m at. I’m not afraid to say when I’ve messed up - I’m also actively working to course correct so that I don’t make those mistakes in such a detrimental way again. That said, I also know that when I am on-top of my game, I really am a great and strong employee. 

But I’m starting to feel like I’m never going to get my life back to where it was. I feel as if I’ve run out of chances in life (I’m only 33 so let’s hope not) and I’m going to get stuck on a path that I don’t want. I understand you can’t plan for everything in life - sometimes life takes over and leads you where you need to be, but I do wish I had some say because I’m afraid life is going to lead me back to living with my parents in the town I grew up in. I really was hoping for more and at one point had it.

So back to my original inquiry - I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. Have you achieved your dreams, only to then lose them and be back at square one? I need a success story, that turned to failure that then turned back to success. I’m desperately trying to keep a positive attitude and not lose my spark, but I don’t know.

1kach62,"Pivoting from development sector to corporate, but feeling lost","Hello everyone,

I’m in desperate need of some career advice. I’m 30 years old and a development professional, specializing in work in conflict-affected countries. Over the years, I’ve worked on projects in Yemen, Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan, gained experience with multilateral organizations, and spent the last 10 years living and working in Europe. I hold a master's degree from a top European university and speak five languages fluently.

A year ago, I won the green card lottery and moved to Washington, D.C., hoping to continue my career here. But soon after I started applying for jobs, the funding situation in the development sector changed because of the new administration, and now I’m really struggling to find work. I’ve applied to many positions at the World Bank and NGOs, but so far, I haven’t had much success. I tried to network, but everyone I meet says it's the worst time to be looking for a development job.

I’m feeling really discouraged about the development sector overall. Even when things stabilize, I’m starting to realize that finding a stable job in this field may always be a struggle. I’ve always dreamed of working for the UN, but breaking in seems almost impossible. I’m considering pivoting to the corporate world while I’m still young enough to make a change.

Some days I think about studying international law and human rights, but I worry about job prospects afterward. Other days I’m drawn to international arbitration, but again, I'm afraid I won't find anything and will be stuck with the student loans. I also think about pursuing a PhD in political science or taking certification courses like project management and M&E to strengthen my profile.

The truth is, I feel completely lost. Financially, I’m okay since my husband moved here with me and found a finance job right away. But emotionally, I’m really struggling. I feel like I’m going through an existential crisis. My self-esteem is at an all-time low. Even though my husband believes in me, I’m having a hard time believing in myself. Some days, I wonder if I might be depressed. Overall, I just feel worthless and useless.

I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts you might have. What would you do if you were in my position? Maybe some of you have pivoted from the development field? If so, how did it work for you? I would really appreciate any advice. Please be kind, I already do enough of negative self-talk on daily basis. Thanks a lot!

1ka9fpm,Pivoting from academics to research in tech. In desperate need of advice!,"Hello lovely redditers! I made the difficult decision to withdraw from a clinical psychology PhD program to pursue a career in research. I'm currently, having a hard time with the transition and successfully packaging my background/experience for non-academic jobs (e.g., going from an 8 page CV to a 2 page resume). If anyone has gone through a similar transition or knows of anyone who could provide pointer, it would be GREATLY appreciated! 

For those interested, here's a link to my redacted CV. I've been able to pare down quite a bit, but I know that it still needs quite a bit of work.

1ka9afu,Office Confrontations,"I work in a cubicle in an office setting. A few weeks ago, a co-worker came to my side of the cubicle where we're both situated and confronted me about me coming to work ill. Mind you, I had seasonal allergies and took sick leave for days on both that week and the previous week. Though I had a lingering cough, this guy was extremely confrontational and rude. 

He told me that by coming into work sick, my “intent is to get everyone sick"". I then stood from my chair and countered that how that isn't true, and he became more confrontational and re-asserted his previous statement. He complained that he contracted whatever sickness he may or may not have been developing from me and how he has a child at home. He also said with a deliberately slow and condescending tone to ""have con-si-der-ation for oth-ers!"" I left work, and decided to save my response for another day. That day came last Wednesday.


I went to his side of the cubicle and calmly stated that ""I want you to know that I listened to every word you said to me on the first Thursday of this month. And I want you to know that i agree with none of it. I understand your caution about being health conscious, but how you came off was rude and disrespectful. As for you telling me what my intents are, you don't know what my intents are since you can't see what's in my head..."" At which point he interrupted me and claimed that all he said to me was ""don't come to work sick."" 

At no point did I step into his cubicle space, but I countered about how that wasn’t all he said, he loudly tells me not to come at him ""like that. I don't play that."" I reminded him of his confrontational approach towards me on April 3rd, and then he became loud and overdramatic and proceeded to log out of his computer and act as though he was moving towards the exit before ""he loses his job over this. I don't know what you're on, but you need to step off"". I reiterated that the way he spoke to me was neither appropriate nor professional. We had a face-off, but I walked back to my cubicle. As a parting remarked, ""What's wrong with you?"" and I replied with the same question.

I wrote down all that transpired and told this man’s supervisor, but I don’t think anything will get done. This employee has a history of issues with how he talks to people. They had the same problem with him at his previous office. Plus, he proved that a reasonable man-to-man conversation with him is impossible. When you call out someone who, at their core, is a condescending bully, they fall apart.",10BestMen012,1,1.0,0,1745881467,2025-04-28 23:04:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ka9afu/office_confrontations/,4,2025

1ka8ymz,How to negotiate salary after stating i expected lower,"HI, so to give some introduction, ive been job searching for a few months now. I was feeling a bit hopeless during my search and when i got a interview for a position as a dietary cook aide specialist at a nursing facility i was very excited. I was denied from that position but got a second interview for another position they were hiring for which was as a floor specialist which i do have 1/2 a year experience as. I also have past experience in similar roles that they stated they would be cross training me in.  However, i did make a couple mistakes at the initial interview. When i asked about the pay, they told me the base pay would start at 18.70/hr. When asked what i was expecting, i told them i was expecting minimum wage which is currently 16.50/hr in CA and i said this because being thoroughly honest, i was feeling desperate to get hired. I also told them i was terminated from my last position as a floor specialist due to attendance issues. However, when they gave me a job offer and even during the initial interview, they stated how they were really impressed with my qualifications/past experience and that they say potential in me. I also received the job offer 3 days later after that second interview and they also stated they were looking to fill the role as soon as possible as well which also came off to me as giving me a bit of negotiating leverage. I am looking to make a long-term career out of this and looking at the job offer now and after giving it some thought, im wondering if i can negotiate a bit higher pay increase of perhaps 10% and how i should go about doing it. Should i ask if there's negotiating room or should i just give them a straight up counteroffer.

1ka8e6m,What can I do with a Bachelor’s in Anatomy while waiting to complete medical school?,"Hi everyone,

I could really use some advice.
I have a Bachelor’s degree in Human Anatomy and I’m currently a medical student and close to graduating, with just one year left. Unfortunately, due to issues at my university (plus the high cost of living), I’m unable to continue school for now.

My original plan was straightforward: get my medical degree, launch my healthcare career. But life had other plans.
Now, while I’m waiting for school to resume, I want to find a job, something meaningful and sustainable but I’m unsure where to start with just my Bachelor’s degree.

I thought about medical writing, but it seems pretty saturated, and most roles prefer an MD or PhD.
I’m open to other options preferably remote work and something I can combine with school would be ideal, but I’m flexible.
My goal is to support myself for now and also build skills that could be valuable long-term, even when I eventually complete medical school.

Does anyone have advice, ideas, or tips on career paths someone with a Bachelor’s in Anatomy could realistically pursue?
I’m open-minded and willing to learn.

1ka7uc1,What can I do after graduation?,"Hi, so I (21) graduate this summer with a BA in Fine Art in the UK and I’m so completely lost on what to do after graduation (I know, predictable) and I could really do with some advice. 

I’m desperate for a job that will not depress me and while I’m aware that an art degree isn’t the most impressive to employers I’m self aware enough to know just how depressed I would be if I had a job that was not meaningful or creative in some sense but I have no idea how to get my foot in the door. I’d really appreciate any advice on what career paths I could take that are well suited to me, that are not seriously oversaturated with jobseekers, that are actually feasible for me to get, and which could actually pay the bills (even if starting salaries aren’t great, if it were reasonable to expect career progression which would then pay the bills that would be fine). Like I said earlier, I’d really prefer a job with some level of creativity and/or meaningful work - but beggars can’t be choosers.

A little context about me - I got top grades in GCSE and A-Level and will hopefully graduate with a good degree classification from a Russel Group uni this summer. Through my degree I’ve gotten a bit of project management and advertising experience as well as some more broad creative and design experience but nothing super specialised. This summer I’ll be doing a funded leadership programme in Kuala Lumpur where I’ll get some more work experience but I’m not sure in exactly what yet - it’s likely something project management or design geared. However, outside of those things the only work experience I have is crew in a restaurant. I am totally prepared to get a masters or other training in something if it would genuinely open up job opportunities but I don’t want to get one just to fill time and waste money.

Ultimately, I’m totally lost in what to go into - I’ve thought about communications, publishing industry, project management etc but everything feels so bleak - it seems like there’s too many jobseekers available for the amount of jobs running and this is really frustrating for me especially because I’m a bit of a tryhard so I know I wouldn’t be happy if I weren’t ‘doing something’.

Apologies for the length of the post but any advice would be greatly appreciated! Jobs, career routes, good steps to take after graduation, further education, industries, whatever.

1ka60xw,Are the sales tactics of the (door to door) company im working for misleading/unethical? Or is this just how sales tactics work?,"Okay to preface this first statement, I’m a broke college student. I have friends that do door to door sales, and they’ve made good money. So I decided I’d give it a shot. 

The company is called Brooks Pest Control. They seem to be a reputable company and have good reviews online. I’ve been doing it for about a week now, and I’ve realized there’s probably some misleading stuff in the pitch.

A large premise of the pitch is that we are able to give a discount because our trucks are “in the area” or because we “work for some of the neighbors.” There’s also a point to create urgency for people to sign up while we’re on the doors, to make them feel like the deal leaves with us. I’ve been trained before to tell people that it’s not a “call in discount.” The “discount” we give knocks contracts down from $1700 (very expensive) for the year to $850 a year (more reasonable).

There are so problems with this. I tried using the website to get a quote, and it the price they sent me was as cheap or cheaper as the price we give on the doors. There are some reps on our team who answered call ins before the typical summer selling season, and the call in prices were similar as well. I feel like it’s misleading to make people think they are getting a better deal or a discount when in reality they are getting the same price that everyone else gets, which is also not even that great of a deal most times, as $850 a year seems like a pretty typical contract, with some people saying it might even be a little bit expensive. The part of the pitch where we tell them we can only do it for so cheap because the trucks are in the area seems it’s just a lie. I’ve talked to my friends on the team, and they seem to agree, they just don’t really seem to care as much. 

What does everyone think? Would you feel dishonest/unethical? Or is this just something I should get over and accept as something that is typical in sales/marketing? After I put some of these pieces together, I just feel so gross giving the pitch to people. Let me know your thoughts.

So for context, I've been at this company for nearly 6 months now. It's still really early and I don't have the luxury to really ask for any favors, but this is an opportunity that I would like to pursue at some point. This is a Japanese company and I work in the American headquarters. I was looking at the possibility of getting a transfer to the Japanese headquarters, and a coworker even suggested a position that could be very helpful and that I could easily fulfill.

I recently got the business card of our branch manager, so I have the ability to contact him, but he's in Japan and our emails would maybe be limited to one a day. Alternatively, I could ask our general manager, but at the end of the day he'd have to ask the branch manager as well, so I'm not sure if that's the right call. Is there someone else I should maybe contact?

Also I understand that this might seem a bit early to ask for something like this. I'm relatively young and haven't had many jobs so I'm not 100% sure of when to pursue something big like this. Is there any sort of long-term plan for getting a transfer like this?

1ka5ccp,Career jeopardy & termination trauma,"I have always been extremely career ambitious. I had undiagnosed ADHD as a kid and so have always had an unrelenting drive to prove myself to others, be successful, earn loads of money etc.

The first ~9 years of my career went to ‘plan’ in the sense that I worked hard and got merit for it, got multiple promotions at different companies, was earning £100k at 30 and feeling really good about that. For someone who used to get constant detentions for not doing my homework hey. 

However, the last couple of years have been rough. I was laid off after an M&A and found myself in a hideous job market for waay longer than I expected. I eventually found a job at an awesome brand - but I ended up reporting into the most toxic woman I have ever met, based in a different country (Israel). It was 8 months of torture as this woman picked apart my personality and my self esteem (over zoom goddamn) and although I was performing above expectations, at 8 months I was suddenly terminated (to my absolute devastation) on account of being a ‘bad culture fit’. It’s a long story- but I’m currently in a legal dispute about the situation and hope to reach a settlement this month. I was undoubtedly bullied out by an insecure manager, and it totally wrecked me. 

Anyway - 5 months on and I feel like the last couple of years have done irreparable damage to my career and my self esteem. I’m now freelancing but finding the work that I used to find SO easy is now so difficult. It’s like I’ve regressed?! I’m constantly doubting myself, have bad anxiety and I find it hard to get through a full working week. I can’t bear to go into the office, and thinking about completing another 30-40 years of this career literally kills me.

All of a sudden my ambition is in the toilet. I get approached almost on a weekly basis with great opportunities and I shy away from them all. I want to go down to part time, I daydream about quitting corporate altogether,  becoming a Pilates instructor or an artist or… I dunno a gardener. Something that doesn’t chain me to a computer screen under the power and judgement of someone else. I’m wondering if my so called ‘ambition’ has been a ruse to people please/get external validation and prove a point that I’m capable this whole time. 

I’d love to hear advice from anyone who quit corporate jobs, sacrificed comfortable salaries,   Overcame work trauma/major wobbles or just has any words of wisdom.

1ka4zoz,I regret my Bachelor’s Degree and I am starting to feel hopeless and stuck. Any advice on careers I can pivot to?,"I graduated in May 2023 with a Bachelor’s in Public Health with a concentration in Community Health. After graduation, I decided to go on a two year gap year before pursuing my MPH because I did not feel certain about my career path. When I initially chose this degree, I wanted to help people and I was really passionate about the welfare for others. I have worked at four organizations while I was in college and since graduating: a nonprofit, the state government, a local health department, and a FQHC. Unfortunately, I didn’t thrive in any of the environments that I was in and realized that the kind of work I was doing wasn’t for me, mainly because I was suffering from severe burnout or it just wasn’t a good fit. I’ve worked as a PrEP care navigator, epidemiology intern, tobacco cessation specialist, and drug prevention coordinator.

I’ve looked at different career paths to pivot to, but all of them require schooling that I simply don’t have the funds for. I am a first generation college student, so any financial support from family is off the table. The future of public health and higher education is looking bleak, so I don’t even know if it’s possible for me to pursue an MPH. I am interested in clinical herbalism and potentially being a full spectrum or death doula, but the path to that seems like it requires a lot of backing that I don’t have.

Originally a defence attorney, then I was sure that I wanted to become a police detective but my parents barred me from considering that option. What I was drawn to were police interrogations and how I could go about it. It took a while to accept the “ban” on becoming an officer but as Paul Dano said “I’m short, I’m white, and no one feels my inner gangster” so that was another reason not to become on officer. I decided I’d become a prosecutor, it feels right. I still get to interrogate by cross-examination. 

BUT, literally I am so nervous to present in front of people, and talk in front of people, and especially cross examine someone in front of a JURY. Now I already feel like a complete burden on someone when I even start up a conversation, ask them a question, anything. I get so nervous talking to people and I’m mostly reserved say for a few friends.
I tried getting into Model United Nations but I felt so ashamed sitting as a delegate infront of kids who were like, 5 years younger than me (I’m 17F btw) I only managed to get as far as an opening statement with a partner, ppl laughed at her for her Indian accent so after that I just felt so ashamed I couldn’t get back into it.

What do I do? If I’m so afraid of embarrassing myself in a small conversation how the hell am I supposed to talk and cross examine infront of a jury?

I have been applying for jobs since early February (always with a follow-up email to the principal and, if I can find out who it is, the Social Studies department head introducing myself and linking my online teaching portfolio), attended job fairs in three different districts, and I have excellent recs/ references. I have experience teaching pre-k and elem through volunteering, substitute teaching, and being a summer camp counselor, middle and high through student teaching and substitute teaching, and even college students as a graduate teaching assistant this past semester. I don't have experience coaching or advising a club, but I have made it clear in emails and applications that I have leadership experience in a wide array of extracurriculars and am open to learning how to conduct them as a teacher.

I have applied to 14 schools now, yet only 5 have even responded to my emails and only 2 have reached out for interviews, though both schools went with other candidates.

I am genuinely so confused and frustrated and don't understand what I am doing wrong. One school that I substitute teach at even told me at the job fair that if they had a position open they would hire me on the spot, but then when THREE social studies positions opened up that week, I applied, sent 3 emails over the course of 2 months checking in only to get no reply, and then today the status changed to ""position filled.""

I'm asking this myself for a long time now.

My dream is to be a team leader or head of department or even higher.

But - do I have the qualifications?
How can I find it out?
Do you have any experiences?

I didn't studied anything in this direction, I only did my apprenticeship and already there I ""moved up"".

I worked at a logistics provider and at the end of my apprenticeship I got an offer from the boss of my boss to join there location which is a port in north Germany and way more international which also was one of my goals.

I'm working there since almost a year and I already have huge responsibility which I like.
I'm consistently learning from my boss, trying to understand their thinking and sometimes I catch myself thinking the same way.

Is that a good sign?
I'm still very young, 22 years old, so way to young and unexperienced but maybe in 10 years?

Is my thinking realistic our am I living in a dream world?

1ka1jh1,Forced Role change at employer,"Some background, I make in the range of $130-$140K, my current title is Senior Software Engineer.  I am being told by my employer that my role is changing and this is what they want me to do.  I have been here a few years, in that time I was pulled from what I was doing in the company, to this brand new initiative/project that is ""the future"" for the company.

My background:  I have been in IT for 25+ years, the majority of my background is being Production Support/Application Support.  I have 10+ years Unix command line experience, 12+ years of writing SQL queries, 4 years AWS and \~10 years of supporting Java based applications in an on-call capacity to throw a few things out there without posting my entire resume of skills.  I don't code... I am NOT a developer.  I have tried multiple times in my career to learn Python, I always get to the same point and it and it feels like jumping off a cliff and becomes enough I just can't make sense of it.  I have told my Boss this, and his Boss.  It's just not for me, and if I can't ""get"" Python, I am not sure how they expect me to become a Java Developer off of some pluralsight courses, with an expectation of being ""Above Average"" when I complete all this.  The Java Developers I know, have told me I would need a 6mo Bootcamp first, before jumping into this.  That isn't an option, they want me doing this role this week or next.

I have already pivoted to a lot of this stuff as it is new to me and I did so without complaining, I am happy to have a job, however, this feels like a LOT more responsibility, and I am not being offered any extra pay.  I have asked HR for a compensation review based on these responsibilities compared to my current title.  I was told this would be great for my career, but it has not been fun, or enjoyable.... at all.  Being almost 49 and looking for a job not having any Managerial experience, I ran into a hard time landing this job, I can't even imagine looking full time in today's climate.

I changed some things to ""protect the innocent"" and marked things I currently do with \*\* (if at the end, I do all of that already, if not, I do up to where it is marked):

My Boss is the overall Manager of the platform, and some of this really feels so far outside my wheelhouse, I am being set up for failure, not success.  Let alone, it should be coming from him, not me.  A few of the items above like the Deployment and Merging strategy, are being used as a test for me, which I don't understand, as all of this came from my Boss before, he is an ex-Developer, I am not.  I track down and fix problems.

His mantra has been ""Just ask questions!""  Well if I don't know what questions to ask, how am I to ask them?  Zero base, zero structure, just throw him in the pool with is concrete boots and let's hope he can swim!

I am not a lazy person, but this is such an overwhelming list of things they want, I don't feel their ETAs are at all realistic, not to mention, taking on all this new stuff, with zero increase in pay.  I feel like I am being set up to fail so they have a reason to let me go.

I would love some advice!  Yes it's a lot, but I feel I need to paint an accurate enough picture to get accurate feedback.

I’m someone who, even in the most menial of jobs, cares a lot about doing a good job and making my customers or clients happy.

And last Friday, a client emailed my boss saying that they’re disappointed with my work and that the “level of service” has declined since I took over for another manager around three months ago. This is like the polar opposite of any feedback I’ve ever received so I was jolted quite a bit.

1ka0ehw,Am I valuing leadership experience too highly?,"I (27M) feel confused on what my next steps for my career should be. I currently make 116K base with the title of Senior Technical Product Manager and 4yr experience in the field for one of the telecommunications companies in the area. I also just recently completed my MBA through my employer, meaning if I leave before October, I have to pay back only 3 K total since that is what they covered for it. 

With all that in mind, I believe I am fairly underpaid based of the research I have made online where the average for that title in the area is roughly 130k. I have thought about transitioning to a different company in pursuit for higher pay. Still, I remained hesitant to do so since my director has made it clear that they are interested in moving me up to managing my current team. 

 Best case scenario pay here would be 128k base and a promotion to BOM3 (Business Operations Manager of Analytics) with the raise, he has also signed me up for internal leadership courses that they make other managers take, and invites me to manager-only meetings as well. So, at the very least I do believe him that in 6 months I would be the manager. Yet, again through research the average pay for similar title in the area is 150k - 180k. 

With all this information in mind, would it be better for my career to eat the lower pay for, bare minimum, another year and a half to gain high level leadership experience and then do the job switch later for the higher pay. Or am I drinking the corporate Kool-Aid and should prioritize changing companies to get the higher pay and reassess later?

1ka01mj,Would you leave this contract or stick it out?,"Contracted through temp agency on an indefinite contract with basic health insurance I pay for with every paycheck via the temp agency. 40hrs a week, w2 with no benefits or perks of working on the clients in-house marketing team. Great job, great coworkers, learning a bunch but approaching 3 years and entering 6 months of discussions about creating a permanent role with no resolve due to ""busy schedules"".

I have no PTO and 40hrs sick time each calendar year. Every time I take a day off I make it up on the weekends or at night since I make $38 per hour before taxes and need the $$. Should I issue an ultimatum RE: creating a permanent role or just ask for a serious raise? I've only asked for a raise once this time last year. (I know I'm stupid but I'm relatively new to the workforce)

My work can only be done by myself and there are no team members who can step in on my behalf to even touch my scope. It takes 6-12 months to train someone on the job and the volume and turn around time on projects (sometimes a few hours) is starting to drive me mad. It's not my departments fault, but rather the lack of communication from the 15+ teams I cross collaborate with.

As I hit another 6 month installment of my role, should I be negotiating for something more? I'm afraid to leave because of how much I'm learning + how incredible the managers and team I work with are + how untoxic the work environment is for a major marketing team. I don't want to grow resentful that I'm the only one that isn't permanent but once those summer Fridays start for a third year in a row and I'm the only one dealing with a dog pile of work my brain might split in half.

Also to note: It's a very secure job in general so the idea of hopping to something new scares me, and there isn't anything currently available that interests me but I'm actively keeping my eyes open. In general I'm considering a radical life change but in the mean time I need a job to pay the bills until I figure out what my next creative endeavor is.

1k9xfcu,Was tendering the wrong move?,"I have been keeping this to myself for about 5 months now and I still don’t know if I made the wrong move… how do I get closure from this.

I am 29(M) and work in the creative industry as a lead consultant. Late last year, I tendered from my role due to disagreements I had with my ex-boss over how a situation with a client was handled.

Long story short, I felt that there was breakdown in communication but I also felt that this particular client was an asshole. Here’s some of the things he did which led up to the argument with my boss:

- He ALWAYS contacts me over the weekends which I replied initially to let him know our agency doesn’t work on the weekends. We have lives outside of work. After awhile, I simply replied during working days.

- He always sets unrealistic deadlines expecting me to be a magician. I have explained to him multiple times that certain things cannot be done as it will be a rushed job and the quality won’t be met. I always propose alternatives to ensure that I can hit his objectives within a shorter timeframe. This removes unnecessary steps during that particular phase of the project but is always turned down as his way is the only way. I will often bring this up to my boss and she always sides with him, so now SHE has to rush through the night with me to hit his deadline when it is completely unnecessary.

- He always makes last minute changes (overhauls sometimes) just an hour or so away from the scheduled call and expects us to finish it by the time the call is on. There was once where I texted him to tell him why it cannot be done and to ask for an extension. He asked for a call and so we did where I very calmly explained my alternative solution which CAN hit his goals. He said okay and hung up. Next thing I know, he called my boss to say I lost my temper on him??? I am 100% sure the call was done in a very very calm and objective tone. I even screenshotted the entire conversation I had with him over text to my boss and she agreed things were said objectively. 

- The last straw came when I was on vacation and requested my boss (non of my colleagues wanted nor knew how to deal to deal with him) to send in the work on my behalf. I rushed it out over the weekends for his presentation on Monday, called my boss on a Sunday evening to ensure that she has looked through and approved all the changes. After seeing my boss send in her email, I texted her a thank you note to sincerely express my gratitude for sending it in for me. She sent me a heated text to say that the work (she approved just the last evening) was not up to standard and the client complained. I got really pissed off and I felt she always sided with the clients no matter what her team has gone through to support clients like this and I tendered immediately over text.

- Of course prior to this there had been multiple occasions where she sided with unreasonable clients and I also understand her role as the one who needs to continuously please the clients. I just felt that this was always in the expense of the team’s effort and as the lead, I have seen this for both my solo projects as well as the projects that my team has done. After 3 years of this, I just couldn’t take it anymore.

Sorry for the long read but yes that’s the gist of the situation and it has been lying on my shoulders for the last couple of months. I have seeked out my boss and we talked things out, but I just feel that there are things she’s said that were not sincere as after knowing her for the last 3 years, she has always been quite a people pleaser. How could I have handled the situation better? Was it me having low EQ and emotional intelligence? Was it my lack of maturity?

1k9xbww,Struggling to Find a Full-Time HR/I-O Role After Graduation — Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone,

I'm hoping it's okay to ask for some guidance here. I’ve been working hard to transition into the I/O Psychology/Human Resources fields for over a year now, but it’s been a tough journey. I have a BA in Psychology and recently earned my MA in Industrial/Organizational Psychology from the University of Hartford, graduating with a 4.0 GPA.

While studying (and after finishing), I was fortunate to land a few contract roles in HR and I/O work. However, finding a full-time, long-term position has been a real challenge. I'm open to any HR-related opportunities and have been applying broadly, but I haven't had much luck so far. I genuinely want to grow with a company, contribute to their workforce development, and see the long-term impact of the work I do.

Despite getting to final interview rounds a few times, I often either don't hear back or receive automated rejections. I've also tried connecting with recruiting agencies, but that hasn’t led to many opportunities yet.

I would be happy to share my resume if that's helpful. If anyone has advice, feedback, or even just some encouragement, I would truly appreciate it. Lately, it's been hard to stay positive, but I'm trying to keep pushing forward. Please if anyone has any advice or leads at all or would be willing to message/connect it would be so helpful to me.

1k9w536,Big Career Decision – Startup Co-Founder Opportunity or Play It Safe?,"Hi folks,

I know this is likely getting trashed but nevertheless wanted to get some outside counsel for a career decision I face. I feel like I am overthinking this way too hard and this has really clouded my judgment. Tried all kinds of different decision frameworks, and my gut/heart feeling changes day by day. So I appreciate any support / personal experience or otherwise :)

**Background:**

* 31 yrs.
* Working at a strategy consulting firm for \~1 yr. (not my dream job but it's good branding and I can manage for another 6 months)
* MBA from top-tier university
* Happily married
* Kids and house planned in 1–2 years
* $300K in cash savings invested (financial freedom in 10–15 yrs at same income)
* Feeling burned out a bit because I basically grinded the last 3 yrs. with no break (I am ready and happy to work a lot but also enjoy sleeping 8 hours and having time with my wife, especially on the weekends)
* Long-term goal: Entrepreneurial path and Financial Independence ($3M, not like $300M)

Options (problem is basically I have to decide ASAP with no time to further test/explore):

**Joining a funded start-up company in tech B2B as co-founder**

* Pros
   * Has seed funding
   * Great co-founder
   * Has first potential customer with +$1M ticket
   * Significant learning curve
   * If I don't do this, I feel like I missed out on the perfect opportunity (funding, great co-founder, super large vision, interesting product)
* Cons
   * I feel a bit out of my league with my skillset
   * Will involve regular travel by plane
   * The responsibility will weigh heavy, never having the time to mentally detach (which is natural in entrepreneurship, but given existing funding seems even higher here)
   * Co-founder is a bit too grindy, I fear — he wants to move super fast and iterate, which results in a lot of stress (he already had a panic attack); I worry that I cannot manage this myself
   * If I don't manage to keep up and have to abandon, I basically have only two short-term stints on my CV which could prove very difficult to find the next job => Delays financial independence +  could hurt the vision to get a house

**Starting a bootstrapped business as a co-founder**

* Pros
   * Great co-founder
   * Slightly more on par with my work ethic (i.e., normal nights and weekends mostly)
   * Local (means more quality time as no travel)
   * High ownership without external investors
* Cons
   * No funding, but 10 months' coverage with basic salary due to government support
   * If I don't manage to keep up and have to abandon, I basically have only two short-term stints on my CV which could prove very difficult to find the next job => Delays financial independence +  could hurt the vision to get a house

**Stay at my current consulting gig and transition into corp/startup job + side hustle**

* Pros
   * Get 1.5 yrs tenure for better CV branding
   * Get a solid corporate/startup job
   * Follow my passion and do side hustles
   * Gives me now time to relax a little bit
   * Enables financial savings to further ramp up my investment account
* Cons
   * Fear of missing out on the last time to follow entrepreneurial passion before kids arrive and house acquisition is on the table => I do feel like this would lead to regrets that would affect my marriage and future career",Apprehensive_Cut9179,1,1.0,1,1745848531,2025-04-28 13:55:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9w536/big_career_decision_startup_cofounder_opportunity/,4,2025

1k9vfpc,Wanting to Change Offices Closer to Home,"I’ve been working from an office location closer to my home the last couple weeks and I have been loving it so much. The commute is easier and much less stressful and I’m actually near things around my house where I can run errands/take appointments if I need to during the week (on lunch breaks) without having to use PTO. I transitioned from working remotely for several years due to COVID to working in an office full time for my current job and it has been a tough adjustment for me. I hate my typical commute. I almost got in a wreck going home after only my second day at the job. I also don’t feel like I fit in at my normal office. It’s so stuffy and corporate there, which wouldn’t have bothered me pre-pandemic, but it hasn’t felt like a good match for me now coming from a WFH environment. I know WFH isn’t an option with my current role but it would majorly improve my work-life balance if my total commute were 40-45 minutes a day versus 1 1/2+ hours a day. I want to ask my manager if I can relocate due to the proximity to my home. My only concern is that everyone else in my role in the area works out of the corporate office. There’s also limited office space at the local office for me to work from, but they do have one or two options. I’ve been trying to decide…does this kind of ask warrant an email or a phone call? Or an email that suggests a phone call for further discussion? And what would be the best way to state my case? I could be wrong but I feel like this is going to be a big ask. They are a very team-oriented group who did not implement technology the way my former company did during the pandemic, so they are not as responsive or even utilize communications tools the way I’ve been accustomed to while working remotely. I’m sure the first and biggest issue will be me relocating when I haven’t been in the role yet a year and they promote sitting with other employees one on one to learn how to do things so they don’t have an extensive job aid library like I’m used to or like using Teams screen share to show me how to do things. I try to utilize what digital/electronic resources I can but there are times when I’ve had to just ask someone to come to my desk to show me something or go to their desk because I can’t get a straight answer or consistent answer or any answer from their various help desks. So I’m struggling to determine the best approach for this request. Thoughts?

1k9vdrb,What should I specialize on? [IT] [Germany],"Hello everyone,

I‘m looking for some help about where I should go in my job.
I‘m a 21yo woman from Germany. 

I‘m currently hired as a Solution Architect for a big worldwide IT-Service provider.

I‘m more specifically working as a Cloud Solution Architect in Azure. I‘m also AZ-104 certified.

Now here‘s my problem. I don‘t care if you find my reasoning dumb, but because of moral reasons I‘m not sure if I want to continue the Azure or even the cloud computing path. The current state of the united states really makes me *not* want to generate income for an american company.

But the problem then is: what else should I do?
I feel like I‘d want to go into something more creative again. I really enjoyed scripting automation code in PowerShell when I was still an apprentice in my old firm. It wasn‘t anything huge and I don‘t want to start a debate, whether PowerShell is suited for that, but I enjoyed just deep diving into a problem and hyperfocusing on it.
My current work is much more consulting and it‘s too stressful for me.

I also discovered a bit of a linux and open source passion in general. You could say I went from Microsoft fangirl to open source and Linux lover.

1k9vcbs,Options for those not good enough for engineering?,"Basically, the title says it all. 
I'm 21 and studied electrical engineering for three years at a good university, with the goal of pursuing a career in finance. My country (Brazil) is largely deindustrialized, but engineers are highly sought after in fields like finance, administration, sales, and other corporate roles.

However, after failing 5-6 classes, I dropped from the middle to the bottom of the bottom quartile academically, and at this rate, it would take me 7 years to graduate instead of 5. It really hurt to watch my friends pass with relative ease, while I was putting in so much effort just to keep up. 

My family is full of doctors, lawyers, and engineers who were really excited when I got into university, but I just can't seem to make it.I've also struggled with depression for years, which has impaired my thinking to the point where I couldn't even complete a simple task in Excel. 

Things got so bad that I eventually saw a neuropsychologist some years ago. By the end of high school, my grades had worsened due to 'brain fog.' They told me my IQ was 118, which is reasonably good, but apparently, it takes much more to become an engineer.

Now, I’m considering switching to a less demanding major, such as production engineering, economics, or even computer science, at an ""easier""  yet still reputable university. I’ve taken some programming classes, and while I wasn’t the best and can’t handle advanced tasks like data engineering, I believe I could manage. I’d always wanted to live in a different country or at least another state, so this path might be the way to go. The job market isn’t great, but I feel that a career in these fields could improve my quality of life, especially since many corporate roles are increasingly requiring programming skills. My city is too expensive and unsafe.

I'm basically just venting but if anyone here had a similar experience or has some advice I'd like to hear

1k9ud6t,I desperately need to get out of sales but don't know how,"Willing to bet there's many with a similar story- I graduated 3 years ago and immediately took a sales job within the industry of my degree. I've always been pretty far on the introverted end of the social spectrum and never expected myself to grind out a sales roll, but after countless applications it was the only one that stuck close to graduation and I was eager to get into the workforce, and ready to challenge myself (and sold by the prospect of making a ton of money...) 

As one might expect, the gig was a total fresh-graduate churn and burn. I realized right away, but I truly had a passion for the industry, met some great people, and stuck it out for 2.5 years. 

I did pretty well in those 2.5 years- came out the gate swinging and set up a substantial amount of new business, but it wasn't enough. Without getting into much detail, this was an incredibly brutally market-driven industry with a ton of volatility and the things that were netting me good profits went stale pretty quickly and before any substantial commissions could hit my checks, I started to go negative around the 1.5 year mark. For reference, about 80% of new hires at this company do not last past 1 year and I'd imagine even less are able to eventually ""make it"". 

After over 2 years of grinding it out on the 30k base salary (I know...) and telling myself the commission will come eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and got a lay up from my direct boss for an admin roll that paid 50k, which is still barely enough to break even in my area and certainly not enough to make up for the amount of debt I put myself in to pay rent and keep the dream alive the prior years. So I took the move upstairs as a paid interview period and hit the job boards (around 7 months ago). 

  
As we all know, this market SUCKS. Hundreds of applications only to get to the end of 2 interview sequences that felt great but didn't work out, until about 2 months ago when a buddy at another company in town told me they were hiring another sales guy. I truly had no desire to go back to sales but desperation once again got the best of me and I applied- within two weeks I was hired.

  
Now we're here- I took a leap back into sales in a WILDLY different industry and since day 1 have regretted every second of it. It's a totally different realm of sales, with an incredibly vague product being offered, and VERY little direction from anyone above. I've dove right back in and have been trying to get back on the saddle grinding the way I used to, but after quite a few bad experiences already I've made up my mind that this isn't what I want and I'm incredibly bitter at myself for thinking I could tackle it again. Still at 50k base, we'll see if I can scrape up enough business to get some sort of bonus but it's not looking hot and I can tell management already has a question mark above my head 2 months in with essentially nothing to show for it.

At this point I'm realizing this may have been more of a vent post, apologies for the wall of text. It's just brutal out there and I've never felt so lost.

  
Where can I go? What can I do? What jobs should I be applying to that AREN'T sales when all I have is weak sales experience? This is sales and I'm on a timer.

1k9szim,Marketing or Strategy?,"Hi all. I come with 9 years of professional experience. 5 years with consulting (MBB) and 4 years in 2 corporate strategy roles. All across big MNCs. 

As I’m hardworking and smart, I have excelled in all roles. Recently, I was offered a shift to marketing as recognition of my talent and with vision to develop me for future leadership roles. The transition to marketing is a step down as I reported directly to the CEO in my last corporate strategy role but here I report to a middle manager. 

Just after 6 months of shifting, an international role came up in Strategy & Business Development. This role would entail working with different countries to drive strategic priorities. 
I have been selected for this new role but I’m afraid this role will just translate to making good PPTs and documents and not really OWNING or driving from the front seat.

I do lack hardcore commercial experience and that is the reason why i had taken up the marketing role in first place . I’m now extremely confused on what I should do. 

I have listed the pros and cons. PS. My long term goal is to become a business leader - owning P&L of a country. 

International strategy role:
PROS: 1. High visibility, 2. Global market exposure, 3. Access to senior leaders 

CONS: 1. Shift to a new country - husband’s job could become a road blocker, 2. No core commercial experience, 3. May set myself up for failure in future 

Local Marketing role: 
PROS: 1. Adds depth to my profile, 2. Next steps are clear (can grow vertically or take a sales role), 3. Already recognised as talent in local country hence strong leadership support 

CONS: 1. Low hierarchy role, 2. No clarity how long I’ve to do this role to move up the ladder, 3. New reporting manager is insecure of me (but I don’t really care about it) ",Spiritual-007,1,1.0,1,1745838912,2025-04-28 11:15:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9szim/marketing_or_strategy/,4,2025
1k9sxhv,"Re-starting career, advice needed.","Hi everyone. I (26F) am currently job hunting and having trouble getting past the application process to actually get interviews. I know the job market is not great rn but unfortunately I don’t have unlimited time to wait around to get a job.    

For context, I started my career fresh out of college in advertising as an account person at a large agency. Some life circumstances affected my happiness and performance and made me miserable and I quit my job after around a year and a half. In hindsight my main happiness problem was my narcissistic ex but at the time I was very overwhelmed (and didn’t really like my manager) so I ended up leaving the job and then afterwards the man. I didn’t feel confident in my place at said job to try to go back after the breakup and I was just mentally exhausted and needed a reset.   

After a break for the summer; my father pulled me into his business to help out “temporarily” with administrative and financial work. One thing led to another and I ended up doing all of the billing of the business and was in no position to drop everything and chase my own career plans. It took me over a year to find a halfway decent person to take over the billing.    

Now, due to health issues, my father has stopped working. Which has left my family in a lurch because he is the breadwinner. My work in the business is useless without him making any output. So I need a job, and very soon. I studied marketing and communications (public relations), and have my stint in the advertising industry. I don’t love agency work, but am willing to stomach it for a couple of years to make it through life and to a more balanced industry. 

I also need a position that is mostly remote because I cannot leave my family at present time due to my father’s illness. Which adds a level of difficulty since everything is hybrid now and I live in a small state with no corporate hq’s or anything related to my degree. 

I know I would be great at project management roles or brand marketing roles but I am having hard luck making it to the interview level. I recently got rejected from a position at Ulta corporate that I _know_ I would have crushed. Trying not to lose hope, but very difficult not to when all I’m getting is either rejections or ghosted. If anyone has any advice regarding my situation I would love to learn from y’all’s experience. 



tl;dr: needing advice on how to quickly land a position in marketing/project management roles, preferably remote due to family circumstances. I have been away from marketing for the past 3 years now.

1k9sbtp,My boss is ignoring my time off requests and ignores me when I try and talk to him,"Basically, I work part time just now because I study at university, I’m due to go back to working full time now that uni is done for the year then I’ll go back part time mid September - he agreed to this a year ago.

During this time I’ve had various issues. After Christmas he told me I was to work full time and that I wasn’t contracted my part time hours unlike last year. He told me he was really unhappy with me and my lack of commitment to work when he was the one last year encouraging me to go back and study as I would benefit him more being qualified. He told me I would be ‘here till 5pm whether I like it or not’ when I was supposed to finish at 2pm bearing in mind people were continuously phoning in sick and I had offered to work some of my days off when I was supposed to be at university. 

I never phone in sick. One day I offered to do overtime for him again I was supposed to finish at 2pm but I stayed late. Come 4pm I was really sick as I just had braces put in the day before. I asked if I could leave and he said ‘if you’re claiming to be sick I can’t stop you but I’m really unhappy with this situation, you’re giving other people double work.’ When really this was me helping with overtime.

Fast forward a few months he eventually realised I was not contracted full time hours after trying to explain this to him so many times where he said ‘I don’t have time to deal with your problems’ - it would have been solved if he just let me work the hours we agreed.

My car has completely broken down and it’s taking me 2h to travel to work on public transport and 2h back. I phoned him to let him know and he said he appreciated me keeping him updated then asked how things will go moving forward. I explained it’s going to be a week and a half, I’ve travelled to work 3 days now on public transport. 

I’ve asked him last week if I can have 2 days holiday off to allow me a break and so that I can pick my car up from the garage on Friday because I can’t work to 5 and travel down and pick up my car. He said ‘okay’ but I requested the holidays last week and he’s completely ignored them. He’s also ignored holidays I put in a month ago but on the system I can see he’s approved everyone else’s when they put them in roughly the same time.

I understand I am not entitled to holidays if it’s short notice or he needs me but to completely ignore them I feel is unfair. One thing that stuck in my head was when I was going through a bad time family wise (not his problem I know) he told me I wasn’t offering to help out more and he said ‘why can’t you be more like (my co-worker) she goes above and beyond for me, you don’t. I would struggle to have anything nice to say to you if you wanted a reference’ and that’s stuck with me. 

I know it’s probably time to leave but while I’m going into my final year at university it will be a nightmare to find something else. I just don’t know how I’m going to bring this situation up to him at work because I need to know whether my holidays are going to be approved or not so I can make arrangements. I genuinely feel like he has an issue with me compared to other co-workers and everyone else has said the same. I don’t know if it’s because everyone else at work is 15+ years older than me but that shouldn’t be the case.

TL:DR how to deal with a boss who ignores you when you try and speak to him and is ignoring holiday requests as in not approving or declining them. I feel like he has an issue with me for some reason.

1k9rtyn,"Career Advice Needed: Offered 8 LPA at Deloitte Hyderabad, but Prefer NCR Location","Hi everyone,
I really need some honest advice from people who've been through tough career choices.

Here’s my situation:

I recently joined a new company in Noida at ₹6.2 LPA after switching from previous company (₹5 LPA earlier).

Around the same time, Deloitte contacted me. I interviewed and recently got shortlisted for an Associate role.

Now, Deloitte has offered me ₹8 LPA (for a 1-year contractual role) — but the role is for their Hyderabad location.

I’m based in Noida (Delhi NCR) and strongly prefer to stay here because of personal reasons (family, cost, stability, etc.).

HR mentioned ₹40k relocation assistance, but no major joining bonus has been discussed yet.

Most Deloitte work happens over Teams calls anyway, and my first-round interviewer even said Gurgaon (NCR) could be possible.


My concerns are:

I really want to join Deloitte because it’s a Big 4 company — it would be a huge addition to my CV and help my career long-term.

The ₹8 LPA offer is good compared to my current ₹6.2 LPA, and honestly, it would save me almost a year of struggle if I stayed in Noida trying to get that hike elsewhere.

However, relocating to Hyderabad for a 1-year contract feels like a big decision, especially when a remote/hybrid NCR option could be possible.


What I need advice on:

How should I politely but firmly request my base location to be changed to Noida/Gurgaon while still sounding positive and professional?

If they insist on Hyderabad, is it worth relocating for Deloitte brand value alone for just a ₹8 LPA role?

What points should I confirm with HR before proceeding (like shift timings, in-hand salary, relocation support details, future growth opportunities, etc.)?


I’ve been thinking about this all day and all week.
Would love to hear your strategies, experiences, or any practical advice.

Thanks a lot in advance!",Particular-Honey-701,2,1.0,0,1745834490,2025-04-28 10:01:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9rtyn/career_advice_needed_offered_8_lpa_at_deloitte/,4,2025

Recently, I interviewed for a US startup. The money was good, but honestly, I don't care much about the salary — I just really, really want to learn and build cool things. The thing is, I feel like there’s an ever-evolving wall in front of me, even as a fresher.

During the interview, I was asked to solve two system design problems and had a LeetCode round that turned out to be more like a frontend interview. And I kept asking myself — how much more do I have to learn just to get my first job? I understand that learning never stops, especially after getting a job, but as a fresher, it feels overwhelming. No matter how much I learn, it still doesn't feel like enough.

The worst part is that my enthusiasm for tech — something I've always loved — is slowly fading. And the scarier part is... this is the only career I genuinely love. I don't know what to do anymore besides this.

The company wanted someone with fullstack knowledge + DevOps + AI + Cloud

It seems like a lot and tbh idk how many more tech stacks do i need to learn just to get that entry level role

Does every entry level guy have fullstack + DevOps + AI knowledge these days?

Or am i not learning enough?

1k9qz7b,"I need Career Advice, I am lost. (Django & Devops)","I am 23 yrs old. My ""serious"" IT journey started with Python Django backend development. I started learning Django 7 months ago. I practiced day and night and I learnt Django, Django REST Framework, Celery, Celerybeat, Redis, Elastic Search, Kafka, Django Channels, both HTTP and WebSocket connections for backend web development. I also made many projects and uploaded on github for each of these tools and combined. My target has always been remote job because pay is very less in my country. Then, I started applying for remote internships, I couldnot find much opportunities for Django at that time. 1 Indian guy approached me, made me work for 10hrs daily for 1 month and didn't pay me. He scammed me and I have a trauma because of that headache work experience. Then, after not finding much opportunities in Django, I found out about Devops and found out that it also paid more. Tbh, I wanna be rich haha. Then, I started learning Devops, 3 months ago. Again, I fully dedicated myself day and night. I learnt AWS, CI/CD using Jenkins, Github Actions, Terraform, Ansible, Jira, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus and Graphana. I also did 6-7 projects, individual tool and combined. But, I don't know, I haven't developed confidence. Each project's mechanism to deploy might be different and I think I will waste client's money while I experiment. 

So, what should I do now? I have also forgotten many things about Django now. I will have to revise everything again and I don't know how much I know about Devops as well. Should I go back to Django? Should I do more projects on Devops and stick to it? Should I learn a more secure option like NodeJS and stick to it? 

I feel like I forgot everything that I ever learnt. But it's alright, I am willing to start again from the zero.

Note: Only internship/work experience I have is of 1 month where I got scammed after working 8-10hrs non-stop. And, I want to do remote job with my skills.

1k9qwke,"At a crossroads, and needing to make a fast decision: Activism, social work and nursing","It's going to be messy, but please bear with me.

I'm at a strange career crossroads. For the record, I'm 36M, have a B.A in a completely unrelated field (media/design). I had pretty random career path in my 20's, which somehow boiled down to always hovering around vaguely healthcare-adjacent fields (lab tech, medical information systems, etc), but nothing too specific - before equally randomly landing a paid role in as a program manager in a human rights org. I absolutely loved the job, and proceeded to continue working in the field for some years. However, I started running into a glass ceiling issue, where 99% of the roles I'm interested in require a degree in social work.

This is admittedly something I take a lot of issues with it (not just because it's annoying for me), and think it's an actual problem. But regardless of my opinion of it, this is how the industry currently works. Plus, social workers are always in high demand where I live, so it might be a good way to ensure an easier time finding work.

I recently got laid off from a job. So while I do have a few possible leads for a new role, I took the opportunity and applied to a masters program in social work (for people with an unrelated undergrad degree). My odds of being accepted are not amazing, but not zero either. I figured I'll continue looking for a job, and if I get accepted to the program, I'll quit when the semester starts. It is an expensive, demanding program and a 3-years commitment (which is a heavy load at the moment), but if I make it - a masters in social work will allow me to get into management roles in a field I love.

HERE IS THE TWIST.

Last week, I was offered to sign up to a different program, which trains people with unrelated degrees - in nursing. Completely for free. 

If you recall from the beginning of the post - I hovered around healthcare related roles for years (hell, I recently also ran a community clinic project, managing a team of nurses...), and while I'm not as passionate about it, it's definitely within my general area of interest. Nursing is also always in demand, so there's that. 

It's about as demanding as the M.SW program - but it's not a masters degree. So while graduating the M.SW program will position me for management roles, this one will not. Expected pay range will likely be more or less the same.

WHERE IS THE CATCH?

The nursing program STARTS in June. If I want to take it, I have to sign up before knowing if I got accepted to the M.SW program. And it means I need to drop the roles I'm currently interviewing for.

I hate making big decisions without having all of the information, but I have to make it fast.

1k9pgy1,"Why you shouldn't pursue graphic design in 2025 and if you really want to pursue design, read this.","Just talked to someone about creating a video, I had hired him as a video editor 1–2 years ago.

Now, he has shifted to UI/UX design, social media post design, and all that.

Honestly, I felt bad after hearing this.

Don't fall for money. Sometimes those initial $$ can create silly biases in you.

As a freelancer, it’s easy to get distracted from your original craft. You position yourself as a video editor, but someone approaches you for social media post designs, and you start doing that instead.

This especially happens with Indian freelancers. Everyone in the world knows you’ll work for them at very cheap rates.

There’s nothing wrong with taking that work but at least have the guts to pass it to someone else and make 20–30% commission only.

Don’t start doing anything that has no future just for a little money.

I shared a story with him about how one of my friends told me they had to fire 25 designers from their agency because of low demand. Whatever work was coming in, the remaining 3-4 designers could easily handle it. But he was in denial.

Now I'm going to say something HARSH sorry if you feel bad after listening to this.

No one absolutely no one truly enjoys designing random social media posts or just doing basic UI/UX forever.

If you are truly a designer at heart if you breathe design day and night then someday, you’ll move towards designing real, physical products.

Designing rockets is any day more exciting than designing Instagram posts.

* Any kind of real strategic decision making. I get to debate over what gets prioritised and done first, but I'm not too involved in the ideation process itself.
* Look at user data and do any sort of analysis. Though i have access to the data, It's hard to find time to even look at it. Forget any analysis. I feel like most days i'm just running around firefighting with the dev team.

I feel like my current role isn't doing justice to my job title (or is it?). When i wanted to move to product, the second section (I DON'T dos) is what i imagined i'd be learning to do and growing into. Its been 2 years since I put down my developer hat and I'm not really keen on putting it back on. I really want to switch jobs because i don't see my role here changing anytime soon (and I see a down-sizing coming). I want some opinion on 

* What kind of jobs should i be applying for? Engineering manager maybe?  
* Will I be able to get a Product management job with my experience? Almost all job listings i see ask for 4/5+ years of management experience. 
* Do I have to forget everything and start at an entry level management job and go from there? 

What would you do in my Position. Please advice. ",ungaya,1,1.0,0,1745822991,2025-04-28 06:49:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9p9gk/need_some_career_advice_please/,4,2025
1k9p45o,Want to quit job and move back to home country for a while..,"I have been working at a job that does not suit my personality and do not want to progress in at sales. I make good money and have a lot of good benefits but feel extremely burnt out where and feel like my life is not progressing how I want to (due to many factors feel depressed and have been neglecting my health) and feel the urge to move back to my home country be with my parents and figure out the next step. I have savings and my parents would love to have me back for a while. Moreover, I do have an occupation I can go back to if I really can't find another job (which is a lot more draining and pays less but can eventually be a lifelong career). 

There was a reason why I left to live abroad, but it seems like my life here is static and back home there are more opportunities that align with my values in terms of dating and culture. And because I have dual citizenship I can move back abroad, however, it will still be hard to pack up and leave and then have to restart the process of job hunting etc. but I do have a safety blanket which are my parents and enough savings.

  
Not really sure what to do and perhaps some of you have insight. was thinking of staying at this role for another 5-6 months while I figure out the next step and save up a bit more. I feel like I just need air for a while and can't continue this sales rat race at the moment and need to just breathe for a few months

1k9oorf,Hate my current role. Recently received a job offer with another company but hesitant to accept due to cons. Any advice?,"Hi all, I recently received a job offer for an administrative role that I recently interviewed for. This role is an in person role that would require an hour long commute each way, and a pay cut from $55,000 to $52,000. 

Ive been with my current company for just about a year. I’m working a primary customer service based role that I’ve found pretty stressful occasionally. The company is also a late stage start up, the first I’ve ever worked for, and there’s been many growing pains with having to work through a lot of gray area situations. Despite these pain points, my current role does offer pretty decent benefits, and it’s a WFH role and pays more than the job I’ve been offered.

I think I’d be less hesitant if the commute wasn’t so significant or if there was no pay cut on top of it. And while not all days are bad days in my current role, the bad ones are often enough to just make me want to quit on the spot.

Hoping to get some insight in opinions on what to do in this situation. Should I stay in my current role and just keep applying until I find something that is more ideal? And should I leave my current headache of a role for a new opportunity?

1k9nxnv,"I’m an early career, thinking of quitting my first job without another immediately in the pipeline","Hey, I’m 24, in my first full-time corporate role. I’ve been at my company for about 9 months, and I work at a consultancy.

The job itself isn’t abusive, but the nature of the work and internal expectations feel increasingly misaligned with my strengths and values. I also despise like my current project, and I’m just not a good fit in the ‘company culture’ which rewards over exertion and deep involvement beyond the scope of job expectation. 

I’m already experiencing signs of burnout and chronic anxiety, and I know that staying here purely for stability could trap me for years and deteriorate my mental health further. Also, career progression is pretty much non-existent at this consultancy (I’ll be eligible for a promotion  after 2 years, but that’s just eligibility, this consultancy over hires like crazy, some do not get promoted until 4 years here, and it already pays below the average for my role )

Here’s my situation. I live at home, low living costs, no dependents. If I save aggressively over the next few months, I can build a ~£3,000 cushion. I plan to finish my Master’s degree by this summer, which will give me more leverage as a ‘recent graduate’ and also explain to potential employers why I left my job early. I could defo take on part-time l work after quitting to extend my runway. I don’t care if it’s minimum wage. Not bothered by titles. I am not delusionally expecting immediate success. I’d treat job hunting, skill-building, and rebuilding as my full-time work for the following 6–12 months.

Ultimately, staying in this environment feels like an even greater risk long-term.

If you were in my position, would you stay longer to avoid resume gaps and perceived instability? Or would you plan a clean exit now while you still have energy, savings potential, etc? 

Oh, another thing. When I signed on, I received a bonus. The bonus was paid out in two instalment, £5,000 after the first year, and another £5,000 after the second year, making £10,000 total. If I leave early, the repayment structure is weird. for the first £5,000, I would need to repay 1/12th of it for each month I didn’t complete in the initial 12 month obligation. But for the second £5,000, it’s different, and this is where they catch us graduates 😅 rather than repaying just the second installment, I would be repaying against the full £10,000, based on how many months I fall short of completing the full 24 month period. I do NOT see myself here for two years. 

TLDR: if I leave before September 2025 (before my first year is done), I would owe very little. If I stay beyond that point but leave before September 2026, I would owe a significant chunk of money back, depending on how many months are left.

So if I want to leave cleanly without owing anything, I’d need to exit within the next few months, which is also part of why I’m seriously considering making a move now.",CheapIndependence844,1,1.0,2,1745817519,2025-04-28 05:18:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9nxnv/im_an_early_career_thinking_of_quitting_my_first/,4,2025

I have a reasonable accommodation due to complex health conditions. So I’ve been teleworking for 4 yrs. Even w/o my RA, my job is 100% online. 

I was recently forced back into the office. My job (the higher ups of my customer) rescinded my reasonable accommodation. I tried negotiating hybrid work, got more doctor letters, even asked for different accommodations at work… they denied all of them. 

As a result, I now take PTO weekly. I used to NEVER take PTO. I was never late to work, etc. Now it’s getting to a point where I’m missing over 8-15hrs of work a week. 

I’m still getting my work done, but it’s embarrassing and I feel terrible. It’s all because I have medical problems that I need to go home to manage. 

Should I email my customer lead and be honest with them that I’m missing so much work due to health issues from my reasonable accommodation being rescinded? The organization is very large, so I’m not sure they’re aware of it. But I don’t want them to think I’m suddenly skipping out on work. But I don’t know how much to disclose in a customer relationship.

1k9mnu0,Double promotion for internal overseas relocation - doable?,"Hi guys, I am working as an entry level engineer 2.5 years now and another 2 years of unrelated experience as well.  I have a related master\`s degree from a good university. I live in Japan and I moved to Japan from another country in 2018. 

Right now I am on three-month business trip to customer site in US, where I met customers and my company\`s field service engineers. In the last winter, I did another three-month business trip another US state, to my potential new location. In the new location there was a lot of job to do, but only one engineer. During my stay I did well and we really clicked senior engineer there. This week, him and my manager made me an offer to relocate. I did not tell them yes or no and we will negotiate when I return Japan. I was told my manager, his manager and his manager are aligned on this idea. If we agree, I will relocate end of this year. 

Why I think I can pull double promotion is, there is a big project starting in the new location and I know this project. I also know all other existing big projects in new location well since I worked both Japanese and US part of this work, joined most meetings and saw it on customer site. Other thing is, I need no training. I am good to work independently from day 1. 

This is a tech company and CEO has announced that company will stop hires and focus on training the existing engineers very recently. Internally there is no alternative engineer to assign this position. 

I am neither Japanese nor American so relocating does not matter much. To mention, my request for promotion is denied recently and I am not going to get any promotion until next April. I feel like I should be already in the next level, and I think it is reasonable to request another promotion for relocating. 

Problem is, there is \`years of experience\` required for the target position. I am afraid this may be an obstacle during negotiations. Do you know how serious are corporate requirements when it comes to internal relocations? 

I am also open for every strategy request for negotiating this. Thanks! ",Miserable-Stomach198,2,1.0,2,1745812827,2025-04-28 04:00:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9mnu0/double_promotion_for_internal_overseas_relocation/,4,2025
1k9mjaq,Did I make the right choice? Advice appreciated.,"Hi everyone,
I could really use some advice as I’m feeling a bit uncertain about a career decision I recently made.

I'm a licensed engineer with around 5 years of experience in manufacturing, and I recently finished my master’s degree related to environmental and chemical engineering. After graduating, I was offered two very different paths:

Option 1 – Research Role (Current Job):

Research staff position under a government-funded project on clean energy and sustainability

Salary is decent but not always released on time

Long daily commute

Work is directly related to my field and could help me build international opportunities later


Option 2 – Teaching Role (Turned Down):

Senior high school teaching position at a private university

More stable, slightly higher salary

Very short commute

Heavy teaching load, and not directly related to my technical field



---

My goal:

I eventually want to work abroad, preferably in industries related to energy, environment, or sustainability.



---

Now I'm wondering:

Did I make the right choice picking the research role, even if it’s harder financially and logistically right now?

Should I stick with this and be patient, or are there things I should be doing now to make sure I’m not wasting time?

Would love to hear from anyone who's been in a similar situation or has experience balancing short-term challenges and long-term goals.


Any advice or perspective would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!

1k9l6jh,Need advice on pitching an idea for the corporate bank I work for,"Hi everyone! This might not be the best forum, but I am a project manager at a Fortune 500 bank and currently pursuing my MBA (we love tuition reimbursement programs!). I've always been passionate about starting my own social venture, especially after taking entrepreneurship and nonprofit management courses during my undergrad. This semester, I received a fellowship to pursue a social venture, and I'm excited to take the next steps after meeting with folks in the community and local nonprofit sector. My venture focuses on providing intimate partner violence / financial abuse survivors with extensive financial counseling tailored to their needs. The goal is to empower women's financial and economic independence, helping them rebuild their lives and achieve stability. After doing considerable customer discovery over the past few months, I initially planned to pitch my idea to foundations, private donors, and other nonprofits in the local region. However, during a discussion with someone in the nonprofit sector, they suggested leveraging my position within the bank to pitch my idea internally. Given the bank's need for a positive brand image and my role as a female professional in the banking space, it seems like a win-win opportunity. I believe this venture can make a significant impact, and I'm eager to pitch it to the corporation I work for as they have been very open to employee feedback on how to better run the business and support the community. However, I'm unsure about the best approach to present my idea effectively and gain support without potentially losing my job due to conflicts of interest.I would love to hear your advice on:

1. How to structure my pitch to highlight the benefits for the corporation and the community without insinuating I have considered pursuing this venture externally.
2. Key points to emphasize to make my idea compelling.
3. Any tips on engaging stakeholders and addressing potential concerns.

1k9ia6y,I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get fired from my job.,"Throwaway for privacy reasons

I (25 M) am currently working at a call center for ATT as part of their retention department. You know, those guys you call up to cancel your phone lines? Yeah, that's me. I am currently am struggling with this job because to be honest, it's changed way too much for me to actually recognize the work. the actual work itself hasn't changed at all, but goals/incentives have changed way drastically, sales was originally 20% of my goals and now, it's 50%. i signed up for the job originally as i figured it was focused on just doing simple billing assistance/tech support, judging by what the position is described, which i treat it as that to help people with high costs or troubleshooting phones, but I'm now getting screwed over thanks to this new goal plan where i need to basically push hard on selling people new phone lines (not upgrades). I have met with my manager several times this month already where we reviewed calls and i keep missing marks and opportunities to push sales, as well as not asking 20 questions with the customer to open those opportunities to convince people why they should buy a whole phone and number, just because. I am expecting this week to meet with my manager again, get told i missed opportunities again, and then get put on a final written warning.  
I realize, that for some, this would be easy or straightforward, but i am not a sales person whatsoever and i never anticipated that this job was that. a sales position. it's real annoying. I can forgive the angry customers, i can accept that i need to be on the phones for 8 hours for the week, but even with pays and bonuses as motivation, it's just so much when you have a manager spamming in an automated message every hour, every day, to make sales and even personally DMs you about why have you not made a sale for the day yet. the constant harassment of sales is exhausting. as much as i want to leave this job, i just don't have any other work lined up behind this one and struggling to figure out what to do, since the pay is really well and will be a major hard adjust. i used to work seasonally at an amazon warehouse, then when this opportunity popped up for me, i just quit on my phone and popped up at ATT. Now i wish i was back at the warehouse since that's more tolerable and only just physically exhausting, since the hours were fine for me.  
All this to say, I'm trying my best to keep working and hold this job for as long as possible, but considering how my performances are looking like and sales are coming up dry or i just rather focus on helping people, it looks like i may not last for much longer. even with my marketing degree, finding work is still rough. I'm honestly just hoping amazon opens up something for me around where i live so i can just be certain I'll have a backup ready for me when the inevitable comes.

1k9gy1g,Approaching 50 and unhappy with my career,"Very long story short, I'm 47M, and I've worked in social services for the state for the last decade. I'm burning out on it, there's fear over funding lapses eliminating my job, and the pay is ok but not enough to ever get ahead in the part of the country I live. I feel like I settled for this line of work because it was what I could get with a public policy degree when I graduated in my 30s that had decent pay and good benefits. 

Now I'm at a crossroads.  I have a deep sense of dissatisfaction, I don't feel like I'm really doing anything to help anyone or make a difference (which is part of the reason I applied for this job), and now a major life event has changed everything for my wife and I. She lost her high-paying job very unexpectedly and we may have to relocate. This has made me:

1) Re-evaluate my dreams, goals, and what I want my (our) life to be. I have gotten very complacent in my job and life and now it's time to shift gears.

2) Realize I have no marketable skills besides writing (I write reports for my job - and I'm very good at it).

3) Research other jobs in similar fields in other parts of the country. It is going to be very difficult for me to find another job and make what I do now with the skills I currently have. 

4) Realize I'm too old to consider going back to school (and I have $70K in student loan debt that I was planning on having discharged via PSLF in the next couple of years - and that's now uncertain!). I feel like the door has closed on many career options that I could have chosen a decade ago based simply on my age.

I'm scrambling to figure out what's next, what I can do, and where I can go. I am willing to learn new skills and would like something more for my life.  So my question is what skills I could or should learn right now that could increase my earning potential in my 50s and 60s without a heavy investment in school? 

Yes, I worry about age discrimination and saddling myself with more debt, lost time, and lost earnings if I did go back to school. If I do continue in social services, I want to get some sort of side hustle or learn a skill that is going to generate some extra income and maybe I could transition to full-time in a few years. Anyone have any advice or ideas? Thanks for reading.

1k9fcog,"Navigating a ""Temporary"" Career Change?","\[cross-post from r/humanresources\]

For any working professionals who made ""temporary"" career changes, whether because of financial and/or economic circumstance, what was your experience? How did you bounce back to your original field, or did your ""temporary"" change become permanent?

I have about 5 years of HR Operations experience and hold a PHR certification. I earned my BA in Sociology in 2016 in just 2.5 years, but graduating early made starting my career challenging. I worked my way up through unpaid internships, temp roles, and several HR Coordinator positions.

Most recently, I was an HR Operations Coordinator for 2.5 years, handling onboarding/offboarding, benefits administration, recognition programs, and HRIS management. I was let go in April last year and had been aiming to grow into an HR Generalist role, with a long-term interest in specializing in compensation.

After being let go, I took some time off, but I started to apply and interview pretty aggressively from November through February. I interviewed for numerous HR Operations roles, and it was eye-opening that every role I interviewed for offered greater compensation than my last job.

I accepted a role in Business Operations this past March for a small start-up of \~30 employees. I initially interviewed for an HR role, but due to shifting business needs, the hiring manager hired someone else in HR, and offered me this role instead. The hiring team appreciated my background in HR operations and PHR certification; however, this role's duties presently focuses on office management and executive assistance. Given that I was approaching nearly a year of unemployment, and this was my first offer, I decided to accept.

I recognize there's a lot of overlap and transferable skills between HR and Business Operations, but that does not mean the two fields are the same. For some reasons why I've taken on this role:

* As mentioned, this was the first place that gave me an offer. I was reaching almost a year of unemployment. Financially, it is relieving to have income and slowly restore my savings again.
* Interviewing was becoming emotionally exhausting, and I had the ""rare"" problem where I sometimes had interviews with different companies stacked on the same day. Still, they all ended up in rejections.
* I am still making more money than my last job, with greater work-life balance (so far), and less pressure and stress. I don't take that for granted.
* I have only ever been part of HR teams. I always felt spending some time gaining experience/exposure in a non-HR role, to be a customer of HR, would later on make me a better HR professional.

For a while, I was fearful I would ""stagnate"" my HR career by taking on this job, but I ultimately convinced myself that professionally and financially, this was the best choice to make.

I've only been at this job for a bit more than a month, and I think I'm doing fine so far! I'm more grateful to have a job than not, regardless of the field. However, I am still working on my PHR re-certification credits today, and I want to be mindful of a path forward for my career.",Travant,1,1.0,0,1745790197,2025-04-27 21:43:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9fcog/navigating_a_temporary_career_change/,4,2025

It's being highlighted as crucial not just for professional success, but for personal fulfillment and navigating the world effectively. Essentially, EQ is about recognizing and understanding your own emotions, as well as those of others 🤔.
In a world facing rapid change and the growth of AI, uniquely human skills like empathy, communication, and collaboration are becoming increasingly valuable. 📈These essential abilities are rooted in high emotional intelligence. EQ helps you manage stress, build stronger relationships, and understand yourself better.
The great news is that EQ is a skill you can definitely improve! 💪 It involves practices like increasing your self-awareness about your feelings, learning to manage your reactions constructively, and paying attention to others to understand their perspectives. Focusing on these areas can significantly enhance your connections and overall well-being in 2025. 🚀",zencirmentorcom,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1745785012,2025-04-27 20:16:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9ddc2/focus_for_2025_emotional_intelligence_eq/,4,2025
1k9cnsb,Which degree to pick based on my desired career description?,"TL;DR Torn between Accounting and Finance (A&F) at LSE and the PwC Flying Start degree at UoM. Long-term goal is to maximize earnings while still having a respectable work-life balance. In a perfect world I’d want my life to look something like this: £100k+ salary, 2 kids (able to put them through private school), nice house, nice car, perhaps living abroad, or at least able to go on a few nice holidays per year. (I understand this is very aspirational)


Some background on the PwC flying start course at Manchester: So whilst it’s not a traditional degree apprenticeship you do still get benefits. It’s a 4 year course, first year is normal uni, years 2, 3, and 4 include 1 term worth of paid work placement with PwC in which you get the option to work in audit, asset & wealth management, banking & capital markets or insurance at any of the PwC offices across the UK (granted, some offices only offer certain roles, and some roles are more competitive to get into) I believe they also pay for your accommodation whilst you are at these placements. In addition to this you will get a 2.5k/year scholarship for years 2, 3, and 4 at uni, and if u perform well you get a job at the end of the degree. Lastly, you will have completed 12/15 exams to become an ICAEW chartered accountant.

With LSE A&F I am less knowledgeable on the degree itself but it is a 3 year course without any work placements and of course you have the LSE name when applying to jobs. This is where LSE seems like it could be a better choice as the degree you get from the flying start programme is a BSc in Business Accounting which seems to be more narrow/limiting than a BSc in A&F. The downsides obviously being that living in London whilst at uni will be more expensive, and you get none of the financial benefits that come from PwC.

See the TL;DR for my ideal life goals, I’d really appreciate any advice on what careers could allow me to achieve this, which degree I should choose to get into said career, and what steps I should take during university (e.g. which placement to go into at PwC, any spring weeks/internships I should be applying to)",RabidFax,1,1.0,0,1745783190,2025-04-27 19:46:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9cnsb/which_degree_to_pick_based_on_my_desired_career/,4,2025

1k9bn0x,Is this normal?,"So…I work for a huge organisation that’s known worldwide and it’s only me and 1 other co worker who has the same job within finance/compliance. I’ve always found this very weird for the size of the organisation but anyway.

One of our job roles is to submit subject access requests to customers when/if they ring in to other departments. Because we are finance/compliance we send them through, also not sure why that is because customer service should do this because we don’t have all the systems. Anyway. Sometimes customers may want call recordings sent to them via post on a USB. This is very rare but does happen around twice a year.

One request came in. I work remotely and had to go into the office to ask IT, the postal office and various departments if they stocked a USB. Nobody did as it’s quite an outdated thing nowadays. My managers made me leave the office and travel around the town, go on buses and taxi’s and find a fucking USB stick. I’m sorry for swearing but it was just ludicrous. I was gone for around 4 hours. No shop around the office had one. To make this worse I had to pay with my own money. I was running around like a headless chicken and I just thought why the F am I doing this. I literally felt taken the piss out of. Maybe i’m being dramatic? But surely my work place should be stocking USB’s and my manager should be making a conscious effort to stock them himself.

My manager has now said expense what I spent but I just think that’s just stupid. I shouldn’t have needed to pay any of my money on travel and the USB in the first place. I am 24 and everyone in my department are high up and around 50/60, lack a lot of empathy as they are high up and don’t have the best characteristics as they are quite pompous. I feel as though they think I’m young so they can sort of take the piss. I have a really good job for someone my age but again this isn’t what my job consists of doing.

I’m all for being a good employee but I just found this pathetic. It’s not my place to trape around town for 4 hours finding a USB stick that my manager or IT should stock themselves. This has made me super angry.

Now I don’t know if this is normal and i’m over reacting but I just don’t think it is? Something about it didn’t sit right with me at all. If you’re not stocking USB sticks yourself then why allow customers to request call recordings via USB and expect me to walk around, catch buses and taxis to find a bloody USB sticks.",queeniegirlxx,0,0.5,5,1745780565,2025-04-27 19:02:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k9bn0x/is_this_normal/,4,2025

1k99ejq,26M – feeling stuck between taking a decent job offer or holding out for what I actually want,"Hey all,
I’m a 26-year-old guy and feeling pretty lost. For the longest time, I tried to break into law – got my degrees, applied everywhere, kept pushing for about two years but it just wasn’t happening. Then I pivoted to compliance because it felt a bit more achievable. Gave that about seven months, still nothing.

Now I’m sitting here at 26, still trying to find an office job that pays decently, because I’m honestly tired of feeling like my life hasn’t even started properly yet.

Right now, I’m working part-time retail – 3 AM shifts, barely any overtime, low pay. It’s been killing me mentally and physically, and I really don’t want to stay in this situation much longer. I just want a stable office job and to actually start building my life.

I’ve been working on getting into tech sales recently – I like tech, and I’ve heard it can pay really well. Made a new LinkedIn, set up a proper CV, started applying. It’s only been about a month, so I know it’s early, but it’s frustrating when you just want to move forward already.

Here’s where I’m stuck:
A good friend of mine works in construction recruitment (American market) and said he can get me in right now. £25K base, plus commission for any hires. He said he’d work closely with me, show me exactly what to do, how to get hires, and how to actually make good money from it. So the support would be there.

But the thing is… construction recruitment doesn’t interest me much. Tech sales is what I actually want.
At the same time, I’m scared. What if I wait another year or two chasing tech sales and end up with nothing again?
If I take this recruitment job, I’d feel obligated to stick it out for at least a year, because I don’t want to screw over my friend who’s offering to help.

I’m torn between:
	•	Taking the job, making decent money, finally getting out of retail and starting to build momentum.
	•	Holding out for tech sales and risking being stuck in this retail job even longer.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation, or just has some advice, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

Last year I started this developer job with a BA in foreign languages and literatures basically because I needed to work (I took some coding courses), the job is fine, the people too - even though I'm starting to hate my team leader, the pay isn't actually that good. 
At the same time I'm also studying for my masters degree in the same field. 
I work from home except for a day a week, day in which I hate going to work, since everyone is older than me and they almost pretend I don't exist, like nobody talks to me, I only interact with my teammates which are from different parts of the country. (Plus there's almost no other girls)
Actually I feel very privileged when compared to my friends or people I know, but the thing is I've started to feel that what I do is completely useless. I don't really understand most of the things, my team leader doesn't bother with explaining functional stuff to me and pretends I know everything. While everyone knows about my background and the difficulties I may find, I feel I will never be good at this job since I don't have the actual qualifications like a computer science degree and such. I still have 2 years and a half like this and don't really know whether I want to do this anymore. The thing is I know any other field, expecially the one I'm graduated for, is either saturated or impossible to work in. Of course I can't wait but to talk to this with my therapist but I'd like to know if there's anyone in a situation similar to mine.

1k99age,Why working is so hard and thrlw reward is so little,"Companies nowadays take a lot of money at the top level. So owners and highest levels of management take a huge chunk of the profits. So if you go work for pizza hut they take 50 percent of the profits right off the bat. They don't need to. But they can so they do. If they only took 15 percent then every employee could get a 35 percent raise. And if you're talking about major companies that have stock, the owners and upper management have the majority of the stock. They could give a significant portion of the stock to the employees. 

They don't need to have most of it but they can have it so they do. And then couple that with the military industrial complex taxing us through inflation to pay for the endless wars and supporting wars abroad our money is worth half of what it was 20 years ago. So without these problems we could work at the same difficulty level as we do now and have 335 percent of the money we have now or work half as much and still have about 170 percent of what we do now. So we should currently be able to work 20 hours a week and make 170 percent of what we get when work 40. But because of lack of strength of unions and because of the military industrial complex we have to work twice as much for almost half the money. 

So if you're thinking man I'm busting my ass so hard and I have nothing to show for it then you're probably right. Sure we could all be tougher and work harder but we are also not being properly rewarded.

So we need to support unions, and start our own businesses and run them more fairly. If u just go try and put your nose to the grindstone for most companies you're gonna get screwed.

1k98gi7,Social anxiety and in a salesy role in my 4th language,"LONG POST

Hello everyone, I hope you are all good. Today I am writing to ask advice and also for others to share their experience if they relate and what did they do to change their situation. I am a 30(F) based in France working my second job in France which is more of a salesy role with a SaaS company in Sustainable Agriculture. I work in French & English both but French is my 4th language and It is not perfect to the native extent but it is almost B2 and I am almost independent. Staying in France is important for me as I am looking to apply for a French nationality, means I currently have a residence permit. 

I am someone who is really socially awkward. I have been trying to figure it out for a long time if it is because of the language barrier, if it is the role, the company culture or just that I am dumb. I come from an entirely different culture than the west. I come from a very small city in Punjab, Pakistan and hence I was raised very differently. I never had growing up opportunities to network much and I also naturally am a very anxious person in social situations. As long as I can remember, my first memory as a child, I have always been the quiet kid, sitting alone, not talking much and just observing things. This is how I grew up mostly. I have always felt 'different' than everyone else. I always wait for people to appraoch me to talk than me going to them to talk. Due to my circumstances, I have always got job roles which are really salesy and even though I try really hard to push myself, make alot of efforts, I always got to hear from my managers in France that I am not 'social' enough and I am not 'smiley' enough. I learnt the language on my own making minimum friends, I have three masters from three european countries in different disciplines. Trying to show that I am not dumb, I am someone who has always been a high achiever and I am intelligent.

However, in the jobs that I have been doing. I have always been criticized for not being the 'smiley', 'talkative', 'making jokes all the time', 'doing small talk' kind of person. I literally feel like I am going to die when I feel this pressure of talking to people, making cold phone calls, etc. I tried to take trainings, etc. to 'CHANGE' myself, to become a more social person. But honestly, after trying so much. I cannot seem to take the criticism anymore. In almost all of my professional experience, I have been somehow made to realise that I am a 'misfit' or being like myself is a 'loss'. this stresses me out as I know I have been trying so hard. But after all that thinking, I come to the realization that it is just not my kind of job. However, my situation right now doesn't allow me to quit and change careers. What would you suggest me ? How do I not feel this weird feeling as if somehow there is something wrong with me ? Please do share your experiences. 

Thank you for reading !! I hope you have a great day !",UnRemarkable_Bit5429,1,1.0,1,1745772521,2025-04-27 16:48:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k98gi7/social_anxiety_and_in_a_salesy_role_in_my_4th/,4,2025

I’m a third-year EE undergraduate from China, trying to make a major career decision.

Given the recent AI explosion and growing CS-related opportunities globally, I'm debating whether I should:

* Stay in EE and focus on AI-related applications (e.g., embedded AI, hardware acceleration), or
* Switch to CS, possibly through a master's degree, to fully engage with the software side.

I'd love to hear from those who have faced similar decisions, or who have observed industry trends:

* How sustainable is the EE job market compared to CS in the next 5-10 years?
* Would it be better to switch early (at undergraduate level) or during graduate studies?

I am 3 months from graduating an Industrial electrical apprenticeship. At this point I’ll have 4 years of experience doing electrical work on Cranes. 

I am looking to get into project management. As I said above my experience is in industrial maintenance. So I am thinking of getting into some sort of construction management. 

I am trying to decide between a few degree options, all of which I can get 100% online. 
- Bachelors of Applied Science, Technical and Industrial Workforce Management. 
- Bachelors of Business Administration, Management. (Slightly more expensive) 
- Bachelors of Business Administration, General Business. 

 Which of these degree options would help me best leverage myself into a Project Manager role? 

Also, will it matter if I don’t have the exact technical knowledge on the project I’m managing? I know a lot about motors, electrical control circuits, generators, etc. But I wouldn’t know the first thing about wiring up a McDonalds since McDonald’s has no need for a 480V generator.

One of the seniors was a bad hire, doesn't know much about actual financial statements. Then there's a Subject Matter Expert that I'm pretty sure would have been a Manager or higher at any other org I have ever worked. Then there's me... Two years of high performance ratings and back and forth on promo to a Lead role etc for about 6 months now. 

I have been working towards a role that we don't have an actual job description for, so while my SM and I have had conversations about growth and development plan, they recently told me that I would have to interview for a promotion... Within my own team... I've never heard of that in the accounting and finance space. Usually seniors are tapped and told they are getting promoted - and I have seen this happen on multiple occasions in other departments.

So I guess I need advice. Stick it out? Semi underpaid... Or start looking? If I look external do I look for another Senior role or do I look for a management role?

I'm in my final semester of Computer Science Engineering from a tier 3 college in India with a CGPA of 9.2. I'm currently interning at a company that's offered me a full-time role for ₹3.5 LPA. The work is okay, not bad, but definitely not exciting.

I’m considering doing a Master's in Germany, preferably in AI or something tech that's booming. I don’t have much hands-on experience in AI yet, but I’m curious and willing to learn. I come from a decent financial background — my family is ready to support me with around ₹10–20 lakhs (can stretch via an education loan if needed).

I looked into universities like TUM and RWTH. I’ve heard TUM is now charging tuition for non-EU/EEA students starting this year (~€3,000–€6,000 per semester), so I’m factoring that in too. I know some public unis still offer tuition-free programs, though.

I’m torn between:

1. Taking the job and building skills slowly through online learning, side projects, etc.


2. Going all in on higher studies in Germany, hoping for better opportunities later.

In my first time I was a rockstar like I became the main guy within 4 months, everyone relied on me I would work my ass off, back then when my managers told me I was doing good & it was like the best feeling in the world, collected recognitions after recognitions for being best employee and to keep getting that I started working overtime, on weekends & everything. Then one day I got to that saturation point & resigned from this job within 1.1 years. After that in my 2nd company also I soon became a rockstar, though I didn't do much as it was easier job, still I became the main guy & everyone relied on me, but the management was shit headed, salary was too low, so I left this  job within just 7 months & this point of time, I got multiple job offers.

Since then, everything went downhill. 

Like, I joined a company & left in literally 3 days (until now I worked WFH & this job was WFO, anxiety got better of me & I got overwhelmed). Within 2 weeks, I joined another company but they lied to me regarding my job role, my work timing & pay, again I said fuck it & left in 1 month. Within 2 months, joined another company again, here I decided enough is enough & worked my ass off, but instead of the usual appreciation I was torn down with issues & escalations which got the better off me, I got anxious & took 2 months sabbatical leave on February 2024 because at the same time some health issues started popping up, post sabbatical I just tendered resignation & so, I left another job in 9 months. Soon, I joined another company, so this was a great company, the pay was so good, but post joining literally on the 2nd day, a close friend of mine came up with a business idea, I saw this as an escape and started working on it, in these periods, I didn't do shit in my job, took constant leaves, escaped work stating some reasons & focused on business for literally 3 months, and on the 3rd month I left the job. Post that business got so fucked because of like the biggest personal financial issue I ever had in my life, so again I was on job search,  by this time within 3 years I had already jumped 6 jobs. But yet again I found another job in December 2024, to be honest it was like my dream company, dream role but it was a contract role, and post my hiring the project I was assigned to got shutdown & I was on bench for 3 months, there was talks of laying me off so I left the company before that (in 4 months).

Now by this stage in March 2025, I had a history of 7 jobs within 3 years, I was not getting an interview call, so I reached out to my second company (one where management was shit heads), they offered me a role but with lesser pay & everything, still I would say within the team in my level I'm like the highest paid (but from my perspective there's more than 2 Lakh salary cut). Considering my situation I took it and joined on April. Now, for almost 1 year even though I had job I wasn't working but rather on bench or just escaping from work. Now, when I joined this company within a matter of 2 weeks they assigned me lot of projects (its a small company & me being a returning employee they are not giving me much training too), the project's are tough one's on which I have never worked before in my life, also there are talks of giving me some complicated, the most toughest clients that are in the company. Like they have very high expectations of me and this is putting me on high pressure. Also, I'm facing like the worst personal issues, financial issues & all at home. The last week on Monday I literally couldn't get myself to work, so saying something I took a leave on Monday, on Tuesday I kept slipping away from work stating some reasons or take breaks, just attending 2-3 calls & so on, but on Wednesday morning I had a proper meltdown like literally at the verge of tears, nauseous, shivering, no breathe, that feeling of so much fear and all. I told I would need off for the rest of the week to get better, but they were not willing to provide one, still I told them the truth about my meltdown, I showed a medical certificate & all, then took leave.

Since then I have been working on myself and all, felt a bit better, but now tomorrow I need to get back to work & I'm having that dreaded feeling, that churn in my stomach & is already feeling extremely defeated. I have no idea what to do, this job is important because salary is important because of some personal issues, but its like I'm literally not able to bring myself to work, I don't know if it's laziness or anything else, I'm also planning to do some business or start something on my own, like I'm trying to find solutions or workarounds to quit my job, but running a business and reaching that stage isn't gonna happen quickly and until then I would need to work. But I'm not able to bring myself to it somehow.

I don't know what to do and I'm the kind of person who always acts carefree like shit doesn't bothers me. There's even a running joke in my family & between my friends that stress & tensions don't affect me. And I guess it never did, but now I feel like the weakest person, on the verge of breaking down & I won't be able to ask to anyone I know for help. But I do need help, can someone give me any advices? Anyone went through something like this? I feel like I'm done and I'm fed up of all the shit.",Mobile-Chapter426,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1745751213,2025-04-27 10:53:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k918h6/feeling_stuck_and_overwhelmed_can_someone_help/,4,2025

So, there’s a colleague who started with the company on the same day as I did. It has been two months since we started, and he is performing the same job with the same responsibilities as I am within our team. However, my job title includes junior while his does not. I understand that prior experience can sometimes influence job titles, but is it typical for someone doing the exact same job as me to have a different title? It’s not as if he has more experience in this specific role or is assisting me in any way.

1k8zt50,Should I stay in my upcoming graduate scheme or return to education?,"I’m a 20 year old male, graduating from University this year after a 3 year mathematics with finance degree from a strong, Russell group university. Last summer I did an internship in Commerical Banking for a large UK based bank- who then offered me a place on their graduate scheme starting in September 2025, making roughly £34-38k starting (not in London).

For the last two years I have been sending large amount of applications (>50) for internships and graduate schemes primarily at investment banks- to which I always get to the virtual interview, sometimes to the formal interview and never an offer. This is my preferred career choice and I believe with a bit more education, work experience and more applications I could in theory get an entry level role as an analyst starting around £70k. I’m debating doing a masters in a related field and then applying for these jobs again next year- internships over summer if I can land them etc (obviously disheartening that I haven’t got any IB specific internships in the past).

This would mean giving up my graduate scheme which is obviously risky- I know I’m lucky to have receiver an offer in a field I’m interested in - and I’m worrying that I’m being a touch over ambitious. Will my salary prospects look good long term in commercial banking? Could I pivot post grad scheme into IB? Am I being over ambitious to think of turning down a good grad scheme?

1k8z4ky,How to deal with managers who don't see your value?,"At every workplace I've had so far (I've at my 4th one now), the manager was a hit or miss.

Either they ""got me"" and we communicated well, or they just acted as clients who wanted stuff from me, or seemed to have something personal against me.  
It's about a 50/50 split between those who get me and those who don't.

I'm a lot more compassionate towards myself than I used to, and I don't think it's my responsibility to just please everybody when there's no constructive criticism involved, just vague ""I can't put my finger on it but there's a sense that..."".

  
I think I have high job ethic, it's important to me to do a good job, but sometimes it seems for some people nothing is good enough.  
I don't think ""I'm the problem"", I have changed the way I work when there were concrete and actionable points to improve (that I saw the merit in).

  
I'm about to leave a workplace with one such manager, after the last one was just great to work with.  
But I don't want to switch jobs every 3 years because every time a new manager comes along and might not see my worth, be threatened by me, or just won't care.

1k8yxc7,Asking for an internal shift,"Hi all, thank you for reading this, I am pretty new to big Orgs so I would really appreciate your help on this topic.

I am 24M working for a worldwide multinational company, I joined 1 y ago in Sales and I was in a department w/ little things to do (= most of the times nothing). 
My pipeline in that department was merely 10/20k.
Not talking only about numbers, I also didn’t get well w/ my local managers and colleagues, finding them always busy or not attending meetings they have scheduled. 

Recently after a colleague resigned I was able to switch to another modality (same office, same procedures just a different team), and after 2 months in it I’ve reached a pipeline of 1.5M.
Local managers are really happy about me and I’m bonding with the local team (calls of 40 min usually) so I would like to join this department.
I am really feeling I am growing professionally and personally in this new role.

Now, the hiring process for this position is almost going to start and I was wondering:

Is it a good idea if I go to talk w/ the General Manager (he was the one who hired me) of our department to ask him if I can be part of the new hiring process? 

We have a structure like:
Me  -  Team Leader  -  Managers

I’ve already tried to ask my new team leader to take me into consideration but he made me understand he couldn’t do nothing.
My ex team leader still wants me with him even though there is literally nothing to do in my previous department. 

Do you think this is a wrong move? I have numbers on my side and I would like to develop myself more, and inside this company this would be the best path for what i saw. 

They can also put the new guy in my old department so that he can get trained and the department can have time to work well.

It’s my 1st time working for this huge companies so thank you so much for whoever is going to help me and happy Sunday!

1k8ywtd,Should I negotiate a low job offer or just accept for now?,"I'm an international master's student in Computer Science, studying in a neighboring country. After graduation, I need a visa to stay and work here, so securing a job quickly is really important. I'm starting to run low on money, but fortunately, I have about six years of prior experience as a software developer, so I’m quite qualified.

The job market has been tough, but I recently received an offer. The role sounds quite demanding. I'll be one of only two developers (and the other might be leaving), and it seems like they expect me to take charge of development, travel, work occasional weekends etc. The team is mostly scientists spread internationally. I’m actually okay with all of that; it sounds like a good opportunity.

However, after reading the contract, I was surprised by how low the salary is. It’s well below my expectations and within the entry-level salary range, even though I have six years of industry experience. Some friends in the industry have also confirmed that it's very low for this country, my experience and for the role described.

I'm not sure if I should bring this up and try to negotiate or just accept it for now to secure my visa and income, while continuing to apply elsewhere. I do have another interview soon with a different startup that’s already being very transparent about salary, and their range is much more competitive.

Would it be wise to mention the salary concerns now without a counter-offer in hand? Or should I just accept it, secure my visa, and keep looking quietly?

There's a director from another department I've occasionally worked with time to time and he asked if I'd be interested in applying for a vacancy on their team for a Data Analyst position and if so to have a chat with her hiring manager.

I then had the (informal) chat with the hiring manager and it went great, our conversation went very well and the things I showed her piqued her interested in me (work data analysis portfolio). She said that her boss (Director) put in a good word for me and to definitely apply if I'm still interested.

She let me know when the job posting went live and that it's only going to be kept up for a short period of time because of the amount of applications coming in and that she'd tell HR to keep it open until my application went in.

I’m planning to pursue a PhD in Finance eventually, and after talking to a lot of people, I realize doing a pre-doctoral RA (pre-doc) first would be a smart move.

I have a strong background in math but limited experience with coding. I’ve been advised that for pre-doc positions — especially at top business schools in the US and Europe — it's important to be proficient in:

* Data collection and cleaning
* Running regression models
* Software like STATA, R, and Python  

I would really appreciate any advice on:

* How to quickly and effectively build these skills, I am a complete novice when it comes to this. If anyone could give me a roadmap, it would be extremely helpful.
* Which resources (courses, textbooks, projects) helped you the most
* What professors usually expect from pre-docs at T10 business schools  

If anyone here is currently a pre-doc or pursuing a PhD in Finance/Economics abroad, I would love to hear about your experience and suggestions. Though there are plenty of resources online to learn data analysis , but there might be a mismatch as to actually what is needed for a pre-doc and what the tech guys do in general.

Thanks a lot for reading! I'm genuinely excited to learn and would be grateful for any guidance.

1k8rrlb,"No hate, OnlyFans Model looking to switch careers","I (28F) did exceptionally well in school, graduated early at 21 with honors with a masters degree in business and worked from 14 on. 

However, I grew up in a small town and could not move home and do things like unpaid internships because there were none. My parents couldn’t pay my rent either. I applied to thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs and I never could land one. No one ever took me seriously. Low paying jobs thought I was too qualified, high paying jobs said I had no experience, despite me working since 14 various jobs. 

Years passed and I finally got one that you didn’t even need a degree for that paid 30k a year. I worked nights at restaurants and weekends and worked about 80+ hours a week. I couldn’t sustain it and I moved into a very cheap neighborhood and often times couldn’t even afford food. I kept applying and I couldn’t get anywhere. I went to career counselors, met with people, redid my resume countless times and spent so much time trying to network. My parents are the type of people who stayed in the same jobs their entire lives and I really had no professional connections. 

I became an OF model and I don’t even do nudity and I make over 130k a year now. At first, I worked 14 hour days, working my day job and then working all night and morning before work on OF. It tools years to build a following and I don’t think anyone has any clue how hard it actually is, especially not being a Instagram model or doing nudity. For reference, 99% of women make less than $100 a month on OF. 

However, eventually I built a decent following. Because of this, it became much easier and I didn’t have to put as much time in. I don’t have to work 80 hours a week and for the first time in my life I can live comfortably and explore things like hobbies. It cured my depression and gave me time to work on myself. 

However, it’s starting to wear on me. The job is boring. It’s not stimulating at all. It’s hard to date with it and I miss being social. I live alone and work from home and have no coworkers (I do everything by myself). The other girls are not nice online and the men are so needy. 

I want to pick a new career but I have concerns. I want to make good money, 100k + so I can pay my bills and not have to leave my apartment. I want some freedom but I’m not afraid to work hard, as long as it’s not so grueling or boring that I get burnt out and depressed. I want to be able to slowly pull back on what I do now, so I don’t have to be financially broke because I’m picking a new career. I also don’t want to get so burnt out because I’m doing both at the same time, because I think I will have to during the transition at least. 

I’m thinking real estate? I think it will give me some freedom but I’ll also be able to work hard. I have sales experience (it’s different but it’s better than nothing?). It will give me the opportunity to work alone sometimes but also be social. 

Is there any other jobs or any advice that anyone has here? ",Early-Card8825,636,0.6800000071525574,584,1745714981,2025-04-27 00:49:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k8rrlb/no_hate_onlyfans_model_looking_to_switch_careers/,4,2025

I earn about $100k with commissions and have an all expenses paid company car. 

But my job is quite stressful, extremely fast paced, my work. phone rings from 7am-5pm every weekday. Most days are 7:30-4:30. I constantly deal with issues and mistakes made by suppliers/others in the company.

Teaching seems more ""rewarding"", less hours and having school holidays off would be excellent if I start a family in the next few years. I think I could get a post grad qualification quite quickly. Income I imagine would be around $80-90k and have heard can grow up to $150k with a head of faculty role. Decent for the hours and holidays involved.

Mortgage broking, kind of a different sales role? I am good with numbers/people and seems pretty easy tbh with not much required qualification wise. Have heard the income is average to begin but can be lucrative if you build a big customer base. But I feel it would have the same drawbacks as my current role. Longer hours, less holidays, phone going off all day.

After two interviews and resounding assurances from the team that I was a great candidate, I got a call the HR manager about negotiating wages.

They made an offer and I countered slightly above their ask. About 10% of the initial offer more. They agreed now was the time to negotiate wages and that it was an agreeable offer and that they needed to discuss as a team before sending a final offer.

Got a call the next day and they made an offer to another candidate and accepted their commitment.

Did I price myself out here? I’ve always negotiated higher wages compared to the initial offer. 

To top it off they said they were still interested in me, due to my licenses and experience, and they were going to try to find another role for me and I’m to wait for a call on Monday with another offer. I’m not optimistic and feel this is a pity hire for a less compensated role. Anyone have any thoughts on this?

I definitely learned my lesson to just take an offer next time, really kills me cause I’ve been unemployed for two months. 

TLDR: got a call from employer with an offer. I countered with 10% more. They gave job to another candidate. Employer is looking for new role for me, will hear back Monday but I’m not optimistic it’ll be at the same compensation.

1k8kn1j,Public Policy BA to work in animal welfare or pursue JD around regulations around animal wellbeing?,"Hey guys, 
So I am thinking of switching my major to public policy to work in a field surrounding animal welfare. I am not sure what positions are available or how to steer my degree into this discipline. If just a bachelors in public policy doesn’t take me far enough, I was thinking of pursuing a JD degree to help me further branch into the field of public policy. 

So here are my questions:
-Is a bachelors in public policy a “good investment” and allow me to work after I graduate or is it only good if I do further education?

-What can I do with a public policy degree in terms of regulating industries like dog foods, and improve animal welfare practices by other means?

-Does a public policy degree prepare you enough for LSATs and law school?

I’m interested in many aspects of public policy including healthcare, education, and mental health services and care reform, so even if there’s no set “field” for animal welfare, I would love your honest opinions.

1k8jupg,Feeling Lost,"Hi Reddit,

This is embarrassing, but I’ve shot myself in the foot. 

I’m 22F & graduated early (Dec 2023) with a degree in Early Childhood Education. I realized during student teaching that I didn’t want to teach, but it was too late to change majors. Since then, I’ve been bouncing around trying to figure out what actually works for me.

First, I took a job teaching toddlers. I loved parts of it, but it destroyed my body (sciatica, constant sickness), & the center couldn’t afford to keep me. I lasted 6 months there.

Then I nannied for a family I adore. I still help them on weekends, but it was only a 6-month contract, & no one in my area can really afford to pay a livable wage for nannying full-time.

Next was a behavioral health role at a preschool. I poured everything into that job, but it was physically rough (I was injured daily) & the work culture was toxic, sketchy practices at best. I was also a Head Start employee, which may or may not lose funding very soon. I walked out after a bad day—kid sent my teeth through my lip & a coworker screamed in my face. I left on good terms with most people, just not upper management. That one lasted 5 months.

After all that, I realized maybe childcare/education just isn’t for me. I’ve been doing a ton of reading & trainings in admin support, HR assistant work, L&D, etc. 

It’s been about 1.5 months. I’ve applied to 60+ jobs, had 5 interviews, but ghosted on all. The good news is I got a barista job at a café nearby that will just barely cover bills. I’m worried I’ll get stuck in this kind of work forever, especially since my resume already looks pretty jumpy.

What can I do to get out of this loop? Should I just keep applying & hope someone takes a chance?

TL;DR Graduated early, realized I hate teaching. Had 3 short-term jobs since then. Trying to pivot into admin/HR, but struggling to land anything. Took a barista gig to survive. Need some tough love.",chuzzlemaster,0,0.5,2,1745692494,2025-04-26 18:34:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k8jupg/feeling_lost/,4,2025

1k8jnsp,Told I was abrasive,"Looking for some insight here. I was invited to a meeting last minute by the executive director of our department as my director who I report to was away. The meeting title was vague, so when I showed up I was surprised to see a few VPs and others along with a consultant. The meeting was apparently supposed to be a dialogue between our company and a consultant to get some ideas. The consultant started proposing policies and procedures that we already have in place, so I brought up what we currently do and asked the group if the intention was to discuss how we can add or change these things. The conversation continued after that but the executive director scheduled a call with me afterwards to give me feedback. She said it was her fault for inviting me and not giving me context but she thought my comments were abrasive. She apparently discussed with the other co-lead of our department who scheduled the meeting and they both thought this. She said they all knew that we had these existing policies and that the consultant was brought on for new ideas. I said that I spoke up as I didn’t want us to duplicate work. She told me to reflect on my comments and see how I would feel if I were the consultants and got asked the same questions. I thanked her for the feedback and told her I was sorry for coming across that way and told her I’d also apologize to the co-lead of our department. She also said well it seems you are uncomfortable with this feedback, and I said no more so surprised because it was not my intention to come off as abrasive. I’m reflecting on this incident and spoke to some people who were also at the meeting, and got feedback that while I was firm, they wouldn’t say I was abrasive. I wonder then if I am getting this feedback because I made them look unprepared or bad in front of executive leadership? Or did I really overstep? Or both?

1k8jnmf,Resume Mistake #3: Poor Formatting and Visual Organization?,"We're on day 3 of my resume mistakes series, and today's focus is on a mistake that instantly damages your credibility:

Even great content gets ignored when it's presented in a wall of text, has inconsistent formatting, or uses bizarre fonts. Many resumes look like they were designed in 1997 and never updated.

 They form an impression of your attention to detail and professionalism within 6 seconds, largely based on format before they even read content.

**Do instead:**

* Use a clean, modern template with consistent formatting
* Ensure plenty of white space to make it skimmable
* Create clear section headers that stand out
* Stick to professional fonts (Calibri, Arial, or Helvetica)
* Maintain consistent date formats, bullet styles, and spacing
* Make sure your name and contact info stand out clearly at the top

Remember: Your resume is also a demonstration of your communication skills and attention to detail. If it's cluttered, inconsistent, or hard to read, employers will assume your work is too.

**Have you recently updated your resume's format? What template or structure works best in your industry?** I'd be interested to hear your experiences.

1k8j4dh,Career Advice: Burnt out sales rep who destroyed her life,"I (F24) dropped out of college and made decent money through various sales jobs. However, my resume is super choppy because I basically had 3 different sales jobs over the course of 3yrs so pretty much staying at each place about a year. I had no idea how much this would hurt my job prospects until now because it looks like I can’t keep a job for longer than a year. I also did not realize how burnt out I would get in sales. When I 1st started it was super fun and I felt like a bad ass. I was outpacing all my peers my age and even managed to buy a town house at 21. Now I just feel like a depressed loser with no skills in a dead end job cycle. I’m realizing the only “talent” I had was my ability to outwork everyone around me and now I’m just too depressed to go back to sales I just don’t have it in me anymore.

So my current job situation is super bizarre over the past 10 months or so. My dad has a small finance company and essentially conned me into working for him with a fake insurance sales job. Like I got my life and health insurance license and everything but the job opportunity was fake and never existed. I basically help out in collections now and have gotten some exposure reviewing bank statements. I also do alot of odd jobs here and there like help with tracking invoices, research our current loans like looking through all the loan agreements and amendments and such to see what we have. I made a website for an entity, I’ve filed trade names with the court house. Nothing really makes sense operationally and it’s not consistent experience it’s random exposure to stuff. I feel like I’m in a position where I have to lie or bullshit on my resume regarding my current role bc it just doesn’t make sense what I do and sometimes there are days where I don’t even do anything bc there’s nothing to do. I’m so depressed and just don’t know what to do. I really want out of my current situation but I don’t want to go back to sales. I’ve applied to over 50 underwriting, credit analyst, and customer success manager roles and haven’t gotten a single interview. I want to start over in a different state so I’ve been applying out of state and wonder if maybe that’s why? I just want my next thing to be super long term so I don’t want to try applying in state bc then I’m afraid I’ll never leave the state. I’m considering being a financial advisor also so like maybe get me SIE license on my own bc I also haven’t heard back applying for those roles either. I tried Bank of America and Fidelity bc supposedly those are less sales based and feed you leads.

Anyways I feel so lost in life and don’t know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",hey_parfait,0,0.5,7,1745690586,2025-04-26 18:03:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k8j4dh/career_advice_burnt_out_sales_rep_who_destroyed/,4,2025
1k8izgl,Do I look like a hopper?,"I feel like I’ve been narrowly avoiding layoffs my entire career. I’d love more than anything to have job security, but as you’ll see, I’ve had a tough time finding that. 

Based on this tenure, if I were to start looking again (sigh), does this look okay? 

Job 1 - 3.5 years across 3 roles with increasing promotion (Intern, Freelance, Full-Time). Left because I moved too far away. 

Job 2 - 1.8 years in a more senior role, I left because the part of the company that paid my salary got sold and we were told to start looking. 

Job 3 - 1 year - This company switched owners twice while I was there, it was volatile. This company no longer exists. 

Job 4 - 1.2 year - The role I was hired for got eliminated three months in. Instead of laying me off, they put me in a role I wasn’t totally qualified for, way out of what I do. I stayed so I could make it to a year mark, but probably should have left after three months and not have this on my resume at all, honestly. 

Job 5 - 2.5 years in a more senior role - I left because my role was changed and there was no path to promotion. My entire team ended up quitting. 

Job 6 - 1.8 years in a more senior role - I left after my entire team was laid off. I was kept on to train replacements, and was able to secure a more senior role elsewhere after the layoff occurred. Everyone who was kept after the that first major layoff was let go several months later. 

I’ve been at my current role for around 2 years now, and I find myself in the same position. There were mass layoffs, and my role has been changed significantly. There’s been consistent layoffs since I started here, my teams been eliminated or outsourced, and I fear there’s writing on the wall. 

I know what the market is like right now, so even if I did look, it’s not like I’d find something soon. I just think about my resume.

1k8it90,Struggling to level up your skills? Seeking feedback on AI learning career coach!,"Hey r/careeradvice community!

I am working on a project that I think could really help professionals navigate the overwhelming world of online learning and career development.

The Problem: 

It feels like there are a million online courses and resources out there, but figuring out exactly what skills you need to learn to reach your career goals can be a real headache. Sifting through endless catalogs and trying to piece together a relevant learning path is time-consuming and often leads to feeling lost or unsure if you're focusing on the right things.

My Idea: 

An AI-powered platform that acts like a personalized career coach. You tell it your current skills, your career aspirations, and industries you're interested in. The AI then analyzes this information along with current job market trends to generate a tailored learning path just for you. This path wouldn't be limited to a single platform but would pull in relevant courses, resources, and even projects from across the web: Coursera, Udemy, edX, and more.

Potential Benefits:
1. Personalized Guidance: No more generic recommendations. Get a step-by-step plan based on your unique situation.
2. Time Savings: Stop wasting hours searching for the right courses. The AI does the heavy lifting.
3. Stay Relevant: Ensure you're learning the skills that are actually in demand in the job market.
4. Clear Roadmap: Visualize your learning journey and track your progress towards your goals.
Who would find this useful? I'm thinking this could be valuable for:
5. Professionals looking to upskill or reskill for a career change or advancement.
6. Individuals just starting their careers and wanting a clear direction for skill development.
7. Potentially even HR departments looking for ways to offer personalized development plans for their employees.

I'd love to get your feedback on this!

1. Does this problem resonate with you? Have you experienced this frustration?
2. What features would be most important to you in a platform like this?
3. Would you be willing to pay for a service that provides this kind of personalized learning guidance? What would be a reasonable price point?

Any thoughts, suggestions, or concerns are welcome! Thanks in advance for your input.",db_name_error_404,0,0.5,1,1745689785,2025-04-26 17:49:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k8it90/struggling_to_level_up_your_skills_seeking/,4,2025
1k8idms,Does Jumping Ship 5 months into a Role Make Sense for Me?,"I will just list my recent experiences so far to get a gist of my last 5-6 years of experience. 

1. Nov 24 to present : working at this non-proft in a finance related job. 55k

2. Nov 21 to Nov 24: working in the accounting dept. of this manufacturing company. 46k to 51k by the end.  had a pretty good 401k program here. 

3. Jan 21 to Nov 21: worked in accounting, manufacturing company. was a temporary role with no chance of being permanent - primarily why I left. 42k

4. Mar 19 to Mar 20: a small time manufacturing co. was laid off from here on Mar 2020 as the Covid crisis negatively impacted this company's business. Finance dept. role. 44k. 

Now at my current role I make 55k (listed #1 above). Sadly we can't join the 401k program until we've stayed with the organization for 1 year. It's a non profit soup kitchen - so the facilities at the place aren't the best. and recently we even found a mouse in the office room. 

My question is - I've gotten a 60k job opportunity at this other non-profit org. with their offices located in downtown of this metro city near me. I'm glad they have a good traditional office there. My question is does it make sense to jump ship and take on this 60k role now when I'm only at my current role for only 5 months??

1k8g0x9,Need help,"Hey everyone,

I started working as a compliance coordinator at a small health care company (3 locations) after intensive job searching post grad school. I’m the only one in my role so as you can imagine I’m really stretched thin. During my interview I wasn’t able to negotiate the pay I wanted, so we settled at 60k (low end in the market value for Texas). They did say that once there’s a “team” under me that we could work our way up to 70k (which is still below market rate lol). 

Reason why I settled is because I only have a couple years under my belt but never have I developed a compliance program from scratch! However, I’ve taken on another tasks like credentialing and licensure. This role is very time sensitive and very consuming. I even asked what’s a priority on my current work load when I saw how much needed to get done. I advised that they should hire a contractor but they don’t have a budget for it. My boss mentioned getting me an assistant. My 1 year evaluation is in June and I need to be compensated for all this work I’m doing and have done. 

Recently, our biller who has only been here for a year just got her evaluation and a 5% increase. What would be the most appropriate raise to ask for? I’ve successfully credentialed 10 new providers, secured 3 payor contracts and keep up with licensing. This does not include my compliance responsibilities (auditing, revising rules & procedures, emergency management, operations). 

This is my first job post grad school. I’m getting a lot of experience (never done credentialing or emergency management before) but not getting paid for it. I do have to say that these responsibilities weren’t pushed on me; I helped out as a favor but now they expect it from me. I have turned down a couple times but it needed to be done.

Background info: the company is only 5 years old with high turn over rate and very tight budget.  We rlost our Medicaid for 5 months because of incorrect email address and we didn’t attest on time. The only way to prevent that is to have a person be responsible for credentialing and keeping up with it.

The role itself has a lot of ambiguity and the start up nature of course adds to that.

Furthermore I’m a contracted employee and don’t even have weekly check ins with my manager. There are sometimes changes made that aren’t communicated to us effectively. I feel like I get dinged on stuff that isn’t very clear.

1k8fmgg,Advice for an early retired English teacher,"Doing some soul searching here and would appreciate your thoughts. 

Career Context: I retired from teaching H.S. English last June, after 16 years/55 years old. This was enough to leave with my health insurance and a meager pension (pays for groceries). I was seriously burnt, burned and beyond continuing in this field. Loved my subject matter and many of the kids. Hated the multi-tasking and micro-management.

Personal Context: The stress relief has been worth it. However, I am now a part-time clerk at a municipal center. It's easy, laid back and pays pennies compared to my previous salary. It's not particularly stimulating. I also have two autoimmune illnesses. . .

My husband works too and has emphasema. Scary transition here. Life is unreal to me at times. 

I am considering going back to school for another degree in journalism?  

Side note: We live in rural America, house is paid off, but then there's taxes, insurance, utilities. . .

1k8fbie,I am feeling stuck and need advice on my next career direction,"I feel really stuck between a rock and a hard place right now and I need some advice, I am 25 year old male who has moved out with my girlfriend, we have been living together for a year now. Both of us are starting fresh, she (a personal trainer) moved from a large commercial gym to a smaller private gym and has taken a financial hit, not being able to bring all of her existing clients from the large commercial gym to this private gym. Me on the other hand joined a start up company 4 months ago, there was all this hype about potential earnings and I started with a nice basic salary and a commission structure so things were looking really promising, I would be able to support my girlfriend and I while she got her cliental back up to a point where we could share expenses evenly again.

Now its April and things at the new startup have taken a nose dive, and I know that risk is involved with a startup, the product definitely has a place I just don't think in my current country and province the market is ready for it, I am the sole employee in my province (KZN, South Africa) and have been put under a lot of pressure to ensure the product succeeds and told to bring new business to the company, the MD basically handed me the software and said ""make it work"" after 3 days of training, I have put in a lot of foot work and built some fantastic momentum that I know will convert into sales but I would say only over the next 8 months. To summarise the nose dive event, my basic salary was completely cut as I was not performing to target, I have been moved to a commission based model. The target is an outrageous number of sales a month, especially for myself who had just moved into the sales role, but I also think one of the biggest red flags which I should have identified and clarified before and have now learnt my lesson was, the managing director of the current startup I am at was banking on me hitting my target every month and using that cash flow to pay my basic and my commission, well as I said the product is new and I think a market disruptor so there is a lot of hesitation from my potential customers to come aboard. What I have learnt thus far: to really do some deep thinking before jumping at an opportunity such as this one and also to do some in depth research and background checks on the managing directors before going for it, I feel stupid now but looking back the managing director seemed like a lovely man who I trusted, maybe I am just upset at myself for not reaching my targets and projecting that at the managing director for stripping me of my basic salary. I also feel so much pressure as the man of the house to still provide for my girlfriend and I while she is struggling to pick up new cliental.

Anyways regardless of all the above information I am now on the search for another job and there has been a lot of opportunity come my way.

(1) In 2024, my first year out of university, I worked at a proper corporate company, nothing huge but very corporate and I struggled so much with that environment, I realised I am not the type of person who can sit behind a desk 8 hours a day developing business process automation (BPO), it absolutely killed me and what made it worse was the environment was incredibly condescending and instead of feeling growth within my first year in the corporate world my confidence was slowly broken by the seniors instead of made to feel like I was growing as a BPO developer. I only lasted a year in that environment and left to the startup I mentioned above. The opportunity comes in as I have received at least 4 requests to return to the company as my absence hit the team hard and they needed to replace me with someone new and train them. I have also been pressured by everyone, my girlfriends god mother, my girlfriends family and my dad. Yes I will be able to return on my terms and ensure I have a good paying salary that is guaranteed every month and this will create a lot of security for my girlfriend and I and allow us to live stress free regarding money but it means I have to return to that horrible environment, do I just suck it up and take it on the chin to ensure I can provide for my girlfriend and I?

(2) I have been approached by an entrepreneur who has had fantastic success in the logistics game (Transporting freight via truck, air, ship etc) and has multiple successful businesses. He has developed a really intuitive software that he is wanting to implement in the logistics game. To summarise, yes this is a startup and I now know the risk of startups and what can happen if things go south, the biggest difference between my current startup I am working for and this one is I will not be in a sales role so my success will not be based on the number of sales I make, it will be more of a support and implementation of this logistics software and if I onboard transporters then there is commission to be earned. In saying all that there will be pressure to fully implement this software so it is deeply rooted within these transporters(there are modules, I will be implementing module 1 but then these transporters can purchase extra modules which will unlock very powerful functionality). In my second sit down with the new startup he mentioned he has big clients lined up awaiting the completion of this logistics software so that kind of gives me peace of mind there will be lots of work for me from the get go so I will have job security sorted, will I though I don't know I am traumatised having the carpet pulled out from under me at my current job. I really want to take this opportunity as it will be customer facing I will get to work with technology and IT which I love and also work with people, I know it will be incredibly hard and stressful as I know nothing about logistics but I am the type of person who does not shy away from learning and improving my knowledge of different fields. I forgot to mention there will be a lot more traveling with this job as if I am not mistaken I will be the first employee implementing this software for the company, this is ringing alarm bells, why am I the only employee?, why would the managing director approach me and not someone who has a great track record in the field and is well connected?, am I going to get screwed over as I am young and naive?. The managing director is very close with my uncle and I have been told that my uncle recommended me for the position. Maybe I am over thinking it but I am on high alert due to my current situation which is causing me serious stress. So do I take the risk at another startup which will have a basic salary, commission possibilities, and personally I think suit my personality type?

(3) My dad is a CFO and over the years has become very well connected, something I didn't mention is I also enjoy data analytics, SQL and all that. My dad has said to me that he has a distant friend who owns a company that uses PowerBI to create digital reporting for big corporate companies and he has said he can setup a meeting between me and this friend of my dads. This may not lead into a job but I could always ask and see if he will onboard me, thing is then it will be another desk job 8 hours a day slaving behind the computer. Maybe I have this warped reality of corporate because my first environment was so toxic and I would enjoy a desk job with the right team I really am not sure but I do feel confident in my ability to secure a job from this meeting that could be potentially setup.

(4) I was at club hockey practice and just got chatting to a friend of mine, older guy probably early 40's, just turns out he is an executive at this large corporate my dad used to work at. He straight up offered me a job after I told him about my background studying IT. The only thing is my dad says this company he used to work at are CRAZY and have what people call a cultish business culture. They do some crazy stuff to every employee that joins the company with the mentality we will break you down to build you back up stronger than before. I totally understand the mentality but after what my dad has told me he has highly recommended I steer clear from them. It is another option though if I am willing to try, maybe my personality type will suit the environment as my dad and I are very different personalities. Then again it will be another desk job.

I always think to myself ""Am I being to idealistic"" and living for that perfect job, when in reality I just need to take a hard knock on the chin and get in the corporate world behind the desk to gain experience and confidence?

Anyways some more information, my girlfriend is going through some healing at the moment, she had some very traumatic experiences last year and has clearly stated to me that this home we are in is her safe place and moving out is not an option. I don't want to move out as I know it will cause her a lot of stress and at this time she doesn't need that, she needs to focus on mental healing. The only problem is this place we currently live is so out of our means now that we are both basically restarting our careers. We are constantly penny pinching and even relying on my mom for help every month with groceries, petrol etc. I just am in this mind space that I don't want to spend my 20's struggling when we could move in somewhere smaller, start a savings, maybe even go on holiday every now and then. Am I wrong for thinking like this with my GF currently needing a safe place for healing?

Apologies there is a lot here I just needed to unpack my current situation and where my mind is at, your advice would be greatly appreciated!",Winter-Hat-3156,0,0.4000000059604645,3,1745680695,2025-04-26 15:18:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k8fbie/i_am_feeling_stuck_and_need_advice_on_my_next/,4,2025
1k8f3fj,"Turning 30 this year, Completely lost and trying to find a career that best suits me.","As the title says, I’m turning 30 this year. In my early 20s, I spent three years managing a fast paced restaurant, then quit at 23 to pursue entrepreneurship. I launched a successful music video production company, but eventually burned out. Working with artists was emotionally draining—many didn’t respect my time or pay on time—so I shut it down. After that, I became a social media manager for several businesses. The pay was decent, and I enjoyed the remote lifestyle, but I quit because social media marketing is severely underpaid and the hours are endless—once you factor everything in, it evens out to about $10 an hour going the freelance route, even with add-ons like managing ad campaigns. Currently, I run a pet sitting and dog walking business. I love being outside and spending time with animals. The pay isn’t great, but if I could do it remotely, I’d honestly be content.



I *will* work hard and push myself—but my nervous system shuts down. When I cross that threshold, I experience intense depersonalization and derealization. It feels like I’m completely detached from my mind and body, and it’s paired with a kind of depression that’s almost indescribable. I’ve tried managing stress in every way possible, but let’s be real—the work doesn’t end. No amount of nervous system regulation can help when the real issue is the culture of work itself.



I’ve genuinely tried to be like everyone else, to accept the bleak reality and just ""push through""—but my body and mind won’t let me. I can force myself to get through the week, but the physical symptoms are completely out of my control: night sweats, insomnia, adult acne, muscle loss, zero energy, a deep sinking pain in my stomach, and crushing depression. The problem is that I’m so willing to push through and keep quite about this but I already know this is not sustainable and will produce health issues and shorten my life span but a part me is like “stop being a pussy” 



Yes, I’ve been in therapy for years but I can confidently say that ChatGPT has helped me more than 15 years of therapy ever did



Here’s where I’m at now:

  
I don’t care about making six figures. I’m not planning on starting a family. I’ve been through some of the darkest mental places burnout can take you (as we all do) 70hour work weeks, chasing external validation, and attaching my self-worth to productivity. Even when I was making great money, I felt miserable and empty. none of this matters if your mental health is being sacrificed. 



My core values have shifted dramatically. These days, all I care about is living slowly and calmly—daily walks, cooking at home, reading, meditating, keeping my home clean, and spending time outside. I do all of this now, I just want a remote job that supports this.



My goal:

  
Make $40K–$50K/year  
Work remotely  
Keep normal hours (30–40/week)  
Ideally scalable  
I will upskill for 1–2 years or even pursue a degree  
Mental health and work/life balance are my top priorities

I’ve thought about getting a Comp Sci degree and moving into cybersecurity, but after a 4 year degree, I know it would take years working as in-person help desk before I could work remotely. 



So here’s my question is:

  
**What realistic remote career paths can support this slower, calmer lifestyle—without requiring passion, burnout, or chasing a six-figure salary? I want to learn and take a year or 2 up-skilling but I do not want to waste my time in something that was never going to work out.**



Reddit often feels like a doom loop: every industry is ""oversaturated,"" “keep dreaming on getting that remote job” “you and everyone else buddy” . Even fast food is “too competitive” these days. I get it—life is hard. But I’m here looking for thoughtful, practical suggestions that can lead me to a sustainable, balanced life. Spare me the doom and gloom, that only wastes both of our time and I can do that on my own but I’m sincerely asking y’all for actual advice.

1k8es3c,Where do I go from here?,"

Hello!

So, my [M22] plan was to graduate college and then pursue a career in Law Enforcement (Controversial, but something i’ve always been passionate about). However, I pivoted in my senior year and decided to pursue becoming a pilot. I’ve flown on and off before in high school and was always passionate about aviation. After I graduated with a degree in philosophy, I immediately started pursuing my private pilot’s license. Unfortunately, a few months into training, I developed a serious heart issue and could no longer maintain a medical clearance. I knew this could happen going in as I had done my research, but now I find I can’t even fall back on Law Enforcement due to my health complications. Fair to say i’ve been lost the past few months. The things i’ve always been most passionate about are now entirely out of reach. 

Fortunately, I have enough money saved through lucky investments, so I’m not destitute and could manage off of those returns. But I want to contribute and work as well. 

Any ideas? I thought about maybe pursuing ATC when the applications open but my heart problem will likely disqualify me from medical as well.

1k8elfu,24F in decisions paralysis,"Hi all,

I graduated last year with a BA in Human Communications. I’m currently working a dead-end, low paying office job (very boring/unfulfilling and the company would be fine if my position didn’t exist). I have been applying for other positions for four months with zero luck (yes I have tried networking, revamping my resume, and LinkedIn premium). I know the corporate, 8-5 life isn’t for me, not unless it was working for a passion of mine and remote/hybrid. What can I possibly do to take a step of out my stagnant life? 

Brainstorming here:
1. Find roommates to save money, work part time nannying/retail and focus on a passion (Writing a book, creating sustainable clothing used thrifted fabrics, getting my TEFL for teaching abroad) Con: financially unstable 
2. Focus on getting my Google Project Management Certificate and CAPM and look for work in the nonprofit industry, Con: I’ll have to stay in my current position for the foreseeable future
3. Go for a master’s abroad (in what?) Con: could be a huge waste of money and not helpful
4. Au Pairing, Con: wouldn’t make much progress for my resume unless I want to transition to childcare full time 

I feel like your career is your life since it takes up the majority of your time, and while no one dreams of labor, something needs to change so I can feel like I have a purpose and secure future. What’s some tangible I, as an average person, can learn to make myself more marketable (math and coding are a no)? How can I fuse my passions (education, sustainability, human rights, literature, travel) with a career? What should I commit to?

I’ve had two meetings with my employer this last month and after the first meeting I knew I was going to end up walking away from the job. There is no one who can fill my role easily and to find someone to replace me is going to be next to impossible, I know that sounds crazy, but it’s true. I let them know that I’d be stepping down. They asked me to hold off until we could have a final meeting.

We had a final meeting where they offered me more than I was asking for along with more hours, which honestly, felt like a slap in the face as I’m on my way out. I knew they’d try that and I knew I’d decline. After the way the situation was handled I no longer felt valued as an employee. So I turned it down, and now they are begging me to stay at least until September to which I also declined. 

Moral of the story, don’t stay anywhere that doesn’t see your worth until you’re walking out of the door. That goes for employment AND relationships. ✌️ ",thesweethoneybee,305,0.9800000190734863,44,1745677957,2025-04-26 14:32:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k8eb59/update_on_i_asked_for_a_raise_and_its_been_three/,4,2025
1k8e2ey,how to love your job until someone makes you feel like you don’t,"ive been at my job for a year. i feel so lucky to have it, i absolutely love it and i genuinely get excited for new projects. i’m also lucky to have such a great manager. 

the issue is cross functional work. i am a big believer in not going to happy hour. unfortunately “networking” in this company is gossip. i’ve become close to a coworker and although i tried my best to keep it professional she feels very comfortable in sharing her personal life.

i made the mistake of getting (only) one drink with her and for the first time, opened up about work toxicity. she said people don’t like our team and also shared the horror stories of how other teams are treated. yelling till you cry, etc. i’ve done good up until now but going to revert back to distancing myself, earphones, & no happy hours.

now for me, i can easily ignore this because this isn’t our team, and i don’t really care how others are. but it fed my anxiety into a spiral and i couldn’t sleep. 

the issue with growing is if you’re not their friend, they will not work with you. straight up not answer your emails. and this is important for me because cross functionally i need them to do my job. i share how open i am if you need anything message or come up to me but it doesn’t seem to matter. it’s also important for me to grow connections.

tldr; ive been here for a year and for the first time the downsides has been revealed. although im not involved, my anxiety has caused me to spiral and feel uncomfortable. naturally it’s easy to ignore but i just want that feeling to go away.

1k8ay5z,"20M, soon to be 21 — anxiety about my future and losing sleep","I’m studying Computing and IT online at the Open University. I originally wanted to become a software engineer or get into cybersecurity. I also work part-time for a charity, which I absolutely love, but it’s not something I can make a full living out of.

I’ve loved programming since I was a kid. I enjoy Rust and Python, and I find cybersecurity interesting. However, after hearing a lot about AI potentially replacing programmers and how bad the IT job market is right now, I’ve been thinking about possibly changing career paths to something more stable.

Previously, I studied electrical work, but I didn’t enjoy the practical, hands-on aspect of it. I also worried about how manual labor could affect my body long-term. That’s part of why I switched to IT. Still, I know electrical installation has better job security than IT right now, and sometimes I wonder if I made a mistake.

I’ve also been thinking about maybe going to university for something like Electrical Engineering — something with more long-term stability.

I have terrible anxiety about my future, and I’m planning to get help for my OCD. Honestly, any advice would be greatly appreciated. The anxiety has been greatly overwhelming lately. I also have chronically low self-esteem and autism.

1k886ko,My boyfriend needs advise (he is age 26),"My boyfriend was hired as a contractor for a TV mounting/electronics installing company. He was hired exactly 9 days ago. This is a veryyyy reputable and known company for Orlando. The boss made it seem like my boyfriend would make around $800-$1000 a week once he is full time. The boss told him he would make $10 an hour while he proves himself to the company and then he'd make %'s of each installation after he has access to the dispatcher. Until he has access to the dispatcher he was supposed to be trained by a lead tech named Jose to go along with him for jobs. He went on 1 job with him because the boss told my boyfriend where to show up. The job was an hour away to only make $20 for 2 hours of work. Jose did not share the $100 tip because he said that my boyfriend is still ""proving himself"". Even though the customer clearly said ""for the both of you"". Then after that my boyfriend was told by the boss that Jose would be in contact to tell him which job to come to next. My boyfriend woke up at 7:00am every morning ready and waiting to hear from Jose. 2 days go by and Jose has not contacted once so my boyfriend calls him. Jose says he needs to make his own money so he didn't contact him for those 2 days so he didn't have to share the money. Then he tells my boyfriend that there are other people training and that he can't expect work every day. Then my boyfriend tries to call the boss and it goes to voicemail. The next morning my boyfriend tries to call the boss. He declines the call and texts him saying he is out of town and that he'll call him tomorrow. Next day , radio silence. Then he texts the boss telling him that he really needs to speak with him that Jose is not contacting him and that he needs work and needs to pay bills and that if he is hired for his company he needs a schedule. Radio silence. Finally yesterday the boss says he'll call him later in the day. Never calls. This morning my boyfriend calls, goes to voicemail. Clearly my boyfriend can't work for this company.

1k87qwe,"Looking for ""next move"" guidance","Looking for 'next step' guidance

Looking for ""Next move"" guidance. What should I do?

Hi all, 27M. asking for advice. This is a bit of a long one. 

TLDR; Moved to a new city for a new job but its bullshit. I dont want to waste 9 hours a day on bullshit so Im thinking about quitting my job and upskilling myself further through certifications.

 I graduated in Dec 2019 with an engineering degree. I was fairly well-rounded (so I feel), having had technical experience through research and internships and being part of clubs and being a resident advisor. I got a job in May 2020 at a manufacturing company in the next town over. I was elated. I wanted to get into manufacturing and the job description seemed like its what I wanted to do.

Turns out it was mostly Excel. Drag and drop. Vlookup. Bullshit. But I was happy to be working at such a tumultous time and having just gotten done with college, I just wanted to chill out for a bit. 

I worked in this role for 2 years and was starting to get fed up and frustrated. It was showing in my work. Not that I was great at my job anyway. I used to question the point of my degree doing such a job.

 I applied to a few other roles with no avail. I looked for openings within the company and there was one in another department that was closer to production. The team was literally the ""product engineering"" team. I applied, interviewed and I got the job! I was so happy to be moving to a new role.

Turns out the new role was just **MORE** Excel, document control and change management. Something even a 7th grader could do. AND my boss wanted me in at the office 7.45 am EVERYDAY for ROLL CALL. Literally. WTF.  Both roles required I stay there for 8.5 hours.

Luckily my life outside work was good so I was like okay whatever.

But a year in I was FED UP as hell. I used to think of all excuses to be remote or would straight up just take unpaid leave to skip work. I felt like I was rotting. I would apply but get no response.

Then in Aug 2023 I got laid off. I broke up with my gf and moved back home at the end of oct 2023.

I spent the next year applying for jobs and upskilling myself through courses. I decided I was going to target the renewable tech space. I finally got a job starting 1st week of Jan 2025 in the hydrogen sector. I was so excited and had this ""new year, new chapter"" vibe.

There is a punch in-punch out system and I would have to be in office for 9 HOURS. I was okay with that because I was finally working again and was going to learn about a whole new interesting space. I was excited!!!

Only to find out....

Its bullshit. AGAIN. The CEO lied to me about so many things. The location is shitty. the office building and the office itself is shitty. **I'm not learning enough to justify 9 hours.** 

 

I started with some temp accomodations and after a  moved into an apartment with a year long lease. 

I told myself I'd leave after a year but I can't do that to myself again. Today's job market doesnt work like that so I wouldnt be doing myself a favour.

Im required to stay in the apartment till august and then I can transfer my lease to someone else. So, I've told myself that Ill work here till august. But Its tough to do that as well. Im just unhappy and this job is a waste of time and energy.

So... im thinking about quitting my job in a month and upskilling myself even further and filling in the gaps I didnt last year. Ill pay rent and expenses and wont move back home till august. I feel like Id accomplish more away from home anyways.

Im not the kind of guy that can put in more work at home after 9 hours of being in a regressive environment. 

The certifications are more for my personal fulfillment. I'm also working on a self-employment opportunity.

I feel really crappy at not really having done much professionally these past 5 years. How I feel about all this warrants another post. Luckily, I have good savings.

1k873xa,Doing the job of 3 people and boss is threatening me with bad reference if I refuse,"
I have worked for a trade association in Belgium for about three years. The pay is alright and the workload is manageable more or less. Recently they did an internal reshuffling and my old boss became an economic director meaning he’s in charge of overseeing the budget and we got a new boss for our team, this all changed starting January this year. The new boss cannot control her nerves and is constantly shouting at everyone and berating people . That in itself was not a major issue for me ( I had horrible bosses before so I can handle it). The worrying situation is the fact that a lot of people resigned or went on extended burnout leave because of the bad management . They refuse to hire more people , even though I know we have the budget (I can’t give more details on that) and instead redistribute the tasks. I assume it’s because they will look good in front of the board members + plus management will get fat bonuses at years end. Anyways, I had a chat with my boss recently where I was very honest and told her that I am struggling with anxiety / panick attacks and I do not want to to get to the burnout stage cause that not be ideal, so I want to address this with her in advance. She took it the wrong way and told me in a subtle way that if I do that the industry is small, everyone knows each other, and a bad reference may hurt my future prospects. I told her I want to fulfill my tasks successfully but I am trying to address this issue with her . Feels like I am doing the company a favour and I feel I am being taken advantage of . All these tasks are not in my job description as I do the job of 3 people and technically I cannot say no . They said they are looking for replacement for people who have left but keep finding reasons for why no one else has been hired yet . I know it’s bullshit. I have tried to asked for promotion / raises many times and nothing has happened. They just keep feeding me bullshit but nothing concrete. I don’t know what do to but I am getting desperate. I am already heavily applying for jobs and hope to be out here ASAP. But what do I do in the meantime ? The job market is bad it might take a while to find something . I obvs don’t want to go on sick leave or resign until I have something else planned. I just pray to God everyday that I get out of this toxic place ASAP.

1k85m4z,Quitting my job without another offer… Unsure about my next steps (career change + business ideas),"Hey everyone,

I’m about to quit my software development job in a few days — without another offer lined up. Honestly, it’s scary, but also feels like the right move. I’ve been feeling stuck for a while, and staying just for the paycheck didn’t make sense anymore.

Right now, I’m torn between two paths:
	1.	Pursue Data Science:
I’m genuinely interested in data science — data analysis, machine learning, predictive models, all of it. But since my work experience is mostly in software development, it’s been tough getting interviews or callbacks for DS roles. I know I’ll probably need to build a portfolio, maybe get a certification, and work on real projects to break in.
	2.	Start my own business:
I’ve also been thinking about starting a business. One idea I’m excited about is creating journals — gym planners, pregnancy journals, gratitude journals, daily planners, etc. I love designing and creating systems that help people stay organized and motivated. But this is just one idea — I’m open to exploring more if it makes sense.

I’m in this weird place where I’m trying to figure out:
	•	Should I dedicate the next 3–6 months fully to data science, and build towards a stable career first?
	•	Should I dive into building a business now while I have the time and freedom?
	•	Is there a smart way to work on both at the same time without burning out?

Money-wise, I can manage for a few months without a full-time job, but I know I need to be smart about it. I don’t want to jump from one stressful situation into another because I rushed the next step.

If anyone here has made a big career pivot, left without a backup plan, or started a business from scratch, I’d love to hear your experiences.
	•	How did you decide what to prioritize?
	•	What would you do differently looking back?
	•	Any specific advice for someone trying to switch into data science? Or starting a journal/planner business?

I’m excited for a fresh start, but also very aware that I need to be practical too. Any advice, encouragement, or even honest reality checks are welcome.
Thanks for reading — seriously appreciate it.

1k8444i,(Advice needed) My manager told me NOT to work after hours but I want to... sometimes?,"I understand that there are a lot of people out here who have issues with managers telling them to work overtime, so I wanted to recognize that before I share my story. I am certainly not here to brag about my opposite situation, rather, I want to get some advice.

It's been almost a year since I started work at this remote job. While being remote has its benefits, it's sometimes hard for me to ""tune off"" after a certain time, especially when you are in the zone to finish something. Earlier this week, I was working past regular working hours (think 7 pm) and messaged my manager with a question. My manager responded instantaneously, but also told me not to work after work hours and turn notifications off after hours, and that was that (no follow-up discussion).

Looking back at this, I realize I should not have contacted my manager after hours (just in case he feels pressured to respond). However, I would like to pick your brains on the following: *if your manager tells you not to work after hours, should you NEVER work after hours?*

I have a couple of options I thought of:

* I interpret this as a ""suggestion"" and work after hours sometimes to show that I am dedicated (?) to the team.
* I work after hours sometimes, but do not text any of my team.
* I take my manager's word for it and never work overtime.

Some context: I am early in my career in the IT/engineering sector, and I didn't have much of a professional reputation before joining the team. Also, I know my manager and some team members sometimes work after hours, but I have never received a message from my manager after hours, while other members sometimes do.

1k82y1z,should i make the jump?,"Good day, Reddit,

I'm currently a help desk/on field tech for a very small MSP (below 5 employees) for almost 6 months now. The people at work are great but not the customers, and I also didn't have proper training (more like send me to sites and I will have to figure out stuff by myself). a lot of time, the customers came back and request for the other tech because I didn't have the answers for them or I did something wrong. I learned from that a lot but it also takes away my confidence and I slowly burnt out from all the mistakes I made.

So about 3 months into the job I started to apply to test the water and today i got an offer from another MSP company in town that around 3 times the size of my company right now (20-40 employees). same title but they offer me slightly better (46000 to 47500). I'm planning to counter to 52000 so ideally we can square down to 50000.

Here are some thinkings I have:
1. Are they trying to hire me to hurt their competitor (i.e. my company), because i live in a small town and people knows people AND my company just took over a client from them AND i conveniently take care of that client mainly right now. Then in 1-2 months fire me so that they can save their budget on a cheaper guy? maybe im just being paranoid?
2. I want to be a sysadmin or network admin in the next 1-2 years. The bigger MSP takes care of the big organizations in town so they have couple of sys admins and I believe in order to get into sysadmin, I will have to join a company with a proper career path to go up and/or shadow them to know how to work as an sysadmin.

If this circumstance fall into you, what will you do? Thank you for all the inputs, I truly appreciate them!",Wrong-Word-1974,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1745636021,2025-04-26 02:53:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k82y1z/should_i_make_the_jump/,4,2025
1k81dyu,I want to ask my boss to put me on salary - Why would he say no?,"(remote position)

3 employees have left recently and they're having a hard time getting new people in my department. I am currently allowed overtime to complete my tasks but I'm finding it still might not be enough.

I may sound dumb here. but hear me out.

I don't really have a life outside of work and I'm close enough with my boss for him to know this. It would greatly benefit me to be able to work at night and on the weekends. It would allow me to slow down and take my time with my work and make sure it right and not feel rushed/stressed out. 

After work, I take a nap, cook dinner, and then pass the time till I work again. On the weekends, same thing. I run errands and then drink/play vidya games until I have to work again. I love my job a lot and I do not feel burnt out what so ever. I love putting my time and energy into my job as I find it very rewarding, and collaborating with my team is also a rewarding effort. In short, I would be able to take my time on my work instead of working against the clock and having to rush. When work is heavy I can put in that 50-60 hours to get it done and chill out at 40 when we get caught up. 

I don't know if anyone at my level is on salary so it's hard to say if he would be willing to do this. I feel like I'm giving my boss an offer that's too good to be true by offering him more ""free"" labor and a guaranteed employee who won't leave when times are tough. It may seem like I'm shooting myself in the foot here but I don't see it that way.

What would cause my boss to say no to this? I'm genuinely curious and am not looking for an argument. The only thing I can think of is that he doesn't want me to get burnt out, but it would please our clients to have a quicker turn around.

1k81bx5,Is asking for a 20k raise reasonable for a software engineering job?,"I started almost a year ago at a software company as a product engineer. Graduated with a CS degree. This was my first job and I was offered 50k/year, I accepted immediately due to job searching for 6ish months.

I’d love to stay at this company, love the environment and the company but obviously my priority is getting paid. I want to ask for $70k/yr. As a software job I don’t think that’s unreasonable, also considering I can maybe apply at other jobs for a few months and land at least 1 paying that much. I guess the only caveat is that it’s a $20k raise. Considering the role and the field I don’t think $70k is unreasonable though. I’d say I definitely do pretty good work, I’m always taking on more responsibilities voluntarily, I’m not gonna sit here and say I’m top 1% but I’d say top 20% for sure.

1k80vxa,How to get along with people,"I work as a Medical office assistant. It’s my 2nd week in the job. t’s my first time doing this job, I don’t have any schooling or training. They trained me for 1 week and then put me on the spot. Most days I come 5-10 minutes late. Today, I came late and  we had 3 doctors and 1 girl opens at 7:30 and I work at 8:30. The next girl was going to come in at 9. And so forth so we would have like 5-6 ppl working during the evening. The first doctor starts at 8:30. I came in at 8:40 and before pulling up to the parking lot my supervisor called me and yelled at me for not letting her know I will be late (she had warned me about calling her if I will be late and for showing up on time). when I arrived my coworker made it a big deal and started saying in loud voice “ur late, u shouldn’t show up at this time.” I said “I talked to *supervisor name* about it.” As I proceeded to take patients blood pressure I overheard her directly telling the patient that she was stressed because I was late. She started talking about me to patients. I immediately asked her “who was one hour late?” She said “you were.” I said “u shouldn’t talk about me to patients that’s rude.” Then we went about our day with tension. Then I took her to the side to talk to her and she gaslighted me saying she never was talking about me and it’s always because I’m late that she is stressed. A day before this I discussed with my supervisor the reason I have been being late and that I’m working on it. I feel like me being late doesn’t equal to her talking about me to patients. My supervisor took her side and said I should work on being early and doctors are being upset about it (idk which doctor is upset about it bc I barely work alone with any of them directly, there’s always someone to handle it. Which I know I should work on being on time).

1k7xpfq,I feel lost.,"This will take about 5 minutes of your time, promise.

Hey, I’m a uk deck officer cadet. For those of you that don’t know that, I’m basically training to become a third officer on a ship. The final goal being captain.

You can skip this part if you’d like, but this is the reason why I’ve lost all my interest and love for this job.


1. Responsibility vs Pay.

The amount of responsibility you have as an officer is beyond what even seems reasonable, it makes sense, but the pay does not speak to the responsibility level. A small mistake can lose you your entire qualification, future employability, hefty fines and prison.


2. Downhill outlook for future of the industry

The marine industry has been dying for the last couple decades. Companies outsourcing work to china/ Philippines/Ukrainian/Indian. All guys who are willing to do the same job for a much lower salary. Also, the seafarers salary is up there with the few salaries that never changed with time, meaning we get paid about a third of what someone would’ve been paid in the 80s ~


3. Change of goals/lifestyle choice

I used to view the six months on and off as sustainable.
After doing a 6 month stint at sea, I saw that it was very hard, with some fun bits of course. But overall, not what I want. 


4. Working hours.

These are terrible. Legal requirements are completely ignored, some days you’re working for less than someone would get at McDonald’s as a third officer. Working 14 hour days sometimes but minimum 10-11 most of the time. 

I love the world of health and fitness, I study it on the side as a hobby, I also love analysing things and using my creativity to design.
I’m not talking artist but rather product and business ideas.

I really value a strong team environment in the workplace, where everyone feels valued.

Somewhere where I can express my creativity and not be bogged down with unrealistic deadlines that limit that.

I love learning new things, new skills especially but knowledge is great. I really enjoy improving myself in any way. And I try to help others achieve that in themselves too.


So why have I made you read all this?

I was doing the work without being hired into the role for 2 months before eventually getting hired after putting my foot down. I was also hired at a lesser salary than the previous analyst.

1k7x73b,Some helpful TIPS to boost your job search and career success,"Whether you’re just starting your career or looking to move to a new role, these strategies will help you gain clarity, confidence, and purpose in your search.

# 1. Job Search Tips: Finding Opportunities Like a Pro

A successful job search starts with knowing where to look. Let’s explore how to effectively leverage Google, job boards, and other search strategies to find high-quality job listings.

# Using Google for Advanced Job Search

Google is not just a search engine for finding answers it’s also a powerful tool for uncovering job opportunities. By refining your search terms, you can uncover positions that might not appear on mainstream job boards. Here’s how to use Google for a more targeted job search:

# Basic Search for Cloud or DevOps Roles

To begin, you can use Google’s advanced search syntax to pinpoint job listings that match your skill set. Here's a simple search query that you can try right away to find Cloud or DevOps positions in the UK or remote jobs:

`site:boards.greenhouse.io (""united Kingdom"" OR ""remote"" OR ""work from home"") intext:""apply"" (intext:""Cloud Engineer"" OR intext:""DevOps Engineer"")`

This search targets [Greenhouse.io](http://Greenhouse.io) job listings with the terms “Cloud Engineer” or “DevOps Engineer.” You can also filter for specific locations or work types, such as remote roles or jobs in the UK.

# Refining the Search for Newer Postings

To focus on the latest job listings, add a filter to show only positions posted recently. For example, you can search for jobs posted in the last 30 days by adding the after: operator:

`site:boards.greenhouse.io (""united Kingdom"" OR ""remote"" OR ""work from home"") intext:""apply"" (intext:""Cloud Engineer"" OR intext:""DevOps Engineer"") after:2024-03-24`

This will help you stay up to date with current job openings.

Remember, the job market is constantly changing, and new positions are posted every day, so check back regularly.

# Expanding Your Search

Don’t limit yourself to just one site. You can use the same search structure across multiple job boards to broaden your search.

Here are some additional job sites to try:

`site:cwjobs.co.uk`

`site:jobserve.com`

`site:technojobs.co.uk`

`site:reed.co.uk`

`site:totaljobs.com`

`site:cv-library.co.uk`

`site:weworkremotely.com`

`site:remoteok.com`

`site:workable.com`

`site:stackoverflow.com/jobs`

These websites often list job opportunities in tech, including Cloud and DevOps positions, making them a great resource for your search.

# Setting Up Google Alerts for Job Notifications

Google Alerts are a great tool to keep you informed about new job openings. By setting up custom alerts, you can receive notifications whenever a job matching your search terms is posted. This ensures that you never miss an opportunity.

For example, you could set an alert for ""Cloud Engineer"" roles with the following search term:

`""Cloud Engineer"" site:boards.greenhouse.io`

You can also customize the alert frequency to suit your needs (e.g., daily or weekly).

This is an easy way to automate your job search process and stay ahead of the competition.

# 2. Crafting an Impressive CV

Your CV is your first chance to impress potential employers, so it’s essential to make it stand out. A well-crafted CV showcases your skills and accomplishments, increasing your chances of landing interviews.

# Key Elements to Make Your CV Stand Out

# 1. Start with a Strong Opening

Begin with a strong introduction that highlights who you are, what you do, and your key credentials or achievements. Your opening should immediately communicate your value to the hiring manager. For example:

* “Experienced Cloud Engineer with 5+ years of hands-on expertise in designing, implementing, and managing scalable cloud solutions for high-growth companies.”

# 2. Use Action-Oriented Bullet Points

Under each role, focus on results and achievements. Use clear, results-driven bullet points that demonstrate how you added value to your previous employers. For example:

* Led a team of 5 engineers in designing and deploying a cloud-based infrastructure that reduced costs by 20%.
* Improved deployment pipeline efficiency, reducing deployment time by 40%.
* Implemented automated monitoring tools, improving system uptime by 30%. These action verbs and specific results will make your experience more compelling.

# 3. Keep Formatting Consistent

Consistency is key when formatting your CV. Use the same font, spacing, and bullet point style throughout the document to maintain a professional appearance. A clean, well-organized CV is easier to read and will make a strong impression.

# 4. Simplify for Readability

Consider creating a second, simplified version of your CV with one-liner bullet points. This version can serve as a quick overview of your experience, making it easier for recruiters to scan. For example:

* **Cloud Engineer** | Company ABC (2019–Present)
* Built and maintained a scalable cloud infrastructure.
* Automated deployment pipelines, reducing deployment time.
* Led the migration of legacy systems to the cloud. This layout improves readability, especially when you’re submitting your CV through online portals where recruiters may only skim it.

# Downloadable CV Template

I’ve attached a CV template that you can use as a guide. Customize it to fit your experience, and remember to tailor your CV to each role you’re applying for.

# 3. Before You Apply – Research the Company

Before applying for a job, take the time to research the company. This will not only help you tailor your application but also prepare you for interviews.

# Researching the Company

# Explore the Company’s Mission and Roadmap:

Find out what the company stands for, its mission, and its long-term goals. Look at their latest news, product launches, or updates to understand where they’re headed.

# Check out Key Team Members:

se LinkedIn to research the team and key figures in the company, including the hiring manager. Understanding who’s leading the team will give you insights into their work culture and what they’re looking for in a candidate.

# Look at Recent Projects or Product Launches:

Dive into recent blogs, open-source contributions, or product launches. This will help you understand the challenges the company is tackling and allow you to tailor your application to show how your skills align with their needs.

# Personalizing Your CV and Outreach

Once you’ve gathered all this information, you can personalize your outreach to recruiters or hiring managers.

A tailored cover letter or LinkedIn message showing that you’ve done your homework will make you stand out among other applicants. You could even consider visiting their office in person to drop off your CV, bypassing some of the automated screening processes. It’s an unconventional approach but one that could leave a strong impression.

# 4. Interview Preparation Tips

Preparing for an interview goes beyond reviewing your CV—it’s about showcasing your skills, experience, and personality in the best light possible.

# 1. Update Your CV with Fresh Accomplishments

As you approach interviews, take the time to update your CV with any recent achievements. Adding the latest projects or successes will give you more talking points during the interview.

# 2. Practice Interview Questions with AI Tools

Use tools like ChatGPT to practice answering common interview questions. This will help you refine your answers and ensure that you present your experience confidently and clearly.

# 3. Focus on Key Areas of Your Experience

Identify 2-3 key areas in your background that you want to highlight during the interview. These could be specific projects, skills, or accomplishments that are relevant to the job.

# 4. Memorize Your CV and Be Prepared to Elaborate

1k7x4ea,Advice on current job?,"Long story short, i work as a carer in public health sector. Good benefits, the pay increments, and work schedule can be adjusted. I am mid 30s with 2 young kids, wife also work in healthcare but in private sector.

I also have background in computers as I finished computer science degree back in 2013 but never had luck getting job in computer field.

Recently manager asked if im good in computers as they need help to input data from hand written data into excel, i felt like i need to step up and help as they are really flexible with my schedule, and usually when i need leaves they grant it. 

I said yes and i showed them my college degree. So they asked if i can help them so i said yes. It took 3 x 12 hrs shift days to complete the inputting that they wanted. And they even remove me off the ward to work in the office during my normal work day. Its was good they were impressed with my computer skills. 

Here's the catch now, because the managers didn't really have good computer skills now they added again more computer work on me and they wanted me to finish the whole data inputting on top of that one manager want me to also make flyers. 

I am confuse now, i felt like i am getting more responsibility than when I was in the ward because in the ward you get fixed break times. And you do your shift and when the shift ends you go out the door. 

What should I do? It happened before that one carer from our unit who also have a computer background got  transferred into admin job. 

Should I negotiate with them before doing more things for them.

1k7ww3b,"As a Hiring Manager I’ve Reviewed possible close to 10,000+ Resumes and interviewed more than 3000 people. Here’s how you can increase your chances.","# As a Hiring Manager I’ve reviewed possible close to 10,000+ Resumes and interviewed more than 3000 people. Here’s how you can increase your chances.

The competition for jobs has never been fiercer. Whether you’re applying for a high-level leadership position or a technical role, your resume is often the first and sometimes the only impression you’ll make on a recruiter or hiring manager. I’ve reviewed over 20,000 resumes in my career, and over time, I’ve seen what works, what doesn’t, and what truly stands out.

I’m going to break down the key elements that you need to include in your CV to make sure it rises above the noise, ensuring that you’re considered for the role you deserve.

# 1. Tailor Your Resume to Each Job

When applying for a job, it's crucial that your resume speaks directly to the specific role. This isn’t just about changing a few words or adjusting the headline—this is about showing how you’re the perfect fit for the job.

**Why does this matter?**

Hiring managers are drowning in applications. They’ve got limited time to quickly assess candidates. So, a generic resume is a huge turn-off. A tailored resume shows you’re serious, and that you’ve taken the time to understand the company’s needs.

**How to do it:**

* **Job Descriptions**: Read the job description carefully. Identify the top 3-5 skills or qualifications the employer is seeking, and make sure they’re visible in your resume. Don’t just list them—**highlight your experience that demonstrates those skills**.
* **Company Fit**: Understand the company's culture and mission. If they value innovation, show how you've contributed to new ideas or improvements in previous roles. If they prioritize efficiency, show examples of how you’ve streamlined processes.
* **Use Keywords**: Many companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to screen resumes. These systems look for specific keywords from the job description. If you’re not including those keywords, your resume might never even be seen by a real person.

# 2. Show Your Impact, Not Just Your Duties

Gone are the days when you could get away with listing just your job duties. **Hiring managers want to know what you’ve achieved**, not just what you’ve been tasked with. Your resume should highlight your ability to produce results.

**Why does this matter?**

Your past achievements are the best indicator of future performance. If you can show concrete results in your past roles, recruiters will have a much clearer idea of what you’ll bring to the table.

**How to do it:**

* **Use Metrics**: Whenever possible, include numbers. For example, instead of saying ""Managed a team,"" say ""Managed a team of 10, achieving a 25% increase in productivity."" Numbers give a clear picture of the scale of your impact.
* **Action Verbs**: Use strong action verbs that convey leadership and achievement. Phrases like “Led,” “Optimized,” “Increased,” or “Implemented” are much more powerful than passive verbs like “Responsible for” or “Assisted with.”
* **Context**: Don’t just list results in a vacuum. Explain the situation, the action you took, and the result (SAR or STAR method). For instance, “Reduced customer complaints by 40% by implementing a new feedback system,” is far more powerful than just saying “Handled customer complaints.”

# 3. Structure Your Resume for Readability

A resume that’s difficult to read is a resume that will be quickly discarded. You have seconds to grab a hiring manager's attention, and that means your resume needs to be **scannable**, organized, and clear.

**Why does this matter?**

Clarity is key. If your resume is hard to read or poorly formatted, it immediately gives the impression that you can’t communicate well or aren’t detail-oriented—qualities that are crucial in almost every role.

**How to do it:**

* **Sections and Headers**: Break your resume into clear, concise sections such as “Professional Experience,” “Education,” “Skills,” and “Certifications.” Use headers to organize the information, and make sure everything is aligned for easy readability.
* **Bullet Points**: Use bullet points rather than paragraphs to describe your achievements and responsibilities. This makes your resume more digestible and easier to scan.
* **Font and Design**: Choose a clean, professional font (like Arial, Helvetica, or Calibri). Avoid using too many different fonts or colors. Use a 10-12 point font size for the body, and keep it consistent throughout the document.
* **White Space**: Ensure your resume isn’t too crowded. Use margins and spacing to give your resume room to breathe. Too much text can overwhelm the reader.

# 4. Focus on Skills, Especially Technical and Soft Skills

Employers are looking for a mix of technical and soft skills. While hard skills are often easier to showcase, soft skills are what truly differentiate you as a top performer in your field.

**Why does this matter?**

Skills are what make you an asset to any team. The right blend of technical expertise and interpersonal abilities makes you versatile and valuable in the eyes of hiring managers.

**How to do it:**

* **Technical Skills**: List the technical tools, systems, or software you’re proficient in, especially those relevant to the job you're applying for. For example, if you're a software engineer, list the languages, frameworks, or tools you know (e.g., Java, Python, AWS, GitHub).
* **Soft Skills**: While harder to quantify, soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and leadership are crucial. Use real examples in your work history to demonstrate these skills. For example, “Led a team of 5 to deliver a project two weeks ahead of schedule” shows leadership and time management.
* **Certification**: If you have any certifications (e.g., PMP, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, etc.), make sure to include them in a prominent place on your resume. Certifications prove you have expertise in certain areas and are continuously learning.

# 5. Be Strategic with the Experience Section

Your experience section is often the heart of your resume. How you present it can make or break your chances of landing an interview.

**Why does this matter?**

Recruiters want to quickly see if you have the experience they’re looking for. A well-organized, results-driven experience section will make a stronger case than one that just lists job titles and responsibilities.

**How to do it:**

* **Reverse Chronological Order**: List your most recent job first and work backward. This allows employers to quickly see your latest and most relevant experience.
* **Highlight Relevant Experience**: Tailor this section to each job application. If a job requires project management experience, highlight roles or tasks where you led projects, even if they were not your primary job responsibility.
* **Prioritize Impact**: Lead with achievements over responsibilities. Start each bullet point with a strong action verb and tie it to a specific result.

# 6. Education and Certifications: Get Them in the Right Place

Your education section can be a strong selling point, but you need to place it strategically, especially if you’ve been working for a number of years.

**Why does this matter?**

For most roles, employers prioritize experience over education, but your educational background can set you apart from other candidates, especially if you’ve completed relevant courses or certifications.

**How to do it:**

* **Education Placement**: If you’ve been in the workforce for a while, your education should go at the end of the resume. If you’re a recent graduate or don’t have much work experience, place it higher up.
* **Relevant Certifications**: Include any certifications that enhance your qualifications for the role. For example, certifications in data science, cloud computing, or Agile project management can be powerful additions.

# 7. Don’t Forget the Personal Touch

In today’s job market, it’s not just about what you’ve done, but who you are. If you’re applying for a role that requires creativity, innovation, or customer interaction, it’s important to show your personality and passion for the work you do.

**Why does this matter?**

A hiring manager wants to know who you are as a person—not just what you’ve done in previous roles. Adding a personal touch shows that you’re enthusiastic and genuinely interested in the company or industry.

**How to do it:**

* **Summary/Objective**: Write a concise professional summary or objective at the top of your resume that highlights your passion, experience, and what you can bring to the company.
* **Volunteer Work and Hobbies**: If applicable, include any volunteer work, side projects, or personal interests that are relevant to the job. This can showcase your personality and commitment to causes outside of work.

# 8. Proofread and Edit

Before you hit send, make sure your resume is flawless. Spelling errors or poor grammar can immediately disqualify you from consideration.

**Why does this matter?**

Attention to detail is crucial. A single typo on your resume can give the impression that you don’t care enough about the role to put in the effort. Make sure your resume is polished and professional.

**How to do it:**

* **Multiple Rounds of Editing**: Proofread your resume multiple times, and consider having someone else look at it too. A fresh pair of eyes might catch errors you’ve missed.
* **Check Formatting**: Make sure everything is properly aligned, the fonts are consistent, and there are no awkward line breaks or spacing issues.

Your resume is more than just a list of past jobs—it’s your personal brand. It’s your chance to show employers why you’re the best candidate for the job. By tailoring your resume, showing your impact, focusing on the right skills, and presenting your experience strategically, you’re putting yourself in the best position to land the job you want.",Hopeful_Stretch_9707,0,0.27000001072883606,4,1745617754,2025-04-25 21:49:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k7ww3b/as_a_hiring_manager_ive_reviewed_possible_close/,4,2025
1k7wvz9,"My current company is doing very poorly financially, but they say they want to avoid layoffs. Should I be applying to new jobs?","Almost immediately after my current company hired me, info started being circulated that indicated they were doing very poorly financially. Final 2024 data showed that they lost over $500mm just last year and wiped out half of their strategic reserve. Their optimistic timeline is a 2.5 - 3 year pathway back to profitability.

The company maintains that they want to avoid layoffs if they can, but said they'll know if they were needed by late May. I'm in marketing and they've already said campaigns and budgets are getting slashed. I'm also the newest employee and my boss was doing it solo before me.

I should be looking for jobs right? I really like this job and my co-workers, but it feels like I'm just waiting around for the shoe to drop. I'm really just concerned the layoffs won't be needed and I'll have potentially left a good job for nothing.

1k7wsoj,Just found out a colleague is on £20k more than me for the same role — feeling disheartened and unsure how to navigate my next salary conversation,"Hi all,

I’m a 27F working remotely in the UK as an IT Business Consultant. I’ve been in the industry since graduating in 2021, starting in Big 4 for two years before joining my current company, where I’ve now worked for 2.5 years. I generally enjoy my job and have had some great experiences here — but something happened today that’s really thrown me.

I found out that someone who joined in the same role as me is earning £55k, while I started on £32k now 35k. We’re at the same level/title, and while I acknowledge she has more experience, the gap feels… massive? Like, £20k for the same job title, same company? It’s made me question my value and how the company sees me.

To make things more complicated, I’m currently in the process of moving to Canada and trying to land a role with the same company over there. It will be a promotion and jump in responsibilities from a consultant to an operational change manager. It’s not an official transfer (my decision to move), so I’m covering all costs myself — visa, rent, flights, everything. A director made a comment recently about how I’m “cheaper for clients,” which felt like a red flag that I might be lowballed again.

I have a salary discussion scheduled for Monday to talk about the Canadian role, and I’m honestly a bit nervous. I don’t want to accept less than I’m worth again, especially with this huge move ahead of me.

Has anyone been through something similar? How do I approach this salary conversation confidently and fairly? Should I bring up the pay disparity? Or focus on market rates in Canada and the value I bring? What do I do if she offers the new salary in line with my current?

Any advice, scripts, or even just solidarity would be appreciated.",Away_Pineapple_9960,5,1.0,17,1745617501,2025-04-25 21:45:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k7wsoj/just_found_out_a_colleague_is_on_20k_more_than_me/,4,2025
1k7wrxf,Should I negotiate for more in this scenario?,"I’ve been through 5 interviews with a company, and ultimately received an offer.
In my head I had a few offer expectations and what my reaction would be.

1. The bare minimum that I would accept.

2. A low amount that I’d be happy with, but would try to negotiate for more. 

3. A high amount that I’d be happy with and wouldn’t try to negotiate for more

4. A peak amount that I’d be ecstatic about

-

I received the offer today, the base salary is $2k away from the salary that I told myself I wouldn’t negotiate for higher

And then there’s performance based bonuses that if met would put me right at my peak amount.

Should I try to negotiate or just accept?

On one hand this is pretty much what I was hoping for, but on the other hand I have always regretted not negotiating at previous jobs. 

At this point in my career I have solid experience, and while my job titles have always sounded good, I have always been underpaid.

1k7vf57,How I survived the toughest job market as an international student,"I landed a full-time job and got 2 internships before graduating in May. That’s the result of 2,300+ applications for both internship and full-time positions. As an international student I can't tell how many rejections were because of sponsorship or my qualifications. I want to share my experience as a reference for other international students. I was extremely anxious and goal-less, but finally, I made it. I just want you to know, the journey is long and tough. If you decide not to give up, just hang in there and keep going, you’re not alone.

In the first several months, my resume was a complete mess. I didn’t know I needed to tailor my resume to the job roles I was applying for. My resume had no keywords, wasn’t written in STAR format, and included both related and unrelated experiences for the positions.

In the following 3 months, I realized my problems. I built 3 versions of my resume targeted at 3 different areas using ChatGPT. I started receiving interview invitations, but I could barely pass the phone screen or the second round. I used AMA Interview to help me predict interview questions for my resumes and specific job roles, and practice mock interviews based on the different interview stages. I used my ""targeted"" resumes to apply for about 200 jobs on Indeed, then started using Handshake as well. I applied to about 600 jobs in total, but the result was clear: 0 replies, not even one rejection letter. I gradually realized that different job roles have different focuses. I started making 6 versions of my resume for the 6 roles I was focusing on and also began preparing structured answers for phone screens and behavioral questions. During this period, I landed my first internship through Handshake. I finally had some work experience I could put on my resume.

The first one is always the hardest. It took me almost 6 months. From there, my internship search became smoother. I received my second internship while still doing my first one. I got several referrals from alumni and even final round interview invitations, but I was rejected by all. There was nothing I could do but accept the reality that students who require sponsorship are always the last candidates they consider. Still, these 2 internships gave me valuable working experience of real-world problems. I continued practicing mock interviews and felt more confident in the process. When I was stuck in job searching and anxious about the future, I received a full-time return offer from my second internship.

The full-time job took me over 2300 applications, hundreds of sleepless nights, and a bit of luck. I truly cherish this opportunity and hope to see a better version of myself in the future. To the millions of international students out there, please don’t give up.

1k7v56c,"2100 applications, 300+ networking emails, 31 interviews, 5 final rounds, 1 offer","If you're still searching, you're not failing.

I started applying for jobs in **spring 2023**. I got my offer in **winter 2025**. In between those two dates was 18 months of endless doubt, and more silence than I thought I could survive. At first, I believed that hard work would be enough. I had 4 internships during college, 2 were big names, and a decent GPA. I thought if I just applied to enough jobs, someone would see my potential. So I applied blindly, hundreds of applications every month to any role that looked close. At the time, all I knew was that I felt invisible. I stopped for a while, not because I gave up, but because I couldn’t keep going like that. But one day, after yet another final round, the call finally came.

**Resume Customization**: Six resumes tailored to six different kinds of jobs. Rewrote my experience until it matched the job descriptions, using ChatGPT to align every bullet point to every new posting.  
**Interview Prep:** I used AMA Interviews to check their real interview question lists and question prediction based on my resumes and job roles. Honestly, according to my countless internship interviews (it's way easier than full-time lol), I found most of the big names their questions are really repetitive, so focusing on real questions is smarter. I practiced my behavior question cheatsheets and mocked case study on the subway, whispering STAR answers to myself like a script I couldn’t quite get right.  
**Job Role Searching:** I stopped relying on LinkedIn Easy Apply and started applying through company websites, cold messaging recruiters, searching for roles at startups that never made it to the big job boards. I started focusing on specific job roles rather than a big area. It definitely wasn't easy. I still had months with no replies. I still joined networking calls pretending I was confident when most of the time I felt like a complete fraud.

After 18 months of trying, I was too tired for that. I just sat there quietly, holding onto the fact that finally, someone saw me. If you're still searching, please know this: you're not failing. You're not invisible. This market is brutal and unforgiving, but it does not define your worth. Apply less, but apply better. Talk to people. Ask for help.

1k7uyxx,I'm Struggling to Find Work as a Software Engineer When I've Never Had a Problem Before,"Up until about three months ago, I used to live in the UK. I've been a full stack software engineer for about 5-6ish years now, and I've genuinely never had problems finding work. There's never been a gap in my career, I've always gotten high evaluations for internal reviews at whatever company I work at, and I've generally always gotten a job offer assuming I've gotten an interview. 

  
I moved to the US on a marriage visa (I've got a green card, full legal right to work, etc.) but I've been applying for jobs for about two months now with absolutely no luck whatsoever. I'm not sure if it's just the job market for full stack software engineering, whether I'm just missing something about how US recruitment differs, or just how I'm applying for things. 

  
For context, I've tried these things so far:

* Applying for jobs directly on LinkedIn, Indeed, corporate websites, etc. 
   * I've had about a 0.5-1% success rate with this. I don't think I've gotten to an interview whatsoever with this strategy, I'll either get the occasional ""we're not moving forward with your application"" or just nothing whatsoever. I've recently tried messaging a recruiter directly or connecting directly on LinkedIn after applying, but I'm either getting nothing back or it's not really helping at all.

* Reaching out to recruiters on LinkedIn
   * I've had a bit of luck with this? I've gotten one or two promising leads, but they've fizzled out, or it's just been a really tough tech interview that I've bombed out of. Funnily enough the best chances I've had so far are with recruiters reaching out to me directly, although I feel like I have no control whatsoever over getting them to message me. I'm just getting them by sheer luck sometimes. 
* Posting that I'm open to work, etc
   * This has gotten me some attention, but doesn't really feel like it's getting me far.
* Asking for referrals
   * I've tried this once or twice, but more or less exhausted this avenue. Most of my professional network still lives in the UK and there aren't many people who work for companies that also have a US presence. 



At this point, I'm not really sure what else I'm supposed to do. The main things that I think might be tripping me up are:

* I'm getting kicked out by an ATS. I'm not sure if this is the case. I've had my CV/Resume reviewed by a few professionals and I've checked to see if it still reads okay after going through an ATS. I'm happy to post my resume here if anyone else wants though
* Employers assume I don't have legal right to work due to my career experience all being in the UK. I'm genuinely not sure how to fix this if this is the problem.

  
I realise it's not been long compared to how some other people in the field have been looking, but I'm kind of ready to give up. I'm not really sure what I can do differently at this point, so I'm open to any and all advice here. I'm kind of at the end of my rope, and I don't know if it's just because this is the first time I've had to look for a job in about 2-3 years, because I'm looking in a new country, whether I'm just out of date in terms of skills, or some combination of the three. 

  
It's also getting me more and more anxious, as the longer I wait, the more out of date and rusty my skills get. I enjoy software engineering, but I really don't have an interest in doing it much outside of my work.

1k7uwfs,24F in Decision Paralysis,"Hi all,

I graduated last year with a BA in Human Communications. I’m currently working a dead-end, low paying office job (very boring/unfulfilling and the company would be fine if my position didn’t exist). I have been applying for other positions for four months with zero luck (yes I have tried networking, revamping my resume, and LinkedIn premium). I know the corporate, 8-5 life isn’t for me, not unless it was working for a passion of mine and remote/hybrid. What can I possibly do to take a step of out my stagnant life? 

Brainstorming here:
1. Find roommates to save money, work part time nannying/retail and focus on a passion (Writing a book, creating sustainable clothing used thrifted fabrics, getting my TEFL for teaching abroad) Con: financially unstable 
2. Focus on getting my Google Project Management Certificate and CAPM and look for work in the nonprofit industry, Con: I’ll have to stay in my current position for the foreseeable future
3. Go for a master’s abroad (in what?) Con: could be a huge waste of money and not helpful
4. Au Pairing, Con: wouldn’t make much progress for my resume unless I want to transition to childcare full time 

I feel like your career is your life since it takes up the majority of your time, and while no one dreams of labor, something needs to change so I can feel like I have a purpose and secure future. What’s some tangible I, as an average person, can learn to make myself more marketable (math and coding are a no)? How can I fuse my passions (education, sustainability, human rights, literature, travel) with a career? What should I commit to? 

Any advice is appreciated! ",gummybearskye,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1745612627,2025-04-25 20:23:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k7uwfs/24f_in_decision_paralysis/,4,2025

1k7tztb,Job Seekers - The Key to Finding Momentum,"As a personal career consultant and coach with 20+ years of leadership experience, I was inspired to write this little bit after recently speaking to a job seeker who spent *$500* on a single resume. The resume writing ""professional"" had no direction or ultimate goal because the client didn't know what those were when asked. The resume ""professional"" had simply made vague promises of ATS compliance, guaranteed interviews and provided a slick marketing deck. That was a year ago. So much for promises. 

Here's my advice. Before you throw your valuable time and money at a tool like a resume (or someone who is just a resume writer, let's be honest), let's talk about something I don't see coming up nearly enough...

**Know the story that you want to tell! Once you understand your story, only then can you effectively build the tools and framework to support you as you tell it. From executives down to college graduates, this is proven true time and again for me.** 

Your story provides insight, direction and motivations not just for you but for those around you. It gives you confidence, clearly defining your challenges, how you've triumphed over them and with whom. It highlights direction, reminding us of past lessons and mistakes which allow us to better project future moments. It makes us better decision makers.

If you cannot tell your professional story, if you cannot provide real world examples to back up what you're saying, if you do not know what kind of base level value you bring to *any* organization, go back to the beginning and start understanding your story. 

I'm always here to help people get started, PM me if you don't know your story and we can find it together. ",Work-Happier,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1745610305,2025-04-25 19:45:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k7tztb/job_seekers_the_key_to_finding_momentum/,4,2025

1k7tkng,Need Advice: pushing back the start date I provided in my internship interview,"I recently had an interview for a summer internship. The position could either be in-person or remote– they didn’t specify yet– but it seems most likely it will be in-person and in another state.

When the interviewees asked when I could start, I foolishly gave the date when my college semester ends. I failed to take into account that I would need to give a 2 weeks notice at my current job and, if the position is in-person, probably at least another week to relocate across the country.

I currently work on the weekends. Therefore, if the new position is remote, I could probably start on the date I originally provided given I only work the new job on the weekdays.

How should I deal with this situation? Should I email the interviewers ASAP or is it better to wait till I get the offer and confirm whether the position is in-person or remote, or something else? Should I quit my current position without notice and burn bridges?

I thought my interview went well, but I'm worried I'm going to make a bad impression by pushing the date back.

Thank you for the help.

1k7sa7n,How bad of a move is it to back out of a job accepted for a different company?,"For context I’m currently on the job market and after accepting an offer and having it pulled I just now finally got another offer. I had another role that I had yet to interview for but the company asked me to give them an answer by the end of the week so I simply accepted because I felt I had to. I’m fine with this role, but after having the interview I’m now unsure which of the two is the better opportunity. If I decide I’d rather go with the other positions, are there legal issues to that? Or is it just kind of like burning a bridge?

For context on the two positions. The one I accepted is a full time position for a small healthcare company. 2 days a week on site with like an hour commute each way for 80000 annually.

The other role is a contract to hire opportunity for Comcast, the much larger company obviously. This role is 4 days a week on site but more like a 20 minute commute and pays $40/hr. The team here is also way cooler and friendlier.

I’m on the fence on which I prefer, the full time position has great benefits and combined with the 36 days of PTO, pays better. but I’m on my parents health insurance so I will be covered for medical purposes. Comcast being as large as it is looks better on my resume going forward and offers a lot more internal opportunity, particularly because I hope to move to a new city/ country in the next year or so if I’m able to, however since it’s contract there’s no guarantee i would even be brought on full time. 

I would love advice on how bad it is for me to pull my acceptance of the offer in the event one is offered at Comcast, or advice on which of these roles I should choose.

Currently, hate my job because the position basically is I am assigned anything that is IT related from looking into some antique software configuration issues, create reports for management to fixing hardware issue. The problem is at this point, I despise my job and I have almost forgotten anything development related skills, nuances or even the framework once I worked on.

We had a meeting with HR saying that we need to pass on our legacy and this needs to be a peaceful transfer. They made it seem like we were volunteer leaving and that this is a good thing for us and the company to continue running smoothly. 


They are asking us to fill out a 75 line excel sheet of every job we are a part of, what our daily tasks are, what we did, what programs we use, etc. Then it asks for historical context, time allocation, and collaboration, documents and previous feedback of each and every job. This thing is 75 lines I am absolutely not exaggerating. 


THEN they want us to set up time 2 hours per WEEK for 6 WEEKS with the hub in india to talk them through how to do our job and how to do our projects.

1k7qeh5,Career Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice from those who have been through something similar.

I currently work as a Design Technologist at a hydro/electric company (hired December 2024) in Ontario, Canada. I hold both an Electrical Engineering Technologist diploma (graduated 2018) and a B.Eng. in Power Systems Engineering (graduated 2023). I’ll be eligible to apply for my P.Eng. in August 2026.

Before this role, I worked at a private consulting company starting in 2018 after graduating with my technologist diploma. Over time, I moved from a Design Technologist position into Project Coordinator and later Senior Design Technologist roles — all while going back to school part-time to complete my engineering degree.

Right now, I’m in a good spot — I earn around $97K/year, am in a union, have excellent benefits, and enjoy a great work/life balance. However, I want to fully utilize my degree and eventually move into a Distribution Engineer role at my current company — ideally sooner rather than later.

My concern is that staying too long as a Design Technologist might make me lose some of the technical knowledge I learned in school. I’m also worried it could make future internal interviews harder if I’m not actively using deeper engineering skills day-to-day.

On top of that, I just feel uncertain and unsure what my next move should be. I genuinely want to stay with this company — it’s located in my hometown and is only a 10-minute drive from home, which has been a huge boost to my overall quality of life.

A few specific questions I have:
	•	Is staying in a Design Technologist role hurting my chances of eventually securing an engineering position at this company?
	•	Once I get my P.Eng. in 2026, how long should I realistically wait for an engineering job to be posted or offered internally?
	•	If no engineering positions come up soon after getting my P.Eng., should I start applying elsewhere, even if I like this company?
	•	Should I have applied to the Distribution Engineer posting that came up two months ago, even though I was still very new?
	•	What can I be doing now to stay sharp and better prepare myself for when an opportunity does come up?

For context, I did let the Director of Engineering know that my long-term goal is to become a Distribution Engineer. That said, I’m not sure how often those positions actually open up internally.

Any advice, tips, or personal experiences would be hugely appreciated.

1k7q4ws,How to deal with an awful manager?,"Context: I’ve been working at my current job (Government) for three years. Part of a very small group of four that is in one, of, many sections of our organization. I’ve had the same manager the entire time.

I work government, tons of dysfunction in government but it’s fairly low stress so I put up with it. Over the last few years I’ve dealt with my manager, they micromanage every little detail. I can’t even talk to other people in our organization without them getting upset with me. We’ve created group chats for every task we do with other sections of our organization so they know what I’m saying to other groups and monitor everything we do (even though prior to this I would tell them everything I was working on).

They also never invite me to meetings or add me to email chains on projects we’re working on, which I believe is malicious because how do you forget one of your three employees, then expect me to know what is going on. Now I haven’t been given any new work in weeks while my coworkers have gotten multiple projects to work on.

On top of that, they don’t include any of us in conversations that are important to all the work we do (e.g a meeting that talked about the specifics of a grant we’re working on). It feels like they’re trying to keep us in the dark.

They don’t listen to people, they talk over everyone and uses canned language as a response to nearly everything, literally sounds like AI and try to mask being rude by being overly positive.

I’ve had people come to me directly in the past because they couldn’t work with them but people can’t do that anymore because we’re being required to post everything in group chats. Now I get anxious when talking to anyone not in my immediate circle at work and sound like a fool because I start stumbling over my words because I don’t want to talk to anyone because I don’t want an hour (not exaggerating) lecture from my manager.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. They’re also very incompetent with the specifics of what we do. Never try to improve anything and will piggyback off what others do and claim success from it.

They never get called out for their behavior. As I mentioned earlier, it’s government… the turnover is so high they will keep anyone if they stay.

I don’t want to find another job, I hate looking for other jobs and they pay me fairly well. But I’m afraid that if I have to deal with this for any longer I’m going to crash out and quit with no plan.

I'd like to keep at it, but I feel the relationship with my boss won't get any better and I've lost interest in the job, so I feel like I should be looking for a way out

So please suggest me what would be the best major i can study for my master that can help with job search. 

PLEASE DONT comment stuff like ' dont go to korea' 'situation is bad there' 'you cant survive' shit like that etc. And pls dont suggest STEM.

1k7npl7,"2+ yrs as UI/UX + Frontend Dev (React, Next.js, React Native) — Handling complex projects, leading design & dev, promoted to SE, but stuck at Rs 12 LPA. Am I underpaid? How to negotiate to 18–20?","Hey guys, I’ve been working for a company as a UI/UX designer and frontend engineer for more than 2 years now. Could anyone help me understand how much the CTC should be based on the current market, if anyone has any ideas?



In my day-to-day work, I develop frontend using TypeScript, Next.js, React, React Native, Redux, API integration, Webflow, manage projects, review PRs, and handle some other minor tasks too.



So far, I’ve worked on 2 React Native projects, 4–5 React and Next.js projects, and 1–2 Webflow projects. Around 60–70% of these projects were quite complex, involving RBAC creation, graph building, cache management, etc.



In the UI/UX part, I’ve designed 3–4 projects, out of which 1–2 were from scratch, and 1 was a redesign.



I’m the only guy who takes care of any design task in the company. Initially, before I and one more frontend dev joined, the team used to do only backend-heavy projects. Now the frontend team has become more technically strong than backend—me and one of my colleagues pushed a lot. Regarding the UI/UX work, it seems like to win the project, management often offers the client to do the UI for free, hence it’s not reflecting in on hike😅.



When I started, my salary was 7 LPA, then it became 9.5 LPA, and this year it’s close to 12 LPA which I was negotiating last year only😂. Correct me if I’m wrong, but looking at the roles and tasks I’m doing, I think it’s quite low—if I’m being too critical—considering the current job market and the hikes other companies are offering.



Last year, I upgraded myself at a good pace and I can see the management acknowledged my efforts. I received Best Employee with an A++ rating, etc. However, if I compare my efforts and the amount I get in hand, it feels like it’s a little less. I’m not sure what the evaluation criteria are, but it seems like they evaluated my performance based only on frontend work and ignored all the UI/UX contributions.



In my company, there are a couple of roles. This time I got promoted to Software Engineer, and other colleagues who were promoted to the same role are getting the same hike. I’m now thinking—if I had focused only on frontend development, I could’ve promoted myself to Senior Software Engineer, considering the pace and volume of work I did last year.



There were 3 projects that completely depended on me:

	•	In one, I was reviewing code and managing other developers—this is also the one where I redesigned the UI.

	•	In another, I scaffolded the project from start to end, reviewed PRs with pixel perfection, worked with a part-time developer, and contributed around 70–80%. The tech stack was mostly Next.js and Strapi in the backend. I also developed the whole Strapi backend.

	•	The third one involved high contribution, lots of code cleanup, and tight deadlines. I often worked late into the night, sometimes till 1–2 AM, putting in 11–13 hours a day.



Stuff I do as a frontend engineer:

	1.	Tech stack: Proficient in React, React Native, TypeScript, Next.js, Redux, Playwright & Tailwind CSS

	2.	Development: Built modules & features with a focus on implementation & code quality

	3.	Layouts & Debugging: Handled complex layouts, debugging & testing

	4.	UI Testing: Ensured pixel-perfect UI & collaborated with the team

	5.	Code Quality: Wrote clean, maintainable code, reviewed PRs in depth

	6.	CI/CD: Managed continuous integration & deployment

	7.	Version Control: Created high-quality PRs & commit messages

	8.	Unit Testing: Wrote unit tests with Jest for UI components

	9.	E2E Testing: Integrated Playwright for critical functionality checks



As a designer:

	1.	Collaboration: Worked with clients & designers to create branding & platforms

	2.	UI/UX: Led UI/UX design for multiple products, improved user experience

	3.	Reusability: Used auto-layout & reusable components for consistency

	4.	User Feedback: Refined designs based on user feedback

	5.	Branding: Designed logos & branding elements for various projects

	6.	Task Management: Handled multiple design tasks & met deadlines



⸻



Could anyone please help me understand:

Am I doing something wrong here?

I lack a bit in communication, but I tried to improve last year and I’m now at a stage where—though not with clients—anyone in the internal team can work easily with me. As per my lead, I haven’t received any negative feedback so far.



Now I want to understand what I should do to push myself beyond and at least reach 18–20 LPA. I’d appreciate any help. Just to let you know, the job is remote (WFH). Looking at the salary, I’m not getting enough motivation to work anymore.



What are some things I can do or share to negotiate better?

And what would be a reasonable amount to ask for or should I switch?",FreedomMysterious641,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1745594747,2025-04-25 15:25:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k7npl7/2_yrs_as_uiux_frontend_dev_react_nextjs_react/,4,2025
1k7neo5,Job offer or scam?? (NYCHH),"I have been throwing a lot of applications out on LinkedIn for admin & HR roles. I recently got a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter with NYCHH advertising a job and an email to send my resume to. The recruiters page is full of employment history, connections, recommendations, and a long history of posting recruiting events and such for NYCHH. When I emailed them my resume, I was immediately offered the role without interview. It’s a WFH admin assistant role, flex hours, good pay & benefits offered. I followed up saying I feel it’s important for both employer / employee to interview to get a better feel for each other and the recruiter said interviewing is not required for the role. 

The recruiters page seems legit, but the NYCHH page doesn’t list this role as a current job opportunity and the no interview thing feels off. I can’t find anywhere on NYCHH to contact their hiring department directly. 

I’ve never been recruited for a job like this before, is this normal for a recruiter or am I right in picking up scammy red flags?

Title: Need career advice: Political Science student considering foreign languages + upskilling during break

Post:

Hi everyone,

I’m a second-semester student at Delhi University, currently pursuing a B.A. (Hons) in Political Science. However, I’ve realized that I’m not very interested in this course anymore. I was thinking of exploring foreign languages like French or German, but I’m confused about the actual career scope and opportunities that come with them.

With my semester break coming up soon, I want to use this time productively to upskill myself. I’d really appreciate suggestions on:

What practical and in-demand skills should I learn that can help me land a good job in the future?

Is learning a foreign language (like French or German) a good decision in terms of career prospects?

Are there any specific certifications, online courses, or internships that would be helpful for someone in my position?

Any guidance or personal experiences would mean a lot. I’m trying to figure out the best path forward, and I want to make good use of my time during this break.

Thanks in advance!

Hey everyone,

I’m a second-semester Political Science (Hons) student at Delhi University, and honestly… I’m not feeling it. The course isn’t what I expected, and I don’t see myself building a career in this field.

I’ve been thinking about learning a foreign language like French or German, but I’m confused—what’s the actual scope? Can this really lead to a stable, well-paying job, or is it just hype?

With my semester break coming up, I’m really motivated to upskill and explore something that can actually help me stand out and feel excited about my future.
Thanks a ton in advance!

So I’d love your help:

What skills should I focus on learning right now that are truly valuable in today’s job market?
Is pursuing a foreign language a smart career move? If yes, which one—and why?
Any recommendations for online courses, internships, or certifications I can do during the break?

1k7mz58,"When are you too old to job hop, and when should you settle down, or is that a boomer myth?","I switched into IT when I was 30.  I'm approaching 40 now.  I've started to move away from tech roles and have embraced ITSM/leadership initiatives.  In the past 10 years, I've had 3 jobs, this is my third and I've only been here for 1.5 years.  I had every intention of staying longish term (5+ years) because it's a large company and (so I thought) plenty of work and room to grow, but it's turning out that the growth is a little slower than I anticipated in the DoD contract world.  Things move at a snails pace and you can be in the same position for 3-5 years before you see significant pay bumps or growth opportunities. 

The day to day work is gruelingly slow, I have too much downtime, and I can't work another job because of legal reasons (this job requires top secret clearance and they're very strict about double dipping or working two jobs at the same time, moonlighting/consulting is ok).  This has given me a lot of opportunity to fill in gaps in our systems and processes and take on initiatives outside of my daily work, which I guess I should not complain about. 

So, I'm thinking of moving on.  With the things I've done, the certs I have (ITIL and CAPM), I'm applying for roles paying $130k +, which would be great for me as I live in the North East, so the higher pay is needed.
But, realistically, I am almost 40.  I know job hopping isn't always look on favorably, and if I am trying to assume more leadership/strategic roles, wouldn't it make sense to stay at one company and try to job hop internally?

1k7j4md,Do I take the job I want in the town I want to live in or do I take the job that offers 25% more money?,"Hello. I have 2 offers on hand right now and I am in a real dilemma. All wages mentioned are netto monthly and salaried. Basically job 1 has much better intangible advantages and less risk. Job 2 pays more but there are more uncertainties involved. And I have recently changed a couple of jobs so I am not big on risk right now.  Job1 will pay me 1800euro, job2 2400euro. Both jobs promise some form of WFH after the probationary period. I can't use the other offer to increase the first offer as I already did that.

Job1:

Pros:

\- I am familiar with the job, I did an almost identical job previously for 5 years and loved it and excelled at it until I plateaued. The job fits me as if putting an old pair of favourite gloves that I haven't used for a couple of years.  
\- Despite that there is a variety of new things I believe I can learn there while having a solid foundation.  
\- Geography, I will live and work in a big town that is half an hour away from the small town where I grew up in and my parents still live. If accepted I will build my life around this town.  
\- I see a lot of space for advancement in that company. Currently I believe myself to be a solid 'mid' but I could become a senior or team lead there. In some years I could bridge the pay gap.  
\- This job would be a good intellectual challenge for me, see above.  
\- Office job but with occasional field work, I like that.  
\- I can see myself staying 5+ years at this job.

Neutral:

Small company - I have worked at even smaller companies.

Cons:

\- Obviously less money.  
\- I can't start my side gig as I would be a competitor.  
\- I would start with 1600euros until my probationary period would end.

Job2:

Pros:

\- More money, I could afford my mid life crisis car.  
\- More vacation days  
\- More bonuses  
\- Easier work  
\- I would be able to start my side business as I would not be a competitor.

Neutral:

Big international company - I have worked at bigger ones.

Cons:

\- Hectic life in capital city. I lived there for 10 years and I used to love it at first, but eventually I got tired of how hectic it was and how people there were pissed off.  
\- The job description is in my ballpark but definitely less so than job1.  
\- The job is juniorish for my experience, I don't see much space for advancement.  
\- Expensive life in capital city. Real estate is roughly similar, but everything else is like comparing a county capital to a country capital, as it really is.",Prigorec-Medjimurec,3,0.8100000023841858,16,1745582313,2025-04-25 11:58:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k7j4md/do_i_take_the_job_i_want_in_the_town_i_want_to/,4,2025

I work in a government job in a policy position and have been for the last 7 years. This job pays decent, it offers me job security and is not highly stressful. I am in my early 40s now with a husband and kids. It recently dawned upon me that likely I will continue working in this job until I retire and then realized that I although it’s a good job I don’t feel like it’s rewarding or I’m making a difference. I am afraid that when I’m on my death bed I will look back on my life and think I spent years working just for the sake of working and making money, but didn’t make a difference. 

I am not looking to make a career change as I do need the stability this job offers me. But I was thinking maybe I could go back to school and get certified in something useful or take on a second part time job which is meaningful. But I don’t know what to do. I do not have any skills or special education that I can use for a side job.

1k7imfn,Stuck after doing msc. Should go for banking exam or cgl? Or pgt teacher? Or IT sector (data analysis)?,"Hii, I am currently doing msc in mathematics from university of delhi (worst decision of my life). This is my last semester (4th sem). The course is very bad. It is highly theoretical and the teachers are not good with giving marks.

Class average wouldn't be a 5 even. If I come to myslef, I am not sure if I will be able to score a 6 gpa. 6 gpa is a possibility only if I give improvement exams in December (with a very good preparation).

I always wanted to pursue a phd but because of the extremely merciless and tough marking scheme of our course, I would not be able to get a 6 gpa. And a phd without 6 gpa just doesn't make any sense to me.

So my ques is what should I do now? I am very good at quants and logical reasoning, however my GA is not good at all. I feel very stuck. Should I go for ssc, banking exam (including rbi) or should get enrolled in a b.ed and wait for completion to appear for c.tet, dssssb, whatever.

Or should I do a phd without a 6 gpa? I am pretty sure I can clear net jrf and gate exam. I have already written a research paper as well. I am also thinking of data analysis but again I have a fear that comany would reject me because of my low gpa in masters.

1k7i61o,I feel like I’m getting shafted at work,"I work in Michigan, United States. The company I currently work for recently had corporate lay off at the beginning of the month. Sadly my position was affected however my manager told me they have a role opening up later in the summer that they would like me to fill and in the meantime they could move me over to another department with the same pay rate instead of laying me off.

Of course I jumped at the opportunity given my need for a job and reported to the new position with no context of what I would be doing. Come to find out this is a position working in a factory doing rework labor for our largest client. Working in the factory itself is not an issue as I had done that for some years previously to my transition into working in the office however the majority of the staff I am working with are contract laborers not affiliated with the company which was somewhat surprising to me. 

The operation is currently running on two shifts of 7/12s and the manager of the shift somewhat expected me to do the same however I explained that while I have no issue working overtime, given that my pay was a set salary I would not be doing the extra 44 hours per week without proper compensation. He tried to assure me that the company would pay my eventually however I stood firm and told him that while I trust I would get compensated I would not work without a concert method of payment for the overtime. Following this there was no movement and I simply would show up and do my part for 8 hours each day, occasionally staying slightly over if the operation truly needed the help.

My first pay check came in just fine, the same as all the others have. Then on Tuesday of this week a HR representative called me to inform me that my pay had been switched from salary to hourly, ensuring that my salary rate had been simply converted to an hourly rate, and that I need to submit my historical time cards to my manager for this pay period. Thankfully I had been filling out my time cards to ensure I had proof of employment and I submitted them with no issue.

Then this morning my paycheck comes in and it is 25% of what it usually is. I have yet to discuss with anyone from HR however I wanted to get some advice on how to approach this. I’m rather new to the corporate world and broke from college so I believe I can somewhat easily be strong armed by my employer. I know this situation is shitty and honestly I’m fine with shitty as long as the pay is the same but now that I’m hardly getting paid at all I could use a second opinion before discussing this situation with the HR team. Is everything going on above board?

1k7h18y,Grad Job Offers,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I’m an international student and recently received two graduate job offers (both on permanent contracts), but neither offers visa sponsorship for entry-level roles — so I’d need to go on the 2-year Graduate visa.

1. Risk Management (Fortune 500 company)
	•	£32K starting, increasing to £34K in year two
	•	Based in the Midlands
	•	Strong name, structured development

2. Non-Actuarial Pricing Analyst (Smaller UK-based firm)
	•	£31K starting, increasing to £33K
	•	Based in the South
	•	Ideal role/industry for me, but smaller company

My main concern is what happens after the 2-year visa ends. If they don’t sponsor me later, I’ll have to either return to my home country or look for opportunities elsewhere.

Fast-forward life about 15 years, and in my 30’s I got a contract job in another university lab, completely different field, basic lab tech — but was quickly reminded how much I love research work and the environment.

My contract, unfortunately, is up in a year, and I’m already starting to wonder about where to go from here. Do I take another job with my same contract company, maybe in a whole other different field but easy to find a job, and would be able to gain wider experience? Or do I branch out and look for a position related to my recent or university specialities, despite coming in with a very shallow level of knowledge? Do I need to go back and get an advanced degree before reaching that high? (Honestly do not mind lab tech/bench work for the time being.)

1k7f91n,The World is My Oyster [but they’re very expensive],"• 20s, B.A., had very specific areas of study 
• Lots of experience in retail/ service, held leadership roles (I hoped it would give me a leg up when I graduated) 
• Interned w/ a nonprofit, which like many, lost funding
• I want to do work like that but the 4 year forecast is pretty bad. 
• Don’t want to return to service bc of the environment, the pressure to work full time (flexibility is /very/ valuable to me rn), and countless other reasons. 
• I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs and interviewed with good feedback, but no offers yet. 
• I live in an area that is still pretty saturated with the types of roles I want, but all kinds of jobs are very competitive. I even got denied from Target. 
• My partner and I can still easily cover the basics (and I can’t describe how good a little break has been), but I need proof of income soon. I also feel like a bum, and I’m getting bored. 

Do I go back to a restaurant PT even though it puts a lil bit of a bad taste in my mouth nowadays? Or is some form of gig work worth it? My plan is to try to land a long term volunteer role or two, diversify my experience, and get my foot back in the door at other orgs. I don’t expect this general nonprofit funding issue to improve drastically soon, so I want to get creative. Or should I forget my dreams and change my path?

1k7e1kz,"When I might be Atelophobic, working in a work environment where even the slightest mistake is forbidden. single little Mistake = get fired.","I am not English Native Speaking . so please excuse for bad grammar.

I work as Security Guard in contract for Power Plant in Thailand.

I am looking back at myself and wondering if I might have Atelophobia (fear of making mistakes) or not. I have anxiety about work. At my workplace, I am being watched and given special attention (I admit that I made mistakes myself, but most of the time, they are not major mistakes that damage the company. They are more like small mistakes that cannot be overlooked). I myself try to force myself not to make even the slightest mistake (pressuring myself). And then I hear this sentence from my employer: ""If I make this mistake again, I will fire you."" But in the end, I still make mistakes.

It turned out that I started working under a lot of stress. From not being able to make even a single mistake, pressuring myself to do my work perfectly, being caught and watched, working without any safe zone, to me starting to worry a lot, like these days, ""I always work well, if I make a mistake, I'll be fired immediately.""  
It's like walking through a field of landmines. If you take a single wrong step, you die instantly.

I feel that people is able to make mistakes. It doesn't work in a working society that absolutely does not accept mistakes. These days, it's already hard to find a job, and it's also very easy to lose your job/get fired. I myself don't want to lose my job either, because I'm the last hope of the family. If I fall down and can't find a job anywhere, I'll probably be so stressed that I might do commit suicide.

Now, the working society in my workplace has forced me to become a person who is afraid of making mistakes, or at worst, may become more depressed.

Nowadays, I can only ask myself, why do I still have to wake up and suffer because I must not making any mistakes at work?

1k7dfr9,College or Work?,"Hi, I (26F) started college back when I graduated high school but never took it too seriously. I joined the workforce and quickly grew through the ranks in the restaurant industry. A couple of years ago I decided to continue some online college courses part time while focusing on my career growth and development. Now, I have completed all the classes at the community college and it is time to transfer to a university to finish my business management degree (which fits perfectly with the field I currently work in). 

Here’s the tough part.. I have grown and developed my career this whole time. I am a District Manager of a sizable restaurant group with international experience in well known brands. I make over 6 figures and I’m comfortable but not fully pleased with my current company. I would like to use my business management degree to continue to grow my career — to where I could be a VP or Regional Director down the line for a large company. 

If I focus on school at the university full time, I’ll have my degree by next Spring. If I stay part time, it’ll be closer to the end of 2027. I can not do school full time with my current workload. I can afford to focus only on school financially, but worry about the “resume gap” or losing quality tenure time in my resume. Additionally, the fluctuating economy in the US concerns me and worrying about securing a job in the future also provides anxiety. A part time job in low level management is also an option, but I worry that stepping down to a lower position could be a red flag in the future job search too.

1k7d3aa,I need help deciding my college! Thanks!,"Hi, I'm an international student and need advice about choosing my school.



Currently, I've got into...

US: Northeastern (Economics and International Business: Finance)



UK: Durham (Accounting and Finance), Bath (Accounting and Finance)



And still waiting for a decision from KCL (Accounting and Finance), Manchester (Accounting and Finance)



I'm looking forward to pursuing my career in high finance, including IB, VC, PE, Quant, HF, etc., but I'm strongly leaning towards IB to start my career.



Since I'm a male from South Korea, I need to finish my mandatory military service 1.5-2 years after my freshman year. So, going to the UK and finishing my undergraduate degree in 3 years, compared to 4 years in the US, will help me catch up with others.



Luckily, I was born in a wealthy household, so money is not my concern. If I go to the US (Northeastern), I'm planning to transfer after my first or second year to a higher-ranked business school (e.g. UChicago, Duke, U Mich, Georgetown, NYU, Harvard, etc.) to increase my chances of breaking into the high finance industry. Also, if I go to the UK, I plan to transfer to LSE, Oxford, or Cambridge after my first year. I know LSE allows transfer for Accounting and Finance majors during the second year, but Oxford or Cambridge does not. So, if I get into Oxford or Cambridge, I'm willing to start over college as a freshman.



My uncle, who worked in the IB industry in the US, tells me the US has more opportunities and diverse options to choose from, but I feel like, considering Durham and Bath are already highly sought-after in the UK, it would be easier for me to get a job. (I feel like London might be a better place than Wall Street due to less competition) I'm not sure if this is possible, but I think the best scenario possible would be to go to the UK and get a job in IB, stay there for a few years, and move to the US and continue my career (I know that it's getting harder to get a job in the US and especially as an international, It would be way more harder)



Plus, If I decide to go to the UK, I would like to know which college has a higher chance of breaking into the finance industry: Durham, Bath, KCL, Manchester. And if anyone knows about transfers in the UK, please let me know!



Just in case if someone is wondering why I didn't apply to LSE in the first place, I realized that I met the English Language proficiency exam and number of APs, but I couldn't meet the GPA requirement of 3.7/4.0 or 4.0/5.0.



Also, I was rejected by UCL statistics, econ, and finance. And my Aps were.. (Sharing my stats just in case I need them when I transfer)



Already achieved:



\- 5 on AP Calc BC



\- 5 on AP Microeconomics



\- 5 on AP Macroeconomics



Prediction received:



\- 5 on AP Bio



\- 4 on AP Chem



\- 4 on AP Stats



\- 4 on AP CSP

1k7ct8o,Is this workplace harassment?,"I got a new job a few months ago, and I work closely with one teammate. After a month, I had a meeting with upper management and my team. They said they didn't need my teammate now that they had me. Of course, after that, my teammate became more aggressive and was frankly mean. I met with my manager and tried to smooth things over with this coworker. However, my manager and he are good friends and have worked together for a long time, so it didn't make a difference. After that, the teammate went around telling everyone in the office that I didn't like him and that I was aggressive. This teammate is well-liked and has been in the company for over 12 years. So, I tried to make things better and became more approachable; I also tried to be nicer. That was fine for a few weeks, but then he started acting strangely, standing close to me and behaving oddly. Then, one day, my manager said something very strange to me about how my coworker was mine. Said, ""Because he's yours"" and discussed how it's okay to have crushes on people. Even though I'd never spoken to my teammate more than I needed to for work, I later discovered that he had been telling people I had a crush on him and liked him. I've mentioned before that I'm happily married. Is this coworker trying to hurt my reputation, or does he think I like him? I don't know, but it's making me uncomfortable.



I stopped eating lunch with my manager and teammate, and I try to avoid interacting with that teammate except for work-related questions. I would not talk to him at all if I could, but I still work closely on projects with him and talk to him daily. I have tried to be more assertive, but my manager told me this week that no one would want to work with me if I continued to be aggressive.

1k7aw88,How to get along with women manager age 50-65?,"I am 32 woman. Mediocre looking. 2 kids. Sorta funny. Slightly above average intelligently. But I beat most my age out by hard work, quick learning ability and organization, it's been that way since grade school. I've been told I'm intimidating at first hello but once someone talks to me I'm not that bad. I have a very flat lined expression. A monotone voice and my face will tell you all my feelings. This is a ramble but I need advice. 

Long story short: how do I get along with women bosses age 50-60? I get along with all other age groups and genders. 

Very long story;
I've worked in a few different corporate settings, but took a 3 year hiatus working self employed. I've been back in the setting for 1.5 years. My prior experience I will take partial responsibility for, being a young know it all. The vibes I gave to both my boss and who I managed, I agree, they were not that of an experienced worker. I have always gotten along with coworkers my own age and males of all ages. I seem to connect to the women 60+. One from my very first job, we meet once a month for drinks. I had a male boss right before I left to work for myself and he gave me some tips, books and put me through some training courses. Covid happened and on my own I went. 

Finally back to corporate working as a manager of my prior position (where my boss was male). The CEO and prior team I'd worked with thought I was a good rehire but with a new woman manager. She was about 50. She was terrible. I recorded her yelling at me. She called me a crazy bitch in one meeting insane. I went and found a new job, when she got my resignation email, she threw her keyboard at the wall. This was brought to HR she was fired after I left whatever. We didn't get along. She didn't really show up. She gaslit me until I finally recorded every interaction I thought I was crazy.

Prior to being hired, I did a lot of book reading and podcast listening on management so I could better manage my contractors and spent lots of time in the field connecting, getting dirty helping. I took action knowing I was not a good manager in 2019. I left that with a very good friend who's about 60. And the core team I still am apart of the group chat. Meet for lunch every other week etc. 

Since December, I moved to a marketing department of a big brand. I do not manage. I have no decision making leverage. I am strictly a contracted employee who works 9-5 with no benefits, no PTO but a great wage. My new boss is a 50 ish year old woman. Been there 11 years. . With a daughter younger than me, It took almost 7 weeks for her to finally offer me the position and we just don't connect. I have actively tried to speak to her and it just kinda lingers in the air. No response. Anyways I made a joke on Tuesday and she shit her pants in our team meeting. I both apologized during the meeting to our team of 4 (including myself) and with a follow up email apologizing about my intention. Today at our 1:1 she just kept laying into me. And ended the 53 minute meeting it with, ""you've come unprepared. What a negative week for you. Loads of negative feedback I hope next week is better"". I said thanks and left. Trying to cry. 

If you've gotten this far help. I'm the problem I understand that. How do I fix it? Women in the age range of 50-60, they are going to be my superior for awhile. I need tips tricks fake corporate lingo to get along with them. And why for the love of god can I get along with everyone else but that freaking age range ? 

Also, my normal life. I get along with women 50-60 just fine. My aunts and mom's friends. Never had an issue. It's only corporate.

1k7aroa,Is this sexual harassment?,"I got a new job a few months ago. The first month was good. I worked closely with my one teammate. After a few months, in a meeting with upper management, they said they no longer needed him, and now they had me. Of course, after that, he became more aggressive and was frankly mean, scheduling a present for a project I had only just found out about the day before. Of course, I met with my manager and tried to smooth things over with this teammate. However, my manager and he are good friends and have worked together for a long time, so it didn't make a difference. After that, he went around telling everyone in the office that I didn't like him and that I was aggressive. This teammate is well-liked and has been in the company for over 14 years. So, I tried to make things better and became more approachable, and I tried to be nicer. That was fine for a few weeks, but then he started acting strangely, standing close to me and behaving oddly. Then, one day, my manager said something very strange to me about how my coworker was mine. My manager said, ""Because he's yours"" and discussed how it's okay to have crushes on people. Even though I've never spoken to him more than I needed to for work, I later discovered that he's been telling people I have a crush on him and that I like him. I have mentioned that I have a partner and am happily married. Is this coworker trying to hurt my reputation, or does he think I like him? I don't know, but it's making me uncomfortable. 

I've started not eating lunch with my manager and teammate, and I try to avoid interacting with that teammate except for work-related questions. I would not talk to him at all if I could, but I still work closely on projects with him and talk to him daily. I have tried to be more assertive, but my manager told me this week that no one would want to work with me if I continued to be aggressive. 

Sorry, this is a very long post, but I'm at my wits' end on what to do.

1k7ai7e,A very bad situation at today's meeting - help,"I am the technical lead for a specific project, responsible for guiding the work by leveraging the technical knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs) across different areas.

Today was the project kickoff meeting, and I invited approximately 20 people to attend. The purpose was to introduce the project goals, discuss the key challenges, and explain how I intend to use the SMEs' expertise.

Since this was the first meeting, I had to focus primarily on one area of expertise and provide specific technical details of this area. Everything was going well.

However, midway through the presentation, the SME responsible for that area interrupted me and said I shouldn't be speaking on that topic, as it was her group's responsibility. She said this in a very unprofessional tone, and it was immediately obvious to everyone on the call.

I tried to minimize the damage by emphasizing the importance of her group, but the situation still didn’t feel right. I recorded the entire meeting.

1k79ew7,Accounting or Computer Science (and then Cyber Security)?,"Hello, for context, I’m a freshman pursuing a degree in cybersecurity at UTSA. They, for some reason, put cyber under the college of business and made me do more pre-reqs that are tailored to business than cyber. I’ll be moving out of state soon and will be going to apply for other colleges. However, I am not sure if I’d want to pursue Accounting or a CompSci degree (then probably get certs for cyber). Tbh, I don’t really have a strong passion for something; I am just kind of driven by strong income potential and/or the aspect of not too much stress.

I’ll list what I personally think and experienced for each area.

–Accounting–

* Like I said, I have done business courses and Intro to Accounting is one of them.
   * The class was a difficult introduction to accounting but I liked it, especially the reasoning/critical-thinking aspect.
* I like that it doesn’t involve heavy math.
* The low-median 6 fig pay entices me, as well as job security, however…
   * I saw Reddit, Glassdoor and Linkedin posts about how overworked accountants could get, and how boring it is.
   * There’s also outsourcing, which is a way, way bigger threat than AI.
   * CPA is highly recommended but it can be challenging, it requires 180 college credits and there’s the need for studying at my own time.
* Another reason why I am interested in accounting is it could translate well if I ever wanted to start a business.
   * Or if I have a degree and CPA, I have the ability to go into other fields such as finance.

–Compsci–

* I have done a Python coding class in highschool and I enjoyed it.
* From my experience with my intro cyber security course, the only thing is I will have to make myself to enjoy doing back-end work since coding in the Linux terminal is overwhelming as it is more complex than what I am used to.
* I really like that, on average, there's more opportunity for growth–career and financial– wise when compared to acc; The average pay potential in tech is a higher ceiling than in accounting. However: 
   * Job security sucks though.
   * There’s more competition in today’s job market.
   * AI is also a threat.
* Just like acc, If I do get a Compsci degree, it can help me transition into many jobs within tech, not just cybersecurity
* I am not a math person but:
   * If I could really put my mind to it, I am confident that I can handle it.

I know that Accounting and CompSci are different from each other but these are the only fields that I have been introduced to and interested in, and both may have good financial potential. Thank you very much for your time.

I’ve been offered an MBA in HR from NMIMS Mumbai, which has great brand value, and I’m leaning towards taking it. However, I’m hearing mixed opinions about HR as a career path.

On one hand, people say that the HR field has limited growth and lower earning potential compared to areas like finance or tech. I’ve been told that people in these fields tend to earn much more, and there might be more career advancement opportunities. I’m really focused on maximizing my wealth and growing in my career, so I’m wondering if pursuing HR is the right choice.

1k78dqw,"Wife about to graduate with PhD, panicking during the job search","Hello everyone. My wife is struggling with finding a job and I thought I might ask for some advice here on her behalf. 

She is about to graduate with her PhD in psychology in May. Her focus is technically developmental psychology, but she took graduate courses in machine learning and her dissertation involved machine learning and quite a bit of computer programming (Python, R, SQL).

She figured out through graduate school that she really does not like teaching or want to teach, and so decided on going into industry instead of academia. However, she’s currently struggling to find a job. She’s been applying on indeed, linkedin, usajobs, and through various websites for a couple of months and has not gotten an interview. Looking primarily for positions as a research psychologist or research scientist but is by no means picky. Most of the positions she’s applying to are data scientist positions and aren’t necessarily entry level, but she may struggle to recognize what is appropriately entry level for her as a new PhD grad.  (I say may because she complains of being either overqualified or under-qualified of these positions but rarely can tell for sure that something is a good fit.) 

We live in the northern Virginia area, and the job market here has been not great in the last three months. She is willing to take a part time job doing doordash or like retail somewhere but she worries that she might get stuck in a cycle of positions that aren’t worth the degree she has. As some background, she grew up in poverty and her family took any jobs they could get. She also had to take student loans to get through undergrad, and these are a consideration as well. 

Any advice on what kind of positions to look for, or even moral support for how to help her through, would be appreciated. She’s getting increasingly sad and pessimistic at the prospect of having to work a small part time thing to pay bills. I can give more info in the comments if needed.

I want to try something else given all the skills and knowledge I’ve obtained over the years. Before i go any further i wanna outline what i actually do so you can understand what my skill set and knowledge actually is. A home inspector is someone who inspects the home for functionality and safety. So for example if your furnace is running poorly or if there's a leak in the bathroom sink or a missing smoke detector. We look at that and report on it. We are not code inspectors. I have some general knowledge of various codes but its certainly not in depth. The company i work for is a small business so i was helping in several different ways like joining a Marketing group called BNI to help network the business, making sure our contracts and insurance were in order, building a template for the inspection reports, did some minor social media stuff like managing our Instagram account, helped train new inspectors, adjusting our pricing and policies. I was given the title of “Operations Manager” after awhile but it wasn’t like this was hugely time consuming or required a lot of commitment. The other thing is my background isn’t in construction and I’m not super interested in the trades oddly enough. As far as things i don’t wanna do aside from the trades is things that are going to take too long to get into. I’m not in a position in my life where i can go to school for a year or more. Id like something i can do now or at most need a certificate that only takes a few months. I know that limits my options but that’s the situation I’m in.

I will be as vague as possible with my role, but essentially my role focuses on financial reporting for upper management. Due to restructuring of my company, I was shifted to another team where the more junior employees do some administrative work. My role remained unchanged in the beginning, however now I’ve been asked to take on some more administrative tasks and my boss has told me plans to add even more work for me to do.

I’m allegedly suppose to be promoted in a few months, however my boss is using this extra admin work that I’m currently doing as justification for my promotion. What can I even do in this case? The easy answer is to say no, but if I decline to take on the extra work (if that’s even possible? lol) then I’m sure that will be used against me during my planned promotion.

My plan has always been to quit because I’m being severely underpaid in my current role, so I don’t really care if I get screwed with the promotion crap tbh, it’s just that the extra money would be nice, as I don’t know when I’m getting my next job in this shitty job market. I will also add that I’m furious with the company as they have promoted all junior people except for me. All the current roles I have been interviewing with all pay higher than my promotion.

But halfway through, she started complaining about people like *me,* career switchers without a traditional CS or DS background, “taking” roles from people like her, who studied computer science. According to her, we’re not “professional enough” to handle real-world cases and shouldn't even be in the field.

I was stunned. She had no idea how hard I’ve worked to get here. I majored in public policy and didn’t touch MySQL, Python, or any real analytics tools until I entered a data-focused master’s program. I had to learn everything from scratch.

The data job market is already brutal. And for those of us who didn’t come from a strong technical foundation, it’s 10x harder. But we’re here, putting in the work, building skills, and earning our spot.

The interview went well and I believe that I will get the promotion. I've been doing the job of 2 people for 2 months and it's wearing me out! I've spoken with the hiring manager (who is now my boss) twice about when a decision will be made, and he doesn't seem to be in any rush. Meanwhile, I'm not getting interim pay and I'm working 2 jobs because nobody will do anything.

1k73bro,What other roles should I consider?,"I am currently enrolled in college, that’s where I’ll decide what career path I want, but for the past few years I’ve been an administrative assistant. I left my previous job because it was an extremely toxic environment. I was doing the work of 3 people, asked to take on even more, all while being underpaid and dealing with adult bullies. 

I have no regrets in leaving and my job hunt has been going well (15+ interviews within a month). However, I’ve had to turn down at least half of the offers because I was initially just franticly applying to every similar role. I didn’t realize that a lot of the jobs offer very little pay. I was making more than the average since I got some raises and even that was not enough to keep me around. 

I came to the conclusion that if I were to accept less pay, I’d rather work in retail (for now) than do administrative work. I still have some better paying interviews coming up and I hope all goes well, but just in case I have to wait another month, are there any similar jobs I should apply for? 

I worked at a dental clinic so it’s in line with healthcare, but I don’t have any licenses or floor experience.

1k7302m,I fear for my career/development as a junior civil engineer,"I am a junior (2-3years) civil engineer with a kind of complicated background now. I am naturally more inclined to structures, it's what ""I love"" and what I always had better grades in college.

But, my first ever job was as an intern in one of the top engineering firms of my country (3rd world country in Africa btw) and it was when I was finishing college. It was just a short period where I was doing water design for a building (water supply, drainage and stormwater drainage).

Then I graduated and started my first job as a structural engineer (kind of, I did mostly structures but since it is a company with not a lot of staff, I also did some of what I did in my internship) and I even had site experience at this job. After 1 year, I landed a golden job, my current one, in a multinational engineering company, not as a structural engineer, but as a water engineer, more specifically water supply. The thing is, a year has passed and I cannot say I have learned a lot, not even close. When I was at the smaller companies, I was actually doing a lot more than what I am here. This is a big company and most of the time, proper work does not get to me, only ""leftovers"" so I feel I am not really developing here and I think I want to try something else. But the problem is that I do not know which area should I apply to, I've ""broken up"" with structures (which is what I love) so I feel I'm behind the curve now, but the thing is, I also feel like I'm behind the curve in water as well, at least for a 3 years experienced engineer. Basically, I try to learn both water and structures on my own time so I can try to stay updated in both but I don't know if this is the correct way to move forward. I feel like water has a lot more opportunities, and I don't mind pursuing water, but I don't mind pursuing structures as well, but on my CV, I do not have structures on the company that matters (the multinational where I am right now).

And also, a topic for another post but you can tackle on it if you want, I want to move out of my home country to work overseas and having the multinational company on my CV is a big plus, but how do I make it work tho? Visas and what not? Should I apply for overseas jobs and then look for visas?

1k72zak,What can I do to make my dream and passion my day-to-day work?,"I know I'm certainly not the only person who has felt this, but after being rejected three times this week (by a major broadcasting company, a grant body, and a music festival/networking conference) I'm really stuck.

  
**In summary:**

I'm a musician and children's video/book creator. The children's entertainment brand (for lack of a better term) is called Pumpkin & Stretch. My wife and I have been working on it for almost ten years now, and it consists of puppet videos, books, comics, and songs. It's our ""soul project"", something we deeply care about and really believe can make the world a better place. Children's stories and educational media (games, shows) have always been a source of inspiration and something I want to work with.



Five years ago, after many publisher rejections, we took things into our own hands and self-published the first book. We also made puppets of the characters and started making videos on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. The videos got a great response and so we created a pitch package that has been sent to dozens of production companies. It has even resulted in several meetings. But just today our biggest lead, with a broadcaster, came to an end. Even though it was well-received by producers, there wasn't a desire to add any additional puppets to their roster of shows. This is after they heard out our point that we could work with a much smaller budget and that the characters could complement the existing roster, rather than detract from it. Other companies simply say they don't have the budget, bad industry lately, and so on.

  
I also write and sing songs with a Latin/indie rock band called Blumarelo. Making music has been eleven years in the making (solo and with a few different bands). Several releases, videos, live shows. Over the last three years, we've put a lot of time and money into the best possible quality recordings, super tight live shows, photos, graphics, etc. But we get rejected by most opportunities we apply to. Festivals, grants, playlists, licensing. And we really struggle to draw people beyond friends/family to shows.



**The results so far:**  
At best, the response for these projects is ""We're very impressed, but..."" and there doesn't seem to be any kind of room to give them a chance. And for all that we have tried to patiently build followings on our own—because organizations/investors want to work with already established or viral creators/artists—the response is limited in number. Positive, but shrunken. Like it doesn't get shown to anyone beyond friends and family.

  
I know this work is how I want to spend my days. I see how even putting more effort into a more normal career I'm not enthusiastic about isn't not a guarantee of things working out. So I'm going all in on this dream as much as possible. But eventually, I can't afford to continue scraping by anymore, juggling multiple jobs/businesses at once, struggling to get by financially, not able to live in the present.

**Where next?:**  
Is there a way to get somewhere with what I'm doing? To stop waiting for the rest of my life to begin? To do what I'm good at and care about, to have an audience, and to make a living?

  
**tl;dr:** Guy is juggling multiple projects, audience growth and opportunities to make a living haven't been flowing even after \~10 years.

1k72o5m,2 Months Into My Job and My Coworker’s Mistakes Keep Getting Blamed on Me – Do I Speak Up or Stay Quiet?,"So I’m two months into a new job, and I’m already starting to feel super defeated. When I started, my coworker—who’s been here a year and is in the exact same position as me—was assigned to train me. She was super sweet, really helpful, and I was genuinely grateful.

At the same time I got hired, our manager started training both of us on new responsibilities—stuff she had never done before either.

Fast forward to about a month in, she started making a lot of mistakes. One day I found out another manager was upset and thought I had created a huge mess with some account records. But here’s the thing: I never touched those accounts. I knew she was the one who had handled them. But I kept quiet, mostly because she had been so kind and I didn’t want to throw her under the bus. I figured maybe it was a one-time thing.

Well… it's not. We’re now in month 2, and the mistakes are still happening. And I keep getting the blame. I feel so uncomfortable because she’s really well-liked by all the managers—especially the one who keeps questioning me about her errors. I honestly feel like if I say anything, I’ll just come across as the “new girl stirring up drama.”

The worst part? Last week, she told me she was going to go into some accounts and update them. Later she messaged me saying they were “updated wrong” but was very careful with her wording—like she knew not to say outright that she messed them up. Then she goes and talks to the manager, and suddenly I’m getting a call asking if I did it wrong. I told him straight up I didn’t touch them, but I could tell he didn’t fully believe me. It was just brushed off.

Now I feel awkward and anxious at work. I feel like I can’t even look at her because I’m so uncomfortable and honestly hurt that she hasn’t taken any accountability. I don’t know what to do. Do I wait and if it happens again, finally say “actually, I didn’t touch that—she did”? Or do I set up a 1:1 with my manager and explain everything?

He really likes her and seems to trust her completely, so I worry I’ll just look like I’m trying to blame someone else. I feel like I have no credibility since I’m so new. Has anyone been in a situation like this? What should I do?

One of the meetings had an attachment called ""(Team Name) Review"". I probably should not have opened it, but I did. It listed our team's salaries along with a restructuring of our bonuses/commission structures. This is also available on the owner of the company's calendar because it's public. 

Do I tell anyone (mostly my coworkers) that our salary information is easily accessible to anyone at the company? Or do I shut my mouth because I kind of snooped around and it could be bad for me? I'm fine with my information being on display, I'm all for salary transparency, but I know some of my coworkers would be livid if they knew and would ask HR/our manager to take it down.

1k714gs,Graduate Software Engineer Job vs. Fully Funded MSc + Job Offer - which should I take?,"I'm a 26 year old male. I've been on the job hunt with the last 6 months with very little luck. I have a BSc in General Science, very mediocre grades with 2.9 GPA and a sparse resume. Recently, I even took on a 3-month unpaid data science internship just to get something on my resume.

Recently I have been desperate so I started applying to jobs far from my home, and I even applied to a Masters program just to try to get my career going. Surprisingly, I now have two options:

Option A:
-Graduate Software Engineer job. 
-Standard to low pay for a grad role.
-Multinational with a score of 4.1⭐ on Glassdoor. 
-5.5 hour drive from home.

Option B: 
-Fully funded MSc in Software Engineering.
-Average standard university.
-Guaranteed 2 year job offer with a multinational w/ score of 3.5⭐ on Glassdoor after graduating (above 70% final grades required for job offer). 
-2 hour drive from home.

I think they are both good options, but I would like to know what you think is better for my long term career potential. Of course a MSc would look good on my resume, but I feel like getting a couple of years of solid industry experience could be more valuable right now.

They say I give an idea of confusion and that I don't know what I want, while I am absolutely clear and true to myself when I say that for me whatever sector is good of it allows me to exit from where I actually am.

1k6zuyn,"AITA: not helping person under me, even though I’ve gotten so much help from others","

I work at a small company in a communications role, and I recently got promoted to a more senior position. I’ve been here for over a year, and from the start I worked directly with one of the founders (who I still report to and receive a lot of guidance from). That being said, I never really got formal training from anyone directly above me (I.e no training from the position I’m in now— the only training I received skipped a couple of levels and was just from my boss, who runs the company.) 

Now that I’ve moved up, I’m working 10–12 hour days, skipping lunch most of the time, and still barely staying afloat. The workload is nonstop, and I’m starting to feel like I’m drowning.

On top of that, there’s a newer employee who’s been here for six months and works in a different area of the team, but we’re still on the same account/client, but doing different things (I started out as her position)

She’s kind and I like her as a person, but she keeps asking me to edit her work (which takes 45m), check all her emails before she sends them, answer basic questions, and even sit in on her meetings — which often happen after hours. She *does* try not to bother me, and tbh her workload is light so she’s not constantly asking me, but I think she sees me as more approachable than going to our shared boss and it’s very frustrating. 

I’m naturally a helpful person and I hate being the one to say no, especially because I’ve had people help me when I was new. But at the same time… she’s not that new anymore. I don’t think I should be the one reviewing every pitch or email she sends out, and I especially don’t want to be getting deadlines from someone who technically isn’t above me. For example, I’ll tell her I’ll get to it when I can, but she emphasizes that she wants to get it out this week (???) 

I want to bring this up to my boss, but I don’t want to sound unkind or like I’m unwilling to help. I just feel like I’ve been put in a position where I’m doing unofficial management (it’s not in my contract to train anyone) without clear boundaries — and it’s draining me. 

Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you set boundaries without sounding like a jerk? Maybe I am being a jerk?

1k6zino,Should I choose dental hygiene or social media managment?,"**I’ve been trying to choose between pursuing dental hygiene or a master’s in social media management. I want to be honest about what I’m going through so I can make the best decision for myself**

**Dental Hygiene – Pros:**

	•	It’s a stable, high-paying job with clear structure.

	•	There’s strong job demand across the country.

	•	I like the idea of helping people one-on-one and seeing them leave with a clean smile.

	•	I’d be done in a few years and could have a consistent income.

.       I love hands on work





**Dental Hygiene – Cons:**

	•	I struggle with science classes, and dental hygiene has a lot of them.

	•	I’ve already been burned out from college, and I’m scared I won’t make it through the heavy studying again.

	•	It’s physically demanding, and I already have back pain.

	•	If I go all-in on this path and fail, I’ll feel crushed.

	•	There’s pressure to finish school and start working before I’m 30, and this path might delay that.



⸻



**Master’s in Social Media Management – Pros:**

	•	I enjoy creating content, branding, and visually appealing work.

	•	The coursework feels lighter and more manageable compared to science.

	•	It allows me to work remotely with a flexible schedule, which helps if I want to focus on family later.

	•	I could finish in less time without needing extra prerequisites.

	•	I see myself doing this in my 20s and 30s, and I think I’d enjoy it.



**Master’s in Social Media Management – Cons:**

	•	The job market is competitive, and I’m scared I won’t find a job even after graduating.

	•	The income might not be as high at the beginning.

	•	It’s not as structured—work can be unpredictable, and I don’t like chaos or last-minute changes.

	•	I sometimes worry if it’s too trendy or won’t last long-term.



⸻



**So I’m torn. Dental hygiene feels more secure, but it’s mentally and physically draining for me.

I’m currently employed but actively looking for a new job. I work in a large organisation where a fair amount of opportunities are available. We use an internal job board which doesn’t require a CV.

I interviewed for a position a few weeks ago which was a grade higher than mine currently, but was rejected. Today, roles in the same team have been posted that are a lower grade (the same as my current grade).

On the application it asks a question on what motivated you to apply for the role and the skills and experience you can bring. My question is, should I mention that I interviewed for the higher grade on my application? The hiring manager is different so likely wouldn’t know this and I’m in 2 minds because on one hand, it shows an interest in the job and the team and also, if they offered me an interview for a higher grade role then how could they justify not offering an interview for the lower grade. On the other hand, I worry this would reflect negatively as in, if we said no before then why would we interview again now?

I was looking to go for MS abroad but seeing the situation in the US, I am a bit sceptical and feel like staying back in India at least for a few more years. My aim was to shift to VLSI field after the MS.

Now that I am planning to stay back, will doing an MTech in EEE/ECE from old IITs/IISC help much considering that I have done undergraduate from a Tier-1 college.

I have been suggested an alternative that studying from NPTEL Courses (and maybe giving the certification exams) could help me in switching to VLSI companies.

I would love to know your take on this dilemma that I have. Please ask me any further clarifications if you need from me regarding my situation.

1k6z32f,[UK] How to request a meeting to (nicely) demand a pay rise?,"Hello!

I have been working as a skilled tradesperson for nearly 5 years now and have practically taught myself everything in my job. I am now, without wishing to sound big-headed, pretty good at my job and can do most things that will come into the shop be it repairs or custom making from scratch and everything inbetween. 2 years ago my boss graciously decided to pay me £1 above minimum wage in light of my attitude and growing skillset. Since then I have only got better and better and added more and more skills to my repertoire. The trouble now is that last year he pulled me aside in April and said that he could only afford to increase my pay by £0.50p per hour that year and I was disappointed as I was a years more experienced and more skilled but I said okay. Cue to now and I've just received my payslip to see that I am now on minimum wage, despite the fact that I am even more skilled, know even more things and pull in on average £8-10k in jobs per month and closer to £15k around Christmas all for a very small business of only 2 full time people (the boss himself and 1 other) and 2 part time people (myself and 1 other). This means that my pay now with inflation is actually LESS than it was 2 years ago! Whoopee! Did I also mention that I'm not full time at 29hrs per week average. So, I want a meeting to basically demand where the fuck my fair pay is (in nicer words obviously) but have no experience in having these meetings so don't know where to start. How do I go about asking for a payrise to meet my skills, experience, attitude etc?

1k6yjjv,Question for people who got a degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management and worked/still work within the industry,"I am planning on studying Hospitality and Tourism Management in College once I graduate. I have known for a while that it’s what I will study. I’ve been working in the Hospitality field for the last few years, I’ve always enjoyed the work and dealing with people is my speciality. I know what the industry entails at a management level and I’m okay with that 

My question is, anyone who has gotten a degree within the hospitality and tourism industry, what career opportunities are on offer?? I don’t want to be a Hotel Manager forever, but I don’t mind doing something along the lines of it for a few years when I graduate. My ideal job would not be behind a desk, plenty of travel involved for work and a comfortable and healthy salary. I won’t be planning on kids so I’m grateful to know I will never have dependants. I’ve done loads of research on Google to see what jobs are out there but all the answers are very broad or Americanised (they seem to only become hotel managers with a degree and nothing else from what I’ve read)

I don’t want to close myself off to just Hospitality so that why I’m also doing Tourism with it too. I would love to be one of those people you see in a hotel, arena etc… that u can tell has an important and well paying job but you have no clue what they actually do. It seems to be an industry where the good jobs just seem to show up and you can’t actually go looking for them. 

Can anyone help me out if they have any info/experience with it? Ideally by the time i’m 30 I’ll have a job that allows me to travel regularly both for work and leisure, in a nice modern city with a salary of €80k+
Anyone know what job this could be?? ",FunnyVegetable9610,1,1.0,3,1745516862,2025-04-24 17:47:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6yjjv/question_for_people_who_got_a_degree_in/,4,2025
1k6yi7a,Should I switch jobs after 2 months into one,"
Hey! I currently work in fraud detection (24/7 shifts). The job’s okay — mostly reviewing transaction alerts and calling clients if needed. I enjoy the team and the hybrid setup, but the company is messy: constant changes, no proper training, and I’m subcontracted through two intermediaries so I don't feel like I belong to a company. I've been here since February so it's only been 2 months.

Now, I’ve got an offer from another company related with security which also does rotative shifts with €4K more per year, direct contract, yearly reviews, and better structure. But it’s fully on-site so I'd spend more time and money on the ride.

I’m not actively looking, and I value stability, so I’m torn. 

Would you switch? What questions should I ask in the interview to really know if it’s worth it?

Thanks! 😊

1k6yhd2,Started New Job & No Onboarding... what to do?,"what should i do? **TLDR: on my first week of new job, got zero onboarding for my role/projects... and everybody is busy due to huge company transitions. have to literally ask for work and how to do... got sent training videos for side project and tried to start but still not getting help when i sent the work for review** 

I finally got a perm full time job after 1.5 years UE and doing contract work... got hired very quickly but it's something i want and it's a big top 5 advertising company. this is my first week

current issues after basic company on boarding on Monday:

1. Tuesday: had nothing on calendar from the team/role i'm in - i had to reach out to my manager to ask what i need to be doing, they told me to wait while they figure things out... nothing

2. Wednesday: still nothing from manager. Got added to a meeting where me and the other new hired weren't introduced to team but rather just given instructions on inputting data on a big project. somebody did say that it's OK if we dont know what we're doing. after meeting I got access to training videos and requested access to the tools i need to do the current side project. No word from my manager still.

so i spent the entire wednesday taking notes and trying to learn to be prepared. 

3. Thursday (today): logged on ready to work but I wasn't assigned anything so i couldnt start the project, so I reached out to my manager and they once again told me to wait... still nothing. I randomly got assigned to something with no instructions but i did it to the best of my ability based on the videos and lack of access to the tools. 

I asked different people to check my work if it was good but they sent me to other people and the last person down the chain gave me an example of the work but sent me the wrong file... which i went to the first person i asked to help about but they havent replied.

\_\_\_\_\_

I can tell they are very busy. the company is going through a huge transition and the team has majority of the heavy work.

1k6yeb8,"Making major moves, going back to school, want advice on what I should do while in school/""in the meantime.""","So this week I decided to get myself back in school for 3D modeling and Animation. I at least now have a sense of direction in my life again that I can actually be excited about.

Anyways, I'm trying to decide what to do in the meantime. Here's my total work history/life story. Buckle up, friends!  
\-Started working at 15, worked at six flags at the carnie prize games. Not much relevance except I started working young.  
\-Got my first permanent job at 16, worked at Walmart for 3 years until I got fired, just like most people do there.  
\-Worked in a variety of other jobs my first attempt at college. Primarily restaurants and cooking and pizza delivery. Studied Music for two years. Didn't complete the program, probably could finish it in a semester of just jackhammering at my Gen Ed courses if I wanted to, but the program got cut a few years back.  
\-After college I moved across the country to Dallas and tried finding work as a cook but ended up walking into a restaurant and they offered me a serving position instead of a cook and so I took it and ended up running with it. Got good. REALLY GOOD. Ended up doing Bartending, even into fine dining and have some MAJOR companies on my resume, including Perry's, Ruth's Chris, and Nick and Sam's.  
\-in 2019 I wanted out of restaurants and my girlfriend at the time recommended I do sales. I gave it a go, and did sort of okay working as an insurance agent, but thought maybe my style would translate to something better. I got my way into a SAAS company, worked there, failed miserably, got fired. that was in 2022.  
\-Fast forward to today, I have tried a couple of other sales roles and have realized one thing: I fucking HATE sales.  
\-About a year ago I was fired from a role and determined that. Still, having to eat, I went back into restaurants full-time, but with no sense of direction I realized I needed to get back into school, and not being half bad at animation already, I decided to go for that. I haven't started the process yet but intend to ASAP once I figure out my other loose ends.  
\-I was at one point vying for a key employee position at the restaurant I work in but after this past weekend I realized I do NOT want to do any more holidays than are necessary again. The restaurant business made me HATE holidays and I simply don't want to live like that. There might be one possible benefit (immigration needs with my fiancé, I work in a Brazilian steakhouse and they sometimes sponsor spouses of employees), but if no promo chance for me and no chance of them sponsoring her, no real reason to stay besides a paycheck, and there are DEFINITELY better ways to earn, even in restaurants.

So, in the meantime, I am trying to figure out the best way to set myself up for future success while still surviving the here-and-now, and if I can escape the death trap that is hospitality sooner rather than later, ALL THE BETTER.

Any advice is helpful. I hope I don't sound unreasonable, entitled, etc. I'm coming with all of this from a place of some serious humility.",metalforhim777,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1745516506,2025-04-24 17:41:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6yeb8/making_major_moves_going_back_to_school_want/,4,2025
1k6y6gq,XRAY TECHS: how can I help this student?,"I am writing this with a broken heart. I am at a clinical site who does so many illegal things and treats students like animals. I am a second year about to graduate, but there are also freshmen who are expected to take images completely alone, unsupervised. Due to some of the completely unsafe conditions, I reported the site. My intentions were never for anyone to get hurt. I simply wanted a change here. I mentioned in my complaint how a freshman student retook a PA chest 6 times because he was ALONE and unsupervised. This wasn’t his fault. Every time we ask for help we’re treated as if we’re committing a crime and should know how to do things ourselves. Today I found out that student was kicked out of the program because of that same incident. I recently mentioned the incident to my clinical coordinator as well so I can only assume it was my big mouth that caused this. I have been crying since I found out. This student didn’t deserve this. Do I reach out to someone to try reiterating that he didn’t just refuse to find someone for help, he simply knew he had to figure things out on his own? Will I just get myself in trouble? I don’t even care at this point. I just don’t think this is fair. The guilt is eating me alive. This poor man lost his future while the site continues to do as they always have. Abuse students.

1k6y63y,(20F) Career & Degree Options? Feeling VERY lost!,"I (20F) have just accomplished my A.A. degree! But now that it's time to transition to my bachelor's, I am at a loss of what to pursue. I never had any real idea of what career I wanted to pursue- I am the first kid in my family to graduate college and explore non retail jobs. 

I wanted to share some of my skills, interests, and careers I've considered in the past, and see if any one can give me ideas! 

I love jobs that utilize management and leadership skills, and I work really well when it comes to managing people and projects. I considered taking these skills further, but I'm not sure in which field would. I was a food service manager for a couple years and left that environment- loved managing, just not there. 

I am a creative person. I have a little bit of experience with social media management, and my designing/art skills might land slightly above-average. I enjoy hobbies like drawing, painting, and sculpting, but those are moreso hobbies than skills (I'm not too great at them, but enjoy it nonetheless!) 

I have interest in psychology, neuroscience, behavioral research and drug research! This has led me to consider careers in therapy, psychiatry, clinical research management or pharmaceutical research, but genuinely  can't afford (let alone qualify) to put myself through med school, and math/science related subjects are VERY hit or miss for me as I struggle bad with ADHD and comprehending them! 

However, I do love to write! Research, communications, creative writing, I enjoy most forms of writing! I also love to read! I have no fear of public speaking, and consider myself to be a good presenter and communicator! 

I used to enjoy the idea of teaching! I liked the idea of lesson plan creating, classroom management, and fostering a nice environment for kids to learn, but ultimately the worsening teaching environment and near-unlivable salary in my state have turned me off from it. 

For any MBTI enthusiasts who may find it worth mentioning, my personality type is ENFJ!

Any ideas are welcome, even if they don't fit all of these details about me, I am pretty undereducated on the job market and what even exists for me to do!

1k6xts4,Need advice on career,"
Hi everyone, I’m currently pursuing Company Secretary (CS) and have cleared the Executive level. I’m also in my 2nd year of B.Com. I’m passionate about the corporate side of things, and I’m also deeply interested in finance.

Here’s where I’m at:

I plan to work for 3 years after completing CS to save money and gain experience.

I’m considering doing an MBA abroad by the age of 24 (and will prepare for the GMAT alongside work).

I want to work at a Big 4 firm after clearing Executive/Professional level for articleship/internship experience.

I’m confused about whether I should stick to the CS path, shift to core finance, or blend both with an MBA in the future.


My questions:

1. Has anyone here done CS and then moved into finance or an MBA abroad?


2. Can CS + Big 4 exposure help build a finance profile too?


3. Would a shift to CFA or core finance later be a better choice?


4. Is it worth sticking with CS if the end goal is an MBA abroad and a career in international finance/corporate roles?


I’d really appreciate thoughts, personal experiences, or even tough truths.",Necessary_Smile2697,1,1.0,1,1745515122,2025-04-24 17:18:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6xts4/need_advice_on_career/,4,2025

I’ve just accepted an internship offer at a large financial institution running mid-year through year-end, and HR wants to chat about the formal contract tomorrow. I’m also interviewing for another top-tier summer internship that would run slightly earlier.

1. Clarify the offer details (start/end dates, contract type, stipend, deferral policy)
2. See if they’d allow me to start a month later, without seeming uncommitted
3. Understand which contractual terms are normal to negotiate vs. which look bad

I am reaching out because I currently feel very lost with where I am in my job. My ultimate goal and wish is to be a better software engineer and eventually grow to be a senior someday (I am 27 yo and about to finish my CS degree with a data science specialisation)

I am working in the IT department of a finance related company that used to be very small and recently grew, but in the IT department the processes haven't really adapted yet. Legacy code base with huge theoretical complexity (Java, Spring, Maven, JavaFX) and a web application that is built in Angular (15-17) built by an external service provider with 5-6 developers from that company that have made software for us for the past 15 years. Me and another colleague were hired so they have internal 'back-up' but the communication is difficult, we don't have any project management basically, very waterfall based, barely any structured work, deadlines or planning. We feel lost about the fact that we were hired to help develop software but the circumstances don't help us grow or be better developers. In fact I feel like I am unlearning everything I learnt at uni because I cannot utilize it in the current architecture that is very customized from the general state of the art approaches.

We hardly get any support or feedback and it just sucks. Everytime we ask for structural changes and support we have to solve the issues ourselves. We are severly undermanaged and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, work ethic and confidence. I feel kind of depressed to be honest.

I love my coworkers and feel comfortable on a personal level. The pay is good and the job is very safe/stable so I feel so guilty and bad about feeling so lost work wise. I really don't know what to do, I am scared to give up the stability this job gives me but I feel like I am capable of more. What do I do?

Back to childhood I was a bit naughty that my parents and my father specially was so resented about it so I spent childhood experiencing physical abuse and been hit. 

I believe my father has too many mental issues that he is a person no one wants him including us ( Me, my mother and a younger sister), we just can't seek divorce as he will never ever accept it. 

I used to be smart at school, but since the first grade I used to be forced to study hard so I can take the first place throughout all my studying years, that I used to see my own worth in my degrees and whenever I got a B I was blamed. 

By 16 I was studying Ismail book Quran to learn Arabic and that was when everything changed, I was seeking perfection too bad that I was forcing myself to change, I cut of my friends, I changed whatever I liked to things accepted by religion, and then this way mental breakdown and depression started. 

I had to get a high degree as a junior, and I manged to get 94 out of 100 and started studying Electrical engineering, I was too isolated that I couldn't socialize and befriend, and the Studying electricity was too hard for me so I didn't have a year passing the first semester, yet my father never ever understood my situation and kept insulting me for not being the student I was before University. 

I graduated in 2018, and since then I never worked in the field, I have been working for low wage at a Cancer center, last year I decided to try to learn about Electricity again and have spent the last 8 months learning programs and the essentials. 

Now it's been a week that I have  started job shadowing with an electrical site engineer, but the work feels really hard, I hate the environment as it is really manly while I my self esteem has been shaking, I have to be getting along with electricians and be responsible for so many things. 

The work is hard, on the other hand my past is always there in my head, there are too much in my head to tell my father and I also have to keep silent as if I say anything he would never confront what he has made me, and I may get really angry to start a fight that may end at the police station.



I really don't know what to do, I don't know what I like to do as a career yet I really need money, if I have had money I could at least get a bit more standing for myself.

1k6v8r2,Should I switch jobs from working at a school to a group private practice?,"Hello everyone! I’m conflicted. I've been a school-based therapist for a new program at our district for 2 years now and I’m considering other settings to work in. Other than the bumps in the road in a new position, the job is also 1 hour commute each way and it's tiring. 

I have an opportunity to work at a group private practice that hires pre-licensed (I’m hoping to finish my license within a year) therapists seeing a variety of clients at an office. The perks of that job would be experience and proximity (literally about 5 minutes away) but I’d be giving up the school schedule (I work 197 days of the year), good salary, benefits and I’d be working 2 evenings/ 1 weekends. There are no hybrid or part time options in my current role. 

I really appreciate the school environment/ schedule because hubby and I are going to try to conceive this year so I don't want to regret leaving mainly JUST because of the drive. I’m not sure if I’d become bored of private practice work. The pay is structured different too, no shows/ cancels means I don’t get paid. 

Anyone have advice? I’d appreciate it thanks in advance!

Around me are lots of people who are so passionate and can talk eloquently about our area of work. I am very interested in my work but I have such a bad case of nerves around both public speaking and speaking in medium to large groups. 

I just came from a workshop where I had the chance to say some things but I kept getting too nervous to jump in because I didn’t know if I was going to make my point clearly and I didn’t know if it was relevant. I ended the workshop feeling upset and frustrated because I knew I had good points at times but I couldn’t assert myself enough to jump in. 

I used to struggle a lot with this in seminars at uni. I couldn’t speak up even if I’d done the work. Other people were able to ‘bullshit’ much easier in that they could talk about a topic they didn’t know in a clever sounding way. I am terrible at this. 

I do well in small groups and then feeding back to the large groups. But I just get so incredibly nervous in scenarios where I have to say what I think. I end up babbling so much and ending on an awkward note. 

Does this resonate with anyone and can anyone offer advice on how to overcome this? I think context is partly that often I’m one of the youngest in the room and haven’t been in my role very long.

1k6u3j8,Mid 20's career advice,"Hi everyone, 

I'll try to spare you all my life story but for context I'm currently 25 years old living in Manchester, working in the finance sector as an assistant accountant under a temporary contract before moving back into my previous role which is much more entry level. I've wanted to go into accounting for a while but after a year of doing it as cover I'm pretty hesitant on doing my qualifications as both the job market for accounts doesn't seem great along with I just don't feel all that interested in. 

Personally I'm not that interested in doing sales or recruiting which is what most people usually suggest, as I previously have worked in sales, both retail and cold calling which wasn't for me as I'm not a big people person. I also feel like every other sector that I've been interested in has either been very low paying for the amount of work you have to do or is very competitive with a really high level of entry needing a lot of qualifications which would put me into a crazy amount of student debt so is risky if it doesn't work out. 

Given the current state of the job market and being fairly young what sectors and jobs would people recommend someone like myself look into for long term career options?

I apply to countless jobs every day but it doesn't matter. Recruiters/hiring managers ghost me unless I hound them for updates, which usually just leads to an official rejection. Hybrid jobs are usually too far away to work into our schedule. With most jobs being remote, there always seems to be someone more qualified. 

I've all but given up on getting a job in my field anymore. Right we just need income but I don't really know what kind of jobs to take. We won't be able to get by on something minimum wage.

1k6t0iq,Former servers/bartenders who left hospitality for a 9–5: do you regret it?,"Hey Reddit, I could really use some perspective from folks who used to work in hospitality — especially bartenders or servers who made good money and then pivoted to a 9–5 job.



I’ve been in hospitality for about 20 years, and I still bartend weekends at a club where I make really solid cash — averaging around $470 a night. That income is what’s helping me aggressively pay down debt, including IRS stuff. But my main job now is a 9–5 office role as an Executive Assistant for a human services company. I actually like the company and want to grow there long-term, possibly in a more creative or outreach-based role.



Here’s the thing: I want to quit bartending. The late nights are wearing me out, and I’m craving stability, better sleep, and the chance to have a more ""normal"" life. But dropping that cash income would be a big financial hit. I’m working on paying off debt and saving, and I’m also planning to ask for a raise this summer to hopefully make the transition possible.



So I’m asking: if you made the leap from high-paying hospitality to a more structured 9–5 (with lower pay at first), was it worth it for your mental health, lifestyle, or career growth? Do you regret it? Would you do it again?



I’d really appreciate hearing your experiences — good, bad, or mixed. Thanks in advance",citizentintin215,1,1.0,2,1745503377,2025-04-24 14:02:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6t0iq/former_serversbartenders_who_left_hospitality_for/,4,2025

1k6rroj,Career Change and Graduating with a Bachelors,"Hello everyone.

I was hoping to get some input/advice on a few different things.

I am currently a full time employee as a Semiconductor Equipment Technician and will be graduating in August with a Bachelors in Data Analytics and an Associates in AI/ML. 

I have been having a tough time searching for any kind of internship or job related to my educational background. I have not received one phone call, either no response or rejection emails. I have applied to at least 100 positions by now since starting my search late last year.  I know the job market is extremely crappy right now, so I know that plays a pretty big factor into the difficulty. 

Outside of that I feel like my resume is pretty good. I have worked with multiple programming languages including Python, SQL, R, and a few others. I am familiar with different statistical analysis techniques. I am knowledgeable in the fields of AI/ML/DL. I also am pretty good with Excel and Power BI, and a little bit of Tableau. I have a few projects under my belt including an AI capstone project that uses computer vision to identify solar panels on buildings using satellite imagery. I also participated in an event hosted by Intel and created a computer vision program that helps identify objects and output auditory identifiers to assist the visually impaired.

There are some things that I worry about that I think may be hindering my search. I have not graduated yet so I do not actually have a degree. And since I work full time I am pursuing an online degree, which I feel may or may not be looked down upon; It would depend on the individual looking over my resume. I also feel like because the school I am going to to acquire my bachelors is advertised all over the place, that could also be a turn off when they see that.

As for my current job, my supervisor has been very kind and allows me to work on data related projects, about 75% of the time. So the majority of the time, I am not doing the normal responsibilities related to the role. In a way, I would like to say I am pretty much doing an internship. On my resume, I have tailored the description of these roles to include thinks such as project management, leading meetings with supervisors and engineers to discuss priorities and objectives. I have mined and gathered technician performance data, manipulated and transformed the data, constructed KPI dashboards and visualizations, and presented findings to upper management. The big worry of mine is the title of my job is ""Semiconductor Equipment Technician"". I feel like when individuals who may review my resume see that, they might think this is a red flag because all of the tasks I have listed are clearly not related to what someone would expect my position to do.

I have discussed with my supervisor about possible opportunities to transition to a full time data related role, but from what I am getting it doesn't seem likely. Since the current position and field I am in is completely unrelated, there aren't really data related roles available. And those that might be semi-related are already being handled by other employees.

My main focus has been applying for Business Intelligence Engineer/Analyst positions as that is truly what I am wanting to do career-wise. I really enjoy everything about those roles because most of the responsibilities include working with data, creating visualizations, and presenting to stakeholders. I have also tried applying for other positions such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, ML Engineer and anything else really related to Data or AI/ML. This way I can actually put on my resume an actual data related job title and that I have work experience in the field. 

I should also note that in what little free time I do have, I have been working towards acquiring some certifications on Coursera but have yet to complete any of them. Whether or not employers recognize Coursera certifications, I am not sure. At some point I also plan on taking the exam certifications that are offered directly through recognized companies like the PL-300, Microsoft's Power BI Data Analyst certification. I have also looked into the certification offered directly from Tableau and others such as the Associate Certified Analytics Professional (ACAP). 

Anyways, I will quit rambling on for now. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you very much!",Dachshund-Spin7166,3,0.800000011920929,1,1745500077,2025-04-24 13:07:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6rroj/career_change_and_graduating_with_a_bachelors/,4,2025
1k6reib,How can I invest in training to become competitive abroad?,"I'm 28 years old, I hold both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Mathematical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano (Italy). In about a month, I’ll be starting my first job at a consulting company (Accenture Group), with a starting gross annual salary of around €28K and the usual benefits.

As I mentioned in a previous post on an Italian subreddit, my original goal was to land a job abroad right away. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, so I’ll be staying in Italy for at least 1–2 years. I see this period as a personal investment—to gain experience, prove my worth, and prepare myself to move abroad as soon as I can. I'll be starting in a Data Analyst/Data Scientist role with some exposure to Machine Learning and AI.

I already have a solid programming foundation (mainly Python, MATLAB, and C++). I also have a strong personal interest in cybersecurity and pentesting, but so far it’s limited to online CTFs—no real work experience in the field yet. In the medium to long term, I’d love to work in an environment with a strong mathematical component (though I’m aware this often requires a PhD, which I’m not in a position to pursue), or at least in a challenging role—not spending eight hours a day building dashboards.

Luckily (or unluckily), I can temporarily live with my father rent-free and without major financial pressure, so I’d like to reinvest a good part of my salary into personal training to make the most of this time. I’m currently looking into serious, recognized certifications (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), advanced courses in ML/AI, or specializations in cybersecurity (CompTIA, CISSP, or similar).

My top priority is to leave Italy within a few years and significantly increase my current salary (around €1800/month net). I strongly believe that professional growth comes from becoming more competitive on the international job market. I’ve consumed a lot of content on personal finance and career strategy, and one key takeaway is that while budgeting helps, the real change comes from increasing your earning power.

So, I’m turning to the community for honest and direct advice:

* Can certifications and specialized courses (AWS, Cloud, Cybersecurity, ML/AI) *actually* improve my competitiveness in the international job market, or are they mostly ignored?
* At this stage in my career, do university pedigree and first-job prestige still weigh more than anything else?
* Since I didn’t get into big-name companies like Google or Amazon right out of school, how realistic is it to aim for those kinds of roles after a few years of experience?

I’d also love to hear from professionals in these fields—or anyone who has already gone through similar thought processes and career paths:  
**Which certifications or specific courses would you personally recommend to truly maximize future job opportunities?**

Any advice, insights, or constructive criticism is deeply appreciated—thank you so much to anyone willing to share!",ThomasHawl,1,1.0,1,1745499042,2025-04-24 12:50:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6reib/how_can_i_invest_in_training_to_become/,4,2025

1k6qhwe,I built an AI Agent to Find and Apply to jobs Automatically - What I learned and features we added,"
It started as a tool to help me find jobs and cut down on the countless hours each week I spent filling out applications. Pretty quickly friends and coworkers were asking if they could use it as well so I got some help and made it available to more people.

We’ve incorporated a ton of user feedback to make it easier to use on mobile, and more intuitive to find relevant jobs! The support from community and users has been incredibly useful to enable us to build something that helps people.

The goal is to level the playing field between employers and applicants. The tool doesn’t flood employers with applications (that would cost too much money anyway) instead the agent targets roles that match skills and experience that people already have.

There’s a couple other tools that can do auto apply through a chrome extension with varying results. However, users are also noticing we’re able to find a ton of remote jobs for them that they can’t find anywhere else. So you don’t even need to use auto apply (people have varying opinions about it) to find jobs you want to apply to. As an additional bonus we also added a job match score, optimizing for the likelihood a user will get an interview.

There’s 3 ways to use it:

1.	⁠⁠Have the AI Agent just find and apply a score to the jobs then you can manually apply for each job
2.	⁠⁠Same as above but you can task the AI agent to apply to jobs you select
3.	⁠⁠Full blown auto apply for jobs that are over 60% match (based on how likely you are to get an interview)

It’s as simple as uploading your resume and our AI agent does the rest. Plus it’s free to use and the paid tier gets you unlimited applies, with a money back guarantee. It’s called SimpleApply",Individual_Mood6573,246,0.9300000071525574,5,1745496292,2025-04-24 12:04:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6qhwe/i_built_an_ai_agent_to_find_and_apply_to_jobs/,4,2025

1k6nuws,"My manager was changed, and I don't trust this new manager, and don't like the decisions she's making.","So I got into this company. Everything was perfect. Good money, work that I love, nice people, lovely manager giving me freedom to do my job, which lead to extra efficiency and I was promoted to expert and fixed lots of thigs with miss Y (let's call my manager miss X). We were going forward.

Recently, the manger was changed, and Y was assigned as my manager. Everything went right down the sink hole.

Miss Y was completely changed. Mannerism, work etiquettes. She became controlling, which cut the extra bit of efficiency I had with miss X. She became a stone hearted person (I know workplace demands this attitude). So I started laughing less.

From the two instances I had with her, I realized that I can't trust her at all and the decisions she'd made which affected me, were made without even telling me.

Now I'm working like a scared rat, because I'm pretty sure if I make a mistake, there's no one to back me up, and the simplest mistake can lead to big issues. So yeah... I don't love my work the same as before, it's more like ""like"" now. And the reason I was promoted to expert is now taken from me. And most importantly, I'm not going forward. I'm just getting my job done.

In an act of haste, I paid about twice my monthly wage (money was good) and am taking a course for Network to change the field entirely and become a Helpdesk/IT expert somewhere down the line. I have a year worth of time.

Should I give miss Y more chances to disappoint me or leave and never look back when the course is over?

And yeah, we had about 3 talking sessions, and the last one I had to fake everything was ok, which in fact, was not and will probably never be. I told her that if my manager tells me to go to hell, I will go and come back, I just expect a glass of water every now and then. She smiled and said she will walk beside me. Poetic, but I don't really deal with poems. I just want to work in peace.",theuntouchable2725,2,1.0,4,1745486378,2025-04-24 09:19:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6nuws/my_manager_was_changed_and_i_dont_trust_this_new/,4,2025
1k6nr3v,"Feel under qualified for my job role, and overwhelmed.","I really don't know what to do. I worked in administrative role in healthcare for a year and a half. My department shared an office with another higher up department that is more legal work. My department is shutting down, and only needs a small team of staff so they've been offering new jobs and relocating people.

I was told the higher up legal team wanted me and 2 others for our ""work ethic"" because we basically did our work I guess lol. 

The problem is, I don't have the same admin experience as the rest of my team. They were lowstaff on a liaison team so I spent most of my time working off site in a hospital not doing admin based work. 

I've started this job and the training is just so much. They'd say ""You're familiar with x y z of course"" and I'd have to say ""actually no, they didn't get me trained on this stuff"" and then that's MORE information to learn.

The stuff they're teaching me is so technical, so precise and it's just word vomit to me. 

My last departments team was very cliquey and since we're based in the same location it's been difficult. The people on my old team did NOT like me or I didn't like them. They didn't like me because indidnt speak to them much because they were very openly racist and homophobic and sexist, my team lead would brag and joke about how he attacked a gay man on a night out not knowing that I'm gay. 

This new team is great, they're nice, friendly and diverse I guess? I like them but idk. I just feel so far out of my depth. They say I'm learning fast and doing well (I'm doing basic intern shit while they train me on the actual work) and they've been very patient and tell me if I ever need help or a minute to process I can take it.

The team is supportive and they want to help me but I still feel like this is something I'll never get the hang of. Idk. I just feel embarrassed and useless and it doesn't help to still be sharing an office space with my old team who spends their time giggling at my behind their backs. 

This was a ramble and a mess I'm sorry lol. I just genuinely don't know what to do or where to go from here. ",ThrowRa78584,2,1.0,1,1745485901,2025-04-24 09:11:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6nr3v/feel_under_qualified_for_my_job_role_and/,4,2025

1. **Job Nature**: The role should involve physical action and mobility, minimizing prolonged desk-based work.

2. **Social Interaction**: The work environment should facilitate frequent interactions with colleagues, clients, or stakeholders.

3. **Career Location**: The branch should offer strong employment prospects in the Middle East (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE) to enable long-term settlement.

4. **Family Considerations**: The career should support keeping my family together, ideally through visa sponsorship and financial stability in the Middle East.

5. **Academic Interests**: The curriculum should align with my interests in mathematics, physics, design, and automobile engineering.

6. **Work Environment**: The workplace should emphasize teamwork and execution-focused tasks, delivering tangible outcomes.

I’ve been applying for entry-level roles in software engineering, and I’m starting to feel overwhelmed. It seems like a lot of companies now want candidates who are fullstack developers, have DevOps skills, and even know AI/ML at a high level for entry level, even cloud as well.

I initially focused on DevOps, AI/ML, Cloud and thought that would be enough to get started as i never saw myself going into web development, but now it feels like I need to be a jack of all trades just to land an entry-level job.

Is this really the new normal in 2025? Are companies expecting too much from freshers, or am I just looking in the wrong places?

Would love to hear what others are experiencing, especially those who recently landed a role or are actively applying.

I personally love Tech and don't care about learning more than what i know, but in the end of the day i need a job LOL, so any advice would be great!

Thanks in advance!

1k6lvdx,Feeling Lost and Humiliated in My Internship - Need Advice on Resigning?,"
Hello everyone,
I'm a (21M) in my 4th year of engineering (specializing in AI/ML) and currently doing an SDE internship at a tech company in India. My start date was back in February, but for the first 2.5 months, I wasn't allocated to any project. Finally, I was asked to come into the office for training, but it quickly became clear that the work has absolutely nothing to do with AI/ML. I'm stuck doing backend testing and other tasks that are completely outside my area of study and interest. Honestly, AI and ML are what truly fascinate me, and this feels like a bait-and-switch.

To make matters worse, the person training me is a higher-up in the company, and from day one, I've felt incredibly looked down upon. Being the youngest and perhaps less experienced in the room, I often feel excluded as everyone speaks in their native language, leaving me completely lost. There have been instances where I've genuinely felt mocked and humiliated by the entire team.

I'll be the first to admit that I don't currently possess all the specific skills they seem to expect. However, during the hiring process, there was a clear promise of eventually working on an AI project, which is the main reason I accepted this internship even tho it was an sde role(i prefered ai roles). That hasn't materialized at all.


All of these feelings have built up recently, and today I made the decision not to go into the office. I'm now facing a wave of anxiety about the whole situation, my intern colleagues have called me and i havent picked up. I have no idea about the proper procedures for resigning from an internship, and I'm stressed about having to explain my absence and then suddenly resign.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What's the best way to handle this? Any advice on how to resign professionally and navigate this awkward situation would be greatly appreciated. I feel completely lost and any guidance would be a huge help.
Thanks in advance.",N1thish69,1,1.0,1,1745477733,2025-04-24 06:55:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6lvdx/feeling_lost_and_humiliated_in_my_internship_need/,4,2025
1k6ltvt,MSIT vs MBA.

By now, I know about online programs and that would make me eligible at least for  internships. But here's the dilemma. There is an option of getting masters in IT with a chance of becoming a QA engineer (manual/automation). However it is going to narrow down the career positions and make me specialize in one field only, where they can always hire foreign workers for a cheaper price, let alone AI that can possibly replace human testing. In the meantime MBA offers a broad range of positions in corporate world, however if there are more MBA jobs and it is relatively easier to get then the value of that degree is not that high which is not gonna make me any different from others. I know additional certs is a plus but I need to start working and getting experience asap. If anyone knows different programs or opportunities let's discuss them. Appreciate it.

1k6kbtm,One year in they dissolved my job function,"TLDR at the bottom.

I've been in the video game development industry for 15 years now. I stared as a 3D Artist, learned coding, became a Technical Artists and worked as that for the majority of my career.

Last year I was recruited to one of the largest companies as a Technical Product Manager - my first management position. Compensation was quite nice, and it included RSU shares (which 1/3 has been vested - released).

This year they announced the dissolution of the PM job family within my organization. They say that PM is folded into delivery (meaning: engineering... Meaning: they think developers, UX, Tech Artists and other subject-matter experts can do the work). Naturally this came as a shock to me - as well as my manager who was only notified 2 weeks ahead of me despite being a Director and part of the extended leadership team.

Emotionally it's been like a rug-pull or a punch in the face: all my motivation is gone, I barely do anything at work anymore. I came here to gain management experience and now I'm told that most likely I will be pushed back to an IC (individual contributor) role as a Technical Artist. I dislike the thought of that but I still wear golden handcuffs (equity) that won't be fully released until 2 more years have passed.

When this re-organization was announced, the VP of Technical Product Management left... Or was sacked... Nobody really knows but my theory is that Product was pushed away by our new General Manager (an engineer who has been with the company only a couple years).

I've talked to many in this organization including the Head of the Technical Art department in the org. I've expressed interest in other management positions (Technical Art Direction) but she seemed very hesitant to discuss this - and I get it: I've only been with the company for 1 year. I lack hands-on experience with the product.

I've tried looking for other jobs, did a really good rounds of interviews for a studio that works on my favorite game. They were impressed by my background but picked someone else.

The job market in game dev is really shit right now. There's maybe 10% job ads compared to peak, pre-covid times, and I don't want to lose my unvested stocks.

TLDR: Game dev veteran bring pushed back to a regular employee job after working one year as manager. External - not personal reasons. Motivation gone but I'm stuck here due to unvested equity.",Big-Veterinarian-823,1,1.0,3,1745471618,2025-04-24 05:13:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6kbtm/one_year_in_they_dissolved_my_job_function/,4,2025

I’m in my final semester of my\_qualifications: Computer Science Engineering from a tier 3 college in India with a CGPA of 9.2. I’m currently interning at a company that’s offered me a full-time role for ₹3.5 LPA. The work is okay, not bad, but definitely not exciting.

I’m considering doing a Master’s in Germany, preferably in AI or something tech that’s booming. I don’t have much hands-on experience in AI yet, but I’m curious and willing to learn. I come from a decent financial background — my family is ready to support me with around ₹10–20 lakhs (can stretch via an education loan if needed).

I looked into universities like TUM and RWTH. I’ve heard TUM is now charging tuition for non-EU/EEA students starting this year (\~€3,000–€6,000 per semester), so I’m factoring that in too. I know some public unis still offer tuition-free programs, though.

I’m torn between:

1. Taking the job and building skills slowly through online learning, side projects, etc.
2. Going all in on higher studies in Germany, hoping for better opportunities later.

Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar spot? Is the MS worth the money and risk in 2025, especially with the job market being shaky in places? Would love some real talk.

I showed the design team the new chatGPT image and they still thank me until now for it . My boss said “I don’t know what you do, but keep it up!” No prob sir, I will continue asking chatGPT politely...

For meetings, I just let granola record it. For emails and notes, I’m too lazy to organize things so I set up a second brain called saner. Every time someone asked about meeting, emails, I just asked ai while they was still debating what was said. Do people not know this is possible?

My boss loved all of the results. He called me into his office and suggested I lead a training session to level up the rest of the team. I agreed, thinking I'd basically be teaching everyone How to ask AI the right questions lol

But, yesterday, my coworker was demoing ChatGPT during lunch. My boss walked by and froze. I saw him stared at the screen, slowly widened his eyes in awe and said, ""Wait, is that what (myname) has been doing?""

Then he called into a meeting and said, ""I trusted you. You made me look foolish bragging about your skills to clients and upper management. All your performance are from AI. You're a liar."" !?!?

He genuinely believed that using AI to do the work was deceptive!? I tried explaining that it's just a tool, like Excel but smarter, but he wasn't convinced. Luckily, some of my teammates and upper management already knew what I was doing and actually supported it. But this still caught me off guard and I’m not sure how to deal with the boss moving forward. Any advice/recommendation would be super helpful, thanks

TL;DR: Used AI to work, nailed it, boss found out, feels betrayed, and thinks I'm a liar.",LateProposalas,19,0.5699999928474426,61,1745465452,2025-04-24 03:30:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6ikiv/using_ai_to_work_more_efficient_and_my_boss/,4,2025
1k6i5qu,Senior Analyst to Manager Salary Jump,"Hi all, 

First time poster in this Forum. 

I recently moved internally from a senior analyst role to a manager role into a new division within a global financial services provider, bearing in mind I’ve only been working at this company for under a year. 

I was offered a 17.5% total increase to my base and my total rem package (inc. super) now is 153k inc super with an additional 3% super on top of that through employer matching. But now I regret not pushing more? 

I didn’t ask HR for the salary range guide before moving as I didn’t want to lose out on the opportunity as I’ve only been working for 4 years and am only 24.

I just wanted to know what is usually expected for internal promotions and from senior analyst levels to a manger level?

Thanks!

1k6i283,"Staying, Asking for a Raise, or Moving on?","Hi everyone, I (25m) have been at this new job for about 9 months now. Really enjoying it… great coworkers, PTO policy, etc. Compared to my last job it is light years ahead in relative pay, hours working, stress, and about every generally frustrating part of work.

Honestly… I’m a little bored. I don’t have much responsibility and kind of sit in the background on meetings. When I started, they said it was about a full year of onboarding to really process the company but I feel like I’ve pretty much completed that “newness” feel to most tasks. It’s in a marketing-related field and at the end of the day it’s just not that hard.

Anyways, I make OK money for my age and location but like almost everyone would like to be making more. I’ve started to get more comfortable with talking to coworkers about raises/promotions, and have been a little disappointed with how it works here. They said “I’ve never gotten a raise, not even a cost-of-living adjustment” and they’ve all been here 2-3 years longer than me. They all work pretty hard and seem well liked by their managers. Another coworker (who used to be in my department) said a few months ago my department was “a dead end”.

Another concern is our industry is really getting hit hard by Trump’s EOs. In fact, 3 of my clients I work on are already thinking of not renewing because they’re simply losing their budget. Our company has also had layoffs for 3 consecutive years.

I might be overreacting but I kind of see the writing on the wall and wonder how they’re going to keep paying everyone if so many people are dropping out. Part of me trusts I’m doing a good enough job to prove I’m worth it, the other part of me feels I’m too new and don’t have enough responsibility to justify keeping me IF layoffs happen.

So, my question is, do I grind it out for a few more months, prove myself, and pray I make it through layoffs again? Do I ask for a raise in my annual review, or at least a market adjustment, or are adjustments not normal anymore? Do I start looking elsewhere for a better paying job? I know these days the fastest way to move up in pay is switch companies, but I do really like this one so far.",you-the-real-mvp,2,1.0,5,1745463809,2025-04-24 03:03:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6i283/staying_asking_for_a_raise_or_moving_on/,4,2025
1k6hnfb,Should I relocate for a full-time temporary job? [urgent],"Hello everyone,

I (22F) graduated last August and has been looking for job. I just received a verbal offer for a 10-month contract job with no guarantee of hours and requires me to relocate (7 hours of driving). Ideally, I need to be there in about two weeks to start the training. They give me until the end of tomorrow to consider so that’s why it’s urgent.

The thing is, I just moved back home to live with my mom. I began studying abroad since I was 16, so I had lived away from my mom for 5 years. Since I moved back, I realized how great it was to have my mom by my side, and that we can do things like grocery shopping, cooking, driving together for everyday. My brother lives in another country as well, so I feel like my mom really appreciates having me by her side.

I’m trying to think if it’s really worth moving for this role. I would extremely appreciate everyone’s thoughts and opinions! Thank you!

1k6hit5,Refuse promotion?,"I’ve been at this organization for 3.5 years at the “senior specialist” level. My director left two years ago and they didn’t replace that position/ title, but I have been doing the director duties for two years. (Typically it goes specialist, senior specialist, manager, director, senior director, VP, though not all departments have all levels).

Discussions of a promotion have been pushed down the line again and again because I’m now on my third boss in two years. There is some dysfunction at the top.

Now that multiple people have left my department, I’ve been offered a promotion for the director level, which I have earned and about which I should be excited. However, my salary would only go from $75K to $80K. I am almost offended and feel like I might as well keep my current title and role instead of way more responsibility for just $5K. I know other directors start at $100K. 

Am I overreacting? How can I ask for more? I did mention it to my current boss and he said he would talk to his boss about it but “there are a lot of VPs wanting raises for their staff.” So I’m not optimistic. I do want to advance my career. 

What increase is fair to ask for?

1k6hcvr,Juggling 2 job offers,"I am graduating next week with my master's degree in Public Health. I have been a paramedic for 12 years, worked 3 years as an oncology clinical coordinator and 5 years as an anesthesia tech (with overlap, because it was 2 different hospitals). I applied to several jobs earlier this month. 

2.5 weeks ago I interviewed for a supervisor position in my current department (anesthesia). I've worked here 5 years, I am a shift lead, I have taught education sessions and was even in the running for a promotion to manager last year but they selected a more tenured tech for promotion. After that, our director spoke to me specifically about her decision and said she wanted to help me get more leadership experience by making me a supervisor. I followed up with her and after 8 months, HR finally allowed creation of a new supervisor role. Several other coworkers also applied. I feel my interview went very well, it was short but also everyone on the panel knows me very well. They said it would be 3 weeks before they would have a decision. 


While browsing the internal hospital job board the next day, I happened to see a position for an oncology program coordinator. I love oncology- a lot more than anesthesia, honestly, and this was a field of oncology I have already worked in and have immense experience and knowledge with. Almost all of my MPH has involved research and internships in oncology, working with non-profits and doing program management. I was so excited to see that job that I applied AND I cold-emailed the medical director, introducing myself and expressing my interest in the position. They interviewed me and offered me the job literally on the spot. 

On Monday, the oncology hiring manager emailed to let me know they wanted to move forward with a formal offer but she wanted to be respectful of my current position and did not want to talk to my manager until I had talked to him first. 

HR then called and gave me the salary for that position and its...really disappointing. I'm not sure if I assumed I would make more money with an MPH, but the pay ends up being almost exactly the same as what I make now. And it's a job at the exact same hospital so I'm honestly really surprised it was so low. They offered $64k, salaried. I currently make $65-$70k as an anesthesia tech. I currently make a lower hourly wage but with access to on-call, overtime, incentive pays, staffing bonus, lead worker differential, etc. Probably 20% of my current income is actually OT and differentials, but I'm really trying to move upwards into hospital leadership and management. 

Being a supervisor in my current department would pay nearly 6 figures because my hourly wage would go up and I would keep access to overtime, differentials, on call etc. It actually has mandatory on-call that is shared with the supervisor team. All of our supervisors are averaging $105k. That might go down a bit with the addition of another person to share on-call with. The job tasks are also much more dry and ""supervisory"" and involve disciplinary actions, being available overnight sometimes for emergency phone call questions, doing scheduling and staffing, and more HR-type tasks. 

The oncology position is more project development-oriented, something I'm more interested in. The pay is just really bothering me. When I asked the HR rep if the salary was negotiable she told me she had picked up my file from another person and didn't really know.

I spoke to my manager this evening and told him I had been offered another position, but that I was more interested in being a supervisor with our department and remaining there. But I told him that because I have a masters degree now, I am ready to move outside of being a technician, into hospital leadership roles and I didn't want to forgo a leadership opportunity if it turns out I am not being considered for promotion. I reiterated that I was more interested in a position with our department and asked if he had an update. He said the team is meeting tomorrow to make a final decision on supervisors and I should know by Friday if I am offered the position. I *feel* like I would be the natural candidate. Of all 4 internal applicants, I'm the only one with a graduate degree, I've worked there the longest, and I have very good rapport with the director who referred me to the position in the first place. However, my department is rather slow and male-oriented and hqs a bit of a problem with favoritism which makes me feel less confident. I think EVEN if they made a decision on Friday, I wouldn't hear about it until Monday or even later. 

Meanwhile, the oncology program is just very excited to get my transfer pushed through. I have a vacation on May 1 for 2 weeks (already approved), but they basically want to start me on the Monday I get back. I'm just still so uncertain about the salary. It's SOO much lower than what I want, basically no different than what I make now. I don't know if I would be able to negotiate later after proving my value or if I'm then stuck at that entry level pay tier, relying on annual raises to get me somewhere. 

1. Is it unprofessional to bring up the salary with the hiring manager who interviewed me and offered me the job on the spot, since the HR rep seemed like she had no clue about my case file?

2. Is there a way to stall with her until Friday when I could possibly check in with my current manager about the supervisor decision? I do work nights, so realistically I'm actually sleeping all day tomorrow anyways and wouldn't normally be having meetings or making phone calls and my manager works 100% remote right now and is pretty hard to get ahold of. 

3. Is there a way to ask about remote work/hybrid? I didn't bring it up in the interview. I actually live 50 minutes from the hospital. The supervisor role is hybrid- 3 days on site 2 days remote. I did not even ask about that in the other interview.

I want to be able to make a fully informed decision as opposed to a decision based on just pay or my own department's slowness/lack of response. 

ETA- my primary motivator is probably income, if I'm being honest. I've been a single mother for 12 years, scraping through school to have financial freedom. I am completely comfortable and content with my current income, but having more earning potential would help me pay off my student loans now and also have better savings and retirement. So if my pay doesn't change, I'm not destitute, but I would really like to have more financial freedom and security.

I also do have quite a lot of work satisfaction where I am. Both jobs would give me different types of satisfaction, both are meaningful to me in their own ways, oncology probably gives me more creative license upfront but I'm worried about the salaried aspect/potentially feeling over-worked. I'm used to working 3 night shifts and both jobs are M-F 8-hour days.

1k6hbfz,Really really need help with a seemingly perfect and productivity/efficiency freak boss and how to handle this?,"So my boss is know to be super duper efficient. His personal life looks like this- He runs all his kids' errands, makes and gets his own lunch to work, keeps fit and healthy, cooks great, chores managed by him, every minute he gets free he has something planned out to do, seems like he needs no one for anything. Like his entire day is planned out without needing even a few mins of ""useless wasteful sitting and doing nothing"" kinda time. Busy is his middle name 

At work it's the same, he used to be a one man army before a couple of us joined, he trained us pretty well, supportive, encouraging, witty, funny, extremely charismatic, super popular , a bit of notorious (in a fun way) and all nice things...

He is extremely fast at doing everything....it's just 'just do it's attitude that gets to me. Now I am not that fast, I am fairly new to the org and process, he is training me for things, grooming me for growth etc...He wants me to be very fast, efficient and very pedantic about almost everything. I was once asked to give hour by hour breakdown of what my day looks like in form of percentage. I get asked why something takes time when it's so easy.. for example if sending an e-mail takes 2 mins then I can send 10 emails in 20 mins. The rest 40 mins I can do other important things. Also, if I attend any summits (company organised summits) I get questioned on what it's for and if it's beneficial, useful etc. I was cared to tell him that I was going there because I was really interested even if it wasn't super relevant. It's a rare chance for me to network and didn't want to miss. But I know he'd ask who I wanted to network with lol. Like everything I even do at work gets questioned- don't know if it's like criticism but to understand why I do what I am doing and the outcome. And then if he thinks it's not good enough, then he advises me more. I feel a bit controlled, I could be wrong. 

I've also been asked to logically assess where I take time. As in how and when and why...dig deeper and find out why I am missing a couple of things (really unimportant to me but important to someone else). If I am missing because I forgot then I have to dig deep to understand WHY and have an action plan for it. I get immediate feedback if I'd ask a question in a group chat that I may have forgotten the answer to. Such small annoyances irritates him. He also keeps a tab of everything we say and do and sometimes it gets back to us so he doesn't have to take any blame. Like I can't say I had trouble with some work, if I do, he'll help me but in future he'll hold this against me as ""I had to step in and solve this on your behalf""

I am pretty good at what I do and I make sure what's important  is always my priority and I am trusted to do things my own way sometimes but I've had to work my ass off to gain that small trust. But I also feel like I can never catch up with them. This affects me. Like I'll always fall short and will never go good enough for them. Honestly, I don't want to be this productive ro efficient that it becomes my life. 

I don't know what his personal life looks like but he keeps complaining about kids, multiple mentions of 'happy wife happy life', says having everything he has is enough but in a negative tone, complaining about how slow the company is, shitty the processes are, how much expenses he has etc. I feel sorry to say this but I sometimes feel sorry for his wife/partner. I know I couldn't handle this personality myself. It affects me. I don't have even a small part of the life he has and it hurts me to hear all this. My life is challenging in many ways and I don't talk about it or bring it to work. And on top of it, he brings a bit of that personality to work.

1k6h24k,"Took a job despite red flags because of extended unemployment, is it crazy to quit?","I got laid off in mid 2024 and after seven months of unemployment I got my first and only job offer. During the recruiting process there were a ton of red flags (recruiter misrepresented a bunch of stuff, I got asked a bizarre question by a member of senior staff, one person volunteered that the company can be hard to work for when I asked what they liked about working there, etc) but I took the job anyway because the salary was 20k more than I was making at my last job and I was about to run out of health insurance.

I've been here a month and a half and i'm on the brink of losing it. My onboarding was basically my manager dumping responsibilities on me, with the occasional ""knowledge transfer"" that consisted of someone showing me something once and then declaring me trained. Within my first week of employment my manager announced publicly that I was taking on a critical weekly task and since then i've been struggling because everyone is expecting me to be able to diagnose and investigate issues for systems i've barely been exposed to. The scope of my role also keeps changing, basically everything I was told in the interview I would be helping with is now exclusively my responsibility and my manager has also been adding ad hoc responsibilities like suddenly owning some specific documentation for other teams.

My third week at the company I had to work a sequence of late nights and during the weekend to get my work done, and on the fourth week I was voluntold into a CEO special project that also required nights and weekends. This feels insane for someone who just started and while I knew that this role wasn't going to be an exclusive 9-6, the fact that I didn't even get through my probation period before they unleashed on me feels beyond the pale.

Would it be foolish to quit this job if I still have enough money to survive? I never stopped applying to other jobs because I knew when I took this job I wasn't staying for the long haul, but so far it's been a lot of ghosting from companies so I haven't had any phone screens or interviews and I don't see that changing any time soon.",TapewormUprising,3,1.0,9,1745460964,2025-04-24 02:16:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k6h24k/took_a_job_despite_red_flags_because_of_extended/,4,2025

How did it happen?,"I'm on the cusp of 30 and despite doing very well at school and, to an extent, uni, I'm now almost ten years on and have nothing to show for it. Much of that wasted time was forced on me by illness, physical and mental, but I have also made some pretty poor and consistently poor life choices. I have a job that pays an average wage but it's not in a field I'm especially passionate about. More damning is that I haven't really developed any skills. I don't have any hard skills to boast of; I can speak decently but I can't really write. I have a high IQ in the abstract but it isn't tied to anything and all this is driven home by how successful all my friends are. Literally, my best mate is worth £100 million, all self-made. Several of my old uni friends are variously successful creatives. The rest are on partnership tracks at international law firms. I feel like a loser and I'm haunted by regret for lost time.

I get that that aspect of my situation is likely to be uncommon (I have an annoyingly successful close circle) but have any of you also made a mess of your life and stunk out your 20s and then turned things around, dramatically, at 30?

During my recovery, I taught myself programming and have been working to transition into software engineering. I've also started some entrepreneurial ventures and will be participating in an accelerator program this summer. I finally got a work trial this week, which would be my first actual software engineering job, but I'm noticing some concerning signs and could use advice.

The position requires being in the office 5 days a week, 9AM to what seems like an undefined evening time. Everyone appears to be walking on eggshells around the CEO, who apparently has no coding experience and has very unrealistic expectations about timelines. Today I left ""early"" at 7PM and felt judged for it, this would be the daily norm. Mind you I have an hour and a half commute

More concerning, I the lead engineer laughing was very openly reading negative reviews of the company and laughing today, and laughing at the engineering queue. Looking into it myself, I found multiple reviews calling the company a ""scam"" because they don't ship their product until weeks after ordering. My role would involve fixing numerous problems with their website, which seems more broken than initially described. 

Is it worth pushing through for the experience after a 3-year employment gap and to get that first software engineering job on my resume, or are these red flags too significant?

1k6epz1,"Is $75K enough to live comfortably in Bentonville, AR as a single person?","TL;DR: Got a $75K offer in Bentonville, AR. I’m a single international student with no other offers. Is this enough to live and save?

Hey folks,
I just got a job offer and wanted to get some honest opinions before I make a final decision. The role is in Bentonville, Arkansas, and the base salary is $75,000. I’m single, no kids. Benefits include health insurance (60% employer-paid), 401k with 50% match up to 3%, $65/month wellness stipend, and potential stock options.

Here’s the situation:

After taxes, that comes out to around $4,600/month take-home.

I’ll have rent, car, groceries, student loan payments, and general living expenses.

I’m also trying to save and build some financial cushion — not just survive paycheck to paycheck.


On a call, the recruiter had mentioned something closer to $50/hour ($104K/yr), which would’ve been way more comfortable. While I appreciate the offer, I’m just trying to figure out whether $75K is actually livable in Bentonville — especially since I’ll be moving and starting fresh.

Also, for context — I’m an international student and I honestly don’t have many other options right now. The market’s rough, and I don’t know when I’ll get another offer like this again. So I’m in this weird place where I want to accept it, but I’m also scared of being stuck financially.

So my questions are:

1. Can a single person live comfortably on $75K in Bentonville, AR, assuming rent + bills + student loan + modest savings goals?


2. Anyone living in Bentonville — what are your actual monthly expenses like?


3. Any red flags or things I should be thinking about that I might be missing?



Would love to hear your thoughts or personal experiences — especially from anyone who’s lived/worked in Bentonville or has been in a similar spot.

1k6dvxy,When to Confirm Salary Range?,"Hi All,

I have a friend that applied for a technical position, but no salary range listed.

He has been called for an interview tomorrow, and was curious when to confirm the salary range.

I would think just confirm it before agreeing to the interview, but I am curious on other opinions.

Should he:
-Ask at the beginning of the interview? Worry here is that if it's too low it will demotivate the entire interview.
-Ask at the end of the interview? Atleast he can go through the interview excited etc.
-Only care if the job is offered?

He does have good experience, and is currently still employed, so there is a floor for him to even consider switching.

Just curious how he should navigate this.

My question is, how do I leave the position I'm currently in only after just starting?

The money is about the same with only a different of about 50-100 dollars a month (the tribe is paying more plus benefits).

* 4–14 days: Most common. They’re still interviewing other people or arguing in a group chat.
* 15+ days: Not always bad news. One person waited through the entire Christmas–New Year break and got an offer.
* Ghosted: Sadly, still a thing. The worst timeline.

A hiring manager told me delays happen when someone’s on PTO, or feedback is mixed across rounds (tech round loved you, behavioral round said “meh,” now they’re debating in Slack). Sometimes they even throw in an extra round last-minute.

What kept me from going full spiral mode during the wait?

* Keep applying—don’t bet it all on one company

They were very pressed about my 7 month tenure at first company and asked many detailed questions about the situation. There was a moment where I did tear up, but I did not let myself cry and pressed through. I did choke up at times but I really did as best as I could.

I did see George brown offer a CoC (certificate of completion for PLC programming, would it be best for me to do this (which takes around 8 months but is 100% online) and hope that plus my schooling is enough? Or is it better to go back to school to get all the hands on experience and have a well rounded program?

Im concerned of doing it for 8 months and then either i struggle to find a job without feeling fully ready which wastes more time or just do it right and commit the 3 years?

1k663q9,How to deal with an incompetent team member?,"This is a long one, but please help me!
A little background... the company i work for is pretty big, but I'm in a team of 3 people, a manager and 2 entry level people.

My team has always been me and my manager but we recently had a new person join the team, we work in a very niche area of marketing (not able to specify) we drive high volumes for the business but our work is pretty basic and easy. Our daily tasks differ every day so me and the other entry level person ( let's call her Olivia) are required to send daily updates to our manager about what our tasks are for the day to ensure nothing is being missed. 

Olivia has only been with us for a month or so now, and I have trained her on EVERYTHING we do, all the reports we run, i have built templates for before she joined to help her, i have written up step by step guides for some admin tasks we need to do monthly, i have walked her through every report/task we do MULTIPLE times. And yet... she can't grasp anything we are doing, every tasks that is assigned to her she asks for help, we end up being on a call for hours just running through her to do list. My manager is aware that I help her a lot but he doesn't know to what extent, if she receives an email that I am CC'd in she asks me to write up the answer to it/tell her what to say. A lot of our tasks are mostly speaking with external partners and it involves a bit of guess work, but it genuinely does not require much brain power.

This has taken up 80% of my day and leaves me falling behind my own tasks. As I am the one training her and ensuring completion of her tasks, if something isn't done it reflects badly on me as well. 

She does not like our manager and constantly complains about him when he's not around, and it's the same with my manager complaining about her (he does it in a more corporate way though)

I feel like i am stuck between a rock and a hard place, i do not want to tell my manager that i would like to help her less as im worried itll seem like im not a team player, it's quite annoying as I love this job and all the benefits that come with it, i have put a lot of effort into building and optimising reports we run and all the reoccurring tasks we have.

I really do not know what to do, me helping her constantly is making me fall behind on my our tasks and I do not want it to seem like I am underperforming.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I really am clueless on what to do in this situation",OkLavishness8619,6,0.8700000047683716,32,1745431884,2025-04-23 18:11:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k663q9/how_to_deal_with_an_incompetent_team_member/,4,2025

1k65sus,I'm desperate to change my career - but I'm lost,"I've \[25F\] came to the conclusion that I need to change jobs—like, yesterday. I'm currently working at the university I graduated from. It’s my first job, and at first, I really loved it. But after three years, it’s clear to me that I need to move on.

They recently transferred me to a different department, and now my responsibilities don’t align with my interests at all. The work is incredibly demanding—both physically and mentally—and on top of that, it’s terribly underpaid. I can’t even afford to rent a place on my own. My new supervisors are awful, and honestly, just the thought of going back to work makes me feel sick.

I’ve been searching for jobs in my field, but nothing looks even remotely promising. At this point, I’d settle for a well-paying job, even if it’s not something I would love—but there just aren’t any in my field. I’ve considered a complete career change, but it makes me feel like I’ve wasted my life, my university years, everything. I can’t afford to go back to school, and even if I somehow managed it, I’d feel like I was wasting even more time.

1k64xec,Looking for guidance on event career development,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out for some advice on how to further my career in event planning and management. I don’t have many connections in this field and thought this community might be a great place to find some guidance and support.

I have over 10 years of experience in the hospitality industry—five of those in food & beverage management, and the last two years focused specifically on events catering and planning. During that time, I’ve truly fallen in love with the world of events—whether it’s planning weddings, nonprofit fundraisers, receptions, or community functions. I love the creativity, the logistics, and the joy that comes from seeing an event come together.

Unfortunately, I recently left my most recent events role due to a lack of upward mobility, poor leadership, and the company’s shift toward having me focus more on F&B rather than event planning. I realized that my true passion lies in the planning, sales, and marketing side of events—and I want to build a career that allows me to grow in that direction.

* What are the best certifications, courses, or programs to grow in event planning, catering management, or event marketing? (I’m open to online or in-person options)
* Is it possible to break into more event strategy or nonprofit-focused planning without a formal degree in events?
* How can I begin building a personal brand or portfolio if I eventually want to run my own events business?
* Any tools, platforms, or skills I should be learning right now?

For context, I do have some college credits (mostly in biology/science), but nothing event-specific yet. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or made a career pivot into events—your insight would mean the world to me.

I appreciate your help! ",Any_Park639,1,1.0,2,1745429091,2025-04-23 17:24:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k64xec/looking_for_guidance_on_event_career_development/,4,2025

My firm hired me a month into my first semester of a paralegal studies program. I ended up not continuing with school as the work loads from school and working full time were far too much on me to be efficient at either. Things have been going well for me and it’s been great learning on the job, however as I’ve grown more confident in my current duties I’d like to do some more independent studying to further increase my value at the firm. For those already in the legal field, do you have any book recommendations I can add to my Amazon cart? 

I primarily work on personal injury cases and currently focus on pre-lit stuff, however my firm often handles large med mal and product liability cases. So any book recommendations for tort or related subject matters would be great. We also occasionally assist clients with other contract needs they may have. Litigation books would be greatly appreciated as well as my bosses are all trial attorneys (plaintiffs’ firm).

I’m also interested in any good books for self learning/independent study regarding corporate law as it’s a branch that interested me when I first enrolled into the program. These will be more for “on the side” reading as I want to expand my knowledge in general tort before branching out more.

1k63m9f,Feeling a tad bit lost,"I'm feeling a little lost right now.

* Context
   * I've been a barista at Starbucks for the past several years and a supervisor for the last year, and through their tuition assistance program I've been able to complete a Bachelors in Technical Communication. I chose this degree to supplement my primary field of study which is Aviation. I have a Commercial Pilots License and I'm currently training to be an instructor (I need 1,500 hours before I can qualify for the airlines, currently have 350 so still some ways to go). I wanted to land a job writing documentation for airplanes or assisting in internal communications for an airline or flight school while finishing my flight training. It seemed like a great way to network with people already in the industry. 
   * However, when I was a semester or two from graduating in Aug 2024 I started looking for jobs or internships and found literally nothing in aviation. I either got a rejection letter citing insufficient experience within a day or two or never heard from them again. I decided to pivot to a Docs-as-Code approach and learned DITA / XML and made a small GitHub portfolio and applied to other technical writing positions and heard nothing again. After living a whole life on Linkedin and Indeed, I decided to let it go and focus more on my instructor license. 
* The problem
   * Now, I've recently been let go from Starbucks and I'm unsure where to focus my attention. I still get nothing from the local flight schools and commercial airlines, so I have half a mind to try and learn knowledge management or API Documentation to build up my portfolio and try the job market again or get a 2-20 license and get a job selling insurance. I am very daunted though by the idea of trying to supplement my education and then falling flat again, so I also wonder if I should just look for another customer service facing job to keep me afloat while finishing my flight license *(flight exams are prone to delays and I may wait two to four months).*

1k625cz,I’ve only been in corporate for >2 years and my boss makes me lead technical client + strategy meetings,"Hi everyone. 

Long story short, I work in tech communications and have several clients. 

I am good at my job on the backend (in communications). However, with a new promotion I must lead meetings with my tech clients. 

During these meetings we have to go over product updates, discuss strategy, pitch new ideas, and hear updates from our clients. 

My heart rate goes through the roof before meetings. I’m talking to CEOs, some of which are former ex big tech execs. I just feel completely out of place.

My boss usually attends the meeting but I still have the pressure of answering first and leading. I don’t mind to give updates and steer that, but when we get technical, need to ask the right questions (I.e what does this technical feature do…but spoken for sauve than that), or discuss strategy…it shakes me to my core. 

I truly don’t feel like it’s something I can handle, and frankly idk how to even get better at it. 

My bosses know I hate it and it’s a weak spot. Anyway, what would you do? Don’t you think it’s kinda ridiculous I need to lead these meetings anyway? I sure do. 

Back story: I have been out of college for about 4 years and spent 2 not in corporate. I came in with no technical skills at all, and I still wouldn’t say I’m technical.

- My former manager has experienced interest in working together again so I feel like I have their support

- Leading firm in the market with big clients
- Good training offered, supportive culture in general
- I feel like this is the easy way out because I have a semi-good reputation among most of the team and don’t have to work as hard to prove myself / don’t have to put in so many long hours
- I feel like I’ll be letting down my old team that moved there if I reject them (especially as I did so once already last year so I won’t receive further job offers from them and will be burning all bridges. This is 100% likely to happen as it happened to someone else recently)
- The interview went horribly as the manager kept saying that I would be stupid to turn them down and would just be following money. He also said that I was making them go above and beyond to hire me and basically insinuated that no other firm would hire me


Honestly my biggest worries are that by turning down job offer #2, I’ll be burning all bridges with them because they will not offer me a role again in the future. 

I’m also worried about the possible job insecure and “sink or swim” culture at job offer #1 especially as I’m not sure if my skills are up to their standard. 

Thank you everyone!

1k61fmf,Career Change,"Hello. So I have been in public safety for my entire adult life. Volunteer Firefighter to part time then I went to paramedic school and was on an ambulance for about 5 years. I'm 26 now. I'm tired of it. Left 2 jobs in bad ways and I think I'm done. I was good at what I did, I loved helping people. But the last year at my last job I hated almost every day. I didn't like having to talk to patients, I was jaded and rolled my eyes at everything. I took care of folks but I didn't have the passion I used to have. So I think I'm done. 

I am currently in school, just knocking out core classes as a ""general education major"" but now I think I need to actually commit to a path. I love cars and I am decently mechanically inclined and I could transfer to a tech school and go be a certified Ford mechanic but I know diesel mechanics make more, and heavy equipment is fascinating to be. But, part of me has always wanted to be an engineer. However I kinda hate school but if I'm going for something I enjoy and actually have a purpose to learn it's fine. Paramedic school was a breeze for me. I just have zero idea what to do with my life. I feel like I've wasted so much time and that it's too late but I know it's not. I'm not tied down by kids or anything I just have a girlfriend who's very supportive of me financially and emotionally but she can't really help me make a decision. 

TLDR: Burn out paramedic looking for new career. Interested in cars and engineering but open to interesting ideas. ",jakethesnake600,2,1.0,1,1745420681,2025-04-23 15:04:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k61fmf/career_change/,4,2025

1k60y3m,Handshake Platform,"I’m really disappointed with my experience on Handshake. After paying a $50 fee through my school to join the platform, I was hoping to find legitimate job opportunities as a recent graduate. Unfortunately, all I’ve encountered are spammy job listings that feel like a waste of time.

I did some research and found I’m not alone in my frustration. Many others have shared similar negative experiences, with the platform falling short of expectations. What’s even more concerning is the growing number of overly positive Google reviews from content creators who seem to be affiliated with Handshake. These content creators may be employed by or paid by Handshake, and it feels like they’re misleading others by claiming that the platform has been truly helpful to them.

This raises serious ethical concerns. If these content creators are being compensated or have some sort of official relationship with Handshake, their reviews could be seen as biased. It's troubling to think that the platform may be manipulating its reputation to counteract negative feedback, especially when many users feel the platform is offering little value in return for the fees they pay.

While I want Handshake to succeed and genuinely provide value for students, it feels like they’re more interested in profiting off the desperation of college students rather than actually creating something that benefits them.

I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way, and I hope this post helps bring attention to these issues. If Handshake shifts its focus to building a truly valuable platform for students—one that prioritizes real connections and job opportunities—it could be a game changer. But right now, it feels like the company is more interested in short-term profit than creating a platform that actually helps people.",Apprehensive-Ice8996,1,1.0,2,1745419489,2025-04-23 14:44:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k60y3m/handshake_platform/,4,2025

I love talking to clients and issues on their matters and also providing services depending what the case entails/needs. Honestly though, I overall am not a sales person. I’ve been in this position for about 11 mo (I started in June of 2024), and will soon be close to my year mark but I’m at a mental standstill and don’t really have the motivation to continue. I do love working, but the sales aspect really just isn’t for me. I’m not sure if I should thug it out until I’ve hit the year mark or just rip the bandaid and quit. What makes this a bit hard as well is that we are a small time…. Like really small. In my office it’s just me and my boss. His managing partner lives in another state, and our experts are remote workers. So, I am really the only sales person there is. I’ve also been tasked with much of the sales process/functions, so me leaving would disrupt that. I respect the work we do and the opportunity my boss has given me, but I also feel guilty of quitting when I hold a lot of power in the sales role. I really tried to connect with this position and do my best but ultimately my mind has done a 180 and really has me dreading coming in to do anything. 

Also extra information: At the end of May, I have an eye procedure that will have me out of work for a week or more, and I’m not sure how much it’ll cost. It may not be much because I’m still under my parents insurance or it might be a lot. I also pay for my car and insurance for it. I have a decent amount saved up (about $6) that can hold me over for a bit but I’ve already been looking for other roles

To be honest, I’m not an expert yet, but here’s where I currently stand:

I know the basics of full stack development.

I can deploy basic to intermediate-level MERN stack applications.

I’ve started learning Java full stack as well.

I’m also picking up DSA — I’d say I’m somewhere between beginner and intermediate right now.

I want to aim high — I’m targeting a 12 LPA package, and I know I’ve got a long way to go. But I’m also a bit confused:

Should I keep doing everything (DSA, system design, Java, MERN)?

Or should I specialize in one area first (say frontend/backend) and then expand?

Is it okay to be a jack of all trades early on, or will that slow me down?

If you’ve walked a similar path, made a transition, or know of opportunities in the industry that align with this skillset, I’d really appreciate your insight or advice.

I received a part time job offer I am excited about. They are known for great work life balance.  Very few people in my current company work part time and no one in my current department.  I gave 3 weeks notice last Monday and then on last Thursday they verbally said I could work part time.  I said I would be open to it for 20 hours a week. It's been a week and I have received nothing in writing.  They stated it would be hourly in case work load would require me to work more hours at times... my current new job offer has set hours. I came back and said I would like set hours in the offer letter working no later than 2 pm. So I can attend to some health issues in my family.  They said they could probably get that added to the letter.  It's been a week and a half since I gave 3 week notice and I have nothing official.  My fear is they are going to say it's part time but basically have the same job I had before and make it hourly - same workload.  I want them to explicitly state the work hours in the offer letter. I think it shouldn't be that difficult if they really wanted me to work partime. I'm afraid it will just turn back into late hours again.

1k5yza1,Data Science or DevOps?,"Hi everyone, as the title suggests I’m trying to decide between my first rotation in a company’s development program. 

My first option is Data Science, which after speaking with the manager is more on the side of data modeling, presentations, python, etc. there’s another department that deals with algorithms I believe. 

The pro with data science is I’ve been keen to trying out data analysis/science as I enjoyed working with data in high school (statistics), I’m not sure if there’s any correlation. The con is I’m hearing it could be a pretty boring job, “dead-end”, or that I’d need additional schooling like a PhD or something to continue with a full-time role in the future.

My second option is DevOps, I have the option to be as technical or as functional as I want to be. They work with Java and Python (I think?), Git, etc. 

I’ve heard DevOps could be seen as a “dead-end” position as well but the pro could be me gaining valuable experience and knowledge through this role. 

To preface, the development program allows me to do 1 full year with a team for 2 rotations. This means my first rotation (year) I could be doing data science/devops, the next rotation I’d be doing something else.

1k5y6ks,"Stuck In A ""Promotion"" Cycle - Need Advice","I'm currently in a pretty tough spot professionally and I could really use some outside perspective.

For the past 4 years, I've been in a role where I have consistently exceeded expectations. Recently, though, I have been asked to go through an extremely lengthy, multi-stage assessment process - just to be ""officially"" promoted to the very position I was hired for.

For additional context, the company I work at recently adopted a new role hierarchy and my team is trying to align our roles to this structure. I was placed at a level lower in this hierarchy in comparison to my team role (a slightly more senior position) because I was hired as a grad.

By my calculations, the process could take anywhere from 6 months to a year and will take up the majority of my time. Until it's completed, I'm to be excluded from any additional responsibilities at this level and revoked of certain responsibilities I previously owned. This is starting to feel less like development and more like I'm having to justify my place on the team all over again. It's demotivating to say the least, and I'm strongly considering weighing up my options and looking elsewhere.

I like the work, the people I work with, and the pay is good enough for me to live comfortably. However, I feel like this going to screw me over long-term if I push through it, but equally the job market (Tech UK) really sucks at the moment.

Has anyone else been through something similar? How did you navigate it without losing momentum or motivation? And at what point do you start questioning if you're in the right environment?

Any advice our thoughts would be appreciated and happy to add further context.

tl;dr - I have been asked to go through a 6-12 month assessment process to be promoted to the job I was hired for, due to a new role restructure. I am being sidelined responsibilities I previously owned and now feels like I am having to justify my existence, any advice?

As a result, I couldn't get a programming role during intern season, but instead got selected for Strategy Consulting at Accenture -- which is unrelated to anything I have done, studied or planned for. I accepted it as everyone was encouraged me to and I had no other internship. 

I have no real interest in management or consulting for the matter, and I am not ecstatic to work with Excel, PowerBI and Powerpoint. 

Question: Should I take up this internship this summer (from May) or reject it? I have nothing else lined up, but if I don't go I could use that time to grind DSA, codeforces, and maybe some open source coding work, which could perhaps (although I'm not sure, so I make this post) help me for the placement season December of this year? 

Yet, it could also look bad on my resume that I was intern-less. 

I also tried getting a science internship, but the only institute offering me this has very low pay, work that is mostly chemistry, and it is in a difficult to go to location. The Accenture internship is very close to my home. 

I would much prefer a programming job (or even science job) over this, and I have started to like C/C++, systems programming, quantitative development/trading.   
  
I do not think I can work long term in consultancy, as the job is not very mentally stimulating, but if it proves to be the only way for me to make money, there is no choice but to do it. My mother doubts I can easily get a programming job because they are quite competitive, so she advises me to take it up. I myself have no real interest but I'm conflicted. 

I'm conflicted in whether I should bother with these jobs as my original interest was becoming a mathematician or/and a physicist, and I'm only doing this for money for my family, who are not rich. It would be difficult if I am unable to continue studying these subjects because of demanding work, or something like that. I also eventually plan to return to academia, or at least want to. I don't know where situations will force me to go. Money is quite essential for us. 

Excuse me if I have ranted but I wanted to make the psychology clear.   
Thank you for reading.

1k5xp15,"My colleague got blocked from a promotion… for being ""too good"" at their job. What now?","Hi everyone..

A friend at work has been killing it lately—great performance, praised by clients, even picked up the slack for others. But instead of being supported, the boss has started downplaying their contributions and quietly sidelining them from new opportunities.

Turns out, the boss told someone : “We can’t let this person outshine the team.
*Classic crab mentality—pulling others down just to stay on top.

What’s the move in a situation like this? How do you support someone stuck under a boss who’s insecure and threatened by competence?

Anyone ever dealt with something like this?

1k5xmw1,"Feeling Stuck in a ""Promotion"" Loop","I am currently in a pretty tough spot professionally and I could really use some outside perspective.

For the past 4 years, I have been in a role where I have consistently exceeded expectations. Recently, though, I have been asked to go through an extremely lengthy, multi-stage assessment process - just to be ""officially"" promoted to the very position I was hired for.

For additional context, the company I work at recently adopted a new role hierarchy and my team is trying to align our roles to this structure. I was placed at a level lower in this hierarchy in comparison to my team role (a slightly more senior position) because I was hired as a grad.

By my calculations, the process could take anywhere from 6 months to a year and will take up the majority of my time. Until it's completed, I'm now being excluded from any additional responsibilities at this level and certain responsibilities I previously owned. I'm starting to feel less like development and more like I'm having to justify my place on the team all over again. It's demotivating to say the least, and I'm strongly considering weighing up my options and looking elsewhere.

I like the work, the people I work with, and the pay is good enough for me to live comfortably. However, I feel like this going to screw me over long-term if I push through it as I won't be able to achieve other goals this year, but equally the job market (Tech UK) really sucks at the moment.

Has anyone else been through something similar? How did you navigate it without losing momentum or motivation? And at what point do you start questioning if you're in the right environment?

Any advice our thoughts would be appreciated and happy to add further context.

**tl;dr** \- I have been asked to go through a 6-12 month assessment process to be promoted to the job I was hired for, due to a new role restructure.

Just looking for some opinions. Been in retail my whole life, ~~nearly~~ (just did the math, and its ***over***) 20 years of retail experience (when did i get old?). I actually like retail and have made it to be a store manager. 

However, I'm looking for a change. Always was interested in flying, but never was smart enough to become a pilot. 

However, now I've got two interviews lined up. One as a Flight Attendant, and another as a Ramp Manager. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with either, or recommendations for one or the other if I'm selected to move forward. 

Both would be a major pay downgrade, and I'd be looking to move up as fast as possible. But hows the work? Flight Attendant is a lot of customer service, which I like, but I hear that travel is hard for folks. Ramp Manager, I'll be working outdoors, in all weather, which seems like it can suck come winter.

The thing is, I’m interested in a bunch of different things. I feel like I could enjoy and do well in a lot of careers *if* I put my mind to it, but that just makes choosing one even harder. Like how are people supposed to just *know* what they want to do for the rest of their lives?

If anyone’s been through this, how did you figure it out? Are there any questions I should be asking myself or things I can do to help me decide? I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance.

1k5vq2i,"24 and Just Graduated and Honestly, I’ve No Idea What I Want to Do with My Life","As the title says, I graduated last year and got thrown straight into the ""real world"" – something no one really prepared me for.

I was always a nerd, my life revolved around grades and scores. (Officially, I’m a healthcare professional now – not a doctor or nurse, but a paramedic.)

Thing is… I’ve kind of lost interest in it. I don’t even know how or why I chose this path in the first place. In the start, I was chasing the MD dream - took the MCAT and actually scored really well, but missed public med school by just 2 percentile points. So I ended up doing this paramedic degree—mostly because of parental pressure. No one really guided me or asked what I wanted.

Now I’ve graduated with a degree I don’t intend to use. All my classmates applied for jobs and got hired. I never even applied - and honestly, I don’t want to… at least not right now.

I’ve always loved writing. I’ve been freelancing since uni, paid my fees, and supported myself through that. After graduating, I landed a copywriting job at a small software house. It pays almost 2x what I’d make as a paramedic, and the hours are super chill.

NOW I don’t know what career path should I choose, because I really don’t want to fuck around (already 24 – I’m old now) and I’ve no idea what to do.

I don’t know if I should try to give healthcare another shot and supposedly “help people”? Stick with this chill writing job, even though I don’t see much career growth here? Or maybe do a Master’s in something I actually want to pursue?

And I’ve no interest in being seen or fame, I just want a decent, meaningful career and to go through the rest of my life with dignity and get old and die.

1k5vg5t,Help,"I know this is probably going to sound like a broken record, but I have become a little worrisome over the past few years.  I sometimes feel like I will never amount to anything and either become homeless or living with my parents until I can no longer, or rebounding into a minimum wage job. Which I feel will only put me into a path of severe sadness and eventually leading me into taking my own life.. I’ve become depressed. I have lost my friends due to time and differences in mindsets, have no money in my savings due to poor spending habits, and only a few jobs on my resume that I was with for a little under a year. I have just landed a job at my mother’s hospital where she works at, and to say i’m nervous is an understatement. While it pays okay for someone my age, working in a hospital isn’t anything close to what I want to do in life. But that’s besides the point.

I was a stupid teenager and wasted my high school years not paying enough attention and just in general not really feeling like anything mattered. I attended two completely different high schools, one, a college preparatory school, which was very hard for me to pass classes. I was taken out, moved to a less difficult, online high school where i passed with flying colors. For my sake that is at least. It was no where near the same level education I feel that I should have received. The first school I attended I achieved (for lack of a better term) a 1.6 GPA. The second, a 3.5 or so, mind you I have no SAT score.

Now I am about to start attending a community college, am 19, 20 years old at the end of November, and have little to no clue about where my life may end up or where I can take it. I am so worrisome because sometimes it feels like my life is flying past me and I even might have missed a key window in my young years to develop a proper set of skills to help me walk through life’s thunderstorms.

For as long as I can remember, my number one goal in life is to become a successful entrepreneur. Business I have no idea about anything, but am very passionate about starting something of my own. I also enjoy sometimes learning about stocks and finance, yet I feel this field may be to difficult for someone like me. An ADHD kid with problems remembering lots of information at a time. I seriously have no idea in the world what I am passionate about. From what I can observe, many students in my position end up laying back on a business degree and never using it and eventually turn into a downward spiral in life, just wasting away time.

I feel that some of you who will see this or even respond to this post will say, “Money isn’t the purpose of life, what matters is the ones around you and the life you lead.” etc etc. But to be honest, since I have zero clue what I am passionate about, already have no friends at almost 20 years old and only myself and family to hangout with. I kind of think I missed a big shot at becoming what I always dreamed of. I could have labeled this post as a Career advice flair, but while i’m confused about my career path, i’m mostly struggling with my education issues and mental health. My now ex girlfriend is taking business classes at the same community college I will be attending this fall, and her ethics, and science classes sound excruciatingly hard. I mean, 10 page essays due every week.

All of this isn’t to say that I am not motivated. I am extremely motivated to start improving my quality of education. But have I started too late? Will I even have a chance at entering certain job fields with bad high school transcripts and no SAT score? How will I support living on my own? If you have read this far, or even taken the time to read a bit and comment your own two cents, I applaud you. I could have kept going but I feel it would just be the same things but worded differently. Please be respectful, I’m hard on myself enough as it is.

1k5ueev,Failed salary negotiations and accepted offer… what can I do now? 😔,"Hi everyone, 
I need some advice on salary re-negotiations...
About a month ago I accepted an offer for a remote role in Fr. The offer was ~10k€ lower than the lower end of the range I had provided. Between introduction in the process and offer the role changed to a lower level/grade which impacted all compensation package (that wasn't communicated until offer time... surprise surprise).
At the time of the offer I felt under pressure to accept quickly (recruiter pretended there was another candidate eager to accept similar offer [spoiler alert: there was not] they didn't give me proper time to think as company going on cie conference in RepDom lol etc.). And also self-pressure: I've been looking for a FR remote role since June and it was the first offer I received...
Long story short I've now come to realise that offers for similar roles/level in France pay ~15k€ more... So I feel uncomfortable with my salary and can't chase the feeling that I failed my negotiation and that this will follow me for as long as I stay in this company.

How would you approach it? 
I think it is too late to reopen negotiations for the offer... Would you discuss concerns with hiring manager now to seek reassurance and maybe have a plan for salary uplift while in role? Is there a risk to cross the line and upset manager before even starting? 
Should I just keep looking for roles and not join the company (not ideal)? 

Should I convince myself that because it is a remote role I should be ok accepting a discounted salary (that doesn't feel great) and not say anything? 

I've asked advice from the recruiter but he is not helpful and suggest I speak to hiring manager directly.

1k5sw8r,"If you are a technical engineering manager, how often you are expected to cover your teams cost and secure funded projects?","I work as EM in an internal R&D function in a mechanical process driven company. Our operational cost and timesheet are funded by projects we receive from the departments in mechanical processes. I have joined here recently.

Getting funding is always a challenge to cover time sheets for my team, as mechanical processes may or may not agree to our R&D proposals, their budgets might get cut from where they were supposed to give us funds. etc. 

Senior EM I report to told me that I am responsible for raising funds for the yearly operational cost, i.e. raising funds for my team so that they can fill timesheet. If I don't, it will lead to dire circumstances, such as my team not having timesheet to fill, implying we're not needed in the organization. 

Are engineering managers supposed to pitch projects and secure entire funds for running operations for their team for the whole year, working in the capacity of a business development? None of my previous EM roles required me to do it. Mostly I got R&D and AI projects organically. I am not feeling comfortable about it and feeling that I have been given an impossible goal just to pin me down and control me. Given the job market, I guess I am stuck and can't confront him either.

1k5s6zd,How to negotiate salary - mid-senior management role,"Hi all,

I, 31 M, based out of India, recently interviewed with a large, publicly listed global tech services firm for a mid-senior management position. During my initial HR conversation, I disclosed my current compensation and asked about the salary range for the role. However, the recruiter didn’t provide a clear answer.

I have now cleared the rounds, and the HR has asked for salary slips, salary annexure etc.

What is the best way forward from here to negotiate the salary? Should I ask them for the offer first before sharing my salary slips (this option does not make sense since I have already shared the salary number)? Or should I share the info and then ask them to share what the higher end of their budget is? Since this is a new role, there aren't a lot of market benchmarks on Glassdoor available. Any other suggestions would be helpful!

Some additional context: I am with a good global software company today and am not actively looking for a job; this new company to which I have applied is somewhat in a stagnant / declining industry.",detective_acebox,2,1.0,6,1745388723,2025-04-23 06:12:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5s6zd/how_to_negotiate_salary_midsenior_management_role/,4,2025
1k5s5lp,My boss's comment about my appearance after all of my efforts made me cry,"I have been working as manager in a client facing role for just under 2 months now. I've diligently poured myself into my role, by trying to establish connections with client who are in brands and major establishments.

After putting everything into preparing for a client facing demo, exactly as per my boss's requirements, i presented it and there was no comments on the flow or presentation itself like how boss gave me feedback for all attempt so far. Now, she commented on my appearance. She commented on my facial hair, if they are personal or cultural thing for me as she stated that i should come across polished for the meeting.

Currently, my facial hairs are trimmed and it is as polished/in shape/neat as any really short facial hair features on men. Infact this comment is coming after multiple video conferencing for hiring by the same manager for the same role 2 months ago.

I've always been professional, and I've led global professional client meetings in the past, be it onboarding, demo, issue resolution, my clients were always happy to interact with me. They never had any issues with the way i speak or my appearance, in fact whenever I'm away and clients asked for my availability to my team, my team would respond that they too can solve their issues but they stated that they would infact share it with me.

That one comment after everything I've done over here to achieve the targets,... It broke me. I cried, i couldn't help it.

Maybe my boss saw it as a simple suggestion. But to me, it hit deep, especially after I've worked so hard to prove my value.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar, I would love to hear your experience or point of view.

TL;DR:
After weeks of intense workout preparing client outreach, demos, and potential partnerships at my new job, my boss commented on my actually trimmed and short facial hairs, implying I should remove it to look ""more polished"" for meetings. I was hired via video call by the same boss, where I looked the same and I've real work experience handling client-facing roles successfully for years. The comment hurt me, I cried. Never had any job or any pressure made me cry, ever.

1k5q6hd,Might quit before my 2 weeks are up...,"Reuploading here with an update!!

I don't know if I'm making a good choice about leaving my job.

There's a number of reasons why I want to leave this job but I don't know if it's just an over reaction or not.
I'm a mental health technician on weekends (9a-5p) currently and I've been at this place for 4 month and I feel drained and I am so done working there. I'm holding out until may when my second job (that pays the same amount) and starts and at this second job I'll be working 40hours a week compared to 16 hours.

1st things 1st. I was promised in my interview that I would be able to pick up more hours when the school year ended...ya not happening now bc I get last pick which is fine but the way it works is based off of newest employee, im not the newest anymore but the new person who is older than me gets to pick up more hours. 

2nd: staffing is awful. The person I work with on weekends falls asleep on shift and vapes in in the office and blows it all over including on me. My would tell my supervisor but he told me ""don't come to me with complaints about staff bc it'll just rope back to you"" so I haven't complained. 

3rd: I don't get pto, I dont work enough to get it. My boss told me today I cannot take off for at least 4 months. I have a pre-planned vacation that I mentioned before I was hired in June. It was fine then but after that conversation I'm concerned about what might happen.

I really don't know. It would be fine if I left because of my second job, im not worried about money but I don't want it to look bad bc I've only been there 4 months.

Does anyone have any advice or opinions?? 

UPDATE:

hey yall I'm back! I took the advice, I put my two weeks in and will be done there soon, thank you so much for the advice and the push. 

While I put my 2 weeks in, I dont think I'm going to last it. My boss texted me today saying that I'm either going to bedd to work 7a to 3p or 3p to 11p this Saturday or Sunday. I told him I can work 7a to 3p (I don't want to work the late shift bc I am not a nigut person, im always in bed by 10p). He texted me back at 1020 pm saying ""could you do 3-11 Sunday. Coworker can't work late now. I dont have another option at this point. Let me know if that's a big deal or not.""

My jaw dropped, maybe im overreacting about it. I just want to quit now and say screw it to the 2 weeks. I need the money but I literally would rather wait for my next job and pay check rather than continue this bs.

Am I ovveracting about the text? Should I call it and just quit?",Hungry-News8602,0,0.5,2,1745381066,2025-04-23 04:04:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5q6hd/might_quit_before_my_2_weeks_are_up/,4,2025
1k5q2j1,I read 20+ books on social skills- here’s what I wish someone told me in my 20s,"Two years ago, I had a crush on my best friend - for three years. She eventually deleted me - not because I was quiet, but because my insecurity made me act controlling, even as a “friend.”

At work, I was too shy to ask for help or speak up. I watched coworkers with half the output get all the praise just because they knew how to talk. Meanwhile, I stayed small and silent.
It wasn’t just introversion or awkwardness - I had zero understanding of people dynamics. No clue how trust, influence, or connection actually worked.

Then I read The Charisma Myth - and something cracked open. Marilyn Monroe could shift from invisible to magnetic just by how she carried herself. Same woman, same clothes, just different energy That blew my mind.

Charisma wasn’t some innate gift. It was a skill. And I could learn it.

So I did. I started reading like my life depended on it - 10+ books a month. Psychology, communication, social power. No instant glow-up, but slowly, people said I seemed more grounded. More confident. Easier to talk to.
If you’re trying to build confidence or just stop feeling invisible, these 3 books completely rewired how I show up in the world:

1. The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane
This book will make you question everything you think you know about charisma. Olivia breaks it into presence, power, and warmth - backed by real stories. The best breakdown of learnable charisma I’ve read.

2. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie
 It’s a classic for a reason. Showed me how basic things - like remembering names or asking questions - can completely shift how people respond to you. It taught me social sense I literally never grew up with.

3. Quiet by Susan Cain
For introverts who feel “not enough” in loud rooms, this book is like a warm hug and a permission slip. It helped me own who I am, instead of constantly trying to be louder.

Once I started understanding how human connection works, I began experimenting in real life. Slowly, I noticed certain patterns - small behaviors that had a huge impact. If you’re starting out on this path, here are some takeaways that genuinely helped me feel more confident and connected:

 - Say people’s names when you talk to them. It builds instant warmth and trust.
 - Mirror their energy and vibe subtly - it tells their nervous system you’re safe.
 - Give “power thank yous”: call out the action, the effort, and the impact.
 - Stop trying to sound smart. Be present. That’s what people remember.
 - Don’t listen to reply. Listen like you’re holding space. They can feel it.
 - Charisma isn’t sparkle. It’s calm confidence + emotional attunement + a little humor.

Of course, none of this change would’ve stuck without the right tools to help me stay consistent. I’m an ADHD adult with a super packed work schedule - so trust me, daily reading didn’t come easy. At first, even sitting down for 10 minutes felt like a mental workout. If you're trying to rewire your mindset or actually stick to reading and growth habits, these tools also made all the difference:

 - Insight Timer App: Charisma starts with presence. This app helped me train my focus - so I could actually stay present in conversations instead of drifting into anxious thoughts. I also use it before bed to stay focused during reading instead of doomscrolling. It’s lowkey helped my reading habit and my anxiety.

 - BeFreed:  A friend of mine who works at JP Morgan recommended this smart reading app for me. We’re both slammed at work and barely have time to finish full books, but this app gives us so much flexibility via high quality book summaries. You can choose how you want to read: 10-min flashcard, 30-min deep dives, or 20-min fun storytelling versions of dense non-fiction,  depending on your time and mood. I usually listen to the fun storytelling mode at the gym - it helps me actually enjoy books I used to find way too dry. If one really hooks me, I’ll switch to the 30 mins deep dive before bed. Tested it with books I already knew - covered 95% of the key points and examples. Total game-changer.
I also asked the AI reading coach to recommend books specifically on social skills - it gave me titles that were exactly what I needed. 

 - The Science of Happiness – Podcast:  Short, science-backed episodes on building empathy, emotional intelligence, and authentic joy. Their episode on gratitude actually shifted how I speak to people. Great for commutes or decompressing after social hangovers.

 - Charisma on Command – YouTube: Broke down how people like Zendaya, Obama, and Timothée Chalamet win people over without trying too hard. Helped me understand how tone, body language, and pause make all the difference. Highly bingeable.

If you’re reading this and struggling with social anxiety or confidence, I just want to say: you’re not broken. You’re not behind. And this can get better.
You don’t need to be the loudest. You just need to be present, curious, and willing to grow. That’s how it starts. 

Let reading be the thing that rewires your brain. It changed my entire life.

So, I just landed a job as a bus driver, and having a background check by aInsight done, On the Letter, I have a couple of 'Review' alerts on some of the jobs I listed, which was expected because I have no way of knowing when, exactly, I started and ended those jobs, and that I fudged some of the dates, in order to compensate for the years that I wasn't working.

As for the 'Review' alert on my driving record, I've never had any thing worse than a ticket, which I've already paid for, and it says that I'm clear. But I have no idea what it wants me to review. The only things I can think of are that I have a restriction that says I need to have glasses when I drive, and that I only have a Class C license, when I need a class B. But I don't think that should be a problem, because they're training me to get my Class B license.

I’ve been unemployed for over 8 months. I've made it to final rounds only to be told I was “great but not the top choice.” First-round interviews feel like lip service before I get ghosted. The silence, the rejection — it's genuinely messing with my head. I’m starting to question my sanity and whether I pursued the wrong career altogether. I've done tons of mock interviews, feel like I have a good grasp on technicals, done tons of modeling tests and passed to next rounds, had my resume reviewed by MDs, top MBA grads, experienced professionals, family you name it I felt like I've done it all.

I come from a finance background — think investment banking, corporate development, a little FP&A and private equity — but nothing is sticking. I’m bleeding through savings and considering whether it’s too late to pivot. Would getting a CPA and switching to accounting make more sense? What industry do I switch to? I only have a few months left and I'm starting to panic.

I’ve started working on my QuickBooks ProAdvisor certification and wondering… can I realistically make money as a freelance bookkeeper with my background? I’ve worked with small businesses in the past and I’m not above going back to basics to rebuild.

I just don’t know what’s next. I’m open to side hustles, contract work, temp jobs — anything I can do to use my skills to survive. I feel stuck, I’m out of energy, and I don’t want to give up.

Offer #1 Marketing Data Analyst at a big 4 bank.

\- Day to day would be analysing marketing data and creating strategy based on said data.

\- 2 days in office, 3 days WFH (1.5 hour commute each way)

\- Have heard from friends they're a very flexible company with lots of leave options and options to change hybrid schedule if signed off by manager.

\- Total renumeration would be 110k plus credit card and home loan perks plus 1 week extra annual leave BUT it is a fixed term contract meaning it would end after 12 months, there is risk I could leave the business if not retained in same role or different role.

\- Head office is in my home town, have heard there's lots of options to move around within the business but you have to work hard to move up if you wanted to go into management.

  
Offer # 2 Marketing & Sales at a heavy machinery company

\- Day to day involves lots of travel, would need to dedicate up to 30% of the year overseas plus potential relocation after 18 months.

\- 5 days a week in office (1.5-2 hour commute each way at the moment)

\- Total renumeration $126k

\- Good mentorship program, it's almost like a grad role but not.

\- International company, so there's opportunities overseas and really high retention rate as salaries are good. There will be an increase in salary post completion of 18 months at the company as there will be an automatic promotion to another role. (unsure of renumeration).

I feel like the offer is fair considering I currently have no collage education, and the goal is to get an education and train someone for management in the future. This is a big decision for me and my family, any words of wisdom of advice are welcomed and appreciated.

1k5nfzk,Am I being taken advantage of?,"Hello, first time posting, just seeking advice. I work for a small marketing company. I am a 1099 employee. I was originally hired as a graphic designer but now I also do account management, and social media management. Essentially I do everything but bring in sales. I do not have a written contract as everything was agreed upon verbally. At the time I was ok with this as getting the experience on my resume was top priority. When hired I was told I would be trained and become fully remote. I am fully “trained” as I was never really trained and had to figure everything out on my own. While being trained I was expected to come into the office which is really just the owners house. I was suppose to be provided a computer while in the office, but was not. So now I use my 10 year old Mac laptop while my PC just sits at home. At 6 months I expressed that I didn’t like running my laptop into the ground while my computer made for graphics just sits in my home office. I expressed a desire to start working from home as originally discussed, I also expressed a need to take advantage of the main benefit of being a 1099 employee, flexibility. It’s been a year now and still no improvement. Now that I have the experience on my resume I want to buckle down and make some changes. This was always my plan. Recently, my sister’s car was having trouble starting. She had to be at work 4am the next day. I reached out and asked to work remotely so she could take my car. I was told no and I was needed in house. This really pissed me off. I know where our projects are at, I know what’s going on with clients, I know that there was no need for me to be there. I took a personal day because it made me so angry. I have been patient, I have expressed my needs and nothing changes. I am flexible when I am told I am not needed 10 mins before I am suppose to be there, or when I am not needed for a week. That’s apart of being 1099, but I am beginning to feel taken advantage of. They are having me help build a website with the intention of automating all of the graphic portion of my job. And a portion of the account management job, such as quotes, purchase orders, ext. In addition to creating automations that step on my duties, they want to hire their daughter who is also a creative. She specializes in social media management which is also one of my duties. Obviously the daughter will take priority. I am worried I being taken advantage of and potentially pushed out. Am I being taken advantage of?

The past year, I've applied for two promotions and was turned down. After the first, I met with my boss's boss (who makes those decisions) and said I would love to be involved if any projects or opportunities come up. He was encouraging and said he'd keep an eye out. After the second, I asked what I could be doing better. I told him I was feeling unappreciated and I'd love to see my contributions over the years be seen and rewarded. I reiterated that I'd enjoy taking on a new project. He was encouraging but also said we don't all have to stay in the same job forever. Last week, he gave me my first-ever mediocre performance review. There was no explanation for why it wasn't excellent, when my direct boss's review was glowing.

So here's my question. Do I leave the job I've loved for decades because of this person? Typically, his position has frequent turnover, but of course there's no way to know how long he'll be there.

1k5ncqw,Boss won’t put mandatory overtime in writing,"To make a long story short- a new gm got hired at my work a few months ago and he is trying to change my schedule. 

This schedule was something I negotiated last year when I got a different job offer and ultimately got me to stay- all before this new gm was here. 

New gm set new guidelines where every order we get in must go out the same day.. no matter how many come in.. I’ve been doing voluntary overtime for a while now in an attempt to prevent the schedule change. Well now corporate is complaining about overtime and so the solution is to adjust my hours to work later  when we are the busiest.  Which I have said I am not okay with and I gave several suggestions such as I can do it some days of the week but not 5 days a week- among various other things. I’ve offered to move weekly standing appointments around to accommodate for some of the days. He said no to all of my suggestions.   

So I told him I’m burnt out and due to personal situations in my life right now I’m unwilling to do anymore voluntary overtime. Which they are still asking for. I said I’m sorry but if I have the choice then the answer is no. I said the only way I would do it is if it were mandatory. 

He told me that he cares and asked me not to make HIM make it mandatory. I told him he didn’t have to and he had a choice but that I would not be doing it of my own accord.  He then said “you’re really going to make me say it?” And I said yes I don’t want to anymore I’m exhausted (I’ve been doing 10-14 hour days) and he said “fine. It’s mandatory” 

So I asked him to give me it in writing and any further requests in the future as well. And he said no. Just refused.  I asked him why and he just said it wasn’t necessary. I will be off at 5 and and 3pm they will just tell me I have 3 hours of mandatory overtime. 

So I know that unfortunately this is all legal. But why would he refuse to give me the mandatory request in writing? 

Also don’t worry- I am absolutely in the process of applying to other jobs right now. ",tunderwood14,56,0.8700000047683716,41,1745372087,2025-04-23 01:34:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5ncqw/boss_wont_put_mandatory_overtime_in_writing/,4,2025

I’m 22 and just graduated with a B.S. in Pure Mathematics. I originally planned to be a high school math teacher and even started a Master’s in Education (finishing Fall 2025). I’ve taught in correctional facilities (including California, Hawaii, England and even Scotland), worked as a hs tutor for 4 years, private school teacher for a semester, and served as a student teacher in a public school.

But I’ve realized the classroom isn’t where I want to be long-term.

Lately I’ve been leaning toward:

Finance (FP&A, strategy, wealth management, equity research)
Higher education (data-focused or admin roles)
SWE (I’ve started learning Python + SQL and building projects)
I’m applying to entry-level and internship roles in all 3 spaces, but I feel behind. People around me are doing very well for themselves since they were able to do internships, and I’m wondering if I messed up not going to a UC or getting a finance/CS degree from the start. I had no idea until the very end of everything to realize I don’t wanna go into hs teaching.

I’ve done some beginner projects with Power BI, Python, and Excel. I also just started teaching myself SQL.

My questions:

Based on my background, do I have a shot at breaking into finance or tech?
What kind of roles should I realistically target?

1k5liai,Lost my job after I injured myself at work. New job application - interview,"Hello ! 
Thank you in advance for your insight and time 🙏🏻

Here is the context :
After I lost my job due to an injury at work (herniated disc),  I couldnt work for 4 months. My doctor said I could go and try to work again. So I found a job (cleaning) in the meantime, but it triggered my injury again.  I had to limit work (Im working less hours than they would like)  which made some tension with my new employer, even though they were aware I was unemployed for an injury initially. 

Im now applying for job that would suit more my condition. The thing is, didnt include my current job in my CV. They were very unhappy about my limitations, and considering my health situation +  the economical context where I live, I dont want to run the risk of losing an opportunity. 

So here are the questions : 

I applied to a job Id really love to get but if I get an interview, I dont know if 

1. I should tell them about this job I have ? I would like to give two weeks notice, but itd be hard to explain to the new employer why I wouldnt be able to start right away without mentionning it... 

2. If I dont mention it, how do I explain the gap? I finished my degree in april 2024, lost the job in september 2024,  and I was cleared to try to work in january 27th 2025 . So I have a long gap to make up for. 

3. Should I tell them about the injury at all? This job is not physically demanding. Its a desk job. 🤷🏼‍♀️ but it is still the reason why I was unemployed. I read it could disadvantage me, even though it shouldnt obviously... 

Any advice at all is appreciated 🤍

Thank you so much in advance for your time.

1k5l64r,How One Trainer Went from 10 Clients a Week → $20k/Month Without Running a Single Ad,"I’ve seen a lot of personal trainers & career advicers hit the same ceiling: packed schedule, client burnout, capped income. A friend of mine was doing \~10 sessions a week, charging decent rates, but was still stuck in a time-for-money cycle.

Instead of chasing more clients, he tried something different — he created a *community* around his training philosophy. Not just a Facebook group with quotes and workouts, but a real membership space with live calls, challenges, progress tracking, and support between members.

He called it his “movement” — and it worked.

2 months in, he had 60+ paying members.  
He wasn’t trading hours for dollars anymore.  
And most of the growth came from *word of mouth* inside the group itself.

What surprised me most:

* Clients showed up more consistently once they felt like they were part of a group
* Results improved → which created more buzz & referrals
* He was finally able to step back, focus on vision, not constant delivery

It made me realize how powerful community-led models are for trainers.

If you’ve ever thought about moving beyond 1:1 sessions or building something scalable around your coaching style, this might be something to look into.

1k5ku3z,Seeking advice on startup salary/equity negotiation!,"Hi Reddit!

Recently had an interview where a startup is offering me (verbally) a generalist role that I can define for myself. As part of salary negotiations they were very transparent and gave these general details.

- There’s a Slicing the Pie model for equity.  They asked for my desired salary if we were in the green, and described different slice multipliers in salary ranges based off of appetite for risk. Since I have very little appetite for risk atm, the range they told me i’d fall in here is 100k-120k. They said they’d check this against another source, which says the usual salary for my role in my city is 72k to 121k. 

So I’m guessing saying 120k as an ideal is fine. They encouraged me to think of it as a number that would keep me around after a year and when more money comes in. Having never made six figures, seems like anything in this range would be my golden handcuffs for sure.

- Then they asked for a second number, which is what I’m willing to make for now. I’m not at all used to being considered for a six figure income, so i’m questioning if I took this note correctly, but it seems possible that could also be in the same range. I’m tempted to aim lower, like 90 or 85k. Again the hr person was very chill and said if it’s too high we’ll negotiate, but he wants people to be financially stable.

I’m told the offer will be a sort of compromise between these numbers and a mix of equity.

So is there a strategy here? I guess I could double check on the range for the second salary number (most important to me).

Anyone have experience with this equity model?

I want to ace this! Thanks for your help!

I recently started working at a fintech company as an KYC specialist, which is a completely new industry for me. My background is in data science, and my previous job had night shifts that really affected my mental and physical health. The new company was understanding about this, and even though I lack experience in fintech, they were supportive and hired me.

However, I’m starting to feel that this role might not be the best fit for me. I’m not happy with the manager, (the CEO is still very good but im not directly reporting to him) and I find myself feeling quite depressed. I was already struggling with depression before, and now I’m considering taking a career break.

The problem is, I’m currently the only person in my role, and there’s a lot of responsibility. The girl who holds the position is leaving for maternity leave for 1 year and currently training me, she will leave in 2 weeks by now and then I’ll be handling everything in the meantime. I even got a new offer with a pay cut  but like it much more and the manager is much more professional. 

Another thing is i got hired because i asked the old colleague of mine to provide a reference , (he currently works here).

I'm feeling lost on what I want to do with the rest of my life. I just turned 30. My resume has a huge gap - I quit my job when I had kids. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old with special needs that will be starting half days at school. My husband makes enough to support us. He tells me I can do anything I want to do, even 30k a year is fine. I'm not sure if I should try to use my degree I'm still in debt for, or to take this opportunity to do something new.

I was 17 when I went to college. my parents kind of pushed me into CS. I like it, I do HTML/CSS for fun (on neopets, don't laugh, but it's not something I'm putting on a resume) and I enjoyed coding and got great grades. I'm rusty and haven't done anything but basic web stuff since I graduated. I was pretty good at Java and Swift. 

I worked 2 years in automation engineering when I graduated. It's ladder logic/PLCs. I guess I could try to do that again, it doesn't change much, but it's niche, more a job for an electrical engineer, and doesn't seem like it has part time work.

I'm after a PART TIME career so I can be around for the kids. Furthermore, my 3 year old has special needs - a genetic condition that basically means he will live with us for the rest of our lives (intellectual disability and lack of speech are likely, but he is happy and is mobile/walking). I feel passionate about caring for people with disabilities now that I've basically had to crash course medical care, and occupational/physical therapy. But I can't stomach starting over with a medical degree when I have 29k debt from my CS degree. 

I have no idea what I should do. I would love to hear what kind of CS part-time careers I could get. IT? Technical writing? I feel like a fresh graduate but worse. I get a stomachache reading job postings not recognizing half the programs/languages they want experience in. And part time is rarer than full time.

Or, should I start over? I could try to get a PTA (physical therapy assistant) job with an associates degree. Same with a radiology degree - that's kind of tech and medical. Or I could try to work at my kids' school as an assistant and make pennies. My mother in law is a very successful Realtor and has urged me to get into the business too. The work sounds really fun but I'm not as outgoing as her - she's out in the community a lot. 

Or any suggestions I haven't thought of would be great. I know there's lots of jobs that just want A bachelors degree. ",Clypsedra,0,0.5,1,1745361078,2025-04-22 22:31:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5jkma/seeking_advice_on_my_next_move_30_f_with_bs_in_cs/,4,2025

Subject: Incident During Team Social Event – Request for Support and Documentation

Hi [HR Manager’s Name] / [Your Manager],

I’m writing to document an incident that occurred during a team outing in December last year. A group of us participated in an escape room as a social activity, and during the event, I sustained a knee injury, specifically a partial ACL tear, after a teammate lost balance during a jump scare and toppled directly onto me. My leg hit a table during the fall, and I’ve been undergoing physical therapy since.

Partial ACL tears typically take a long time to heal, and in some cases, full recovery may not be possible. The injury has had a significant impact on my mobility and overall well-being.

Although the outing was not a formal company event, it involved multiple team members. There was some initial acknowledgment from the team, but I’ve largely been managing the recovery process on my own. I’ve also had previous uncomfortable interactions with this teammate, including unsolicited personal remarks, which have contributed to my desire to limit further interaction.

To support my recovery and help maintain productivity at work, I’d like to request the following:

That the incident be formally documented

1k5i7h6,28 and desperate to start over,"\[28F\] If you had given a summary of what my current life looks like to my 16 year old self, I would've been ecstatic. I moved to NYC shortly after graduating college (which was always my dream) and have been working on massive accounts in the advertising industry, making 6 figures since I was 26. However, I am so miserable that it's virtually impossible to peel myself out of bed in the morning and I cry most nights if not as soon as I walk in the door. I'm so quick to get angry at nothing and will sometimes get this strong desire to cut everyone in my life off out of absolutely nowhere.

My job itself is so boring yet so stressful and tense. I work in client services which means that our agency team constantly thinks we're throwing them under the bus for the sake of the clients and our clients are never happy with anything we do no matter how much we overwork our team. Not only is the job itself awful but I feel like I contribute nothing positive to society. If my entire industry went away tomorrow, the only thing that would change is that people would go directly to the webpage they're trying to visit rather than getting served with an ad they're not interested in and won't look at. I'm getting to a point where I can no longer pretend to care about whether a particular shade of yellow is yellow enough or if fake balloons look too fake. I can't pretend to care whether sales reps on the other side of the world will get brochures 2 weeks later than they wanted when there are people with real problems.

For the first 5 years, I've tried to frame my career to myself as ""just a job that pays the bills and that I'm lucky to have"" and I wish that could be enough but it's just not. I'm so generally unhappy and numb to everything that I can't even get a clear idea of what I'd rather be doing when I try to think about it. I took the LSAT a few years ago, scored a 167, then never applied to law school because I couldn't clearly frame up what my goals actually were while writing my admissions essays and realized I didn't even necessarily know why I wanted to go to law school.

The only thing I still like to do is run. It is literally the only thread still connecting me to myself. It's gotten to the point that if I don't have a half or full marathon that I'm training for, I can feel myself start to spiral. So I guess it's also become a way for me to assign myself a sense of purpose.

Now that I've complained at you up to this point... What I'm looking for are your stories of starting over in your career, how you went about it and how it worked out. What helped you break out of feeling stuck and afraid to take a risk? What helped enlighten you in figuring out what you wanted to do instead? Once you realized it, how did you ultimately make it happen?

I'm hoping if I can make myself feel a little hope that I can ditch everything to start over and end up happy that I did it, it'll help break me out of the cycle of fear that's been keeping me stuck.",Clean-Plant,1,1.0,3,1745357547,2025-04-22 21:32:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5i7h6/28_and_desperate_to_start_over/,4,2025
1k5hw1j,Looking to have a career while being disabled.,"Hi all. I was hoping to get some advice. I am a 26 year old individual with disabilities. I am currently working remotely at a internship that is sponsored by vocational rehab. The company is one that helps people with disabilities. One part of the internship is looking for another position. The problem is I am not sure what I want to do with my life. What’s challenging is that I didn’t finish college due to disability. Another challenge is that I live in a rural area and I don’t have a drivers license. I suppose I am writing this post to vent, but I am really scared that once this internship ends it may take me a while to find a new career, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to sit around and collect disability all of my life. I’ve been looking at jobs today and and I really haven’t seen any that seem like they would work for me and that scares me. I would appreciate any advice. Thank you.

1k5hh3y,I built 9 interview assistants to train for one job,"For months, I kept second-guessing myself. I finally got such rare and precious interview opportunities among hundreds of resumes, but I messed up all of them in the end.
Only then did I realize: it turns out that skills are not my biggest obstacle, but ignoring the **interview details** is.

I used to believe that after I received an interview invitation, all I had to do was wait until the appointed time, turn on the camera/sit in the conference room, and speak with the interviewer. It did not turn out like this...

Later, I tried several AI copilots. Created some interview assistants with free trials. Comparing the simulation practice results of many companies. I relearned to use the SMART method to optimize each case, and also reviewed some key details by the way:

1. It is really important to study the position and company background. Don't just glance at the JD, you must really understand what the other party is looking for. What kind of skills are needed and what kind of personality candidates are liked.
2. Prepare **highlight moment** stories in advance. For example, how do you lead a team, how to resolve conflicts, and how to deliver results under pressure. These can be answered fluently after practicing a few rounds in Beyz.
3. Don't complain about your previous company or boss. The interviewer may deliberately ""hook you to tell the truth"", but you need to express your growth and experience in a mature and positive way.
4. **Eye contact** is really a plus. (But don't keep staring at people, it's too scary...) This is the most direct way to convey confidence.
5. ""I like to work independently"" is no longer enough. **The keyword now is ""teamwork""**, you have to tell a specific collaboration story to reflect your communication, cooperation and responsibility.

Calm down and spend 15 minutes every day practicing in front of the mirror. Even if you just repeat a few stories, you can blurt them out in the real interview.
Or open your phone to record a complete mock interview, and then look back to see which expressions, tone or logic you can optimize.
Review more, practice more, **real progress starts with facing yourself. **",CreditOk5063,1,1.0,0,1745355714,2025-04-22 21:01:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5hh3y/i_built_9_interview_assistants_to_train_for_one/,4,2025

I just finished that second call today. However now I realize I have no email communication with the hiring manager. We only spoke on the phone. Personally I don't think it went well, however i always follow up with email thanking them for their time. But I don't have the hiring manager email. I only have the recruiters.

1k5g7ib,New Job Offer,"Hi everyone- I was just offered a Data analyst position with a company that is merging from two previous companies. They are offering me 40k more then I make now. I’m super excited about that part. 

The two companies however have data in two separate spots ( excel and Netsuite). Initially I was told that they wanted to combine all of the data into Netsuite and move it then into Salesforce (where my expertise lies). However they are satisfied for now to keep using Netsuite and using Power Bi and tableau to run enhanced reports.

I’m worried I might be a bit over my head moving the data from excel into Netsuite and then having to use Power Bi to make it look pretty. I’m pretty average with excel and the other two I have no experience using.

1k5g1ch,"need help choosing a career path/college, psych related","Hi! I’m a high school senior trying to plan my future, and I’d love some honest advice on my college + career path. I’m choosing between a few options and don’t want to waste time or money.

- I’m definitely going to a CUNY due to cost I’ve been accepted to Hunter, Baruch, and Brooklyn College.

- I’m passionate about psychology, but I also want to make $90k+, have a stable job, and work in a calm setting because I struggle with hospital environments bc the lights and chaos give me anxiety.


- I don’t want to open my own practice

-  I’m okay with grad school if it actually pays off.

i’ve considered: 
- Therapist (but I’m unsure if the salary is worth the years of school)

- Nursing, specifically PMHNP, but I’m not sure I can handle the intensity and don’t like being in high-stress environments/hospitals

- Healthcare admin, I/O psych, psych PA, etc. 

I have volunteered at two mental health clinics and loved the environment and met such great people and therapists who helped me a lot with career guidance 

So far my plan is go to Brooklyn College, major in psychology, take nursing prerequisites, and decide over time. That way I can apply to accelerated nursing programs after I graduate, or go for a psych master’s, or another health-related field if I find one I like. It feels flexible and gives me room to think without locking me in.

My question:
Is this a smart plan? Would it still give me solid job options post-grad without being stuck or behind? Am I missing any careers that match my needs better? Also if you’ve gone to Brooklyn, Hunter, or Baruch, what would you say about your experience?

1k5fuw4,Career Advice- Lawyer to Criminology (Gov’t Position)?,"Currently considering a career change. I have a BS in both Criminal Justice & Political Science and a JD from a well know east cost law school. Prior to entering law school, I intended on doing the JAG program with the Marie Corps to help pay for school. After JAG, I thought I would pursuing a career as a prosecutor and potentially the USAO’s office. I also considered a government/federal law enforcement position (specifically in criminal profiling, national security, detective work). 

However COVID ruined a lot of those plans for me. Due to personal & family situations, I ended up taking a scholarship from my law school and did not end up in JAG. I also did not pursue a position at the local DA’s office after graduation due to lower pay. I took a job as civil defense lawyer in a major city (how I ended up a defense attorney I may never know lol) but I haven’t practiced in criminal law at all. I am currently working to pay off my debts with this job, but I don’t know if I see myself staying here forever. I love my job but I don’t feel like I’m doing any “good” in the world. 

I have a degree in criminal justice and my JD, but I was wondering if (1) do I NEED to go back to school for any additional degrees, and (2) if I need to go back to school, what degrees should I obtain? From what I’ve gathered, forensic psych or criminology…? I know a lot of government entities (FBI, CIA, Homeland, DOJ) are JD preferred positions, but I lack any practical experience in the criminal justice field so I figured an additional degree may help that deficiency 

Thoughts?

1k5fh5v,Denied a promotion… yet again. Now what?,"I work in corporate for a mid-size company and have been here for over 5 years. We are a lean team and I’ve been eager to take on more work and prove myself. I was very certain that I was set for getting a promotion back in March because of the high-level work I am producing which at this point is on par with a director-level title even though I am currently a senior manager. I had my performance review and was rated “exceeds expectations” and had glowing remarks… but no promotion. My manager could not clearly explain why I was not promoted to director even though I am clearly functioning at the capacity of a director.
 
I know what I need to do next. However, it is extremely hard given the current economic environment. Ordinarily, I would already have another job lined up but this market is… exceptional.
 
On top of that, every time I log into LinkedIn, I see other friends and counterparts getting their stars (today I saw one of my friends announce her promotion to director level and it broke me). It feels like I am falling behind and I’m almost embarrassed of it at this point especially when I see other people in similar roles progressing forward while I stand still.
 
I guess my time will come eventually but in the meantime, I am stuck. I feel taken advantage of, completely burnt out, defeated, and I’m not sure how to navigate this.

1k5fdp6,Turned Down a Job in September. Now I’ve been fired and the role is still vacant. How should I approach?,"I was at Job A. It was unsatisfying but easy except for my miserable boss. Good salary and benefits, a remote position with flexible hours but started looking because my boss was truly terrible.

I applied for and was offered Job B. Almost the same salary but would be a much harder, in-person job with much less flexibility but the potential to be much more fulfilling. I ended up turning down Job B because it was really more of a director position (which I did not want) without the corresponding bump in salary, and there were no guarantees the management would be any better at this new place. I decided to tough it out. This was in late September. 

Now, about a month ago, I was fired from Job A. My boss gave me a final notice for a misstep I made (I turned in a project way late and tried to cover it up) and then a week later found a very small reason to let me go. I appealed but lost the appeal. (Funnily enough, SHE got fired just last week. How ironic!)

Job B is still vacant. I reached out to the recruiter right after I was fired. She asked why I was reconsidering Job B and I said it was because they had listened to my advice and hired a director over the program (true!) and I was looking for a change in my work environment (also true). She sounded happy and optimistic, and said she would connect with the proper folks and get back to me. I emailed after a week or two to check in and she said there were no updates. It’s been a few more weeks now, and I’m not sure what to do next. 

I have contact information for leadership at Job B (above the recruiter) who I interviewed with and who offered me the job. Should I reach out to them directly and reiterate my interest in the position? They did actually make some changes internally that make the position a better fit now, but the reality is that I’m looking because I was fired from Job A. All the advice I’ve found on the topic of asking for a job after declining it says you should be honest about why you’re reconsidering but I can’t imagine that’s true when you’ve been fired. Any tips? How would you approach it? I can’t just cut my losses without trying everything; jobs in my field are very few and far between, so dismissing one that is local and at a respected institution should not be done lightly.

I make pretty good money for my age (about $60k/yr) but there are not many growth opportunities in my current agency due to my agency being a small business (about 4 years old). There is no need for an office manager at the time and the owner of the agency handles all leadership responsibilities himself because he only has 3 employees including myself.

I have my bachelors degree in business administration, I earned that about a year ago. I chose to stay with my current job after graduation because my agent gave me a raise once I finished the degree and the job market for my area hasn’t been the greatest.

I am currently in a program paid for by my boss to learn more information about the possibility of opening my own captive agency in the future. I am not sure if opening my own insurance agency is the route for me, I do enjoy working in the insurance industry but becoming an agency owner is a whole beast I’m not sure how to conquer. I’m staying in the program since it is free for me and it is valuable information that help me with my current sales position. 

I like my job, but I am nervous about the future because there is no room for promotion within my current agency and I’m worried I am wasting my time if I do not pursue my own agency in the future. I want to make more money eventually. 

I have also been thinking about starting graduate school and obtaining a masters degree, but I’m not sure what in. It feels like the best route is just go towards a business administration masters degree, but would I even use it for anything?

When I was in a charge of a team, if I received documentation indicating somebody was on leave (even with a date provided on the doctor's note) I would provide a vague email indicating team member X will be off but wouldn't include a return date even if there was a period of time associated with the note.  

My reasoning being is that information shouldn't be disclosed and also that it created an opportunity for people to hold work and wait for the person to come back.  Also, when medical documentation/notes are provided there is always a chance that leave may be extended, etc.  

I am curious what people who work in HR or regularly deal with these situations feel is appropriate when sending out communications like this.

1k5c4xt,Company Changed Job Title on Contract — Advice?,"
Hi everyone,

I accepted a job offer recently where the role was always presented with a specific title that fits my technical career path. When I signed the contract, I noticed they used a more generic title instead. HR said it's their standard naming and it should be used both internally and externally.

I already accepted a lower salary, so now it feels like another compromise. The tasks stay the same, but the title really matters to me for future opportunities.

Would you push back on this or let it go? Has anyone dealt with something similar?

The process started with a recruiter screen, which had to be rescheduled after the recruiter missed the original time. After that initial screening, I had a second interview two weeks later that went exceptionally well.

Following that, I didn’t hear back for a week, so I followed up with emails—two to the recruiter and one to the hiring manager—but received no response. A full month later, I was contacted to schedule another interview. While I had mentally moved on at that point, I accepted. That interview also went well, and again I followed up afterward, asking for feedback—no reply.

Shortly after, I received an invitation for an onsite interview. I put together a well-received technical presentation, and the team deviated from the original itinerary to take me on a tour. The experience was very positive, and I left feeling confident. I sent a follow-up thank-you email to the recruiter the next day—no reply. I even texted the interviewer a week after the visit—again, no response.

1k5ared,College or Insurance Industry,"Need genuine advice

24F - I’ve my 215 for two years and have worked with two different firms. Currently, I’ve just surpassed a year with my current brokerage, they’ve been patient and kind - but my manager is still a full time agent and first time “team leader”. I specialize in Medicare, Life, and have done quite well with Annuities because my manager is also a financial advisor. But this year has only been trial and error.

I work part time in the nightlife industry and have relied on that the last three years in this insurance process. I haven’t been able to solely rely on insurance pay yet. Even though I’ve been spending $, time, and so much gas  each month to maintain my own license. I recently sold an annuity ($87k) and only made $1,500 off of it due to splits and the level of pay. I’ve made triple that one day in my part time. All love to my manager but he is extremely preoccupied with his own clients and has given me misinformation in the past which makes me look bad to my prospects. 

- another factor is the Trump Administration, which I suspect is trying to cut Medicare Advantage for all it’s worth. Carriers have already stopped paying out for certain plans in hopes to remove it from the market, long term I only see that getting worse. My main demographic is 65+

• This takes me to my situation now, I met with my local community college and am considering getting a degree in something that will fulfill me more. The position I’m in with my part time will not last forever, and gives me a lot of flexibility to explore my career path. 
I’ve invested almost three years into insurance and my best year was 14k. I’m empathic, kind, understanding, and felt I would blossom in this career. But my management is inconsistent, pay is inconsistent, people are inconsistent. 

My degree would be at no cost due to financial  aid, grants, and a scholarship program that the program offers. I would graduate at 27 if it goes to plan. Starting salary in this field would be 63k+

I could really use some career advice. I’m currently working as a customer support rep at a tech company. It’s my first job out of college— I studied business, but I couldn’t find any desirable opportunities after graduating.

Honestly, I’ve felt a bit overqualified for the role from the start, but I took it for the experience and to get a foot in the door. Now, the company is moving our support team overseas, and we’re all being transitioned into a new role that I have no interest in. It’s not aligned with my goals or interests, and I’d really prefer not to move into it.

Here are the two options I’m currently weighing:
	1.	Accept the new role — I’d keep the job, do the work, and look for other opportunities on the side. Not ideal since the role itself doesn’t motivate me and might be a drag on my energy.
	2.	Decline the transition — The new position requires a background check, so I could opt out of that part, which would likely result in me being laid off. In that case, I’d plan to file for unemployment while actively searching for a job more in line with what I actually want to do.

I’d love your advice on the following:

	•	What are the potential consequences (legal, financial, professional) of each option?
	•	Would I still be eligible for unemployment if I intentionally don’t complete the background check and get laid off?",Medium-Departure-913,1,0.6600000262260437,2,1745339260,2025-04-22 16:27:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k5amml/need_advice_team_being_moved_overseas_being/,4,2025

- I do not want to move up in this industry. The hours will never get better, the content has gotten worse over the last decade, and the industry isn't keeping up with the quickly-changing times. Plus the company I work for is in bed with the FCC Chair and this administration.

- been in my current role 2.5 years.

- no benefits (Big media company I work for says I'm an essential employee on severe weather/snowstorm days, but won't pay for my health insurance as I'm TECHNICALLY part-time)

- I'm in the news industry and have to see SO MUCH sad and/or infuriating news content. The election changed the content I have to see everyday and made it way worse for me mentally.

- office politics: I and the one coworker I still get along with have been ousted. No one talks to us anymore, and I don't understand why and I wish I didn't care. So many people in my department are passive aggressive and somebody probably talked about me behind my back.

1k58v32,I am Feeling Stuck After Being Graduated for a Year,"Hey everyone,

I’m not sure if this is an over-asked question here, but I could really use some advice and perspective.

This May will mark one year since I graduated with a BA in English Language and Literature, along with a minor in Photography and Education. I'm based in West Virginia, about an hour outside of D.C.

When I started college, my plan was to become an English teacher abroad. And for the past two years, I’ve been teaching here in WV. While there have definitely been some bright spots, the overall experience has been tough. Many days, it feels like the students don't even notice I’m there. I bring work home constantly — grading on weekends, planning late into the night — and it’s taken a toll.

Lately, I’ve been seriously considering stepping away from teaching. I’ve always dreamed of teaching abroad in places like Australia or New Zealand, but I’ve found that the process of qualifying and finding positions is a lot more complicated than I expected. If anyone here has experience with teaching overseas, I’d love to hear more about how you made it happen.

At the same time, I feel stuck. Over the past four months, I’ve applied to over 100 jobs — everything from journalism and communications roles to office and admin positions — and I haven’t landed a single interview. The only feedback I get is that they went with someone who had more experience.

So now I’m asking: how do you *get* experience in a new field when you can’t even get your foot in the door? Should I double down on trying to teach abroad, even though the path seems uncertain? Or look into internships or entry-level positions that may pay less but offer a better long-term fit?

I know there’s no single “right” answer, but I’d really appreciate any thoughts, stories, or advice from those who’ve been in a similar place. Thanks so much for reading.

1k58bt7,Staff refused to perform tasks,"Hi~ 

I am at my wits end. Need some advice on how to deal with the following situation.

1. Management team found out that a group of staff did not perform a specific task for a few months. They falsified the records. This is a serious breach in quality aspect. It could lead to audit issues and potentially cessation of service for a few months.

2. The same group of staff have multiple repeat offences of misconduct. Their misconduct could affect the integrity of the products we are selling. We are dealing with healthcare and patients. So it is also a very major concern.

Keep in mind that above have been reiterated many many times that if a staff could not perform a certain task on time, management team have an open door policy for them to approach and let us know the issue. So that management team can work together to think of solutions. Yet, no one open up or approach. The misconduct were also briefed before with warning given repeatedly.

What’s the problem now?

The group of staff are not happy with the consequences set by our company for their misconduct. (Can’t go into too much detail - but most of my friends think it’s extremely lenient)

And the higher ups are scared to lose staff. So they are planning to take back the consequences given to them. I can’t go into too much details. But the whole gist is that despite all the misconducts, the group of staff have more power over the higher ups decision now.

I am part of the management team. This disheartened me a lot. Especially when one of my top management member and my partner left too. Now it feels like the group of staff are targeting me. Every day to work feels like hell. 

I can’t quit for now because I’m worried my supervisor won’t be able to take it. Please give me ideas on how to not feel so miserable working in that workplace for the next few months until I handover everything to the new staff. (PS: I am also losing my interest in that role.

We’ve just had a new manager come on board who wanted “to reward the hard working, lovely members of the team” with a promotion to team leader and a pay rise to £12.30ph. 

My name was missed off the list of who she promoted via what’s app group chat.

I complained to HR as it felt highly unfair and I felt absolutely shit.

New manager apologised profusely and said she had no idea I’d been in the business so long and said she would promote me too with immediate effect. 

After a week, today. She calls me into the office and says that the business owner gave her a bollocking and that my promotion is unreasonable.

She cites reasons like I only work 3 days a week, I’m not flexible because I have 2 year old twins. Says it’s not me, it’s them etc. 
She was genuinely upset and said she fucked up. HR was also present. 

I really, really don’t want to go into work tomorrow and am thinking of handing in my notice as I’m so let down and upset, I don’t know how I can face them again tomorrow, and do my job feeling so underappeciated. 

My anxiety has hit an all time high. 
I felt so comfortable in this job.

1k57k2c,Young and Lost. Words of wisdom PLEASE?,"I’m 19 and I know a decent amount of people may look at this and laugh because I have SO MUCH TIME cause I’m only 19 and I’m sure I’ve barely seen anything yet but I can’t help but feel this way so any advice is appreciated.

I currently have a work+study study arrangement with a great company and I work as a business analyst. Keeping it short I don’t really enjoy it much, it’s not stimulating, I don’t feel like I’m using all my strengths here and I feel like I could flourish in something that i genuinely enjoy more. 

*(I’ve also posted this in career advice but forgot to add this part)*: I hate the corporate environment. I thought my anxiety here was just because of being new but it’s been 9 months and nothing has changed. I have friends but everything else about office culture in general is just not for me. I thought I’d be able to enjoy it. I don’t at all — i think it’s harder for me because I’m autistic as well. I really do try. I go to the bathroom every morning to speak positive words to myself in the mirror so i can get through each day🤣. But man, I hate it. It’s so upsetting because I worked so hard for this opportunity and even cried when i got the job offer, my mum was so proud of me. But it’s not for me, it’s like my body is rejecting it.

What led me to this role in the first place was the prestige of the company, valuable experience and not paying for my studies, and I was interested in a role with a combination of technical expertise & business context. I don’t know if it’s because of the sheer size of this company, but my work is unfulfilling and boring. I find myself wishing I could chase my dream and become an author

I’ve always loved writing and do it on the side as a hobby, but with being the eldest in an immigrant family i prioritised money. I don’t know roles that are/will be in high demand where I’m doing some sort of creative writing or something. 

As of recent I’ve become more and more uninterested with work — i push through because it’s a beneficial opportunity and I know I want to complete it to get my degree and experience as well as having a decent income, but I don’t know…should I pursue being an author on the side? Motivation is low due to being kind of unhappy at work so I find even getting myself to write once I’m home from work or on the weekends is difficult. 

I don’t know what to do because I like to have a plan for the future and actively work towards it, and even aside from that, after my dreadful school experience it’s important I do something I actually enjoy. Ugh. I don’t know how to go about this or how to pick myself up. I’m also scared I’m not good enough at writing to pursue it or something, but I guess that’s just that common fear of failure.

To the experienced people here, please give me some words of advice. Be as brutal as you need to be if necessary 🙏🏻",Ok_Calligrapher_1613,1,1.0,3,1745331768,2025-04-22 14:22:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k57k2c/young_and_lost_words_of_wisdom_please/,4,2025
1k56vwr,Is it normal to be left figuring everything out on your own at work?,"Hi! I’ve been working in a corporate setup here in the Philippines for about 9 months now. I’m a fresh graduate, and I just want to ask if this kind of setup is normal. 

When I started, there were no proper endorsements or clear task handovers. They just gave me a few pieces of paper and told me that’s what I’d need to get the job done. I report directly to the General Manager, but even then, I feel like I’ve just been left to figure things out on my own.

Most of the time, they just tell me “do this” or “do that” without much explanation or context. It feels like I’m just being thrown random tasks and expected to magically know how to do them.

Is this how it usually goes for fresh grads? Or should I be concerned about the lack of proper training and guidance? I’d really appreciate any advice or insight from others who’ve been through something similar.

Thanks in advance!

1k56mac,Got Rejected - How cooked am I?,"So I applied for this internal role at my company in a different department that I eventually wanted to go into without speaking to anyone, however, that wasn't a big deal as I am currently in between team leads (they left the company early in the year) and I work with a range of different managers depending on the client accounts I am on so there's no one to really talk to about this. It's also a very large multinational company.

Anyways, shortly after I applied I reached out to the hiring manager, a director, and manages to secure a coffee chat to discuss the role which I am hoping goes well as this role would be perfect for me at the time and I match it about 70%. The part I'm worried about is during that time and before our coffee session next week I received a rejection email from the role (probably from recruiting or ATS system maybe). As a result do I mention it or do you think they may catch up to it and just tell me in person the role is not for me? How should I navigate this to secure the role.

1k55s8k,End of year review - sales job - FMLA,"Yesterday I received my end of year review, yes in April. I have always had great reviews in the past. Always a few things to work on in the past, but they were related to cross selling more of our companies products and not so performance related. I work in a travel related job selling vacations and insurance at a mega corporate company. 

I was on FMLA the last 3 months out of the year due to an injury. I was on a good track to finish with a high review when I left and was exploring other roles higher up in the company that my previous boss said I would be a great fit for. My previous boss and new boss conducted the review. 

My time out of the office was not accounted for. My goals were not adjusted and being out on medical leave affected my review. I originally applied to work from home under ADA benefits and did not get approved until the week I returned to work. 9 weeks after applying. I can understand getting a bad review if I were working and not selling, but that was not the case. I mentioned being denied WFH and the answer I was met with was that our VP (who verbally denied my leave and told me to submit for it under ADA) said nobody under 5 years would be approved. That is not written in our handbook and I WAS called and approved just extremely late. I feel like my FMLA should not have affected my review and I voiced my opinion and was told, “Well I dont think you would have met the goal anyway.” 

What would you do? My instinct is to just find a new job. ",VaJenna314,2,1.0,1,1745327039,2025-04-22 13:03:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k55s8k/end_of_year_review_sales_job_fmla/,4,2025
1k54b3p,Nearing the end of 90 day PIP. Should I negotiate mutual separation or wait to get fired?,"I’ve been dealing with burnout for over a year but I decided to stick it through the PIP. I wasn’t offered severance as an option when I was PIP'd. HR hasn't been involved that I know of so I haven't seen  any official documentation other than an action plan my boss fills out every month. I've been actively applying for jobs the whole time but the job market’s tough.

My 30- and 60-day reviews went well but my 90-day review got canceled and now the timeline is ambiguous. The PIP goals were obtainable. At the beginning, I was offered a chance to transfer teams but I had to go through a training period. Now that I’m near the end of that, I’ve been told I’m not meeting expectations for the new team. It's been hard balancing PIP at my current role, training for new team and job hunting all at once. 

The truth is, I genuinely gave it my all. I pushed through even when I had nothing left. But it’s clear the company doesn’t see it that way and I honestly feel like the decision’s already been made. I just don’t understand why they won’t be direct about it.

So now I’m wondering, is it too late to try and negotiate a mutual separation agreement or do I just keep suffering through until they fire me. Quitting is not an option because I want to be able to hopefully get severance and collect unemployment.

1k53xxg,How to protect yourself as young professionals?,"So i got my first big girl job as writer in fashion magazine, after i graduate from my masters. I just 23 back then.

So because this is my first big job, i worked so hard, i clock in and clock out very timely, and i never missed a deadline. Besides these, I know that my skills is still at beginner level (all of my co-workers and uppers already work for at-least 4 years, so it makes sense that i am the most junior). So I learn I had to take feedback and work on make my craft better each day. 

Eventually my work hard get noticed and I being promoted only 3 months as opposed to average of 2 years. I know by being promoted this fast would evokes some jealousy.

Then here comes the uneasiness’s. My senior (33F) would watch me like a hawk. We worked in open space, she would back and forth into my area to watch my desktop, beside that she becomes overly observant of what i am doing at office; like i often caught her looking at me so intently, then i caught her copying my method of writing even as far as taking my style. However I still not disturbed at this point.

Then it amplified, she is irritated when i do smallest mistake, when i didn’t reply her message she would straight up call me in very rude manner. 

The craziest thing is she isn’t my supervisor, there is no supervisor at all in this organization structure. I am the most junior so i have to act accordingly all the senior but she acted like she own me. When i prioritize other senior work, she would angry and demand that i have to do hers first.


All of this slowly eating me up. I become paranoid to go to work, i felt very unsafe. I am naturally cheerful kid when i am in safe place, but in here I can’t. I become so anxious, and depressed. I can’t eat at all, sleep 12 hours a day, didn’t want to talk to anybody. My body weight dropped to 40Kg.

And then I dropped my resignation, the HR shocked, everyone was shocked. They asked me why, and I didn’t tell them anything. I keep it to myself.

1k4zt8d,"I survived two years of rejection to land this job… and now I feel like I’m breaking again.
what to do?","**Hell**o

I went through two years of hell after masters graduation — depression, health problems, constant rejections — trying to find my first job in my field. Eventually, I gave up on finding something I actually liked and accepted a job in a sub-field of this niche I’ve always disliked, just to move forward with my life, learn something, and escape the rut I was in. I moved to a bigger city, hoping for a fresh start, even if the job itself didn’t excite me.

Since day one, there was no training, no real onboarding, no real support. I’ve been expected to figure out everything on my own. just “sink or swim.”

And the worst part? I only have one person in the office with me — my coworker — and he’s been getting more and more toxic over the past month or two.

He has over 25 years of experience, and I’m just starting my first job. Still, he constantly makes condescending remarks, like tellling me something like ""you're a big boy now,"" and saying things like “I would’ve done this in half an hour if I had time.” He twists conversations, puts words in my mouth, and later accuses me of things I never said.

He once told me, ""I’ve worked with a lot of people in my life, but I really don’t like the way you work."" That crushed me — especially because I’m always trying to do my best. I stay overtime (unpaid) just to finish projects they dump on me, and still feel like I’m falling short, I try to learn, ask questions, and contribute. Even if I don’t love the field, I genuinely want to grow and be useful.

Still, he accused me of being here just for the money, which is really unfair. Then he said that either I can’t or I don’t want to work like him — which is honestly wild, considering how specialized the work is and the fact that I’m brand new, still in my first few months.

Instead of helping me or giving advice, he criticizes my thought process, tears down my interpretations, and never gives constructive feedback. Lately, he even stopped shaking my hand and now insists we only communicate through email, despite sitting a meter or two apart. I didn’t do anything to deserve this. I’ve never been rude or sarcastic. I even tried to understand him — maybe he’s going through burnout or personal issues — but it just keeps escalating.

The whole company feels like it’s running on fumes. HR and the Manager are barely present. My department head rarely shows up in our office and doesn’t seem interested in what’s going on. Everyone is overworked. One person often ends up doing the work of an entire department. There’s no structure, no process, and honestly, no sense of direction.

This job is making me feel robotic. Numb. I sit at my desk like a robot all day, with no one to communicate with. Not learning, not advancing. Just surviving.

And now, as I near the end of my probationary period (but they will probably dont care and want me to stay ), I feel completely stuck. The job market in my field is practically dead in this country, and I can’t move abroad at the moment. I feel isolated, drained, and numb. Like I’m slowly falling apart again.

Hence I transferred to a product mgr role. I did have some discovery talks w the managers from the team and felt hesitant about the role in general (too much risk & unknowns), but decided to take it on after some cost-benefit analysis.

However, this is my current POV not even a month in:

1) **Too many stakeholders**, very limited strategy influence and decision-making from my org.

2) **Incongruence in product / project strategy within the team itself.** Most (ie. the middle managers and some folks at my level) rather out-source nearly everything to a 3rd party vendor for short-term convenience, while others (eg. manager who interviewed me) have a more product-centric mindset and long-term considerations. I'm interested in executing something well (questioning the whys behind decisions) and not just do it for the sake of doing it, be done with it and go home to the fam (which seems like the vibe I am getting from most of the team).

3) **From a technical and design level, I feel like this project is going to be a house on flames esp when it comes to delivery work (of which 95% they are planning to out-source) due to 1 and 2 as well**. I don't know if the team has assessed the relevant risks and trade-offs before recommending a certain direction / strategy or at least when I asked about it, the vibe I get was ""ugh don't wanna do that because more work for us and troublesome"". Some of it makes sense ie. consolidating payment milestones, but some others don't make that much sense ie. giving up too much control by getting a third party to source for equipment instead of managing it in-house.

4) **I miss doing some amount of tactical work.** Even when it comes to POC and service blueprints, the team is reliant on 3rd party vendors to do it ""due to lack of knowledge in the area"" (this is one reason why the manager was interested in me because of my prev work exp).

\_\_\_

My 1-1 review w manager is coming up. How transparent should I be regarding all of the above issues? Should I hint that I may want to explore for lateral transfer because I sure as hell do not want to be locked into the project by being forced to do low-code work (which I did not sign up for!! I would be ok to learn and help in a limited capacity but NOT be forced to rush for delivery on some vendors schedule and promises).

1k4ynth,New hire being offered higher starting salary than me after being at company 3+ years,"I’ve been a project manager for a few years. My team is small, and I am the longest standing PM in my country’s branch of the company. It’s relevant to mention that my reviews from those I work with are excellent. I am very good at my job - not to brag too much, but I do want to be clear that there are zero issues with performance. 

I got a new boss recently, shortly before my teammate left. My new boss submitted recommendations for a new hire, so all interviewees were selected by her. They all have 10ish years of experience in similar roles/industries. 

I was invited to the platform my company uses for interviews, as I am part of the interviewing team. Because of this, I was able to see what salary expectations each of the candidates submitted. Next to each submission, the person from HR had noted whether or not the salary expectation was in budget. Salaries $8k-13k higher than my current salary were marked as “in budget.” 

I am a few years (or many years, in some cases) younger than these candidates, and changed careers to my current field only around 5 years ago. I asked for a raise last year and they entertained me with a couple of calls to discuss, but ultimately was politely told to “shove it” for now. I believe I’m being underpaid based on the industry average for people in my field. I also have a master’s degree which is relevant to my role. 

I have initiated another salary discussion with my boss who will be bringing the topic to higher ups on my behalf. My boss seems to be on my side and in support of my request. What I’m wondering now is how I can argue for a higher rate without making it sound like I expect more money just because of the new hires (with more experience) will be getting more. I feel it’s objectively well-deserved based on my performance, experience IN THE ROLE, and the current market rate for jobs similar to mine, but I’d appreciate any advice on how I can ask for higher pay without saying how upset I’ll be to have been at my company for years while someone new can walk in and be paid significantly more on their first day.

1k4xnqc,Lateral Moves,"Okay right now I work swing shift in a lab and I applied to two roles in the company, a promotion in the same shift and a lateral move within the same shift and company. I got denied the promotion, but offered for  the lateral move. If I decline the lateral move. I will move to grave. The pay difference is basically 18 cents in favor of the swing. 

Personally, I very much enjoy grave it's calm relaxing and frees me up for essentially the rest of the day. I don't hate swing but I don't necessarily enjoy it.

I am going to try negotiate for a sign on bonus and an increase in pay for the lateral move. Supposedly there is potential to move up the career ladder in the swing role, but that could be just a pipe dream. 

My current lifestyle meshes with grave its chill and at most I'm just troubleshooting equipment. Same thing for the swing role but apparently significantly more work.  
The pay grade for both role is the same but the swing potentially has more steps like (2 promotions assuming people leave/retire) versus the grave is just 1 promotion.

TLDR: Should I choose to work harder in swing for only 18 cents more (pre-negotiation) progress my career into potentially being promoted (i would have to wait for people to retire) or wait/chill in grave, enjoy the work/life balance and get a similar treatment for promotion.",Bunratha,2,1.0,1,1745295662,2025-04-22 04:21:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4xnqc/lateral_moves/,4,2025

1k4xlte,How to go about explaining a recently accepted job during an interview with another company?,"I recently signed the offer letter for a job, but a day later, I got an email from a recruiter from another company that I applied for requesting to schedule a recruiter screening interview. I didn't expect to hear back from them at all.

Given that I've signed the offer letter (I didn't know I'd get anything back from the second company) for the first company, I'm wondering how I would address the recently accepted role during the recruiter screening if they were to ask about the current state of my employment. I'm not sure if mentioning / not mentioning it will make me look flakey or paint me as a bad candidate and blow the whole thing before I get to the next round of interviews. 

I hope it won't come up, and I don't plan on bringing up, but if they do ask, do I answer with something along the lines of **""Technically I am not employed right now (due to lay off and start date for Company 1 is in early May), but I have accepted a role with Company 1 early next month, however my skillset is better suited for this role, etc.""**, or would I just say that **""I'm not employed as of this moment"" (Which is technically true, I don't start until early may)** and not mention the other role at all? 

The first role (the one I signed the offer to) requires relocation within 90 days of the start date, but the second role is fully remote with likely more pay so I'd like to get the second role if I can. The chances of me getting that fully remote role are totally against me, but I still want to try my best, and wondering how I can avoid fumbling over this question in the following interviews.

Has anyone else been through something like this and have any advice?

1k4wp5o,Looking for perspective/advice: Applicant wants to apply again for the same role,"I am looking to apply again for the same role/same company I applied to almost 2 yrs ago. Basically, I passed the interviews and was just waiting for the job offer. Then I was ghosted by the HR. I was in communication with my would-be boss and he told me that it was the CEO's decision not to proceed with the offer.

Now, I see that the role is still open, and have confirmed with some friends inside that the role has been vacant since.

For background, I was with this company for 5yrs, then resigned, then after 4 yrs, I tried to go back and apply for this role. This is the same department/team I was in before, just applying for a more senior role.

What is the hr/employer perspective on this? I really think I'm a good fit for this role, but I do not want to come across as desperate. I have a stable job now, but I am actively looking/sending applications elsewhere.

1k4vlas,At a crossroads...better work environment vs higher pay... what would you do and what do you value in a new role?,"Hey everyone! I’m torn between staying at my current job or taking a new offer that I got today. I have been applying for 9 months or so and this is my first actual offer. The money’s close, but the day-to-day would be  very different. Just wondering because genuinely do not know what to do and need advice. I am 24M in HCOL btw.  

Current Job: 

\- Pay: $78.5K base + 15% bonus (never fully funded, usually at 70-75%) + \~10% profit share 

\- Work: Risk assessments (kinda boring, not growing much but its stable)  

\- Schedule: Hybrid (2 weeks in office / 2 weeks remote)  

\- Hate my job, team is awful, no one has motivation (including me) and I oftentimes have to show some of the older folk how to do the work. But from the bottom of my heart, I feel crushed every time I come into the office/have to do the work. Benefits are really great and the bonus + profit sharing is nice. Also 21 days PTO.  Firm is a large broker dealer with 80k people.



New Offer:  

\- Pay: They offered 88k base but I countered with $95K (no bonus), but has pension + stock options  

\- Work: Model validation & testing, eventually creating the models for bank. 

\- Schedule: Mostly remote (only 3 office days/month)  

\- Smaller team (3 people), and 2 levels below the Chief Risk Officer. Role is at a regional bank with 25 billion in assets. Super flexible with great WLB. Work seems more interesting and obviously I would be in a better team environment. 22 days PTO and literally the same medical and vision benefits. But overall, benefits are a tad weaker (no fitness, concierge etc.). Also no bonus and 3% 401k match vs current roles 7%. 



If you were in my shoes, would you take the pay cut for a healthier work environment? Or is sticking it out for the money the smarter play? Like I said, right now I have no idea what I am doing long term so thinking maybe I should figure that our first... I dont know im so confused!

1k4utqa,My reviews after trying 4 mock interview platforms,"I was super stuck in interview prep. I tried many methods, including:

**College career center every day** → This heavily depends on your advisor's industry expertise. Their experience might not align with your target field. For example, I wanted to get a data scientist role in the tech industry, but most of our school advisors had backgrounds in consulting or more traditional industries.  
**Finding peers in school Slack communities** → No offense, but sometimes they’re not as patient or hardworking as you are. Some people even misunderstood it as a dating ??? Excuse me??  
**My first and last try: spending $130 on a career coach verified by LinkedIn** → It was relatively professional, but way too expensive for me a student with loans. I just couldn’t afford it...okay, that part’s on me..So I turned to AI mock interview websites, but I couldn’t find many in-depth reviews and wasn’t sure which one suited me best. I Googled the top-ranked platforms and wrote some quick reviews based on my experience. Hope they help as a reference. Just pick the one that fits your needs best!

[Prepfully](https://prepfully.com/) \- mock with career coaches  
Target users: looking for real-human interview coaches  
Review: That’s where I booked the career coach. Honestly, it wasn’t budget-friendly for me, but it’s a good option for those who prefer real-time practice with experienced interviewers. It provides detailed feedback and can be especially helpful for final interview stages. Just a heads-up: sometimes appointments might get canceled by the coaches, and access to meeting notes is limited.

[AMA Interview](https://www.amainterview.ai/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Reddit+Post&utm_campaign=experience_share) \- mock with AI interviewer  
Review: It generates resume, role, and company specific questions, and lets you chat with an AI interviewer with an avatar. It also provides example answers and performance ratings to help you refine your responses. Their Chrome extension includes interview question prediction for LinkedIn job posts and even interviewer personality prediction as a free bonus lol. However it doesn’t support technical interview rounds.

[Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) \- mock with tech peers  
Review: A good platform that allows SWE or SDE candidates to practice live coding interviews with peers for free. It’s a good choice for improving coding interview skills, you can get matched with peers at similar coding levels. Since the matching is random, the experience can vary, but overall it's a good option for structured mock interviews and free technical practice.

[Exponent](https://www.tryexponent.com/) \- thorough interview sources  
Although I found that most of their paid interview videos are also available on YouTube lol. They do offer comprehensive training courses and strong community support for PM roles. Personally, I found free YouTube videos to be sufficient for my own interview prep. Their video answers are helpful for beginners as structured feedback, but they might not be very useful for more senior-level candidates.",OfComputer,3,1.0,1,1745286648,2025-04-22 01:50:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4utqa/my_reviews_after_trying_4_mock_interview_platforms/,4,2025
1k4ut6l,Should I leave my job for a competitor?,"I’m (27) in a real dilemma and could use some outside perspectives. I’m currently working at a job I love, with a manager who has truly invested in my growth. I started here less than a year ago, and it was my introduction to the field. Within six months, I earned a promotion and a 10% raise, and my manager has hinted at another promotion soon. However, my coworkers have shared their salaries for that next level, and the pay increase is only about 5%. I have grown a lot, and I fully credit that to my current company for enabling me to take that next step forward every day. 

Now, a competitor has offered me a job with a **25% salary increase** and **6 more days of PTO**. It’s an enticing offer, but there’s a catch—people who have left my current company for this competitor have been walked out immediately and deemed ineligible for rehire. So if I go, there’s no going back.

I love my current job, the team, and the mentorship I’m receiving. I would say I'm truly drinking the Kool-Aid, but the financial and benefits increase at the competitor are significant. There are no guarantees on whether or not the competitor is bad, but there's uncertainty there. 

Would you leap for the better salary and PTO, or stay where you love the work and have strong career support?

  
**TL;DR:** I love my job and have a supportive manager, but a competitor is offering 25% more pay and extra PTO. Leaving means I can never return. Should I take the risk or stay where I’m growing?

1k4tp3l,Is this a professional sounding message?,"I work in an arena. I work in concessions. The other day, we where having a meeting. The boss said that there is an upcoming event and that we can sign up to work the event if we want. I signed up. 

I do not actually remember when the event is scheduled for. At this company, we have this thing called a virtual roster. Employees can log into it to find out when we are scheduled to work. However, because I put my name on a sign up sheet instead of just being scheduled for the event by the supervisors like usual, I am not sure if this would show up on the virtual roster like any typical shift that I would work. I plan to message my supervisor to ask for clarification and a reminder of the date and time. I have drafted a message, tell me if you think the message sounds good and professional. 

I can already see someone telling me that I am overthinking this. I have autism. I do not understand social cues. I need to think carefully about my every action, every word, every sound, every mannerism, to make sure I do not offend people. It seems like overthinking to you, in the same way and for the same reason that the amount of thought and effort that a type 1 diabetic puts into his/her diet would seem like overthinking to a person without diabetes. Type 1 diabetics need to watch what they eat in ways that most people do not. Similarly, autistic people need to be careful how we talk and act in ways that neurotypical people do not. If it seems like I am overthinking it, it is because you have no idea how hard it is to be autistic in a world designed by and for neurotypical people. 

Here is the message that I drafted. 

Hello (insert name here). 

The other day, during a meeting, you said that there would be an upcoming event and informed us if that there was a sign up sheet if we wished to put our names on it. I put my name on that sign up sheet. 

I forget, what is the date and time of the event for which I signed up? 

Because I signed up to work the event, would the shift still appear on the virtual roster?

To give you some context, it’s currently a sub contracting business which has the potential to be it’s own business. We have good customers relationships and employees however, having to pay a large percentage to a another company to sub contract is killing us but neither of us are educated enough to leave the contract and do it on our own.

1k4th0z,medical coder to data specialist (formerly registrar),"Would making a career change to oncology data specialist (or any other registrar) from medical coder be considered a lateral move? 

I've been at my current job for 3+ years. My company is pretty small and moves VERY slow but is also part of a major healthcare system. While there is job security.. my current manager is being headhunted for other positions AND there are major work flow changes on the horizon.

I have no desire to be a manager. I'm capable of working independently and usually end up in some type of lead position. I don't enjoy being a ""coding machine"" and like to break up my day with additional duties. But there is a large possibility I shift to just coding. Especially with a new manager. 

\-I work in a pretty small specialty (pathology) so there never seem to be many job openings. And I'm not considering another type of coding. But there are (even entry-level) ODS jobs posted consistently. 

\-I am concerned with job security. I don't want to lose my job to AI or overseas. Or be forced to relocate for a position.

\-I've been in my current career for 5+. I have a BS in Nutrition. Various work experience in and out of the medical field. I'd love to feel like I have a bigger impact on patient care than just getting stuff paid by insurance. 

\-The jobs sound very appealing on paper. Especially ODS and burn data. Going for another certification would be free or low cost.

1k4rxei,4 applications -> 3 offers: targeted applications are more effective than mass applying,"I once mass applied to over 1200 jobs without getting one offer, or even making it to the hiring manager round. But after I adjusted my resume, interview prep, and job application strategy, I received 3 offers after just 4 applications (no referrals, no networking, 1 was an internship with a return offer, and the other 2 were full-time roles).

**My job searching journey you guys can see as reference:**

Stage 1: 1200+ applications → 9 interviews → 0 offers. Mass applying without customized resumes, no reviews, no targets, no interview prep...

Stage 2: 4 applications → 3 offers. Tailored resumes with job descriptions, prepared a 15 pages cheatsheet of phone screens, behavioral questions, case study thoughts, and polished it to the 5th version.

**Websites:**

Job application website: [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) (got 1 internship with return offer), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) (got 2 offers)  
Mock on different interview rounds based on resume, company, specific roles & question prediction: [AMA Interview](https://www.amainterview.ai/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Reddit+Post&utm_campaign=storytelling)  
Resume customization & combine answer example with my BG: [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)

**Lessons:**

Stop crazily mass applying: No review at all, just like a relentless job application machine without a brain → Targeted application is king. Otherwise, it’s just spam.

Practice interviews smarter: I used to receive 9 interviews, but 8 stopped at the phone screen stage. Only 1 reached the hiring manager → Mocking and practicing interviews is sometimes even more important than applying. Otherwise, you waste those precious chances.

Stop applying to jobs posted 1 month ago: Proven to be a complete waste of time. Change the LinkedIn URL to filter jobs posted in the last 24 hours: change 86400 in the URL to 3600 (86400 = 24 hours, 3600 = 1 hour).

Customize your resume: For example, I used my data scientist resume to apply for business analyst roles, but the requirements are completely different. DS focuses more on data skills, while BA emphasizes business acumen alongside data.A highly relevant resume for one position is way, way, way more effective than applying to 100+ jobs.

**According to this 8 month job search journey, I finally understand:**

Targeted application: Tailor your resume based on job roles, or even the specific job description for positions at companies you're most interested in. It's most effective if you apply as early as possible.

Interview question & answer prediction: Use the job description and the company’s past interview question history to predict potential questions, then prepare your answers based on those.

Prep smarter: Prepare 5–8 core stories that you can integrate into your interview answers. Build your own cheatsheet for phone screens and behavioral rounds. In most cases, technical or case study rounds don’t really differentiate candidates.",OfComputer,5,0.7300000190734863,6,1745278110,2025-04-21 23:28:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4rxei/4_applications_3_offers_targeted_applications_are/,4,2025
1k4rt2d,"Signed a Promotion Offer, But Another Department Just called me about another role .What Should I Do?","Hey everyone, I could really use some career advice.

I just signed an offer for a promotion in my current department. The new role is a comfortable environment, I get along well with the team, and there’s potential for future leadership opportunities. I was excited about it and felt good signing the offer.

But literally right after I signed, a senior manager who I previously interviewed with from another department reached out and told me they have a role open and they want to bring me on immediately, no interview required. It’s a bit of a step up in title and is a client facing role which could open up networking and long-term career opportunities. It also feels like it could be a faster path to upward mobility.

Now I’m torn.

On one hand, I just signed the promotion offer and don’t want to burn bridges. I’ve worked hard for that opportunity. On the other hand, the other role seems very interesting but it’s a big pivot, and I’d be leaving behind a team and manager that invested heavily in my growth.

If I back out of the signed offer, would it look unprofessional? Is it worth making the switch if the new role has more long-term upside? Has anyone been in a similar situation?

Appreciate any honest thoughts or advice.

1k4rrt5,I want to quit my job because I hate my boss,"Ok - backstory - I would consider myself a high performer. I worked my way up into leading company-wide projects with little to no experience. I am told on the daily to make sure to write what I am doing on my resume because I am doing things that my Director should be doing (but isn’t/and isn’t taking the initiative)

We had a conversation about goals - I am sharing a goal with a known low-performer who hasn’t learned the same skills that I have worked extra hours/on the weekends to learn. I brought the shared goal up as a concern, and asked if I could have an individual goal. During a side conversation, my Boss’s boss said that my performance score should be MY performance score, so I thought that I wasn’t being “complainy” for bringing my goal up for discussion.

However, when I had a conversation with my Boss about my concerns of a shared goal - she blamed me not wanting to be a team player. This is not the case - I actually had a conversation with them previously in the year because when I took on trying to help my coworker/train them on the things that I took the initiative to learn on my own, I didn’t have enough time to get my normal job responsibilities completed, and found I was working EVERY weekend and evening. 

Worst part is is that my boss’s boss, who previously stated that my performance score should be MY performance score, completely did a 180 and in a call with my boss, decided that “we can’t leave our coworkers behind - this organization is fully behind working together to accomplish goals” - and to be clear, I am all for working together, though this has involved me tracking my coworkers tasks/completion of those tasks and training him on what he doesn’t know (which I think is a manager responsibility - they both agreed that too, but still insist that my pay for performance score is going to be linked to my coworkers ability to do his job)

I am only on a team of 4, and have always had individual goal - though this year I feel taken advantage of and completely discouraged that there is nothing I can do to get a higher score.

And I’m also embarrassed for making a stink over a pay for performance score (it is my only opportunity for a raise).

I am the first full-time marketing hire to work at this company and have two entry-level part-time (they only work max 10 hours per week) marketing specialists who help me out with my workload.

I just audited my marketing results and determined that my SEO efforts made up about 57% of this company's entire revenue stream in the past year. With the other 43% being attributed to a medley of marketing tactics like sales outreach, email, etc.

The deals we have closed due to SEO have a way shorter customer journey (I am talking days compared to to years) as they are actively seeking us out, and it's typically a very easy job for the sales team at this point.

My question for you, other marketers, is what kind of compensation is it fair for me to ask for?

1k4qziy,Career Advice Needed,"Hi All,

I’m a 25 year old male who graduated several years ago with a bachelor’s in business administration and a minor in finance. I really messed up by not doing an internship during school especially during covid since an online one would’ve been relatively easy. 

I struggled after school finding a job and finally got one that pays pretty decent ($31 an hour). Unfortunately the job was not really what the recruiter told me it was going to be. I pretty much setup conference room meetings, interact with certain vendors, order supplies, and fill in /help out at our event center. It’s very customer service based mixed with manual labor and there does not seem to be any role I could move into unless someone retires.

This is at a big company and I feel stuck in the corporate facilities team. I have learned almost no hard skills besides using our purchasing system, and don’t know what to do. I really want to get into a job that sets me on a solid career path. Unfortunately it seems impossible to transition into another department, especially with no experience and some hiring freezes going on. Just feeling lost and don’t know what to do with my life. 

I’ve thought about getting an apprenticeship in a trade, which I’ve actually been offered one in low voltage for this company, but the starting pay is $18 an hour. I’ve thought about going back to school, but I really don’t know what for. I just feel dumb most days and my motivation is at an all time low. 

Any advice on getting some skills to maybe get into a finance or accounting role?

1k4qxbm,How do I not get fired again?,"
I really need help.

I started working much later in life, after spending most of my twenties struggling with anxiety, depression, and other undiagnosed issues,  along with a lot of failures. Without going into all the painful details, somehow, even while I was struggling, I managed to achieve a few things. For a while, I truly believed my life was finally starting to get better.

But things didn’t go as I hoped. In February, I was fired from my very first job — in a foreign country no less — after just three months. I struggled a lot with adjusting, and although they said the reason for letting me go was ""personal,"" deep down I know I wasn’t fitting in well with the team. My fear of failure was overwhelming, and it showed.

Am I even good at my job? Honestly, I don’t know anymore. After everything that happened, it’s hard not to feel like I must be terrible at it,  like it’s all my fault.

Now, I have a new job starting in May, and I feel completely frozen with fear. I’m terrified that I’ll get fired again, that I’ll fail all over again, and that I’ll end up as one of those people who bounce from job to job, weighed down by mental health struggles — or worse, that I’ll just seem like someone making excuses for not being good enough.

I’m writing all of this because I’m desperate for advice , how to avoid getting fired, or even just some reassurance that it’s possible to have a rough beginning and still turn things around.
Right now, I just feel deeply hurt, scared of the future, and crushed by the feeling that I’m a failure and a disappointment.

P.S.: I’ve tried therapy, but it hasn’t really helped me yet.

1k4qvph,Should I Still Handle Mail for a Business I No Longer Work For?,"Hey everyone! I’d love to get your thoughts on a situation I’m facing.

I work full-time at one company, and my boss offered me a side job to help with her second business. Since it’s a small business with no office staff, she gave me 8 hours a week to help out. My only official responsibility there was to check employee licenses, and that’s what I was actually paid for. I also checked the company’s mail and took checks to the bank, but that was just something I did to be helpful. it was never part of my official duties.

There wasn’t much mail coming in for the second business, so I didn’t mind. I’d take their checks to the bank along with checks from my full-time job.

After working like this for a while, I asked for a raise at my full-time job. I hadn’t asked for anything in two years, and I was going through a tough financial situation, so I finally decided to speak up. I expected maybe a dollar or two increase, but she actually gave me more than I expected. I was thrilled and felt like I was finally being appreciated.

But shortly after that, she told me she was taking away my side job. In the end, even though my full-time salary went up, I started earning less overall than before, because I lost the extra income from the second business ($600-700 less) 

Now, even though I no longer work for that second business, the mail for it still comes to our main office. I know I technically have every right not to deal with it or even mention it. But knowing myself and my stubborn personality, I started doubting my decision.

Do you think I should still let her know when mail for her second business arrives, even if I’m not opening or handling it? If I tell her that she received some letters, she will definitely ask to open them and take a picture, which already sounds like a task that I’m not paid for? Or am I too petty ? 😄

1k4qqhw,Asking for a letter of recommendation / reference,"Asking Boss for Letter of Recommendation for Grad School?

I've been working in my current job since 2017.  In that time, I've had the same manager and developed a good relationship with them.  However, it is time for me to take the next step in my life and career.

I've been applying to some jobs of interest in my field, but it has not been easy.  I sometimes feel that I've effectively mastered a fairly limited skillset.

So, naturally I have been looking at graduate school in engineering.  I've found a number of very interesting programs and gotten some promising feedback from the program leadership and direct supervisor.  I think it could be a great, challenging experience that opens a lot of doors.

However, to get in the door I need some letters of recommendation.  I have two from undergrad, but I need a third for some of them and I think it should be from my employer, as this will be the most directly relevant to my potential graduate work.

I've discussed graduate school with my supervisor a bit, as my employer has a tuition reimbursement program.  However, I am not sure if I could take advantage of it.  Not only  would it not really be applicable to my day to day work, many of the classes would be during the workday, and according to their policy, it is supposed to be out of work hours.  That, and I am tempted to just go as hard as possible for a few years and really immerse myself and go somewhere better in a few years, especially if I get an assistanceship.

But that leaves me with a bit of a dilemma when it comes to asking for a letter of recommendation.

I am part of a team of three (the other two being the Creative Director and another Senior Graphic Designer). Our job has always been fast-paced with tight deadlines, but recently our workload has increased dramatically, and our creative director told us that he expects this will be the “new pace” moving forward. 

Our team is extremely talented, productive, and high-achieving. We are largely respected by the company for the high-quality work we pump out. The three of us get along well and are all long-term employees (12 yrs, 20 yrs, 22yrs). We always strive to help each other out of someone is in a jam, and cover each other’s workload when someone is sick or on vacation. 

However, with this new pace and dramatic workload increase, I feel my stamina beginning to flag and my creative juices beginning to drain. A lot of my work involves detailed illustrations, which are difficult to rush on short deadlines. All three members of our team are having to work more nights and weekends on top of our 40-hour week, and since we are all salaried, we don’t get paid for our extra time. 

I look at the creative director, who is a borderline workaholic, and see how he never seems to run out of energy. I look at the other senior graphic designer, who (although being a busy dad), maintains a busy work-travel schedule while managing to meet all his deadlines with creative concepts that are straight-up bangers every. single. time. And then I look at myself: barely doggy-paddling to keep my head above water, exhausted, growing irritable, and losing interest in other aspects of my life. 

I worry. I worry because I’m the only woman on the team and I don’t want to appear weak. I worry because although I’ve been at the company for 12+ years, I’m still the youngest by more than a decade and should be the one with “youthful energy.” I’m worried because I’ve set a precedent for excellence in the past that I fear I will no longer be able to meet. And I’m worried because after years of loving this job and the work I do, I’m currently working too quickly to enjoy it at all.

1k4ptk9,Am I doing something wrong?,"Hello! I’ve been living in a new city for almost 1 year now and haven’t been able to land in my field at all. I’m 27 y.o with an Associates Degree in hospitality and recreation management and about 10 years of experience in the industry. 

Like a lot of people here looking for advice, I’ve sent out my resume to hundreds of different companies and recruiters with very few getting back to. I’m spending most of my days now scrolling through job boards looking for the next step in my career and I really don’t know where to turn. 

Currently, I’m unemployed after working for a sales and marketing company that promised a lot of opportunity but didn’t back the promise.

Is going back to school and taking on more debt a saving grace? I’ve thought about this pretty long and I’m not sure that it is the smartest choice at the moment.

Thank you!

1k4pj4j,33 Year Old Looking for Advice on a Path Forward,"Hello all! 

Thank you for taking the time to view this post. A little backstory about me. I worked in retail/grocery for around seven years. The last five of which was in mid-level management. From there, I went to work at a very big shipbuilding company working as a mechanic building submarines for the US Navy. During my time at this company, I meet my long term girlfriend and we had a child together. I ended up quitting my job after five years, as I started to homeschool one of her children who was having a lot of issues in the public school system. During this time, I took up a side gig with a family friend running customer service for them for their online business. This was just to help get by and is not a long term career in any way. 

Sadly, our relationship ended and I was kind of put out with no job. I moved in with my parents, who are older, need help around the house and enjoy spending time with their grandkids. I was able to find a decent job working at a warehouse distribution center. For the work I do, it pays well. However, the hours are not consistent and I'm having trouble finding a reality where I keep doing this work while having enough stable income to have a place of my own, for me and my two daughters. 

Long story short, I'm looking for any advice anyone may have of a job field or career that I can get into while having nearly zero college education and the work history that I have.(Retail, Customer service management, mechanic, general warehouse worker.) Going back to tools is always an option, but I don't love it and I suffered a pretty bad tear to my meniscus at my previous employer which makes it a little difficult to do the kinds of motion that are required. Ladders, kneeling for long periods of time, etc. 

I am open to taking a course or getting a certification and I'm rather open to any possibilities. I'm not in a good place financially and all I wish is to support my girls. If anyone has any recommendations, I would greatly appreciate it!

1k4p0xo,Should I take a similar role at a different biopharma company in this market?,"So, before I begin, I want to highlight that I understand that the job market right now is exceptionally bad, so even getting an offer is a monumental thing and that I'm appreciative of and understand how lucky I am to have an offer. Nonetheless, I've been at a sizable biopharma company (somewhere in the top 20 by market cap) for the past 3ish years, and have been extended an offer by a larger biopharma company (somewhere in the top 10). Both roles are in the gene therapy strand of biopharma, so not a lot of key players. I mainly started job-hunting because there was a profound sense that layoffs were imminent at the beginning of the year -- my team is fantastic, I don't have any complaints about the work culture or responsibilities, just the sense that the ship is sinking.

The broader economy, and biotech as an industry in particular, are likely going to experience some level of contraction over the next 1-2 years. I think the company extending an offer to me might be better financially and is an incredible opportunity to learn new things and have a more well-rounded perspective, but there is always a chance of getting laid off before I have any concrete results at the new company to show for myself. If I stay at my current company, which is probably more financially vulnerable, I may at least be able to finagle some decent professional development before I get laid off, and the severance package would at least give me some more runway to take an interim job.

What should I do: take the new job or stay put? This is my first probable recession in the workforce, I'm scared and I don't know what to do -- I'd love to get some advice on how to approach this.",Anonymity_pls,1,1.0,1,1745270471,2025-04-21 21:21:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4p0xo/should_i_take_a_similar_role_at_a_different/,4,2025

1k4oem7,Jobs that allow you to start out making decent money after completing school,"I have a useless bachelors degree that I don't use and currently work at a dental office. I am really burnt out and want to go back to school to make more money but not sure what to go to school for. 

The only jobs I've had are all customer service jobs (restaurants, retail, and now being a dental assistant). I've been considering nursing for the job stability because after spending 4 years getting a bachelors and not being able to put it towards anything I don't want to risk that happening again. The idea of completing a degree and having a job right out of the gate and then pretty much always having a job no matter where I live sounds so appealing. If I went through with nursing, it would be at a clinic environment though. I have no desire to work in an ER or anything like that for the aforementioned reason that I don't enjoy interacting with so many people on a daily basis and hate fast paced environments. I'd be willing to put up with that type of nursing while in school but not long term.

The idea of a corporate office environment where I would not have to interact with so many different strangers everyday and not be responsible for another human sounds so much better; but the thought of getting a masters in marketing or something and then having to do an internship and then climb the corporate ladder before i can even come close to making six figures sounds terrible. It's so tempting though because I consider myself an introvert/extrovert. I hate being secluded and not getting human interaction but I also get burnt out having to spend day after day talking to people. I think the difference is I don't mind talking to lots of coworkers a day but talking to customers/patients and having to cater to their every need is draining. 

As hard as nursing school sounds, trying to work my way up in corporate environment sounds harder.

What are some jobs that are somewhat easy to start working after completing school?

1k4o0xh,Got blindsided with a PIP and I’m feeling crushed. Should I just quit or try to ride it out?,"So… I found out I’m getting put on a PIP starting Wednesday, and honestly, I’m still trying to process it. There was *zero* feedback about my Q1 performance until my manager randomly told me last Monday that I needed to ""step up"" and be more strategic. I was like, okay… vague, but sure, let’s work on it.

Then he followed up with an email (cc'ing HR, of course) saying my work quality was poor and that I missed deadlines — stuff he *never* mentioned in our convo. Felt super shady.

I didn’t reply right away because I was swamped, and then Thursday I get pulled into a meeting with him and HR about officially being placed on the PIP. Absolutely gutting.

To make things worse, today my senior director (my manager’s boss) literally asked my colleague to take over *my* current project... in front of me. Like, no subtlety at all. That felt like the final nail in the coffin.

At first, I thought I’d fight it, prove them wrong, and come out stronger. But after that stunt? I just feel disrespected and humiliated. I’m seriously considering quitting. Thing is, I have a 60-day notice period (India), and while my husband is super supportive, I’ve been job hunting for months with no luck. The market sucks right now, and we’re also in the middle of buying a house — so quitting without a backup would hit our savings hard.

I don’t do well with risk and I’m not one of those lucky ""land a job in a week"" types. I also suck at confrontations, and my manager has a stellar rep while I don’t. But staying here feels like torture. I feel invisible, disrespected, and just… done.

Would love to hear thoughts from folks who’ve been through something similar. Do I stick it out and try to job hunt during the notice period? Or do I just cut my losses and protect my sanity?",eager_light,122,0.8999999761581421,125,1745267995,2025-04-21 20:39:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4o0xh/got_blindsided_with_a_pip_and_im_feeling_crushed/,4,2025

1k4ndlq,"Any recommendations for careers that help people, have good work-life balance, and won’t put me in debt?","Hello!

I’m 20 years old and struggling to decide what direction to take my career. I went through high school as part of a dual credit program and graduated with both my diploma and an associate degree in general studies. After graduation, I took a year off to focus on saving money, thinking about my future, and making a well-informed decision about returning to school.

Unfortunately, a lot happened during that time that distracted me from figuring those things out. As the new year approached, I realized I hadn’t made much progress. Out of fear of losing time, I decided to return to my community college to pursue an associate degree in Instrumentation Technology—a field that almost all the men in my family have gone into and found success in. It felt comfortable and low-risk.

I’m about halfway through the program now, and it’s definitely not bad! What worries me is that I just don’t feel like I fit in with my classmates—many of whom seem to love it and, personality-wise, seem like they’re built for it. I don’t have the same passion about it. I know that passion is a luxury we aren’t always—or perhaps often—afforded or entitled to, but part of me wonders if I’m wasting my potential. I’m not sure; it’s just a thought that weighs on me.

I deeply enjoy helping people and have felt most fulfilled when I’ve been able to love and support others through hard circumstances. Because of that, the medical field has appealed to me, but I just can’t afford the debt it would likely involve. And many of those careers also seem to come with difficult work-life balances, which is something very important to me, as I hope to lead a family down the line.

That brings me here. Do y’all have any suggestions or experience with professions that involve helping people and offer a good work-life balance? Ideally, something attainable with an associate degree or even a certificate. It’s not the length of school that concerns me—it’s strictly the financial burden. From what I’ve researched, becoming an Occupational Therapy Assistant seems promising, and I’ve already started speaking with some faculty at my community college about it.

Still, I’m getting cold feet again. I’m worried that I haven’t looked hard enough for where I truly belong or what I might love. And, perhaps more significantly, it feels risky and uncomfortable because it’s such a different path from anything my family has done.

The state of the economy and the uncertainty of the future freak me out and make me want to stick with something that feels familiar and offers more financial stability. It feels like I’m stuck between two options: living financially stress-free in a job I don’t love, or pursuing something I’m passionate about and fulfilled by—but possibly being financially unstable. The obvious answer feels like the second option, but I can’t help feeling anxious lol. I think a lot of this is just being faced with more adulthood and responsibilities.

I was recently offered a position that I was genuinely excited about. It aligned perfectly with what I want to do, and I felt like I had all the right qualifications for it. I accepted the offer at $65K because I really wanted the role and was eager to get started.
A few days later, I noticed the same job was reposted with a listed salary range of $64K to $135K-something they hadn't shared with me during the interview process. I felt a bit misled and decided to reach back out to the recruiter to respectfully ask if we could revisit the salary and consider something closer to $77K-$80K, still within the posted range.
Instead of negotiating, they pulled the offer altogether. I was told they couldn't support my request and wished me luck. I even tried reaching out to the hiring manager because I really wanted the role-still waiting for a response
Now I feel devastated. I keep wondering if I ruined my shot by simply advocating for myself. I didn't mean to come off as greedy- just wanted to be paid fairly, especially with how expensive things have gotten. But now I'm filled with regret and sadness.

1k4k5l7,Have you ever negotiated a buyout from a full-time (non-contract) job?,"Hi all,

Using a throwaway because a couple of my coworkers know my main. Need to provide some context here so my question (hopefully) makes sense. I'm also not sure this is the right sub, so please direct me to a more logical place to post it if one exists.

I currently work in tech at a mid-size company (500-1000 employees, idk exactly how many). The company is far from being profitable and we're a subsidiary of a much larger corporation that wants us to achieve profitability soon. I've been here about 2 years, and during that time we've had 2 rounds of layoffs, the entire executive team change over, several abrupt shifts in strategy, generally low morale, and recently some unannounced firings (I don't know details here other than that they happened sporadically across departments). 

For these reasons and some personal ones, as well as the state of the tech industry right now, I've been thinking of leaving this job to pursue a career change to something I'm much more passionate about. I have enough money saved up to last me about a year, I'm a single person with no kids who lives well within my means, and if things don't work out over the next several months I think I could find another job in tech if I really had to. There's also a program in July that I'm planning to use as a stepping stone to breaking into the new industry that I'm really excited about. So I'm pretty set on doing this, what I'm trying to figure out is the timing.

To put it bluntly, I'm pretty burnt out. I've been working full time since 2019 at jobs I have varying levels of interest in that have paid well but have felt like dead ends. I've had plenty of time for vacations and such but my job is stressful and requires me being online all day, and I've let my physical and mental wellbeing lapse. I'd like nothing more than to quit my job, take the summer off, do that program, and then re-start my job search in earnest in August/September when I'm hopefully refreshed and motivated and raring to go. 

So, the question: is there a way I can negotiate a voluntary buyout with my current company instead of just quitting and getting nothing? Has anyone experienced anything like this before? The last round of layoffs at my company happened almost exactly a year ago, and there's noticeable tension in the air about us hitting our performance goals, so I feel like layoffs could happen anytime now anyway but I haven't heard anything specific. I'd feel like a real dumbass if I quit on Friday and then in 3 weeks I could have been laid off and gotten a few months severance to chill on. I wish there was some way I could subtly (or not subtly) hint that I was thinking about leaving and work out some kind of buyout, but I've never done this and am not sure if it's even a thing that happens. 

Any advice here would be really appreciated, or any stories of what you have done that worked or backfired or what have you.

The problem is I’m scared of what will happen if I fail in dentistry or if it becomes too hard, especially since I struggle with chemistry. With architecture, I worry it might be too stressful or that I’ll struggle with schematic drawings. To be honest, the main reason I like it is the scale models—I enjoy working with different materials and building things. For dentistry, I can imagine myself doing pediatric work, but that impression is based solely on my experience as a patient. As for economics, I think it’s laid‑back and offers a lot of free time. I’m currently in Grade 11, taking accounting, and I plan to follow the university pathway. I’m still not sure which one to choose, though.

1k4ix0r,Firguring out my first job after graduation. Please help!!!,"Hi all,

I am graduating in may with a biochem degree. I'm taking a year to work before going back to get my master's (I've deferred already), and I would like to go into fragrance / cosmetic chem. I have no interest in pursuing bio so for all intents and purposes, imagine me as a chem major. I really am not bragging when I say this but I ALWAYS kill interviews. It's great until its not. I've obviously been applying to jobs like crazy and in the STEM world, all lab tech positions are contract which means they revolve super quick and the whole process zooms by. I interviewed for a position late last week and today they have extended an offer to me. This is great, however, I'm not amazed by any means by the job. The hourly rate is standard for a lab tech position (22$ which absolutely sucks) and its moderately related to the career that I wish to pursue after grad school.

My concern, however, is that during the interview, which was revolving style with 3 interviewers, *every single one of them* emphasized that the job is highly repetitive and monotonous, and that it will get boring very quickly. Now, I'm not expecting to be swept off my feet by any position, but I've **never** had an interviewer, let alone three separate people, tell me up front that I will get bored. I'm concerned, and I don't know if I want to do something that's gonna make me want to rip my hair out every day. Its also a very common starter job after college and many other college kids will work there so they say I will ""feel at home"", but to me that doesn't leave a ton of room for making professional connections for my future. I'll basically be titrating and doing viscosity testing 24/7, 365. The thing is, though, that the position is in the personal care industry, which I want to get into, with a big name company in laundry and home fragrance. I think it would look great on my resume if I want to get a job again in the personal care industry to have experience already.

I have a secondary interview 2 days from now for another lab tech role, but this time in the oil/gas sector. This job pays more, is equidistant to the one I just got offered, and seems like it has a LOT of moving parts. I love to be engaged, I love to be borderline stressed when it comes to be responsibilities on the job. But its totally unrelated to what I want to do after grad school. I really have no desire to go into oil/gas and the plant is shutting down in 2 years anyway so there's no future for me there. I really jived with hiring group I interviewed with, (who are the heads of the departments I would be shuffled around in) and the work environment seems like a place that I would really enjoy. Some of the analytical tests they mentioned, I've never even heard of and I am dying to get my hands dirty learning about how they work. I really would love to have this job instead but I haven't been guarenteed the position yet since my second round of interviews is on Wednesday.

I have to let the first offer know my decision by TOMORROW MORNING!!! I don't know what to do! I really don't want to commit yet when I feel like there's something better out there, but at the end of the day, I just need a job. I have debt from school and I need to get working ASAP. The laundry lab tech is somewhat relevant to my future, AND i actually ***have*** the job. so what do I do? the other one suits my working style better, seems like a more engaging environment, and sounds really interesting to me. but I don't have an offer yet. I'm not sure if I should walk away from something I have for something that might be way better. Please help me out!

**TLDR: I got an offer for a position that's somewhat relevant to my future but the job seems really boring to me; I have to let them know my decision in 24 hrs. I have a second-round interview on Wednesday for something that seems really interesting but isn't relevant to my future at all. It also pays better.

1k4i5lp,"Which skills are employers most desparate for, but juniors often lack? 2025 version","To me, it feels like in the current economy and job market, junior developers are practically not hireable at all. I'm trying to understand why.

What is it that modern employers are looking for that juniors often cannot provide — even in theory?

Would it be correct to say, that the current expectation is that a junior would be able to build an app - from start to finish? 

I’m not a junior developer myself. However, I’m currently taking some classes for my master's, and I've noticed a lot of students around me are struggling to find jobs — and to be fair, many are struggling even to build decent projects.

I wish I could help, but honestly, I don't see a clear or easy piece of advice to give.

1k4hzln,"The company I work for is a “family” style company, lots of people are “friends” and hang out at the weekend.  How do I avoid sharing personal information without coming across as anti-social.","I have worked for this company for 3 years now. It is a good company with a good group of people, but the flaw is that everyone knows each other on a personal basis and spends time after work together. I don’t want to get involved with that as I have a personal life and don’t want to be the source of untrue rumors and politics. This company is particularly bad for negative rumors, drama and hits on your negative reputation.

There’s been a several occasions where colleagues have been hanging out together and one of them has gotten into serious trouble with management. Rumours spread rapidly even if you didn’t start them. 

I’ve also had false negative rumours spread about myself before by someone that didn’t like me a couple of years ago. 

Often the company has events such as trade shows where you’re effectively forced to have dinner with colleagues (I’m not saying this is a bad thing) and attend social events. 

There’s a blur between personal life and work. At one of these events a colleague I don’t know well asked if I have a girlfriend, I said yes, they then said “why haven’t you shared this with us, that’s kind of weird” like there is some obligation to share it. I don’t think this is a bad thing in this case as it just didn’t come up in conversation before, but it did get me thinking. 

When I am at work I will chat about work and other topics such as small details, what I did at the weekend etc, i.e. I watched this movie and went here but never really explain any detail about my personal life and social life. 

I want to come across as social, and not be seen as someone that’s unapproachable without discussing my life details. What’s the best strategy to do this. Similarly if I get invited to a work social event how do you decline without coming across as unapproachable.

1k4fksc,"Should I lean into my career or index for family? (F/39, ex-FAANG, trying for baby)","Hi all — looking for some perspective from folks who’ve wrestled with this crossroads.

I’m 39F, with 10+ years in industry and a CS degree. I spent 7 years at a FAANG, left making around $260k (including stock), and took a fully remote role last year for $193k. The new job is extremely flexible, comes with generous vacation, and I genuinely like it — it’s easy, low stress, and while I am learning, it’s nowhere near the fast pace or upskilling I had at FAANG.

My partner and I are currently trying for a baby (yes, I know I’m on the later side, that’s a separate post). The truth is, this new role has been a gift while trying to build a family — but I can’t shake the voice in my head that says I’m letting long-term earning potential slip through my fingers.

I’ve already been contacted by two FAANGs since leaving, and I’m confident I could land a role at $250k+ again — possibly $500k+ down the line if I re-accelerate my career. If I stay where I am, I’m likely capped around $200k for the rest of my career. That could easily be a lost million+ by retirement.

On the flip side… kids are only little once. And the flexibility and low stress of my current job would make parenting so much more manageable in these early years. But I can’t help wondering if I’m being shortsighted.

Extra context: I grew up poor, paid for all of my schooling, and currently send $1k/month to support my widowed mother. I won’t be getting an inheritance, and I’m behind where I’d like to be financially because I took time to pay off substantial student loans — and, okay, did some travel too.

So I guess I’m asking:
For those of you who prioritized family over career, do you regret it financially or otherwise?
And for those who leaned hard into career — did you feel like you missed out on something at home?

I know there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but I’d really love to hear from people who’ve been on either side of this choice.",Abused_Tourist1,0,0.5,6,1745247432,2025-04-21 14:57:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4fksc/should_i_lean_into_my_career_or_index_for_family/,4,2025

I am currently 30/M from the UK. I am currently self-employed running my own business within the construction industry. My current yearly salary is around 35-38K.  
  
I have been contemplating quitting my business and entering a new career to become employed full time due to the work/life balance, long hours and stress. But the average annual salary in the UK for most jobs now is around 25-28k…  
  
I have considered going to university through online learning or ‘distance learning’ to achieve a degree with the thought being it would provide more opportunities and lead to a better salary and career path. But when I checked the annual salary its almost the same…around 30K or slightly more if you have the experience.

1k4ekxj,Need a change from Human Services ..,"Hello community. Looking for some advice here on how to make a career change once I move out of state in August.  I’ve been wanting to branch out of my chosen career and expand upon it - find something I can actually have a long career with that provide me financial security.

I’ve worked in human services since finishing my undergrad in ‘22. Started out as a housing navigator for homeless individuals for about 7 months, switched to direct care staff at a shelter after that. I liked the flexibility of it and working in a shelter was interesting for me. I then picked up a part time job as an activities assistant at a nursing home for about 1 year, until management changes really started to make that place unbearable. Also having been working on the Alzheimer’s wing, it took a toll on me mentally to see all of those residents decline and pass away. So I quit that job, continued with working at an individual shelter and then 2 years ago got switched to a family shelter working with the Haitian and Venezuelan immigrants. Being fluent in Spanish, I was one of a few staff members that could communicate with clients to assist with their needs. Been there ever since and am looking for a change. I feel unfulfilled and want something more, that could also provide me with better pay for my future.

Ive never really been interested in social work. I had originally wanted to graduate in criminal justice to be an officer, my school had a 4+1 program, but the climate of policing at the time of me really changed my opinion on doing that. So I graduated with a human services major and minor in CJ. I have always stayed having interests in the legal/law enforcement  field,  but don’t know what I can apply for with my experience. I’m looking for entry level jobs to get me in the door so I can gain experience.

Any advice on how to take next steps? Or what job would suit my experiences? Would I need a masters/certifications?",Accomplished_Hour350,2,1.0,1,1745244916,2025-04-21 14:15:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k4ekxj/need_a_change_from_human_services/,4,2025
1k4ehpt,Need help changing career paths.,"Hey all. Currently and for the last 10 years, I've been working as a cook for corporate dining and most recently for a nursing home. I live in North Carolina and grabbed the first job I could find even though I'm fairly overqualified. The work itself is easy but I find myself having more bad days than good days lately, especially because of coworkers and admin/nursing staff. 

For a few years I've been fairly tired of food service anyway, but this job feels like the straw that broke the camel's back. Unfortunately I don't have any college education or developed skills to fall back on. 

With my current career path, I've been customer facing quite a bit, so I have customer service experience. I've looked into adjacent things such as working for a food distribution company or as a health inspector, but either there aren't jobs here or there are major schooling requirements (like a science degree for the health inspector) that I don't have. 

I'm currently 33 and own a home with my husband, so we aren't looking to uproot our lives and move elsewhere. I'd like to find a job that potentially will pay more but be a little less stressful. I cherish my time off as I am also the homemaker so anything that could afford me weekends and hopefully nights would be cool. I really don't mind changing industries altogether either. I don't mind getting certification of some sort but I DONT want to take on more major debt because of the house. I just need some guidance to what is the best fit for me.


My resume is as follows: 10 years cooking (catering, baking, salad bar, creating full meals, I've done it all), 5 years event staff, and about 2 years customer service (supermarket- personal shopper).

1k4ehct,"What do you think you've done right, and you could have done better","Let me start -
Done right 
1. Communication and updating.  I believe it is already too late if my boss asks me for updates, so I always try to update them periodically or necessary, before they asks.  And make sure no surprises to them.
2. Never go in with only questions.  No matter how clueless I am, I always do some research and present my thoughts and proposals with the questions.  I believe it demonstrates attitude and abilities as well.
3. Never complain just for the sake of complaining.  Be positive.  Well, I learned this from a very negative former coworker, who always complains.  I noticed everybody disliked her.  One of my other coworkers commented about her if you are useless at least be fun.  Another said she didn't realize she chose to be part of the problem not the solution.
4. Never afraid of challenges. I enjoy taking on things that seem new and challenging.  

Could've done better 
1. Networking.  I am not too bad but not trying enough either.  I sometimes find keeping in touch with people I haven't run into for a while a little awkward.  What should I say? Will my reaching out a waste of their time?  Especially with people in the higher positions.

1k4edzq,Should I take on more work after being passed up from promotion,"I work for a large corporation as a senior social media specialist. I have worked there for about 3 years. Prior to that I was working in social at another large company and then before then I worked at a marketing agency. I have been in digital marketing for about 10 years. 

Our marketing manager resigned about a year ago and I have been doing some stretch marketing projects in their absence. I’ve been taking on more and more marketing assignments but a lot of my day to day is still in social media. 

We got the green light to backfill the marketing manager role so I applied. This would be a skip level promotion for me and there are no direct reports. While most of my career has been in the social media space, I do have a marketing degree,m and background from my time at an agency as well as obviously the stretch marketing projects I’ve been working on. I always receive great annual review feedback. 

A couple weeks ago they told me that I didn’t get the promotion because the two they were moving forward with had “a lot of marketing experience”, but said they value me and want to give me the opportunity to grow. They gave me a list of projects that I can work on for “development”. All of them would fall under marketing projects/tasks etc. I was gracious. Thanked them for the opportunity and said I would be happy to take on these additional projects. I assumed whoever they hired would have loads of marketing experience but I recently learned that the person they hired worked in a completely different field for a very long time, went back to school in 2021 and got a marketing degree and has since been mostly in “specialist” roles (email specialist) and has 1 year of “marketing manager” under her belt. Once I found that out I was pretty defeated. I could understand if I felt like this person was more qualified than me, but it doesn’t really feel that way. Now the more work I’ve been asked to do feels moot. 

I’m not sure how to handle this. Should I just continue to take on more responsibilities with the hopes of being promoted soon? Should I push back on these “development” opportunities. I’m feeling bummed and honestly my morale is low so just looking for suggestions or am I totally in the wrong here?

This is actually my first job, and I accepted the offer with a minimum wage salary of PHP 645 per day since I haven’t officially graduated yet.

I interned at the same company, and when my internship ended, they offered me the job.

My background is in IT, says admin, help desk. 
In December a recruited contacted me about a role as an adult instructor for military students for some technology courses. The next day I was interviewed by the PM and the interview was very technical. There were technologies for LMS stuff I was not familiar with. I was also asked about my experience with Sharepoint. I was very transparent stating that I didn’t know anything about the LMS and had very limited Sharepoint experience beyond user level. I asked why so technical for an instructor role? I was told this is for a system analyst role, not instructor. 
I got an offer letter for a sys analyst. Then a new offer letter adding knowledge management.  When I showed up it was clear the role is KM more than anything else, not my background. 
I have tried to accomplish some things here, but have not gotten a single thing done. Mostly because the network is administrated at such a high level and there are no permissions to automate anything. I have put tickets in the enterprise, told do everything manually. 
I have not gotten guidance from my bosses on anything. From what I understand there has not been a KM is twenty years here. The one thing I found could be done I did, and was told that the client hadn’t authorized it. I undid it. Now we are waiting on multiple meetings to see about approval.
The salary is good and I would like to figure this out and grow into it. I just don’t think it’s happening. I think they will fire me.

1k4ccqe,"Should I leave the creative industry? If so, where to next?","I (23F) have been working freelance and more recently full-time as a designer (Social Media, Graphic, Spatial, UX and etc). I understand that positioning myself as a generalist was my fatal mistake. 

I’ve never felt proud of any of my accomplishments because they were essentially useless. Jobs want to hire creatives with 3-5 years in a specific niche at entry-level so it doesn’t matter how good my portfolio looks if it’s scattered across niches.

I finally got a job that didn’t reject me for being a generalist but made use of it. Now I take photos, write copy, media plan, film content, design, prop shop, DI and do whatever they ask me at their beck and call but my KPI is still tagged to a project unrelated to my daily duties. Basically I feel like I’m staying a generalist and there’s simply no way out. I’m not paid much either which bothers me everyday.

I live in a really fast-paced conservative society (in Asia), the workload is immense and I’m not the fastest worker or learner. In my country, being fast is the priority.

I know I could excel if I had the time but that’s just not a realistic demand to have knowing my own slowness. 

Should I quit the industry? Any ideas what might suit my slow pace but makes use of some transferable skills I may have?

1k4c6xm,Return to old role 2 years later?,"In 2023 I took a VP role at a smaller public sector organization after being a Manager at a larger public sector organization (both administration in healthcare in Canada). At the time it was a $38k jump and the expanded responsibilities seemed like a great opportunity. The last two years have had ups and downs, felt like I made the wrong move. I’m 35 so still have at least 20 years left (if I can stick with public sector for a full DB pension). 

My previous manager recently reached out to say that my previous role will be open and posted soon. The rate of pay has changed significantly so now the take home is only $3,500 less annually than my current role. The old employer has more benefits, more resources, bigger teams, potential growth, more remote work potential. My current role rate of pay isn’t expected to rise significantly, so potential advancement at old employer would be more lucrative. 

I’m constantly frustrated in my current role and find it significantly more stressful (now for no real financial gain). I don’t see any potential for change in my current role (funding environment, size of organization, etc.) Is the step backwards a huge red flag for future opportunities? Is now the time to make a jump outside the public sector? Pay was the main reason for leaving initially and that factor has been essentially wiped out…so that has got me wondering. Thoughts??

I have ambitious goals, and I work hard toward them. I even achieve many of them. But at the back of my mind, I keep wondering—what's the point of all this wealth? What's the point of doing anything at all? Even if I buy a Lamborghini, what’s the use of it? I would still feel alone and unloved.

For me, true happiness—the real meaning of life—is finding true love. A girl I could love for life, and who would love me back. That’s all I really want. If someone asked me to choose between a million dollars and a girl who would truly love me, I would choose the girl.

Because of this mindset, I’m struggling to work hard. My brain has started believing that no amount of money can make me happy—that only love can. And now, my mind is constantly focused on chasing love instead of chasing success. I don’t want to think like this.

Looking at my current reality, I know I need to focus on building wealth and achieving my goals. Even if it feels lonely sometimes, I need to set aside those feelings and just do what’s right.

1k46wpg,Career Advice Needed! (Civil Engineering),"Hello to whoever is reading this!

I'm looking for some advice on how relocating—specifically to a different country—might affect my career in civil engineering (I am in geotechnical engineering specifically).

A bit of background: I'm Canadian and graduated in 2023 with a BASc in Civil Engineering from a Canadian university. I also recently completed my Master’s in Civil Engineering at an American university and am currently working at a well-established firm in Canada as I work toward obtaining my PEng designation.

Recently, I married someone from a different nationality, and we're planning a temporary move to East Asia to be closer to her family.

Our plan is to return to Canada in our early to mid-thirties (roughly 5–8 years from now). However, I’m concerned about how this international move might impact my long-term career. I know that Canadian companies tend to place a strong emphasis on Canadian work experience, so I’m wondering:

1k46q7e,Joining coast guard???,"Hi reddit! 

I'm currently 19 years old female and have 1 more year left in my associates degree for business, but I lowkey feel bored af with it and am having trouble seeing myself in business etc. I've always loved ocean and all things boats etc and have grown up tuna, deep sea fishing, crabbing and sailing on the ocean and have spent a lot of time on the water, on and around boats. I'm a super active person and outdoorsy person and I really enjoy doing new things and adventures.

I'm thinking about joining the coast guard, but I have a few concerns: 
- I want to finish my bachelor's in business. (Even if I never end up using it in life I want to have it as an option.) 

- I don't want to never get to see my family (I am really close with my family)

- I dont want to be working a grunt job like scrubbing floors, scraping paint etc.

- I want to be working on a boat. (Preferably smaller, like navigating or working law enforcement or driving or something like that.) 

- Is it a safe thing for a 20 year old girl to make or should I wait until I'm a bit older? 

My dads a navy vet and I have the ability to get my bachelor's for basically free already, i just feel really bored with where my life is at now and honestly just want to be near the ocean and have some adventure and excitment. But first and formost I want to he smart and make the best choices for myself anf my future. I don't need to enlist now financially or situationally. I have a good job and a great home situation. I just feel like theres something more out there for me.

Should I finish my bachelor's while serving or should I finish it out then join. If it's realistic to finish my bachelor's while serving, while enlisted how do I make sure I am doing the job I want to be doing, and am not doing a stupid job?

1k46chy,Miserable job,"Don’t usually post here but started a new job about a month ago after being unemployed for 4 months. When I got home from the first day of the job I knew that I didn’t like it but I stuck around because I wanted to make some money. After being there for about a month now 3 people have just recently quit in the last week and they’ve also warned me about the high employee turnover. 


The thing is I’m very miserable at that job and dread going in all the time. It makes my entire life miserable and since 3 people have left recently and it’s a super small team (only about 5 workers 2 managers included) I have been given only closing shifts for the next two weeks. I don’t mind closing on some days but for two weeks straight it’s a lot especially since it takes up your entire day (the shifts are 11:30am-8:30pm). 

Is it worth staying if I’m super miserable and it is taking can potentially take a toll on my mental health? I feel as if I quit tomorrow I will have a weight lifted off my shoulder and it feels like I’ll be free. 

Any advice or opinions are welcome but please be respectful. Thanks in advance

1k45hdr,Help Interpreting Home THC Tests Please,"

Have an upcoming test and am getting some weird results on my THC tests this weekend that aren’t covered anywhere in the directions (read multiple times). Could really use some input. TYVM for your time.

========

Note: Strong control lines showed up in every ‘level’ window on all three tests I took.

========

Test Brand #1

Friday

300 Level line present (approx half as strong as control line)
200 Level line present (approx half as strong as control line)
100 Level line NOT present
50 Level line present (very faint, and just half)
20 Level line NOT present

Sunday

300 Level line present (approx half as strong as control line)
200 Level line present (approx half as strong as control line)
100 Level line NOT present
50 Level line present (very faint)
20 Level line present (very faint)

Test Brand #2

Friday

300 Level line present (approx half as strong as control line)
200 Level line present (approx half as strong as control line)
100 Level line NOT present
50 Level line present (very faint, and just half)
15 Level line NOT present

========

IE Friday tests show basically the same results, and the test I took today/Sunday has an additional negative line at the very lowest level (20 vs 15 on that brand).

And all three are entirely missing the 100 level Y/N line. 

So. I have no idea how to read these results.

Any thoughts on whether that missing 100 line on all 3 tests—and the 50 half lines on Friday—mean the tests are confused bc my level is higher than 300? Or…?

I take 20mg gummies every night for sleep, and sometimes use more on a weekend night (which unfortunately was just lately). 

So. I am trying to get at least below 300 (use is doctor approved but I’m hoping my levels aren’t completely off the charts, as some is apparently fine, but not too much).

1k45gs7,Feeling struck in my job search,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been feeling really stuck and frustrated, and I just need to vent a little. I graduated in 2023 from a well-known university, and I thought that would be the start of something good, but here I am—almost two and a half years later—and I still can’t land a job.

I’ve been putting in so much effort—updating my resume, applying to countless positions, and trying to make my applications stand out. But no matter how much I try, I’m still met with silence. It feels like everything I’ve worked for during my education has led to this never-ending cycle of rejection, or worse—just being completely ignored.

It’s hard not to question everything when you’ve done all the “right” things. I chose a good college, worked hard, and tried to position myself well for the job market, but nothing seems to be paying off. It’s honestly exhausting at this point—feeling like I’m stuck, putting in effort with no visible results. Every day I try again, hoping for something different, but it feels like I’m just running in circles.

I’m at a point where I’m questioning the value of all the time and energy I’ve invested into my education. If this is what it leads to—endless applications and no opportunities—was it all worth it?

Thanks for reading.

1k45ek2,Should I join the military or stay civilian,"I’m currently earning $80k and I previously made around $30K through-out college. I was graduated with an internship and later got laid applied for jobs for a couple months and heard nothing back at that time, so I was planning to join the military (Guard or Reserves) mainly to get a security clearance, access the VA loan, and get help paying for school.

But I was able to land a couple of interviews and After getting this higher-paying job, I put the enlistment process on hold. Now, I’ve picked up a part-time security job that’s actually sponsoring me for a Secret clearance, and I believe I’ll eventually be able to get a TS without needing to go the military route.

This has left me unsure if I should still join the Guard or Reserves at all.

Originally, I was aiming for a cyber MOS/AFSC so I could get clearance and experience in tech. But now that I’m getting the clearance independently, I’m wondering if cyber is still the right path — or if I should go after a different job in the military that exposes me to a field less likely to be affected by AI and automation, and that’s also transferable to civilian life.

Also, here’s something I’m wrestling with:
	•	Once I get my Secret clearance, would it be smarter to stay at my current job, join the Guard, and then start applying for higher-paying cleared roles?
	•	Or would it make more sense to land a better-paying role using my clearance first, and then join the Guard/Reserve afterward?

Any advice on the best move long-term — especially around career growth, stability, and flexibility — would be really appreciated.",Rb6795,4,0.8299999833106995,13,1745210940,2025-04-21 04:49:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k45ek2/should_i_join_the_military_or_stay_civilian/,4,2025
1k455lu,Torn between starting a new job locally or moving interstate to help with family business,"Hi everyone, I could use some advice from people who have faced similar crossroads.

I’m about to start a new role as an Assistant Commercial Property Manager next week — I’ve been working hard to break into the property industry here, and I love my life where I am right now. But over the weekend, I got a distressing call from my family, who are based in another state. They’re working on a childcare development project and have asked me to come over and help manage it, as it ties into my long-term interest in development project management.

Now I’m stuck:

* On one hand, the local role I’ve secured is steady and a great foot in the door for property management, which was my initial focus.
* On the other hand, the interstate project is family-based, short-term (though no fixed end date yet), and closely aligned with my dream of moving toward development project management roles.

I’ve thought about proposing a cycle like 3 months with my family, 2 months back to the state I am in so I can help my family while still keeping my life here, but I’m unsure if walking away from this first job before it even starts would hurt any future opportunities that I may have. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation — juggling family obligations and early career choices?  
Would moving interstate temporarily be worth it, or should I stick with the local role and focus on long-term stability here?

Any advice would be hugely appreciated!

1k44td7,Next Move,"Good evening, everyone. I’m looking for some advice on how to move forward in my career.

I’ve worked in Information Technology for over 20 years, holding roles from Service Desk to Lead Technician to IT Manager. Currently, I’m in a Senior Service Desk role at a company I’ve been with for over seven years.

Earlier in 2024, I asked leadership about pathways into a lead or supervisory role, positions I’ve held before and genuinely enjoy. I was advised to complete some internal e-learning modules, which I did. However, after a recent reorganization in April of 2024 that placed me under a new supervisor, all conversations about advancement stopped. More recently, I learned that our CIO has a strong preference for on-site leadership, which is an issue as I work fully remote.

For context, I have a BS in IT with a concentration in IT management and am currently pursuing a Master’s in IT with a concentration in Enterprise Technology Management. My long-term goal is to earn a doctorate in the field.

Here’s where I’m torn: I’m considering shifting my Master’s focus to Cybersecurity to develop a new skill set and possibly transition away from the Service Desk track. I understand that breaking into Cyber can be difficult without direct experience, but I have a solid grasp of core principles and a strong foundation in IT.

Given this background, would pivoting toward Cybersecurity be a smart move for long-term growth? Or would it be better to stay the course and try to break the on-site leadership ceiling another way? I’d appreciate any insights or recommendations.

1k4368g,Does anyone know what job or career path would be good for me?,"So I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible, I’ll just give an overall rundown of my journey so far lol. In high school I was very good at english and essay writing as well as dance, and had a love and passion for both. I was also very good at math and physics though and knew this would probably be the smarter route to take, so I went to college for engineering.

Before college I took a gap year just to reset. I have always been extremely spiritual and so I ended up taking that year to study and research it, and wrote all kinds of little personal articles and paragraphs about realizations I had (like research papers basically about the topic of spirituality) but just for fun. I also traveled with my mom a lot, and honestly it overall ended up being the happiest I’d been in my entire life. But I wasn’t working so I knew that lifestyle wasn’t something I could just continue.

I ended up going to college as well as started flight lessons, soon before college though I ended up developing OCD. It wasn’t bad at first but got worse and worse over time to the point where it was debilitating, and I ended up having to drop out of college (which was a shame because I was halfway through an aerospace engineering degree with a 4.0) and having to quit flight lessons.

When I dropped out however I was doing an internship and they actually ended up hiring me in the Engineering Department as a permanent employee when they found out my schedule would be open. I did that for about a year until I recently quit. There were just issues with paychecks being shorted and new management not being the best, and it was definitely the right decision for me.

I’m now at a point where I don’t know what I want to do now. I’ve definitely always been extremely neurodivergent and the typical 9 to 5 is something I know I could never be happy doing. I could do it if I had to though. I only have two classes left to finish a certificate in engineering and am already part way through a private pilot license so I might finish those up just so my previous effort didn’t go to waste. I don’t know what to do after that though. 

I want to do something that would truly make me happy but is also smart. I would love doing something healing, like working with rescue animals or people who need help (I’ve done both and love that). I would also love something to do with english or writing or research. Or dance or public speaking (I am an extremely good at speech writing and public speaking and as nerdy as it may sound have completed in speech competitions before lol).

I just want to be free. I love the stars and the moon and the ocean and the Universe and God, that is what truly truly speaks to me and I beyond love. I love researching and writing analytical papers especially on spiritual stuff. Like my favorite thing ever is sitting in the backyard in the middle of the night just staring and the stars and moon and listening to God speak. I don’t know I am a very very very feeling and emotional person. I’ve been in a mental funk lately and just need to find a lifestyle that allows me to be free and okay. I dream about being able to travel. I just want to experience everything and see every country and every state. I don’t know I just can’t figure out what to do. I’m scared of the future and need to find a way to be free and career that will allow that. I’m sorry this was long and probably sounded so crazy, but any advice would be appreciated.

Please no snark about this being a dumb decision - I am feeling very down on myself because I thought I had fully vetted this new opportunity, but ended up being miserable and couldn’t take it anymore.

While this reddit is obviously themed around work and careers, it's apparent that lots of people are dealing with issues regarding their values, purpose, and motivation, and are mentioning career related challenges as just one part of their struggles. If I'm describing you:

This offer is for 3 free remote coaching sessions, each one lasting roughly 50 minutes and free of costs or strings attached. That length aims to provide enough time and structure for you to walk away with tangible insights or strategies within the free offer, rather than worrying that you’ll just receive a long consultation that sets you up to pay before gaining any real value.

This is being extended to adults only and will be considered based on the compatibility of your concerns and my areas of expertise. With that said, I encourage you to reach out and not overthink if you'd be asking for guidance for the 'wrong' thing.

And that paper is now pulished in a popular org and they r getting credit for that.my name is in the preface as I helped us in designing ui/ux types things.
Recently month ago, there was end of session and every department was organising fest.in my uni but no one from my dpmt was coming forward, so i saw a chance me n one guy of.my class went to HoD and seek for their permission first they declined to give us permission but after that I created presentation a budget analysis complete blueprint full proof list of guest artist every thing i had connections for sponsor other related thing so technically me n.my friend were Organizer coz we took charge.
The department faculty were afraid that management of uni whether approve this or not but they saw potential in our presentation and our point we went to dean n he allowed us after severral things (long story short)
The person with me well i think this is not how i think but he cut me off took charge of everything making it seem like this whole was his idea and leading the fest i let it go and when. Confrontation came he said I am into my personal life.more and I am not taking fest seriously. He also got some shit on me about a thing which he tried to blackmail me but relax i Confronted it and stood strong and I said i am leaving and I made him taste his own shit btw.
Bit the fest. Was hosted everyone got.credut. yesterday was certificate distribution i don't even got volunteer one. Yeah it was whole my idea but i left it in mid.
Idk what should I think how should I........

Idk what to say now.....
There are many incident like that in small business i tried to go. So thats why i think i don't ask for something i really want from persons, even if there are bund pf individuals and i wnat to ask something i hesitate a lot i am not affirmative and confident for this ik i got potential even though i not got success in any of my previous works but still I feel it. But also i am insecure  about my appearance less BMI 5'5 height 19 yo so these r might be reasons i have tried to change but not possible for me..

1k3zn6b,"Lawyer who moved to a government job and it SUCKS, what do I do?","About two months ago, I accepted a position at a prosecutor's office after working in private practice for around eight years. I made a strategic decision and took a pretty big pay cut for work-life balance and a more positive work environment. The job came at the recommendation of a trusted mentor and another person who worked at the office. It's turned out terribly so far for a variety of reasons:

- My assigned paralegal does not do her job and is AWOL for significant chunks of time. No hate to her, she's a nice person. But she just disappears. My boss won't reassign me, and she's teflon when it comes to getting fired/disciplined--I am told by a colleague this has been a problem in the past. I've tried to talk to her about the issue (keeping in mind that I'm new and she isn't) and she's not receptive. She blows internal deadlines weekly. 

- I'm required to use a state-issued laptop. My laptop is, to put it lightly, a piece of shit. Like, the keys are falling off and my cursor only works half the time. I've been told I'm getting a new one, but no matter how many times I ask, it hasn't happened yet. It significantly impacts my ability to get work done. 

- For lack of a better term, I'm being bullied. My coworkers and bosses play ""pranks"" on me. Everyone was told they could leave the office early for Good Friday but me. I got called into the boss's office for a fake complaint against me. Coworkers have deliberately given me advice that would get me called into the boss's office for violating unwritten rules that I have not been told about. Socially, I'm not included in happy hours, lunches, etc. despite repeated efforts to make connections on my part. This has never been an issue for me before. I'm a big girl and can handle it, but it still sucks. 

- As an extension of the bullying, when I have questions or need guidance, it's not available to any useful extent. I can't tell when the advice is genuine and still don't know who to trust.

I'm micromanaged. Somehow, I work more hours than I did in private practice, because of my inefficient computer and time spent cleaning up my paralegal's mess. It also turns out that I'm terribly underpaid. Someone that started six months before me with less relevant experience makes 15k more than I do. 

I'm trying to make the best of it and advocate for myself, but to be quite honest, I'm at a loss. 
The last thing I want to do is leave a job after such short time, but this is an actively terrible place to work. The door at my old firm is wide open, but I left because it's shutting down in the next three years. 

Any ideas on what to do? I'm half inclined to just say ""fuck y'all, I quit"" and take a few months off, but that's not a productive thing at all. I can't really go to my aforementioned mentor or colleague because they are both close friends with my boss.

1k3ybkq,Does it Sound Like Grad School Would Help Me?,"I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this.

I've been working for my current employer a bit over 7 years.  While I have gained some good experience in that time, I can't help feel like I've got rather stuck in this one little field.  The pay is decent and the people are nice, but I would like to opportunity to branch out and either go onto more challenging things in my field or go into related fields.  It also could very well pay quite a bit more from what I have seen.

I've found a couple of great masters programs in engineering.  And I think I would not only be accepted to them, but also get full funding based on the conversations I have had with the various people in charge of them.  The work would be challenging, interesting, and I've heard great things about them from several people who have gone through them.

However, I have two fears that are keeping me from pulling the trigger:

1.  Time between undergrad and graduate.  Do hiring managers frown upon a nearly 10 year period between them?  I'm afraid that they will see me as directionless for not going right away or feel that they won't be able to get enough out of me to justify hiring.

2.  Ability to spin experience.  As mentioned above the work I have been doing is related to what I want to do.  However, it may not be directly applicable.  I think I could spin it as being similar enough, with the master's giving me the skills to essentially cover for shortcomings in terms of my work experience.  But I worry that they will see the experience as not relevant.",New_Engineer94,1,1.0,5,1745188262,2025-04-20 22:31:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k3ybkq/does_it_sound_like_grad_school_would_help_me/,4,2025

1k3w6pf,Switch jobs now or wait until I have masters?,"So I graduated with my Bachelors in August 2024 (Mechanical Engineering), and started working full time in January 2025 as a Quality Engineer at a big defense company. I previously interned there for about 1.5 yrs. I was planning on waiting until I finished my masters to start full time, but they kept pressuring me to start full time and I eventually caved and now I really dislike my job.

I've been applying to other jobs (honestly just a way for me to vent lol), and now I'm being offered a job as a structural engineer at a much smaller defense company. I never really thought I would get this far, and now I don't know what to do. Pay, benefits, PTO, etc is basically a wash. 

The job seems very interesting, but I REALLY wanna relocate after I graduate with my masters in December and my absolute dream is to work in the Space industry. If I take the job now, I'd likely be postponing that a few years as I wouldn't want to have short stints at my first two jobs. And I know the ""it's never too late to chase your dreams"" thing, but the jobs I want in the space industry are very demanding and I would rather do it while I'm young, have few responsibilities, no family, etc.

So do I:


a) Take the new job now that would be much more interesting. But put off moving and working in my dream industry a few years. And I will mention I really like the team I interviewed with and I would feel really bad if I knew going into it knowing I don't plan on staying there long term. They were all such nice & down to earth people. I know you all will say you gotta do what's best for yourself, but that won't change how I feel about this.

b) Wait till I graduate this December, and then look for other jobs. I've been given a research opportunity this summer that will get me similar (just not to the extent) experience to what the job I'm being offered would give me. And my current job is extremely low stress and has a generous schedule which makes taking classes easier. But this is all banking on being able to find a new job beginning of next year. And I wouldn't be burning a bridge with probably the biggest employer in my field.


Currently leaning towards staying where I'm at and trying to make the most of it and my research over the summer to give myself the best chance possible to get a job in thr space industry after I graduate.

So the question is, Option A: College and degree as I work part time and save up maybe 200$ a month or Option B: Walmart Manager and save 150k over 6 years and make roughly 70k average salary by the time im 25 let's assume, (Coule potentiolly be more or less) with possibility of 6 figures.

1k3srjx,Looking to leave a job a little earlier to pursue a different career. Would it hurt me in the future or is it worth doing?,"I've been working at an office for 8 months. Realizing that this career is not for me, I put my two weeks in so I can pursue a higher education and switch career paths. It was what I wanted to do long term, but I wanted to try and work for a while and test out the field beforehand. My current job is not enjoyable, the pay is incredibly low, and it is incredibly unorganized which would lead to weekly issues in the workplace.

After I put my two weeks in, the company president brought me into his office and rambled for 20 min in a very unprofessional meeting, saying that I was wrong making this decision, jobs look at tenure (which is true but I feel like if I explain my situation to them they'd at least have an understanding), and that I'm good at what I do even though I'm considered as an afterthought instead of an asset. 

The whole meeting was just him using his emotions instead of it on a professional level, it was insulting the way it was handled, which solidified my decision.

I have one more major project this week and then that's the last of my contributions. I want to leave a day or two earlier than my posted last day but I genuinely don't think I will gain anything staying during those two days. I don't plan on using this company as a reference just by how toxic it was and it turned me into a miserable individual while working here. Would it be wrong for me to do this?

1k3rees,Best career advice you ever got?,"I was in a 1-2-1 a few weeks back and it was relevant to that discussion to bring up some of the best advice I have been given over the years. For background I have worked just shy of 20 years mostly withing FP&A but also some other roles. So here goes - my all time top 3 peices of advice received;

**1) No matter how tough, or even impossible, the situation if you have truly done your best that's all you can do.** This is something the young me desperately needed to hear when things started going south and I could not fix everything that went wrong.

**2) Don't focus on others, only focus on if your own contribution is valuable and if you feel that you are making a difference.** I would reguralarly get stuck in negative thoughts of others not doing enough when I was working my ass off. This is for obvious reasons not helpful for anybody.

**3) It's just a damn job.** I very specifically remember feeling so focused on all the problems at work and a friend of mine said this to me. It was like an awakaning - you are right! My CV is strong, I could get a new job in a couple of weeks... why am I obsessing over this?

Hi, Let's start from starting cuz idk if it has any context but yea. I was decent in studies from the start, in school no tutions till 9th, Took maths from 10th, didn't like to do maths that much but still managed decent.

11th came, Told my dad He should admit me in a non school and I should prepare for JEE (heard jee is the staple after 12th), he denied and said study after coming from school but I didn't follow that. 

Did my 12th, prepared little for JEE, and obviously didn't get any good one. Got into an IPU college in ECE, did t want to be lazy this time but Covid happened, 2 years straight up in home chilling. 

College reopens (I don't know what linkedin is and don't have insta and stuff cuz I was stupid ig, so just lurked in discord gaming servers.) and me being introvert didn't approach most people other than my friend group.
Also, I put some effort in studies  cuz people said cgpa should be high for placements, did a decent job maintained CGPA.

(Didn't know about internships (I know but I'm not living under a rock pls understand me), it's like 5th sem.)
But in 6th sem, We find an internship in IoT. (Btw no internship company came in college).

Did it for 6 months, liked the software part when coding,
asked my instructor if I could do a course in only coding IoT? (He said no u need hardware too, so Interest diminished). So, took a Coding Ninjas course of web dev with friends, did some development casually, feeling good, (still don't wanna do DSA or leaving it for later), 
People saying company will come easy placements, we happy.

Studied decently got 9.19 cgpa, (knowing some development and a Lil react.js and node.js)
Thinking companies will come, It came:

1st: BSES: I thought I wanna do web dev an not core electronics. So didn't sit.

2nd: Airtel: Sat, but nope.

3rd: Indigo: Came for inventory management, so said no.

That's it, 3 companies came on campus physically.
(More came like Capgemini but u know).

Now, it's end sem. In July, had farewell, the placement cell saying companies will come.

(I didn't had contact with seniors much and did some frontend thinking I want this and this will be my thing and would like this).

In Sept. Did an online intern in frontend for 3 months, easy tasks, done. 

Now, got addicted to reels, cuz installed insta now,
Focus span got low, didn't touch coding anything from December till April. 

Now, exploring job market and everyone demands DSA and no basic development. I'm feeling low. Don't feel like coding. Fearing DSA. I tried to do it but even for loops are feeling unfamiliar. Feel like frontend not suitable, electronics not suitable and wtf is suitable for me ?

One friend in BSES, one friend has business, one got referral directly into a flutter job, and one is interested in development and has been coding ig so he got an intern.

I'm feeling I am alone, feeling I got no skills, one friend (he a data analyst) says I should do data analyst in like 4 months and try for job. 

Idk if imma be able to do that, I'm feeling feeling a fear from maths, coding and stuff. Also the gap is just increasing in resume. I don't want that to happen. 

I wanna find my passion or interest, I think I should give DSA and development a try, but gap is increasing I want a Job now and want to upskill on the side. I want maybe G.E.T where I can get trained and then do my thing at home and switch sometime, but G.E.T roles usually come in campus. 

Please help me guys, suggest something what should I do I do like content and trends and n stuff but got no metrics or account to show for it even if I hope.into a marketing role. 

Please help me:
1. Get a something even with bonds I just wanna learn and upskill (Any job though I'm even trying support or operation roles).

2. Please suggest a possible field of interest to me, which I should pursue.

please guys do suggest anything you feel is right for me. My dad thinks I am a master in coding and says do AI and ML, or any course I want, but even I'm not sure with this self doubt and mindset rn. (Even my ocd and adhd has spiked up).

(Also, I went to college for deposit and stuff, many companies are coming and taking 2025 batch students, test rooms are being setup, idk why college didn't bring this stuff for our batch. But I know no blaming, but I gotta save myself, but first I need to solve this gap thingy, please.)

Guys help me. I feel like killing myself, and I cry myself to sleep.  I think I have forgot even the js, the little concepts scare me. What should I do. Please man for the love of God anyone guide me.

1k3okw7,Confused about my future career path…,"So I’m currently 23 (F) and I got into a really good sixth form at the time (2018), and was excited about getting my a levels done. 

Literally out of nowhere, my mother, who felt like I didn’t need an education, (I’m south Asian btw) stopped me from going at ALL on a random Monday and decided that I should get married.(Which I didn’t, she just wanted me at home). Her baseless and pointless reasoning for this was because she thought I was going to stray from studying and sleep around with boys, which I never understood because I have good friends, and don’t even stay or go out at all during the evenings like that. And just like that, my sixth form days were over. I was embarrassed and felt so deprived from my career goals, I didn’t know what to do. 

If you’re wondering where my dad is in all of this. Unfortunately, his life was made a living hell and he lived separate from my mum, not knowing that this was happening but he always remained close to me as a father and supported me. Our contact was heavily limited however because my mother just refused to allow us to keep ties with him. 

Anyway I pleaded and begged and my mum finally allowed me to get into a traineeship course which was not even a proper education.  I was gutted, but at least it was something. During the years I have tried to complete my education but it was hard to fund it so I just left it. Recently, I had connected with my dad and told him the entire story. 
He is now fully determined to ensure I complete my studies to the highest standards. Whilst I have that zeal to do so as well, I feel like the greatest opportunity (my a levels) was already snatched from me so what’s the point? 

I only just begun to complete my level three foundation diploma in IT and I really want to get an apprenticeship done to the gap between my A-levels. That’s one way, except it’s been a year since I’ve tried applying and have only faced rejection from interviews from apprenticeships. 

I feel like it’s all too late and I’ve passed the golden age of opportunity to academically succeed. Just came on here to ask, is there hope to move forward? If so, can anyone suggest some alternate pathways to continue and complete my education. What’s the best way? Appreciated.

1k3n8vg,Did I do something wrong? What should be my next step?,"First off I am in my early 30's and I have primarily worked in medicine. I was a EMT while in college and worked through nursing school. I spent the last several years working as an ER nurse and traveling through the pandemic and after. I suffered greatly from the work I was doing, it was hard on my body and mind. I spent two years applying to every remote work position I could find and after over 400 applications I was hired. In September 2024 I was hired with a 90 day probationary orientation period. I excelled and earned great marks. I was taken off probation and assigned a mentor. 

My daily responsibilities include reviewing medical records for risk adjustment purposes. I am required to review a minimum of 40 charts per week and log 40 hours per week. If you complete more charts the company awards you a bonus calculated on you performance against your peers. So far I have completed enough charts to be the highest earner and have receive $200-300 extra each month. 

Upon starting I had several meetings with my peers to walk me through the job and give advice. I was told by everyone I spoke with to pace myself. They told me that the program locks after 15 minutes so if I was done with a chart review but needed more time that I needed to be back within 15 minutes to click on something. 

For the last month our chart inventory has been very high. Administration decided to offer an incentive period of three weeks. Basically every additional chart completed (after 40 charts) you would be paid $30 with a max of 2 charts per hour. 

I took a pay cut to work for this company and I had reached out to my manager prior to this to ask for overtime opportunities and was turned down. I found this incentive period to be an opportunity to help close that pay gap in the short term. 

I worked a lot of overtime and completed enough charts to balance the 2 chart/hour maximum. At the end of the three week period I had calculated that my incentive pay out would be around $7000. At team meetings everyone was talking about working around the clock for the incentive so I though everyone was doing the same as I was. I was told in orientation that someone earned $15,000 during an incentive period. I did not think what I was doing was extreme. 

This period ended up being extended and is still on now. I decided that I was going to take a bit of a break and not participate in the incentive and not work the crazy hours as I could not keep up. I received a message from my manager asking if we could meet as she had a few questions. I hopped onto a video chat with her; she wanted to know how I had finished all the work that I did. She said I had completed more charts than anyone every had in the companies history. I was rather shocked by that statement because of the things I have heard about past incentive periods. I told her that I worked really hard and for many hours. I told her that I was tired and did not plan to participate in the ongoing incentive because I had worked so much the previous 3 weeks. 

About 10 minutes into our meeting my manager told me not to freak out but the director wanted to join the meeting. The director joined and hammered me with the same questions that I had just given answers to. They told me they had pulled the data from my work over the incentive period and were going through it chart by chart. For context I completed around 300 charts. They asked me very specific questions about some charts that I did not have answers to because I had completed so many. They said there were no quality concerns in my work. The meeting ended and I was told my manager would finish the review and contact me if she needed more clarification. 

Over the next week I was expecting to hear from my manager as pay day was approaching, but nothing. Pay day arrived and I received $1800 for my incentive payout. I contacted my manager to ask for a meeting with no response. I do not work on Fridays, but received a message from the director where she apologized for contacting my on my day off but that she had sent me an email and I needed to review it. The email stated that I was still  under investigation and that I am no longer eligible for the incentive so do not work outside of normal constraints. 

So now I am on week number two of being completely anxious. I do not know what is going on with the state of my employment or pay. 

I am wondering if I am the one who is wrong in this situation. I did allow some charts more time than they actually took me. I did this because that is the overall advice I received from mentors at the company. But because I did work so many hours, my record was the one to be pulled and examined so closely. 

I am very upset and worried about my job right now and frankly embarrassed. I am a really hard worker and have always been guided by a fair moral compass. But right now I am fraught with worry and really need some guidance.

1k3mcd2,Vent/Need Advice Career Change,"I've worked for a small start up that has increased in size 5x over the last 6 years. 
In the beginning I had a quick upward trajectory from RAI-SRAI, and was managing a team of 4. 
I was never given a management title or compensation for it, and was quickly overwhelmed with the role. 
I expressed that I couldn't manage any more people (everyone hired had little to no experience and needed a lot of hands on training) and my boss reacted poorly. They finally put a job posting up for a director. 
The director then hired a manager to handle logistics and supply for the team. Essentially two very experienced professionals were needed to cover the scope of what I was expected to do. 

After the director came in I asked to shadow other teams to switch groups and two weeks before the start they reneged. 
Since then I've been working on the bench and nothing has changed for three years (including no promotions). 
I've stayed because our benefits are good and my compensation is decent (plus bonuses, rsus, retention bonus). 

I'm now doing a master's in drug development and thinking of applying to entry level roles in clinical or project management and living off of savings. 
Many other employees have been able to switch groups yet I have never been supported by upper management or HR to do the same. 

My director (who was very supportive) just left and they have given the manager all of the director level responsibilities....without pay or a promotion.

I'm at wits end with the company,  I want to feel like I have a career trajectory again. 

I'm completing online certifications in PM, GMP, GLP, GCP, Veeva and various organizational tools. 
I'm going to take the CAPM exam in a few months. 

Any other suggestions for how to set myself up for a career change?

1k3luf0,Thinking of quitting my six figure job as its seems to be taking a nose dive. Bad or good decision?,"Basically I started a new job 10 months ago, and the salary currently is 122K. The job is very demanding, often times I’m working until 5-6PM. If we get late important work that requires quick turn around I’m working until 7-8PM. To many meetings to name, including early 8AM ones drive me insane. We originally were 6 team members, two senior and the rest of us new hires. One quit going in 3 months, one of the senior members transferred to another department, and just last Friday one other newer team members submitted their resignation. This leaves me, one new hire like me, and one senior team member. I hate the workload, I hate going onsite to the building with substandard AC/ventilation since it’s an older building and it gets hot late afternoon. If they end hybrid schedule, it will be a nightmare. I have applied and interviewed for other positions. Latest I heard from one of them is “ Quick update-we submitted your resume to our Teaming Partner and waiting to hear back from them. I'll follow up with you soon.” I’m not sure what this means, but this weekend I applied to more places. But I feel it’s slowly becoming clear I may need to resign without something lined up.

1k3kwxj,"Hit a huge turning point in life, need advice","So I'll be 28 in June, and my entire team just got made redundant as I was starting to lose faith in the path I'd chosen anyway, and I could use a bit of guidance as I moved to London for my career and it's basically just my roommate, my parents over the phone, and my girl who can advise me and they're not really sure what I should do.

For context, I lost my dad at 7 and didn't really have that 'career' or 'guidance' parent growing up until my mum remarried years and years later. My decision of what classes to take in school or what career north star to aim for were kind of just based on the vibes I had at the time... which of course were cloudy as hell. The only thing I knew was that my dad was a painter, and whilst I didn't inherit that talent, I felt a bit creative too. So given that I had severe ADHD and struggled with academic schoolwork, despite being told I was smart, I made a bold move and skipped university despite having good grades at a good school. I self-taught myself graphic design, which I believed at the time was the perfect middle ground between that artistic side of my dad and some of the creativity I felt as a teenager, and something that provided value and made money. I knew it wasn't going to be the kind of thing that made me millions, but I thought the trade off of not following my classmates into medical or law degrees would be worth it. Things unfortunately didn't work out that way.

In the time since I managed to go from unpaid internships in my hometown in North East England to an award winning agency in Central London where I beat out 100 other applicants, many of whom with advanced design degrees, for my midweight role. I was earning around £33,000 after my pay rise, but in london that's not easy living, especially with the post-covid inflation and rent problems. I don't want to make it about renting and how to find a cheaper flat, that's a whole different issue. The main problem is that despite objectively having some pretty unlucky jobs, for sure, I've just come to realise I dislike this career path in general to an extreme. Most of my bosses haven't been people who care about the creative team - we're, as one literally described us when he didn't think I could hear, ""mac monkeys"" that exist at the behest of the marketing team and don't have enough ROI because of how hard it is to pitch our services. You can work your arse off to earn other people millions and be told you're not quite worth that 10% pay rise after 2 years of a ton of unpaid overtime and stress. Where I direct my creativity has also changed and even getting 'fun' or inspiring projects to freelance on since I got made redundant just make me want to groan and I can barely bring myself to care. I'm currently trying to find work just doing something less mentally stressful like a cinema job or security work just to tide me over whilst I reassess my direction in general.

My plan for the short-term is like this, get something that pays the bills, then whilst doing that I'm teaching myself UI/UX on the suggestion of a friend, since it'll be a path that still allows me to bring my old CV and portfolio into an interview and have it be relevant, but it's different and in-demand enough to maybe be my change of course. The thing is, I'm slowly realising that I'm finding it hard to care about these portfolio test projects too. It's more of the same, sitting down in front of a computer to produce something creative just isn't 'me' at all. 

So, unfortunately, I'll have to do what I'll have to do for a while, and that's fine - I'm not going to be down in the dumps about that, but how do you guys think I should go about trying to find a new direction. I don't need it to be something that changes the world, if I found fulfilment in a blue collar job and was able to build my finances to start a family that'd be all the wealth in the world to me, I'm just scared that at 28 I'd be starting really far behind and stuck on apprentice wage through my 30s. I also feel like I do still have that creativity in me, but right now it manifests in things like writing, storytelling, curating nice things, reviewing movies and videogames, producing bodybuilding workout plans for friends with my custom selection. I don't want the slog of agency design work, but maybe if there were something I could still do creatively that wouldn't be so soul sucking (and in graphic design's case, replaceable or undervalued), I'd like to consider it. 

I guess to boil it down to specifics:

\- What kind of moves should I be making at 28? I feel like I'm out of that age where I should be taking the kind of risks that could end up with me moving back in broke with the parents, but am I overestimating how long it takes to start from zero and get to a good spot? Could I start on something minimum wage and make it to £40k by my mid 30s if I work hard?

\- For someone with interests in weightlifting, geek culture (games, movies, worldbuilding, stories), to an extent business and economics but not to the degree I feel comfortable starting my own due to anxiety, and who feels very comfortable being charismatic in one-on-ones but struggles with things like stage fright, and who doesn't mind working with his hands or putting in hard work in a sprint, but feels deflated after long periods of overtime etc. what jumps out at you that I should try?

\- If anyone older has any reassurance it'd be nice, I've been on a very lonely path and my hard work has not only come up a bit short with my career, I've neglected to have a lot of fun in my 20s, and any uplifting reassurance or silver linings would mean a lot.

1k3iwqg,advice for someone debating between MS Statistics and PhD Clinical Psych?,"I am trying to decide between 2 different career paths, one being a phd in clinical psych or a masters in stats w a data science emphasis. I have a bachelors in psych and years of research experience and have been aiming for a phd clin psych since college. I wanted to do assessments and some therapy, but also love the data/ research experience i’ve gotten. I started to question whether i could realistically do a phd after getting an acceptance into a program last year, which i ended up turning down. I am first gen and help support my family financially so really seeing the exact stipend i would get for the next 6-7 years and researching cost of living in the area made me start to consider other (shorter) career options. On top of that, recent changes impacting phd funding, postdoc, etc. has only pushed to consider other options more strongly. Due to the current political climate, there are only a few states I would be willing to do a phd in, which limits my chances of admission+ the lack of research jobs available right now could mean that i would not get into and complete a program until my mid 30s, and i would be struggling financially in the meantime and unable to help my family, which is pretty terrifying to me. 
Being a psychologist is something I am passionate about but it is not the only career I could ever see myself doing, so have been thoroughly exploring my options and interests and I am really interested in possibly pursuing biostats/health data science instead. I actually applied to a stats ms a few weeks ago and got accepted. I am a little nervous about the future outlook for this path due to ai, outsourcing jobs, etc as well as salary progression compared to being a psychologist.

I want something where I do something physical, like on my feet, talking to people, solving problems, and catering to people's needs.

I recently put in my two weeks’ notice at my job. Shortly after, I had a significant family situation come up—multiple losses over the past year and now a close relative in hospice care. I asked my manager if I could work from home temporarily during my notice period, but she said it wasn’t allowed under company policy and didn’t acknowledge the situation personally.

1k3a7jr,Help - I think I chose the wrong major,"TL;DR: Should I change my major now for better career prospects? Behavioural science to Accounting or finance? 

Hello, as the title suggests, I’m a mature age student and I’ve been having second-thoughts on my behavioural science major in my business bachelor. I have started looking for paid and unpaid positions, and am starting to think I should have went with Accounting or Finance. For those who have chosen a psychology or behavioural science major in business - what kind of role are you in now?

I initially chose this major as I have a keen interest in data analytics and any kind of quantitative research. But I really enjoyed the consumer behaviour aspect of it. 

Employers, when you’re reviewing applications, would a less popular major deter you? Or does the major not matter as much as the applicant’s other qualities e.g. career history, GPA, in-person impression, skills, and aligning values etc.?

1k39cgg,HELP ME FIND A CAREER,"Alright, y’all know life isn’t easy for most right now. December of last year I had my own apartment with my partner and our kid, a job where I could honestly pay all the bills myself, we could afford childcare out of pocket etc.
Well, crap changed. We’re now renting a room from my cousin in a different state, I’m only making $13/h, rent is twice as much as it was where I was living in December if we live on our own, and I’m eight months pregnant with my second kid. I feel STUCK and I need some advice on a career path.

I’m currently working in childcare, at a job I used to have. My daughter is free there which is the only saving grace for this job. They’ve just decided to essentially /tell/ me that I’m going from my ideal schedule to working an area I do not want to work and with a schedule that I didn’t agree to, that’ll essentially keep me away from home making things harder on myself, my partner, and tends to give my daughter some emotional issues and behavioral issues.

1k37wvp,What to do? Might be fired or promoted next week,"I took my job six months ago, joining a team of five other people (Steve, Adam, Stacey, Hailey, Rebecca). 

When I took this job, I initially applied for a more senior role, but my boss (Steve), had found someone with slightly more experience (Hailey). Still, he wanted me on the team, and so I accepted a more junior role with certain understandings regarding my position, hours, responsibilities, and salary progression to account for my higher level of experience. This included that I would report to Adam, and Rebecca (who would have the same job as me, but who’s been on the team a few years) would train me.

However, one week into my role, Steve quit, and Stacey (the office’s 2nd in command) became my boss. When she took the role, she told me that everything I discussed with Steve was off the table, and that Rebecca (who I have slightly more experience than) would be my supervisor. 

I couldn’t just go back to my old job, so I’ve weathered the last six months extreme difficulty, particularly because of difficulties working with Rebecca. 

Recently, Stacey quit, and we now have a new boss (Jordan).  

Jordan started last week (Monday), and his first order of business was to schedule an introductory meeting with every member of the office to discuss their function, expectations, and goals. As such, we scheduled one for last Wednesday.

At the end of his second day (Tuesday), he approached me, and asked what I had spent my day working on. I told him “nothing”, to which he questioned why. I responded by telling him that Rebecca assigns me all of my tasks, and despite my asking throughout the day, she had assigned me nothing. 

He proceeded to ask me to come to his office, to close the door, and that we were going to have our introductory meeting now. 

Here, I explained how I came to work here, that my ultimate goal was Hailey’s position, and also my difficulty working with Rebecca. This included that despite there being work to do, Rebecca will monopolize it (or occasionally give me near impossible tasks), that she is almost never in the office, or when she is, she’s almost always unavailable, and that she’s been unwilling to train me. 

This concluded with me proposing to Jordan that I keep doing my core work under Rebecca, but fill the huge gaps in my time by learning + working with Adam, and also having Adam become my new supervisor. 

Jordan listened, acknowledged that me doing nothing was an issue, and said he’d consider it; I found this to be a productive discussion.

However, Wednesday morning, Adam announced his resignation; and after speaking with Adam about it, he informed me that he had let Jordan know on Monday. As such, I waited until Jordan was available to approach him, where I asked his thoughts on my proposal, given that Adam was leaving, and I asked why he hadn’t mentioned it during our discussion yesterday. 

He responded by telling me he’s still thinking about what to do, and he’s not sure because it’s his third day; but given that Adam is leaving next week Friday, his timelines are accelerated. However, unlike our previous discussion, his demeanour was much more annoyed.

As a note, Adam has specialized skills that are near irreplaceable, where our office will cease to function without them, even for a day. Hailey is the only other person in our office who would even begin to know how to do Adam’s work, minus a handful of industry experts.

Now I’m in a position where I feel like I shouldn’t ask him again on what’s happening, but I foresee a few different outcomes: 

> #1: Jordan promotes Hailey into Adam’s role, and promotes me or Rebecca into Hailey’s role.

> #2: Jordan tries for an outside hire with maybe some of Adam’s skills, and just hopes they can fill the gap, where he either a) fires me for having no function, or b) tells me to support his new hire.

Am I thinking about this right? I have no idea what to do next but wait.

I’m a software engineer and just started a new job this week (let’s call it Job2), but I’ve now received an offer from a large financial company (Job3) that I really want to work for. I think they’ll be using HireRight for the background check.

Now I’m not sure how to handle the background check and onboarding paperwork. Specifically:
	•	Should I include Job2 on the background check/employment history form?
	•	Should I tell the recruiter that I just started a new role?
	•	If I don’t mention Job2, is there a chance it’ll come up and they’ll ask me to explain?

1k34g3q,Networking Events vs Workplace Connections – Advice Needed,"Hi everyone,  

I’m a 41-year-old man based in the North West of the UK and while my career’s been stable so far, I’d like to take the next step and build a stronger professional network.

I’m pretty introverted and the idea of networking events makes me cringe a bit.

I’m torn between pushing myself to attend local networking groups (which sound intimidating but might open new doors) or focusing on building relationships within my current workplace (safer, but maybe limiting?). 

On one hand, external events could connect me with fresh ideas/opportunities/connections outside my bubble. On the other, workplace networking feels more manageable and directly relevant to my role.

For those in the North West especially around Manchester: Are these events actually worthwhile here that I should look into?  

Are there less intensive strategies to grow a network without feeling socially drained?

Introverts: Have you found networking events useful? Any tricks to handle the awkwardness?

1k33lyx,I'm torn between two jobs,"I've been offered a position with a company that has wanted to hire me for 4 years. What they're offering is about 10k/yr less than what I'm making now.

I've made a physical list of things I like and dislike about both jobs.



Current employer:

I work out of town often. I'm talking all the time. My closest job in the last two years has been two hours away, which only lasted for 3 weeks, and the furthest was 7 hours away, which lasted for 5 months. I'm only home about one weekend a month. I do get per diem which is about $45/day depending where I am. Bigger cities get slightly higher.

I use my own truck for the traveling. They pay me a monthly stipend for it and pay for all my fuel. I've been averaging about 50k miles/year. 

There are many times I don't get the support from the project manager and end up taking my role and parts of theirs in order to get the job done. 

Every job has been high stress with expedited timelines. 

There is a decent bonus structure that adds to my base pay but I haven't seen one in nearly a year. This is common to wait for them as most jobs take a long time to close out. 

I am very often brought in on jobs that have gone off the rails. For example, they'll fire a superintendent that isn't up to par and I'm brought in to correct his mistakes and finish the project on time. 



Potential employer: 

10k less base pay

Company truck, company paid fuel and maintenance

I'll be home every night

No bonus structure but the company is employee owned. I'll earn shares in the company that can be sold back to them. I'm not entirely sure how it works but it's interesting. 

I don't know anyone that would be my peers but the people I have met, CEO and vice president, have been truly amazing. I get a really good vibe from them. 


My biggest issue is that I only have about 15 years before I retire. I need a good place to retire from. I'm not sure my current employer is that company. I love them all but the travel and stress is killing me. At the same time, I'd hate to give up my status as fixer of jobs gone haywire to be the new guy somewhere else. 



For the record; I live alone. I'm not married but do have a very supportive and loving girlfriend who does travel with me infrequently but can't stay away from home for too long because boarding animals is expensive and they don't travel well. I have adult children that have their own lives but I'm the sane and dependable parent. 

I could use some input that isn't, ""Do what's best for your career""",The_Super_Grover911,7,1.0,17,1745089217,2025-04-19 19:00:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k33lyx/im_torn_between_two_jobs/,4,2025
1k32vtw,Getting into consulting,"I graduated a couple of years ago with a degree in supply chain and have been working at a 3PL, supporting some of their larger accounts. Lately, I’ve been exploring a transition into consulting.

From what I’ve gathered, breaking into MBB directly from industry—especially without prior consulting experience—seems extremely difficult. I’m look at Tier 2 or boutique consulting firms, ideally those with a focus on supply chain or operational strategy.

For those who’ve made a similar move or have insights into this path: 
•	What helped you stand out as an experienced hire from industry? 
•	Is 1-2 years of experience enough or should I wait to transition?
•	How should I prepare for the recruiting process as a non-traditional candidate?

1k31gr1,"31 year old guy, wants to change his life, find his way, and needs help with career advice/suggestions.","Dear Redditors of r/carreradvice,

I’m turning to you and your opinions today because I’m at a point in my life where I’m trying to do better and help myself.

Some things about me:

I’m a 31-year-old man living and working in Germany for ten years, unfortunately for the same company that I started working for when I moved here.

I’m now a deputy front office and reservation manager in a 5 star superior hotel and have some tasks in accounting and HR.
I really can’t stand working in a hotel anymore, and I really want to take my career in a different direction.

A bit about me, my skills, and what I bring to the table:

Have some savings, but it’s not much. 
Depending on when I would be moving, maybe around 15k €, and I don’t have any investments 
at all.

I have things, like a laptop, phone, tablet, and so on. In terms of living, I don’t need much and prefer a minimalistic lifestyle and living space, so I don’t have many distractions.

I don’t mind travelling for work often, or traveling the whole time for that matter. I don’t need to have a home. I would even like this, especially if the job takes me all over the world.

A job with frequent travel is also okay, or where 
I don’t need to travel for work is also okay.

A remote job is also okay. 

If I would need to move somewhere far away, 
I could do it on short notice, one suitcase and one bag, that would be it for me.

I don’t have a SO, or kids, or anyone who would need attention, and I don’t want to have kids ever.

I wouldn’t mind working in the hotel industry, but maybe in a different position or something that is connected to the industry. (Still not sure how I feel about this, but I know that I don’t want to work in a hotel in Germany anymore.)

English and German skills are at a high level. 
To that, I can speak fluently Croatian/Bosnian/Serbian.

I would say that I’m good with people and that they feel comfortable around me, especially those who are working under me. Those who I was teaching and students, all really liked working with me, because of how I treat them, explain things, my patience, and how I handle things in stressful situations.

On-site problem solving

Skilled in on-site problem solving, process optimisation, and restructuring.

Logical approach and thinking

Organized, detail-oriented, with strong critical thinking.

Strong prioritisation ability.

People and customer interaction skills, being able to connect on a personal level.

Complex reservation and booking management.

Team coordination and being responsible for multiple employees across various departments at the same time.

Multitasking across various departments.

I’m not afraid of hard work.

Fast and willing learner.

I think that at this point in life I need to give up to find something I love, so that it could become my career. I wouldn’t know where to look, or what my passions is, I’m kind interested in a lot of things, but then again I never found that one thing where I could say, this is it.

I want to find something I like, something interesting with a good prospect for the future, so that I can at least be financially free.
Something I can fully invest myself into and be really good at. And to be honest, it doesn’t even need to be interesting, if I know that I’m financially well off, I know that I will be able to do well.

Would it make sense to learn something new? 
Or maybe to work on my current skills and do some up-skilling, but in what direction?

Or do you think that there is a job that I could start to do immediately with some basic training that will be provided by the company that employs me?

I’m just so lost here.

Does anybody have any idea or suggestions for me? Be it a job I can start immediately, learning something new, a company, a general way.

I have the desire and will to change my life and 
work towards a better future, to move out of here and to find my way.

Any help and advice is appreciated, and I thank everyone for their time spent.

Kind regards.",Aegon-14,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1745083469,2025-04-19 17:24:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k31gr1/31_year_old_guy_wants_to_change_his_life_find_his/,4,2025
1k2zi4j,Meeting on Monday,"My director called a meeting for Monday with HR.
(8am Monday).

I have been at the company 9 months. I already received an achievement award last month. 

My coworker complained about me to my manager and director (for honest reasons i don’t know) 


We scheduled warranty calls for new construction homes. We do it via email,phone call and a couple of builders have websites. I have been handling one website for 7 months with no help from the complainer. We have slowed down some and last Friday (there was one submitted) that I was looking into. Have a email I sent the builder. She goes ahead and enters it… (which she has never done before…) 

**the builders have called in and she’s put the work order in and then they add it to the portal and they let her know so she does log in and put her initials for those. 


I don’t really let it bother me since I am still waiting for the builder- (When we enter work orders for our system we put our initial or if it’s rescheduled or touched by someone they go ahead and add theirs too.) 
She reports me to my manager (kinda goes off in our group chat that I have “messed” with work orders that one and one other one.) Sends a screenshot she was meaning to send to the manager to the group chat. No one called me or anything about it so I was assuming nothing ever came from it. 

Monday (4/14) was good.  The builder put in 2 of the same work orders for her and I closed the duplicate out- i let her know and she’s very nice says “thank you 😊”.

Tuesday (4/15)- We get an email one of the tech’s cut sheetrock. We were told 4/8 if this happens to go ahead and email the builder and it has the work order number attached so we can just search for it. 
I already have it pulled up. (I always have the portal pulled up since they enter them through out the day.) I see that it was scheduled by her (builder called it in). I go ahead and add theirs notes and close it out. I emailed the builder rep as well letting him know sheetrock was cut. 

She asked me why I closed it out i explained I already had it pulled up and emailed the builder and I didn’t think it was that big of a deal. SHE WENT OFF. Saying it was rude and disrespectful and how she was now going to mess with my work orders. I just let her know it wasn’t rude or disrespectful in my opinion I was just closing it out… I already assume she’s sending this info to our manager. 

He sends me a text everything is going to be okay and not respond to her. 

Wed (4/16)- My director calls and just sees what’s going on I explain this came from left field (I really have no clue why she is so angry.) He thinks it’s because she’s “bored” I let him know that all I handle are the emails and portals since I assume she is getting all of the phone calls (i would rarely get 1 a day.) My other coworker would only get a handful and get emails. He lets me know to let the complainer handle this portal. Which I agree I told him I didn’t care that she was even in it and she can gladly take it over if that would help this situation. They maybe add (3 new ones a day if that). 

**We only have one main email that we color when we are getting them/ regardless of if it’s notes or scheduling. When I go to lunch my other coworker has stated they have let emails sit to see if she would get any and she never would. If she was actually bored you think she would hop on and try and get some emails as well. 


Should I be worried about being fired? 
 My manager said it’s just a meeting and to not stress about it . 

I have never been written up or disciplined. (I rarely ever complain…) I just always assume the worst.

1k2zewn,Maintain safe career path or go into (profitable) startup job I'm underqualified for for a huge raise?,"Maybe the answer is subjective, but want to get some weigh-in:

**Job A (current)**

\- Cushy, safe, recession-resilient corporate job

\- Great boss who likes me and is not stingy with promotions/raises

\- Worked here for four years and have strong rapport

\- Kind of place I could ""tap the brakes"" in 15 years and cruise until retirement, hitting all my financial goals, though probably not by a comfortable margin

\- I am grinding, but the job is not wildly demanding. I never work weekends and probably put in 50 hrs on average week

**Job B**

\- I believe I have a good chance at landing this job (for reasons that I won't go into, but not nepotism), but I am underqualified in years of experience (2yrs shy), M&A experience, and experience with their particular category, and have never worked in a startup environment, so have no real idea of what will be expected

\- Tech startup that's around 6 years old, profitable, and pays twice as much as my current salary. Working here for even three years would change my life. It would take me somewhere around 8 years to make that much in my current ""cushy"" career path.

\- Fully remote, which actually seems more like a con than a pro to me, as I get along well with people and I feel 100% WFH sterilizes social interactions

\- Unclear how heavy the workload is, but I imagine I'll be working a lot

**My thoughts:**

The way I see it, actually getting hired for this job could go one of three ways:

1. Company IPO's and I make a bazillion dollars, ride into the sunset (win)

2. I work there for a few years and am way ahead of my financial plan just through the increased compensation + have a strong resume to continue in that world or even come back to my existing career path with higher compensation (win)

3. I work there for a few months and then either get fired or laid off, then have to move back into my existing career path, either starting from scratch at a new company or returning to my current one set back a few years because I left (loss)

1-2 both sound great. #3 keeps me awake at night because my family depends on me. I am confident I could pull off the job, but avoiding this scenario is out of my control; I might be neglected and then fired for incompetence because I was adrift, boss might just suck, the company might go under, etc...

Anyway, hoping to hear some counsel. Appreciate it.",Willing-Prune2852,3,1.0,6,1745078026,2025-04-19 15:53:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2zewn/maintain_safe_career_path_or_go_into_profitable/,4,2025
1k2zadr,Role and Salary Review,"To be upfront about where I stand with my current role, I am already in the process of finding a new role and am in the final stages of one opportunity and have two others that I'm about half-way through.

I'm the controller at a small service based company where I came in with wage rates that were touted as above market average and they are, but this is across the board and is now causing issues.  The company in it's first year made just under $14m and is now at around $11m.  My two bosses (two majority owners of the company) have asked me to review all hourly and salary rates and come up with new rates for everyone including myself and them.  I feel like this is an unethical (borderline toxic) ask of me as their salaries should be determined by them and a BoD and mine should come from them.

Like I said, I am already running for the hills, but I wanted to check my thought process should this ever come up in the future.

1k2xi35,First full-time job : how to choose ?,"Hi everyone,
I just finished my studies (Audit and accounting) and I’m torn between two job offers:

Paris – Consultant in consolidation (€41K/year), not in a Big 4, but with strong learning opportunities (especially in IFRS). The cost of living is higher, with rent ranging from €800 to €1,000. I don’t see myself living in Paris long-term, and it would mean being far from my family.
The company is supportive: they’re giving me time to prepare for the DSCG (a key step toward becoming a Certified Public Accountant in France), and they’ve mentioned offering training for the DEC as well (the final diploma to earn that title). That said, I’m honestly unsure whether I want to stay in accounting in the long run.

Other City in France – IT Audit at KPMG (€40K/year), part of a Big 4 firm. The role seems interesting, there’s no rent to pay as I’ll be living with family, and it offers greater personal stability. I’m genuinely interested in IT and curious to dive deeper into the field, but I’m unsure about the long-term career outlook in IT audit, and whether it’s too soon to move away from traditional accounting. Some people around me have also mentioned that IT audit can be quite boring, which adds to my hesitation.

I’m scared of missing out on a strong career path if I stay in the smaller city, but also afraid of burning out in Paris.

I’d love your thoughts!

I have never cried this much in a job before. I've been stressed about overwork in the past, but due to what I see as a lack of delegation (and thus, lack of trust), the supervisor is instead the one stressed and overworked as I wait for tasks to be reviewed or to be assigned more work.

---

Hi all,

Just for a bit of background, I currently work for a big beauty retailer, where I have been since October of last year, and I HATE IT THERE! It's my first job in retail, and out of every industry I've worked in, including hospitality and office administration, it is one of the worst. I have been looking for a new job for a while because I am only contracted for 10 hours a week. I get that it's better than nothing, and at the time, after being made redundant from my last job, it was a godsend. But as I progressively work there, nothing seems to be getting better or changing—rude customers, management blaming me for everything going wrong even when I'm not in the building, and cutting my breaks short or 'forgetting' to give them to me. 

I have a trial shift on Sunday for a company that is only open 9 months of the year, from February to October. The management and the team seem lovely, and I have direct experience in the industry, which will help with my transition. However, my maybe new manager mentioned that due to the location of the business being on the beach, and since I live in not-so-sunny Wales, when the weather is bad, they close shop, and no one gets paid because obviously, their shifts get canceled. I didn’t connect the dots at the time, but I feel that my hours may be seriously affected by poor weather conditions, and I might be putting myself in a worse position than I am currently in. My maybe new manager said he could offer me full-time employment for 9 months of the year, and I could just get a seasonal job from October to January so I'm not without an income. I plan to ask him some questions before I sign any employment contract. Can you please possibly answer any concerns I'm having if you have a similar job or any other questions I should ask that I might be forgetting?",imjustagirl2312,1,1.0,0,1745061604,2025-04-19 11:20:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2u0ec/new_job_maybe/,4,2025

1k2scto,"I've reviewed 5,000+ resumes. Here's how you can stand out.","I'm a hiring manager, and I've reviewed over 5,000 resumes.

Here's how you can stand out:

**1. Actually show the skills we're looking for.**

If you have the skills we're looking for, I should see them at the top of your resume. In this case... I only had 2 requirements for this role: high level of English skills and not needing sponsorship to work in the country. Despite this, many candidates submitted CVs and applications ridden with grammatical errors and messed up formatting.

**2. Remove those percentage bars from skills section.**

ATS has trouble parsing through those, and it means nothing to human reviewers.

What does 60% of Canva mean? What does 40% of French mean? Nothing. It's completely subjective as there's no linear progress when it comes to skill. And even if there was, why would you self-report that you're only half-confident in your French skills? Maybe that 40% is enough for the role.

Just list out the skills and leave it to the interviewer to figure out if your skills are a good fit for the role.

**3. Apply to new applications (1-2 week old max).**

Unfortunately, part of the hiring process relies on luck. If I already picked 5-6 interesting candidates and started interviewing them, I might miss those that just submitted an application. To ensure your application actually gets seen, apply for fresh jobs only.

**4. Keep the summary section short.**

Most recruiters and hiring managers only glance at this section, so you should keep it short and punchy. I recommend 1-3 sentences (so, 2-3 lines) MAX.

Some people like to treat it as a biography, with 10 lines of text. This approach not only makes me not want to read it at all, but it also wastes valuable real estate on the paper which you could be using in your experience, education or skills section.

**5. Create a LinkedIn, add people and ask them to refer you.**

You probably already know about networking, so I'm not gonna talk about that. Instead, I wanted to share something you may not know: many companies have internal policies that require the HM to consider or even interview a referral candidate. My company for example, has a policy where a referral should at least be considered, while internal applicants have to be interviewed. This lets you skip the line and 'force' your application in front of the hiring manager.

**6. If you're particularly interested in working for a company, follow up your application with an email a week later.**

It will help us see that you're engaged and interested, which will make us look at your application (if we haven't already).

However, if you don't get a respone to your follow-up, I wouldn't go keep my hopes up. If they don't reach out after a follow up, they probably found someone else already and are just wakting for them to sign a contract.

A few other notes:

- Many people think that HMs always hire senior-level applicants for entry-level roles. While that might happen sometimes, from my experience, most managers wouldn't do that. We usually have a set budget for the role (which is given to us), which is lower for junior roles than senior ones. A senior will not be happy with a junior salary, so they will be looking for any opportunity to leave as soon as possible. That means that I, as a HM, will have to do another round of hiring very soon, which is a waste of time. So, any manager worth their salt will not be doing this. 

- Please submit your resume in the specified language. We always mention that we only accept applications in English, yet a few dozen candidates still send a resume in Swedish or another language. This will automatically disqualify your application. If no language is specified, submit the CV in the language of the job posting.

- Edit your cover letter - don't just submit an AI written one. Over 75% of CLs candidates submitted were just copied straight from ChatGPT. Remember, hiring managers read hundreds of applications. We can see the patterns in words and phrases being used in GenAI outputs. I don't have a problem with candidates using AI (I use it myself), but you NEED to manually edit it and make it interesting. The competition is too fierce to be relying on the HM not paying attention.

- If you get to the interview stage, do some research on the company and the role. If you're applying to work for an enterprise in a specialized role, don't tell the interviewer that you're looking for a startup environment where you'd be wearing several hats. (I know it may seem obvious, but this literally happened in one of my interviews last week, so I thought I'd add it in here). 

- In most companies, your applications aren't filtered out by ATS. People are the ones reviewing your applications. There are some things that can be filtered out by ATS via additional questions employers can set. But most companies (small-midsized) manually check CVs. 

- If you're still in college, do some internships or participate in school organizations (like for newspapers or events). This experience will make you stand out compared to students or recent grads who haven't done anything beyond classroom work.",ConsistentLavander,634,0.8899999856948853,114,1745054533,2025-04-19 09:22:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2scto/ive_reviewed_5000_resumes_heres_how_you_can_stand/,4,2025

1k2qzo9,"I got promoted, but now I’m stuck managing people. What should I do?","A year ago, I got a product manager role. I was decent at my job, but things really changed lately when I started using new tech to speed up the boring stuff. None of this was rocket science - I just described problems to AI, find some new tools, and make it work. For ex, I built an automated dashboard, create MVP in days not weeks with v0, and manage emails & docs with saner, do deep research (which used to take days) with GPT...

Then, word got around. My work was always ahead of schedule, and during one of those performance reviews I got offered a team lead role.

Which was exciting at the time. But now, my job feels completely different, it's not just analytics and working with my close devs. I spend way more time in stakeholder alignment meetings than actually solving problems. People don’t always say what they mean. Like:

* A senior PM said “Let’s loop in the data team for visibility” which I later learned meant “We’re blaming them in the next meeting”
* I shared a draft strategy doc with another team’s manager, and instead of feedback, she cc my boss and said “This is a strong starting point, but we may need more experienced input.”

I’m grateful for the promotion. But now I’m trying really hard to manage up without overstepping and still somehow deliver results.

Any advice for new managers on how to manage both up and down? and what is the key thing I should learn/do to reach a higher position in the future?

1k2q471,How can I transition from CNA to office clerk?,"I am 34 and am changing my career choice from medical to accounting. I'm choosing accounting for the money.

I was a CNA en route a nursing career. However, as a CNA, I learned that I cared *too much*, and feared that nursing would be a bad investment, because I'd very likely be one to experience early burn out (because, I just cared too much). I was in a bad marriage, and my home life and inner world suffered - I was not valued at home. I was so desperate to be needed and validated that I had something to offer as a human being, and my role as a CNA was an appreciative one. So, naturally, at work, I was a ""yes"" person, always saying yes and eager to please, because it meant to much to me to be valued (and I was being valued at work).

It has been very difficult for me to pivot from medical services to office/clerical/accounting roles. I am constantly recruited for CNA roles, despite my license being expired. I also struggle with submitting an application without hesitation or a lack of confidence in myself. I burned bridges with my employer of my CNA role (my most recent employment - 5 years ago). I had submitted my 2 weeks notice, and completed my last day, but at the end of my final shift, management pulled me into their office asking if they could get me to stay if they offered a higher wage and schedule choice. Again, I felt immensely valued by this gesture, so, I said yes, and was immediately rehired upon their request. But, this didn't change the fact that being a CNA no longer aligned with my career goals - as a CNA, I learned that I am too emotional to be a nurse for the next 40 years of my life. I didn't fear burning a bridge - in fact, I wanted to burn it so that I wouldn't get roped into doing something I didn't see myself sustainably being able to do for an entire lifelong career. 

Burning that bridge: I quit a week or so after they begged of me to stay/rehire, and in order to do so effectively, I made up a heinous lie, one that would surely make the employer not beg for me to stay again. I normally struggle to tell a lie, but I was able to this time - I wanted to burn the bridge that badly - I was so, so drawn to the medical field with a burning passion to help others, but it felt like an unsustainable position to put myself in - I wanted to shake myself out of it. 

The marriage has beaten me down - my self esteem has been low for years. I haven't held a job since covid - my spouse encouraged me to stay home and not work because I wasn't sure of a career path.

So, I have 5 years of recent unemployment without being a mother - sickened by the effect of covid, depression, and other emotional turmoil from an abusive marital relationship.

Telling the truth to employers is not helping me get a job. I have never been in a position where I struggle to gain employment - I held a regular full-time job from age 17-27, and even managed to put myself through school twice while doing so. I used to get 98% of the jobs I wanted/applied for - I was turned down by maybe 1 or 2 in my lifetime prior to this stretch of unemployment. Things are just bad for me now, and have been for a long time. It's so hard to crawl my way out of this failed marriage, especially when I cannot get a job that is in line with real career goals, so that I can work towards a future of financial independence and self-sufficiency. I am financially dependent with no money - beaten down emotionally, psychologically. I feel hollow. I also feel like I need a second lie to get me out of the trap the first one put me in, powerful enough to help me reframe my recent history in such a way that I can get a job - the right job - not just another CNA job. I even tried retail - no luck - likely because for every retail job, there are literally 70 other applicants I am competing against in this economy.

Roles that I have been applying to but am not getting include roles like *medical office specialist, receptionist, medical receptionist, office clerk,* etc. I thought these would be a good bridge between my medical experience with my goals in office/desk work. I believe that I am not getting the jobs because 1) being not-rehirable from my employer of my CNA role (due to me getting roped by into employment after successfully completing my 2 weeks - to only quit again without notice a week later, in addition to the lie I told them), 2) my 2 years of medical receptionist volunteer experience is not being validated by the wicked volunteer services manager. When anybody calls in - she says ""I cannot validate that she was a volunteer here."" She literally is just wicked - I reapplied to be a volunteer again recently, and I saw my history in the computer system - she is telling lies on purpose because she is wicked. That office is just messed up. So, my two experiences that are directly applicable to a bridge to office work are compromised references of work experience history. I don't know how to get a clerical role when I don't have clerical experience outside of my compromised history.

1k2ps6l,Had to request and lead my own exit meeting (HR & Manager) after a 2 week exit — Is this standard?,"Me: 20’s 
Manager (Director): 40’s 
HR Manager: 30’s 

Intro:
I recently resigned from a job after about  two weeks. I’m posting here to get feedback from HR professionals about whether this situation was handled appropriately—especially around how my resignation was managed. I tried to handle things respectfully and professionally throughout, but the process left me questioning how things are supposed to work.

*Note: I have never encountered a manager so unwilling to communicate and listen to their employee. And so willing to escalate early on. I am extremely good at communicating and working under pressure, but this manager pushed me to my limit. I am often described as nice, soft-spoken, polite, helpful. 
⸻

Week 1 – Delayed Access & Misalignment
	•	The role started fine, typical onboarding, seemingly nice but distant manager. Given a lot of information but tried hard to learn and absorb and take notes.
	•	I was asked to fix an existing reporting tool without documentation or context.
	•	I proactively tried to get started, but had delayed access to key tools, data, and systems, and original owner for questions.
	•	My manager was not technical and discouraged me from contacting the central IT team for questions (office politics). This put me in a very isolated situation and I ended up contacting them for questions behind the manager’s back.
⸻

Week 2 – Escalation
	•	I was assigned a new project early in the week (way out of my technical skill set) and expected to produce results on the reporting tool almost immediately after getting access (I estimate it would take 2-3 weeks to start updating it).
	•	I had a lengthy (multiple hours) 1:1 meeting with my manager (2 days in a row) where:
	•	They repeatedly shifted expectations about my responsibilities.
	•	Made undermining comments about my capability. Started insulting me personally. 
	•	At one point asked, “Who’s pressuring you? I can protect you.”—in a way that felt fake-protective and manipulative (and weird to hear from an older man).
	•	I told my manager that I wanted to resign (the hours-long conversations wore me down and I knew this was not right or professional). They said HR would need to be involved due to protocol.

⸻

Initial HR Meeting
	•	In the meeting with HR, they asked how I was feeling. I said that I felt like I was lacking in support and resources (information) to do the job well.
	•	I became emotional but stayed composed.
	•	HR encouraged me to give it 30 more days, saying maybe I was overwhelmed my first week, and could leave at any time if it didn’t improve.

The day after the meeting I received a micro-managing email on the deliverable instructions that felt more like performance documentation than support. It also had my teammate CC-ed. 

⸻

MidWeek – Breaking Point
	•	On one night of week two, I had what I now recognize as an stress-related breakdown. Could not think straight and was extremely exhausted.
	•	I went missing after work, fell asleep on public transit, couldn’t be contacted because my phone died, and cried the entire way home.
	•	My family became extremely worried when they couldn’t reach me and contacted authorities.
	•	I still showed up for work Thursday morning but knew I could not continue under those conditions.

⸻

Later Week 2 – I Formally Requested a Follow-Up
	•	Later that evening (after work hours), I emailed to request a follow-up meeting. I emailed my manager and HR:
	•	My tone was respectful and professional. I wanted to resign over video call (face to face) and handle it properly.

⸻

Next Morning – Final Resignation Meeting
	•	HR rearranged their schedule:
	•	First met privately with my manager. (15 min)
	•	Then brought both of us into a joint meeting. (First thing in the morning)
	•	I opened the conversation and calmly stated I was resigning, citing communication issues and role misalignment.
	•	My manager responded with a cold and deflective tone. The exchange became increasingly tense.
	•	I chose to de-escalate, I felt scared even over video call—I redirected the conversation to HR and asked for their input.
	•	They had been muted and taking notes until that point. When prompted:
	•	The HR rep made general comments about onboarding challenges and called it a bad fit.
	•	The meeting ended shortly after.

⸻

My Questions:
	•	Is it typical for an employee to have to initiate and lead their own resignation meeting?
      •     Is this escalation of events in 2 weeks abnormal? (Feeling necessary to quit day 7 and 10)
	•	Should HR have stepped in after the first meeting?",Electronic-Being5871,1,1.0,3,1745043435,2025-04-19 06:17:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2ps6l/had_to_request_and_lead_my_own_exit_meeting_hr/,4,2025

1k2o1vf,One week into my new job and I hate it. Any advice? I’m depressed.,"I just started a new job after leaving my last one of 3 years. The last role was high-stress with no upward trajectory, and the management was totally unsupportive and non-collaborative. We won’t from family culture to corporate. I left feeling burnt out but on good terms and hopeful that this new opportunity would be a step forward.

My background is in science and technical writing. This new role was advertised as a technical writing position—but in reality, it appears that’s maybe 10% of what I’m doing. The rest is work related to software development. I have ZERO experience in software, but I was hopeful and open to learning what is needed and there were no requirements for these skills in the job posting. The company knew this going in as well, so I expected some level of support or onboarding to help get me up to speed.

Instead, after a four-round interview process, I started and only then found out that the person I’m supposed to work alongside (same position), is going on maternity leave any day now. I had no idea. There’s been attempts at a  structured onboarding but it’s been mostly based on my attempts to trigger them and there is no clear point of contact for support. I sit at my desk overwhelmed, and when I ask questions, no one seems to know the answers. I asked the woman I’m essentially replacing who I can turn to once she’s out, and she said… no one. The department had 9 months to plan and did nothing from what I see. The woman has been great, but she’s super pregnant so I have no qualms that she is basically checked out at this point.

The thing is, I took a $10k pay cut thinking this would be a chance to transition into a better long-term path, but instead I now have: Less pay, No PTO until it accrues, Less flexibility, A role I’m underprepared for and No support or the support I will have can be gone any day now.

I’m invited to 3+ meetings a day where I have zero context. Everyone’s speaking in software jargon, and no one explains what’s going on. I’m feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and like I was sold something completely different than what I signed up for and I feel like they chose wrong in choosing me. Next week there are a ton of handoff meeting where I will be handed off projects…these are massive projects by the way, and I will be doing them alone…ii down even know what to do! Everyone has been very friendly, but at the end of the day, this is a corporate environment so…it’s politics from what I can gauge.

I’m angling on trying to stick it out for the 12 weeks until the woman returns and reassess from there—but I’m already burnt out and deeply discouraged. My reason for trying to stick it out is that, if I do leave, there may be some appreciativeness that I filled in and didn’t leave them without anyone…? Idk. I just feel like I’ve been set up to fail for the last 3 years and now I’m stuck in the same boat - I have teared up so many times during this past week sitting at my desk trying to take as many notes as I can.  Also, I’m not going back to my last job.

I have ZERO experience in software, but I was hopeful and open to learning what is needed and there were no requirements for these skills in the job posting. The company knew this going in as well, so I expected some level of support or onboarding to help get me up to speed.

Instead, after a four-round interview process, I started and only then found out that the person I’m supposed to work alongside (same position), is going on maternity leave any day now. I had no idea. There’s been attempts at a  structured onboarding but it’s been mostly based on my attempts to trigger them and there is no clear point of contact for support. I sit at my desk overwhelmed, and when I ask questions, no one seems to know the answers. I asked the woman I’m essentially replacing who I can turn to once she’s out, and she said… no one. The department had 9 months to plan and did nothing from what I see. The woman has been great, but she’s super pregnant so I have no qualms that she is basically checked out at this point.

The thing is, I took a $10k pay cut thinking this would be a chance to transition into a better long-term path, but instead I now have: Less pay, No PTO until it accrues, Less flexibility, A role I’m underprepared for and No support or the support I will have can be gone any day now.

I’m invited to 3+ meetings a day where I have zero context. Everyone’s speaking in software jargon, and no one explains what’s going on. I’m feeling overwhelmed, isolated, and like I was sold something completely different than what I signed up for and I feel like they chose wrong in choosing me. Next week there are a ton of handoff meeting where I will be handed off projects…these are massive projects by the way, and I will be doing them alone…ii down even know what to do! Everyone has been very friendly, but at the end of the day, this is a corporate environment so…it’s politics from what I can gauge.

I’m angling on trying to stick it out for the 12 weeks until the woman returns and reassess from there—but I’m already burnt out and deeply discouraged. My reason for trying to stick it out is that, if I do leave, there may be some appreciativeness that I filled in and didn’t leave them without anyone…? Idk. I just feel like I’ve been set up to fail for the last 3 years and now I’m stuck in the same boat - I have teared up so many times during this past week sitting at my desk trying to take as many notes as I can.  Also, I’m not going back to my last job.

Has anyone been in a similar position? Please help.",DancingLobster_,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1745036453,2025-04-19 04:20:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2o0fl/one_week_into_my_new_job_and_i_hate_it_and_advice/,4,2025
1k2nlmi,Should I talk to my boss??,"Helppppp…. I have been working at the same company since August 2022. This past August, I asked for a raise, as my workload had doubled (or more) and my work was bringing in significant amounts of money for the company. I was told probably but would have to wait til the end of the fiscal cycle like normal (end of March). I waited til mid march, where I received a 7% raise. I got a bit extra of a bonus as well, which was nice. I discuss with my boss the potential of me becoming a team lead one day and how close I am to achieving that (there is one step between me and that role). I have not been promoted at this company.

Important note: my boss has been here about a year and a half less than me.

Fast forward a few weeks later and my boss announces a person who’s been here about 10 months has gotten promoted to a team lead, but they barely say a word ever. All the reasons I didn’t get promoted were I hadn’t had enough exposure to more kinds of projects.. I’ve done dozens of projects. This person has worked on one (albeit challenging) project during their time. This person came over from newish boss’s old company…

THEN TODAY my boss says they’re going to be hiring the senior role I would be promoted to and a few other folks my role. They did not specify but I gathered outside hires…

QUESTION: do I somehow lightly bring this up with my boss? I truly do a lot for the company and wear many hats and am super knowledgeable. I train new team members. I’m confident and personable. So where’s my promotion? Or is this too entitled?

1k2njke,Are IQ scores really standardised? Genuinely curious about what they actually measure?,"I keep seeing posts everywhere about IQ results, and it’s made me wonder how standardised these tests really are. From what I understand, IQ tests mostly measure things like logic, spatial reasoning, and problem-solving. But aren’t there other kinds of intelligence that get overlooked?

I scored a 126, which I think is slightly above average (with the average range being 110–120). I also thought 144 was the upper limit for most standard IQ tests, but I’ve seen people quoting way higher scores. Is that still the main test people are referring to, or are there multiple versions floating around now?

I’m not trying to discredit anyone, just genuinely curious if any academics or people with a psychology background can weigh in. Am I wrong in thinking IQ only reflects a narrow kind of intelligence?

I have sent hundreds of applications and had several promising multi-round interviews that went well. Every single time - the hiring team either cancels the position or they select another candidate.

For reference, I am an American who has lived in Canada for 8 years and I am looking to relocate back to the US. I have a lot of good experience and education, and oftentimes the roles I interview for I match the criteria. I don't know if the companies are concerned about the relocation and prefer to hire someone local. Or, maybe they're more interested in internal hires at the moment.

1k2mwap,Is 2 weeks in too soon to transfer?,"Throwaway and vague because I don't want to be randomly found out.

I work for a very large (thousands of employees) organization. They have their own temporary personnel division (think Temp Service), which has recently hired me on. I started just a short while ago doing helpdesk type stuff. The cool thing, even though I'm a temp, I'm still an employee of the company (not fte, which provides more benefits) and because of that, I can apply for jobs as an internal applicant.

I have been open and honest starting from my interview (with my current team) to today that I'd be looking to transfer to a fte position in the organization (they have many divisions, and mostly all of them have an IT team of some sort). 

A job opened up today in the department I work in. A different team, but the same department, same division. I know I'd be a great candidate for this position. It's fte and would come with a 40% pay bump. 

How should I handle the conversation with my supervisor? Should I apply without telling them? I don't think it's good etiquette to directly ask the other manager for an interview, but should I ask about the position?

I've never been in a position like this, but I intend to pull the trigger on some sort of action Monday morning. I've already crafted my Resume and Cover Letter.

1k2m1mr,How to build emotional fitness and distress tolerance?,"How do I not get my emotions caught up in my work product? My job can be difficult sometimes - I work at a company that recently IPO’ed in the AI infrastructure industry. The executive leadership team is very demanding at our company and my department reports directly through the chief accounting officer. 

I feel lots of pressure and I put lots of pressure on myself to perform well. Last week when I asked my manager a question about the difference between two entities in Oracle he said “I don’t fucking know and I don’t care.” But then he will go ask the director what it is five minutes later. Other colleagues have said he is a terrible manager and they don’t like working with him at all. I’ve never seen anyone screamed at - but on rare occasions the tone of voice is aggressive and the person is usually so upset their voice starts shaking. It just makes me feel extremely stressed all the time and I can’t get my mind off work. The culture at the office is everyone is very curt. 

I don’t feel like I have enough emotional fitness or distress tolerance and I feel always on edge. Despite working long hours (I had multiple 14+ hour days before filing) I always feel like I’m aiming for a moving target. Nothing is really documented unlike the last department I worked in which had hundreds of SOP’s. My work performance is declining as well - and I think setting some emotional boundaries would really help me feel accomplished - after all I’m only human. 

Besides seeing coworkers turn to vices - the director will get drunk at company parties to the point she slurs her words, then she drives home afterwards, I’ve turned to my own vices too. I find emotionally I have trouble handling the stress.

In university, I won awards and cash prizes for my writing, and I had multiple professors ask to keep my work as examples for future students. I felt good about my prospects when I graduated, but nothing seemed to work out. Worked deadend paper pushing office jobs ever since. I've continued to apply for writing positions but no luck.

I regularly ask him for basic resources for my software engineering roles like for example... servers for my applications. He can't get me access. Most of the people on my team like him as a person but can't understand how he has 0 authority over other people working on our projects. We have some personal beef between us because he said he'd give me a leadership role but when I noticed he couldn't get things done efficiently I stopped working as hard. There is some history but this guy sucks. He is out of office all the time on his teams status. I mean twice a week he's just gone in the afternoon. What can I do?

1k2hdr6,My job is forcing me to take on another agency with no compensation,"I am a manger at my place of work. I manage clinical staff who work in the field. Last month, I was told that I needed to take on another agency, three hours away, with no compensation. I did the workflow for both agencies for a month, but I was working 50+ hours a week as a salaried employee. I said enough is enough last week, and they took the other agency away and hired the person back who was previously processing the workflow for the other agency AND getting paid to do so. This week, in a call that did not include me, the VP of the company said that I WILL take on the role of the second agency and that I can “absorb the extra agency” into my already low, base rate salary that does not account for my years of experience or degree. I have sent an email and a text to the VP, and she has read both of them and called my boss to ask if she knew I was messaging her. She knew. She only communicates with me through my boss. If she wants me to know something, she tells my boss and asks that she communicates it to me. Before, she’d respond to me immediately and messaged me frequently. The second I started pushing back and voicing my concerns, she shut me out. My question is, is this normal, or do I have the right to be upset? Should I take on this other agency, which more than doubles my workload, without continuing to speak up?

1k2grdv,I need a connection or help getting a new job. HELP.,"Hey guys, I'm writing this in hopes that there's someone out there that can help me find a new path. I'm an EX job corps student that graduated in 2024 and began to work as an ""Officer."" I'll say it like that from now because I don't want to bring any legal trouble. Anywho, I've been working 12 hour shifts / 5 days a week for a little over a year now and the money is very good. This is my first job and it's allowed me to become completely independent, own a fully paid off car, build 700+ credit from nothing, and be financially stable. This is where that joy ends. I am truthfully, and never was, interested in this career field. Dealing with criminals and stuff everyday is tiring on top of supervisors AND these super long shifts. I'm very young, like very young. I'm actually the youngest officer where I work, but I'm looking for a new career field I can still be independent working in. I had no experience going into my job, and I'll have no experience going into the next, but I literally outwork everyone (and that's not to brag, I'm speaking facts). I've worked my butt off to get here. If there's any recruiter or person with a connection, contact me. I will move anywhere in the United States and work ANY job. Just know that of this moment I do make 2.8-3k bi-weekly. I can take a pay cut in exchange for hours but it has to be reasonable. And if your someone who's already working a good paying job (entry level) then I'd love tips on getting hired in YOUR field. Do not tell me to work in a field you've never been in (I will ignore you). I don't expect anything from this, but I never would've gotten where I am today without throwing the ball. I'll throw some extra facts about me below:

  
I'm passionate about game development. I can do digital graphic design whether it be logos, websites, or in-game elements. I'm decently strong. I'm lightweight. I will force myself to do any work that benefits me. I'm also male and don't drink.

However, they informed me that if I was interested I would have to send over my updated resume and do a formal interview again. They even mentioned that they might create a job posting for this position and if I wasn't ready to interview soon I could apply for the job opening.

1k2fxjf,Should I tell my boss I have problems with the job/the duties I'm required to do?,"**Intro:** My job is not working out for me. I planned to stay for at least a year so I can put it on my resume, but I’m only 6 months in and I’m extremely stressed and burnt out. I don’t know if it would be beneficial or detrimental to tell my supervisor now or wait for later. 

**Background:** I was looking for a full time job, a true 8-4/9-5, don’t have to work evenings or weekends so I could have a work life balance, don’t have to drive on the job/during my shift because I have driving anxiety 

**Job Posting:** I applied to a state government job. I know people with these jobs who never work outside of working hours, and I know the reputation of government being slow because people put down their work once their shift is over. Job posting said nothing about hours being different than standard working hours. 

**Interview:** Interview mentioned the job requires working some evenings and weekends. I told them upfront that I have a side job that I will not be quitting, as well as volunteer work and hobbies that I prioritize so there are certain days I am not available and am not willing to change my schedule. I knew this job wasn’t for me, and I didn’t think they would offer me the job because I made it clear that I would not prioritize it if not between 9 and 5, and I thought they would think I’m unreliable. 

**Offer:** They offered me the job. I was desperate for money and benefits, so instead of rejecting it, I asked A LOT of questions to see if it would work. I asked how often I’d be required to work evenings/weekends. They told me around 5 times a year. NOT BAD! If it were every day, every week, or even every month, it would be a no from me. But I can do 5 times! I asked them if the meetings would be in person or virtual (because I have driving anxiety and I can’t drive long distances even if infrequently) and they said that of the 5 meetings, it is a combination of virtual and in person. It sounded totally manageable so I took the job. 



**Lie 1:** On my first day, my supervisor told me the job requires 11 meetings outside of working hours per year, as required by federal government guidelines. I was SHOCKED. What happened to 5? 11 is not only more than 5, it’s more than double. I didn’t want to call her a liar to her face, and I also didn’t want to quit right then and there, so I begrudgingly accepted that I would have to work outside of working hours once a month. (Please don’t tell me this isn’t bad. It is VERY bad for me. I have something to do almost every day after work and every meeting so far I’ve had to cancel or miss one of my side job shifts/events. This kind of schedule just doesn’t work with my lifestyle, and it is not what I agreed to.) 

**Lie 2 and 3:** So, I learned that 11 meetings per year is actually the minimum. We have to do at least 11, but the true number is “indefinite” because whenever a town in the state (any town in the state) requests technical assistance or training, we must provide it. So far, we have 15 meetings scheduled for the first year (already done 8). But two more towns are requesting meetings so that’s going to be  7. It could get up to 20 or 24. We’ve been doing two a month for the past few months and we have two a month scheduled through the summer. Again, this is NOT working with my schedule and it’s not fair to me. Additionally, the meetings are not half virtual and half in person. 90% are in person. Sometimes, the meetings are far away and there’s no train lines that go there. Yesterday, I drove 3 hours there and 3 hours back (6 hours total) for a 1.5 hour meeting. I was extremely stressed and anxious, and almost had a panic attack. On the way back, it was dark and I was getting so tired. I took a few breaks but I was still fighting for my life. When I got home, I was mentally and physically EXHAUSTED. This is not sustainable for me. 

**Problem:** Because I am so burnt out, I asked HR for a reasonable accommodation to have one extra WFH day a week. (Three instead of two). My manager had a meeting with me about it. She is assigning me a slew of trainings, 4 new projects, I have to keep a journal of everything I work on every day, and we have to have daily check ins. Mind you, this is not standard for WFH. I was already WFH with complete freedom, but now that I’m asking for one extra day, my manager is telling me:

I don’t know how to do my job so here are some trainings 

She doesn’t trust me to do my job, so journal and check ins to make sure I am completing my work 

But let’s make it harder for me to do my job so here are 4 new projects to work on so if I don’t finish them all, my failure can be used as justification to get rid of my accommodation 

**Another problem:** There is a “big 2-day conference” coming up that is 2 hours away from me, and goes way past my working hours. I didn’t think this was required (I thought it was more professional development), but my supervisor wants me to go. I asked if it is required, and she passive aggressively said it is “highly encouraged,” meaning if I don’t go, she will be upset. Working a 12 hour shift, driving 4+ hours in one day, missing my evening commitments, TWO DAYS IN A ROW, is NOT going to work for me. I want to talk to my manager about my not going, and I was wondering if I should use this topic to speak about the job overall not working for me. 

**Desperation:** I don’t want to suffer in silence. I don’t want to lie and say everything is going fine when asked. I feel like I should communicate this with my supervisor to let her know I’m struggling because the job is not what I agreed to and it’s just not working out for me. Especially as an explanation of why I don’t want to go to the conference. But I’m nervous she will fire me. Some people say it’s not easy to get fired from a government job so I will be fine. But what if she is able to fire me anyway? Or, what if I stay until I complete my first year, but she treats me differently knowing I hate the job, and makes my life even more of a living hell than it is now? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 



**TLDR:** Job lied to me about hours, it’s not working for me but I want to stay for another 6 months to complete a full year, but I’m wondering if I should communicate my concerns with my supervisor. If I communicate, I could face retaliation; if I don’t, I look like a bad employee and my absence at the conference will go unexplained.

“Wait…...this isn’t it either.”

I’ve followed the advice—networked, upskilled, picked stable industries, chased “purpose,” even tried turning a hobby into income. And yet, every time I think I’ve found the “right” path, it turns into just another job. Decent pay, okay coworkers, but nothing that makes me feel alive.

1k2ewzc,"Take a Lower-Paying, Less Technical Role Now — or Hold Out and Prep for a Higher-Level Engineering Job?","Hi everyone,

I could really use some advice as I figure out my next career move.

Some quick background: I was laid off about 4 months ago and used that time to recharge. I’ve recently jumped back into the job hunt, but the market’s been tough—especially for Engineering roles similar to my last position. I haven’t been getting much traction there.

Lately, I’ve been applying to more analytical, lower-skill roles and I’m actually getting responses and made it past the first round for a few of them. The catch? These roles come with about a $30K pay cut and would underutilize the skills I built in my previous Engineering role. On the plus side, they’re lower stress and seem more attainable in this job market.

Here’s my dilemma:  
Should I take one of these roles now—knowing it’s a step back in terms of both pay and skill usage—but gain some job security while continuing to look for something better in the background?

**OR** should I fully commit to interview prep for the next couple of months and aim for a more technical, higher-paying role that better aligns with my long-term goals and allows me to grow in my career?

For context:

* I can live off unemployment and severance for about 3 more months before I’d need to tap into savings.
* I’m worried about stalling my career growth if I step too far back, but also don’t want to be out of work for too long.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar spot or has advice. Thanks in advance!",Accomplished-Net9863,1,1.0,1,1745008431,2025-04-18 20:33:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2ewzc/take_a_lowerpaying_less_technical_role_now_or/,4,2025
1k2ewna,What if I get multiple offers?,"So I feel really privileged posting this in this economy, but I work in a field that hasn’t been hit that hard (yet) by the current economic situation. I’ve had multiple interviews for a few different jobs over the past couple weeks. Here’s my dilemma. 

I just got offered the job at employer number 1. Let’s call it Job 1. Job 1 is fine—not really my passion area, but pays slightly more than my job now and I would be content with it if it’s the only offer I get.

I had a final round interview yesterday for a job (let’s call it Job 2) that pays more than Job 1 and that I’m significantly more passionate about. I would much prefer Job 2 over Job 1. I think I did well in the interview, but they told me they’re still in the process of interviewing all candidates and will get back to me with a decision by the end of next week. 

I’m also in the beginning stages of two other jobs (had 1st round interviews that went well) that I would prefer over Job 1. 

What do I do? I know the obvious answer is accept Job 1 and then possibly leave if I get any of the other jobs, but I work in a relatively small field and that kind of thing gets around. Is it worth burning a bridge? I can’t stay at my current job—it’s extremely toxic and I’m ready to move on.

1k2csxw,Should I leave my job?,"I am feeling very conflicted. I have been at my current job for 6 years. There are a lot of great perks (flexible hours if I have an appointment, work from home 2 days a week, decent PTO, a 5 week sabbatical every 5 years of service, okay healthcare coverage and they contribute $900/yr to my HSA, yearly bonus if we have a good year) and I truly like my job and my coworkers. I’m also very good at it and have the performance reviews to back it up.

My biggest issue is the pay. They are very transparent that they will never be at the top when it comes to compensation. In fact they do research every 3 years to make sure they are average in the industry. We have multiple offices in different states but we all get paid the same, even if we live in a more expensive city. And I happen to live in the most expensive city. My rent is crazy high for a 2 bedroom apartment and there is no way I can afford to buy a house with what I make. When I’ve brought this up to management, they told me it’s not their responsibility to “subsidize my life style” and that it’s a personal choice to live in the city I live in. 

So I started job searching and interviewed somewhere recently and they are most likely going to make me an offer next week. I don’t know the exact number yet but I was very transparent I would only leave for more money and their bonus structure is more robust than my current employer.

After that interview I thought I would be so happy, but I really wasn’t. The office I would leave for is much more stuffy, less laid back and a smaller company.

1k2c9uy,Should I Accept The Job or Stay Where I Am,"I've been at a company for a little over 4 years now in an information security analyst role. I have consistently been getting work at a manager level (projects and stakeholders at director/VP levels to manage) and have been very vocal to my direct leader and our VP regarding looking for a promotion. I am just trying to get the title that goes along with the work Im getting assigned as there are managers on the team getting less work than me. My directors (I have had 2 in the lat two years as one rolled off the team) both tell me to keep working at it but there is currently no openings for a promotion. My VP even said he can see I am ready and wants to support me during a conversation I had with him last year. However since that time a new director rolled on which I had to prove myself to again, a colleague I helped trained got promoted because she is located in India and they did not want to open roles here in the US and my org (technology) has gotten restructured and is still in flux as to how they want to arrange teams. This meant another new director rolled on about a month ago that I would soon be reporting to after I build a rapport with the last one. 

I applied for a roll within another unit in the company (GRC) and was able to get an offer for a manager roll. But what they offered me was such a low percentage increase (3%-I spoke to HR about this concern and will be hearing back soon if there is a counter offer) I am wondering if it is even worth it. On one hand I would have a manager title and can leverage that to get a job somewhere else with my experience and certifications (CRISC and CISSP) but I would be taking a low increase, would have to go from virtual to hybrid (3 days) and be in a dept Im not too excited about but would be able to potentially gain some new skills in governance. On the other hand, if I stay where I am there is no indication I will get promoted any time soon since they love doing the runaround. My current director told me she point blank asked our VP about me and he just keeps being avoidant ""Let's see how things play out"" etc. I wouldn't have a manager title to use when looking a role in other companies but I would be able to remain virtual in my current role.

Ultimately, I don't know if to take a new role with a guarantee or keep hoping which I know is worth nothing in corporate jobs. Any thinking points would be greatly appreciated.",jon62092,1,0.6700000166893005,8,1745001615,2025-04-18 18:40:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2c9uy/should_i_accept_the_job_or_stay_where_i_am/,4,2025
1k2c97d,Job Consideration,"Wondering if I would be crazy for doing this. Current company is paying me $110,000 plus 25% bonus. I live in a house in Colorado that I have a 2.9% interest rate with about 200k equity in it. Payment on the house with everything is around $2700. House is worth 675k.

Company is talking a promotion for me that I would move to Connecticut for around 175k salary with a starting 105% bonus. This bonus would scale up to 205% over time. 

Housing market in Connecticut looks like I could afford a bigger house for around 750k. I would get a much larger yard, around 1500sq ft - 2000sqft more and better overall design. Payment would jump to 4500-5500 depending on what I would plan to do.

I feel like this would be doable and would be a decent upgrade in house and potential lifestyle. We would be losing our family who is all located here and everything that we know. Our 3 kids are all about to be school age so daycare isn’t really an issue. We would also be losing our friend circle that we live by who we hang out with almost daily. We are very sociable and feel like we could develop relationships anywhere.

1k2c8t0,How I designed and made the switch from finance to marketing,"Hi reddit. I wanted to share this here because I honestly just want to tell someone how hard I worked to make this happen. I also think it could be helpful to anyone whos thinking about making a switch like this because I wish smoeone laid it out like this for me.

1.5 years ago I was an mid level accountant at a big accounting firm. I had a good salary. Everyhting was good on paper - but I honestly felt so soul sucked and drained every day going to work. I felt cheated - everyone told me this accounting job would be amazing, and how great of a job it is and on paper it is but IRL i fucking hated going to work and just burying my face in numbers all day of other people making more money than me.

I decided to make a change a year ago - and I just now have landed a job as a Marketing Manager at a growing consumer packaged goods company. I’m already way happier, the work is way more creative, the office is way nicer, and theres just so much opportunity to take my career in different directions from here.

Honestly, this was the hardest thing I’d ever done. I have no mentors. No supportive bosses. My mom would have been supportive but she passed some time ago and the rest of my family told me I was making a huge mistake. So if you’re going through this I see you and I hope this helps you in some way because if I can do it you can do it and honestly I am proud of myself for pushing through it.

**I decided not to get another degree.**

I think this is the easy thing and some of my friends said I should do it. But then I talked to people who actually did some kind of adult program / MBA or Masters in something and rarely did they say that it actually helped them. Unless its like a top tier program where companies actively recruit all or most of the grads - it sounds like you’re pretty SOL after graduating, especifaly in this economy.

I think its better to show grit, self-learning, and just grind out what you need to know (especially for something like marketing, its prob different if you’re doing something super technical).

**I read this book that really changed my mind**

**The Element** \- by Ken Robinson. This is just such a fun book to read and really helped cement my idea that my life was too short to be a number cruncher for the rest of my life. It interviews people who love and are amazing at what they do and it talks about how to find “your element”. The stories are really interesting

**I really figured out what I was good at and where it would translate**

I’d been in accounting for so long now that I don’t even know what I could do outside of it. So I took a lot of career assessments / career aptitude tests. Theres a million of these but the favorite one I took is called the **Pigment career discovery assessment.** You need to pay for it but it is FAR RAR more detailed and informative than the free or cheaper ones. I credit the inspiration to go into marketing to this assessment.

**I used the living shit out of AI**

I cannot even count how many hours I spent talking to ChatGPT on voice mode. Every time I had a free moment or was driving in the car, I’d pop it open and just talk and talk and talk to it. I’d ask it day in the life of marketing questions- Id ask it what different acrynmns in marketing meant, Id ask it it to mock interview me and critique me, I’d ask it to help me craft my story and just so much more. It became my personal mentor and my support system. I don’t think I would have been able to learn even 1/10th of what I know without it.

**I figured out how to set up an accounting to marketing bridge**

Before I started I thought accountign and marketing couldnt be more different. Ones numbers another ones like pretty videos and designs? As i was diving in, talking to chatGPT, and really analyzing my skills - I started ot build a bridge that helped me to build my confidence and tell my story in this transition.

I found out how really good marketers are really good at data - and how marketing data is really very similar to financial data, and actually IS financial data in some companies (direct to consumer companies). I started to learn that often times what holds marketers back is their lack of finance understanding so I started to really weave this into my story and interview.

I can now confidently defend this argument how marketing and finance are hand in hand and joined at the hip. THIS angle got me hired. I know this because they told me.

**I became the most ‘decorated’ candidate**

I dont actully know if this helped. It didn’t hurt - but I think this was something that helped the company justify their decision to hire me instead of THE reason they hired me. But I found out all the marketing tools that these consumer companies used and I just got all the certifications I possibly could. I have google analytics, amplitude, hotjar, semrush… I am DECKED out.

honestly - I just want to say that I am proud of myself. No one else has told me that. but I am. And if you’re going through this like I am just know this shit is hard. This economy fucking sucks. But it’s possible and you can do it.",seany_irish,62,1.0,2,1745001538,2025-04-18 18:38:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2c8t0/how_i_designed_and_made_the_switch_from_finance/,4,2025

1k2byuf,Stuck and not sure how to get back up,"I'm a 32yo woman living in London. About this time last year my life started going to shit: I was let go from my job (I was making +100k £ and worked in AI in a niche financial/investment sector), my long term relationship started to crumble, I had a health scare, got another job and was let go again.

I kept my flat after the break up because I needed a bit of stability, but I've been draining my savings with this crazy rent. I've applied to \~250 jobs in the past year, and I'm either too senior (a lot of job offers for grad students now), or companies don't even get back to me, or they always pick someone else. Lowering my salary expectations (by a lot) hasn't worked either.

I might get a crappy low paying remote job soon (been living with hopes for a while now though), but I don't even know why I'm staying here anymore. I don't know if I should move from the UK, stay in London but in a flatshare, or what to do with my life.

I'm a very resilient person, but I'm just feeling extremely low right now. The relatively few times I get interviews, my hopes keep going up only to crush and burn a few weeks later. I feel my life has crumbled in all aspects that matter. I thought I was going to buy a house last year (can't get a mortgage because I don't have employment), and build a family with my ex partner. Everything in my life tanked, and I don't know how to get up anymore. Not only these 250+ rejections from jobs, but I've been handling other ""no-s"" from life and I can't just take it anymore.

Other insecurities are starting to creep in, like of course I stay up to date with the market, but not having to work for 1.5 years now I don't even know if I'm capable to keep up with the tech world. Also, it seems working in finance or in my old industry works only if you have referrals and my old team was all based in the US or can't help anyway. I don't have contacts or the network here. The only 2 people I know here I'm too ashamed to contact because it would mean showing up as desperate, which is a repellent for this sector.

I come from nothing, and I've worked extremely hard my whole life to set aside a bit of savings. I still have a tiny bit left, but it won't last long with all these expenses and no income, and it just makes me depressed seeing that I spent 30k + missed salary just to survive here (yes, I had to cut back from anything fun/surplus that I was doing before, I've literally just stayed home applying for jobs) and now will floor the savings of a lifetime.

Should I move back with my parents? Should I start travelling the world and fuck everything I was planning for? Should I just stay here and have faith that something will come up?

2. Learn jwellery design and cancel my abroad plan.

1k27wzw,If I could give one piece of career advice to young people : Work as many Summer/temporary/shitty jobs as possible before you Graduate.,"M30, Architect. Happy in my career — and I owe a lot of that to something I never expected: working crappy part-time jobs.

It’s only now, looking back, that I truly appreciate the value of all the temporary jobs I worked through high school and college. From age 16 to 23, I did it all — bars, restaurants, nightclubs, manual labor, furniture removal, Uber Eats. I hated most of them at the time, but they gave me something I didn’t realise I’d carry with me: perspective.

Now, when I have a rough day at the office, I remind myself: *At least I'm not halfway through a 12-hour restaurant shift with three more lined up that week. At least I'm not lugging a sofa up 12 flights of stairs in a building with no lift, with an entire truck left to unload. At least I'm not out in the freezing cold mixing concrete.*  
I get to sit down. I get to work with my brain. I get to *breathe*.

Meanwhile, I’ve noticed some friends — great people — who never worked before graduating. For them, their first “bad day” is their *first* bad day. They’ve got nothing to benchmark it against. I don’t think they fully grasp what a genuinely hard day feels like.

If I ever have kids, I’ll 100% be encouraging them to take on part-time jobs. Not because they need to ""toughen up,"" but because those experiences gave me a wider lens on life — and I honestly think I’m happier because of it.",XK150F,70,0.9200000166893005,19,1744990691,2025-04-18 15:38:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k27wzw/if_i_could_give_one_piece_of_career_advice_to/,4,2025

1k27jki,Staying vs leaving,"Omg okay- A little back story…. I currently work at an Urgent Care in a city with a decent amount of tweakers and unhoused. I also work on the west side of town so you can imagine I get a lot of characters. My clinic sees roughly around 50-70 people a day. I can handle the angry and aggressive people and for the most part I can handle the tweakers. Per our policy I literally can’t check anybody in that doesn’t have a photo ID and you can imagine that creates a few issues when my coworker will check the unhoused in without photo IDs. They come back when I’m working and I refuse to check them in bc I could literally get fired for it. 

TW - Long story short a few weeks ago I had this guy come in and threaten to “slit his arteries” so I would be forced to check him in which wasn’t the craziest threat I’ve had. But a few weeks after that this extremely aggressive guy came in. I was the only person at the desk and for some reason none of my coworkers happened to be around when this happened so I didn’t have backup - we happened to be on telemed this day and this guy came in for something we literally couldn’t help him with bc we had no doctor on site. He starts screaming at me bc I’m a lying bitch and I just don’t want to help him blah blah blah. Trying to calm him down and explain that our provider was out sick he decided to come up to the desk and get in my face. A little intimidating but I was fine. He moves the plastic guard that’s hanging in between us and starts screaming in my face TW: he says over and over that he is going to blow my fucking brains out. Do I understand what that means? And just kept getting closer and closer and more in my face. 

I was stunned. Literally too scared to call for help and it was just me and this guy. After he left I was terrified everytime the door would open bc that was a very serious situation and what if it was that guy coming back. Anyway, that was strike 3 for me. I literally don’t get paid enough or have the staff support to help with this. When I told my regional what had happened she told me that I should have called the cops because that’s scary and not ok. I asked if we could hire full time security and she said it’s probably unlikely. 

So I take it serious to gtfo of there. I end up getting offered this job that will pay me $2 more, and it’s basically like a girl boss corporate call center. I’ll be dealing with scheduling caregivers and clients all day and they said it’s pretty busy. 

I’ve never worked in that kind of setting before but it’s better money, shitty benefits but all I care abt is the pto and I’ll get that after 90 days. I’d be working 4 10s after training but I currently work 4 12s so that’s not a big deal.

This is where I don’t know what to do. I put in my two weeks, the regional calls me - says she declined my offer and what can they do to get me to stay. They said they will move me locations and see if they can counter offer the pay that this new place is gonna give me. 

After months of being ghosted by employers I felt like this was a really good opportunity to get out of urgent care but then I got that offer. 

I can stay at urgent care, switch locations and probably get more pay. Only work 3 12s and my benefits are nice OR I can take this new gig, get more pay, get pto AND get out of urgent care but I only have 1 day off with my partner… 

I have no idea what to choose, please give your advice and how you would approach this situation.

1k24ucz,Assigned a coworker’s task because he “isn’t comfortable doing it”,"Hello. I started working at a home restoration company that helps home owner fix house damages caused by floods, fire, hurricanes, mold, etc. 

On the website posting it said my responsibilities would be: 

- Scheduling jobs 
- Data entry 
- Speaking with Homeowners 
- Sending our invoices to public adjusters

We have another guy that works there and he is the estimator. He is the one the creates the big bill (adds material costs, hours, type of work done) and later submits it to insurance companies. 

I met the manager twice but he has not been in the office since. 

When I was being trained by the young lady that I was replacing we received a phone call from insurance and they wanted to discuss the bill created by our estimator. I asked her if he is going to be taking the call since he is the one who has the knowledge on it and she said no. 

I asked her “If he is the one who creates the bill, and the only one here with knowledge on it on this, wouldn’t it make sense for HIM to take these calls?” 
 
She proceeds to whisper “He isn’t comfortable speaking on the phone” 

She takes the phone call and the insurance guy starts berating her telling her that the entire bill is inaccurate, that the prices we added there are in correct and that the charges on it seem made up. 

With the limited knowledge she has she opens the file and tries to explain everything the best way she can and she is told she is wrong. 

The Estimator is hearing all this and he’s not even chiming in and as soon as she hangs up she proceeds to tell her “You should have said this! You should have explained that I added this to the bill because of xyw” 

This seems stupid as hell to me. If HE KNOWS about the information being requested by the insurance companies why is HE not speaking ??? 

The girl left for maternity leave and now I’m in charge and I’ve been ignoring these calls because 1. I was never trained on them 2. He refuses to help. 3. When I tell him there’s a call he is completely silent and doesn’t care. 


How do I bring this up to the manager the next time I see him and would I be wrong for throwing him under the bus ???

1k23p7a,Burned out and royally fucked up,"Burned out and I fucked up big time

So I work at a small company, with almost 10 yrs of experience in my field. The company is a cooperative—so we are all theoretically ""senior"" with decision making capacities and all manage our own parts of the job. We are extremely understaffed for the amount of work that we do, went from 3 to 4 to 2 people in my department and with plenty of internal chaos over the three years I've been at this company, and we are now not in a position to hire relief. I am one of the newest members in the company and others have been there twenty years.

The internal chaos was related to personnel issues in the company which external HR was eventually brought in to manage. This was now roughly a year ago, and then some, but the problem was an employee in my department who started not long after I did and was doing no work with major liabilities to us as a studio, and then accusing us of racism and hostility as justifications for her poor performance. Before these accusations came up, I was a major driver in the company of trying to get her on a PIP which we don't have a culture of at this office and there was huge pushback. This led to my initial feeling of burnout as it took 18mo to push her out and get her to agree to leave, and then the financial impact of paying for someone doing appreciably NO work during this time. My feeling at the time was, ""Why should I bother? How much is my own hard work worth if they're all so willing to tolerate this nonsense?"" The fourth member of the department retired on good terms. There was a parallel though less devastating experience in another department, trying to get someone nonperforming to leave the company, which also ultimately resolved.

At first, everything went much smoother with our shared workloads, despite now being 2 people, since we could handle the work directly ourselves without any intervening agents of chaos. But gradually, both the burnout and the overwork started to catch up to me, deeping my burnout, my stress and my burden of work to catch up. Now I am the agent of chaos and I'm not sure what to do, because some of these choices I've made were poor choices that lacked integrity and have also had liability for us. And it's been enduring for some time.

Basically, I have been lying about doing work or the state of work being done or not done and the timing of it for about a year. I am typically high achieving and my joining this cooperative was expressed to me as a real boon for my skill and experience. At the same time, I have felt the environment between the 2 of us in the department has been a pressure cooker. I have flagged for more than a year that I'm overwhelmed, feel wholy incapable of handling all my responsibilities, they've been seeing some element of my sloppiness as I forget things, leave critical emails unanswered, leave projects to flounder, and generate real emergencies both financially ans reptuationally for clients. It has both material costs and opportunity costs. When I raise this to my colleague in my department, with 20yrs of experience, his only answer is basically: knuckle down, be more efficient, be more effective. Obviously that has done nothing but make me more incapacitated, slower, unmotivated, overwhelmed, trying to keep plates spinning. And I stuck to my lies, getting more elaborate and more plates spinning. 

Another element at play is that my one colleague, though he's a core member, is famously one of the difficult characters on our team. He is extremely demanding of himself and others, generates a huge amount of work and with experience quickly, but he's a very difficult person to disagree with. If, for example, I propose approaching a project in a different manner, if he doesn't agree, he will just keep pushing me to go along with his view. Sometimes this is based on experience, sometimes the disagreement is about two paths through a non-obvious situations with different pros and cons, and whatever he prefers is the way he expects this to work. Sometimes those preferences are about buying myself mental or emotional space, which at times might trade off a financial consequence for a consequences on me, my mood, and capacity. Of course, other people working in this pressure cooker have also gotten their work to me sloppy and late, and we're all trying to juggle for each other, some with more success than others. My role and my colleague's are extremely critical direction-setting roles dealing with both long range decision-making and immediate, intense deadlines. They are quite specialized so I'm not very easily replaceable. We're not in a position to hire, both because of a combined slump in our industry and the actual financial costs of paying two staff salaries for at least two years who were a drain rather than a contribution to our work. The latter part is poor decision-making on the part of my cooperative mates and originated before I started—meaning management and personnel are not a strong suit of those who have been here longest.

It came to a head this week, when I announced I was taking a week off for burnout because I was truly beyond coping. Come what may, time to pay the piper etc. (This has also had an impact on my physical heart health and I'm learning from binge-reading burnout resources and talking with my therapist that stress management and boundaries and self care are all critical components I've let slide while chasing work.) Several colleagues then insisted I hand over my work, trying I believe to catch me in lies (fair enough) which pushed me into a panic attack yesterday. I am also recognizing that beyond workload, there is an interpersonal dynamic. Not just being denied autonomy in my work that is hyptothecially mine (and which I feel I've now proven unworthy OF), but also this pressure cooker mentality. I know I should have flagged my state of affairs with my work performance and accomplishments before, and I can't quite put my finger on why I so elaborately lied and hid it, except that it felt like what I had to do to get breathing room. Obviously as my mental health and capacity tanked, it all snowballed.

So, I've asked for the next 10 days off to rest and cope from burnout. My colleagues are pressing me to hand them work or admit to things before then. I countered and asked for some solutions that would allow me some grace to resolve things my way, and my direct colleague and I locked horns where I told him he was railroading me where as he has before.

Where do I start? How can I repair my own sense of dignity and autonomy, but also my trustworthiness? What can change in a studio where we're a cooperative looking after our small business together but that leaves more decision making to personality and soft pressure tactics? I am trying to wrap my mind around how I got myself here, and know that in another company these may all have been fireable offenses. 

Any advice, wisdom or perspective is very very much welcome.",f1rstpancake,3,1.0,0,1744979211,2025-04-18 12:26:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k23p7a/burned_out_and_royally_fucked_up/,4,2025
1k239kk,"So much drama, so little time!","TL/DR If a staff makes an allegation against another staff, does management have to verify the allegation before proceeding with disciplinary action?

Lol no but seriously. A newly hired coworker hasn't been here 30 days yet I have a meeting this morning with my director and could really use some technical feedback on HR policy/procedure. 

Let me TRY to tell a long story fast. April 3 a meeting was held and a new policy rolled out that my dept and another should send emails to inform one another about PTO. 

I took of 4/15 but forgot to send the email, however there was signage on my office door and auto replies set on my email stating my PTO. She contacted my director to report this and that I'm habitually late. Our  My director sent me an email on this but only after sending a Teams message to our regional group chat, disclosing to my teammates that she would be having a meeting with me about the allegations.

Next week I'm out a few days so I sent the email. My coworker sent a reply saying ""Thanks for letting me know. I did take notice of this on your memo posted for the residents"". I feel like she's playing mind games. 

Additional context I've been in my position for 2 ½ years and my current director was my director at our last job and recruited me to take this position. Last month she gave me a positive performance review, a bonus and a raise. Her email says ""Please consider this a final notice regarding this topic"" This is the FIRST notice on this topic. Can a first notice be a final notice? 

I welcome responses about what a messy weirdo this coworker is but more substantive, what's the onus on a manager to corroborate allegations before proceeding with disciplinary action?

1k2303v,"If someone is not suitable for a job, how will it manifest and affect other aspects in their life?","I'm sorry for posting this here, but I figure this is a career-related question. Has any of you worked a job that you are not a fit for? How did you manage it?

Some context: My girlfriend studied engineering in school, and she liked it. She is a tomboyish, introverted girl who loves hands-on stuff. However, her first job out of school is in consulting, which consists of a very different working style compared to engineering. She has to socialise a lot and is forcing herself to do so, such that she has some physical health issues right now. People in her company are also loud and, in a way, rude. They insult people openly, and the boss isn't supportive. One good thing is that she said her colleagues are helpful and they support each other. It's very conflicting. The workload is also EXTREME. I'm talking about having to work on weekends, and almost every day until midnight. She is easily irritated nowadays, and she admitted it. She snapped over small things outside of work, regardless of whether or not it's with her friends, family or with me. As someone who is closest to her and whom she comes to me to talk about work stress a lot, I experience her irritation a lot. I recognised her pattern, and recently, I just let her be when she rants, without asking many questions. Her work issues seem to be endless, where every day is bad (with some aspects of good). I think her mental health is really bad right now. She doesn't suit such a job due to her character and personality. But unfortunately, she is a hardworking person with a little bit of a ""people pleaser"" tendency. It is hard to talk her out of the job. On certain days, she does say that she wants to quit and go for another more suitable job. But it's been all words.

My question is, has anyone experienced something similar before, and what was it like for you? ",PomegranateIll9332,2,0.6700000166893005,9,1744976959,2025-04-18 11:49:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k2303v/if_someone_is_not_suitable_for_a_job_how_will_it/,4,2025
1k22tw8,Graceful Exit,"I've been working for an IT company for about 4 years and have been handling managing our services practically solo.  Industry standards and discussions with in IT communities and vendors say we should have a team of 4-5 people based on environments.

For the past two years, I've been begging for help as there is an insane backlog of tickets and projects that I can't do alone. I've been given an entry level technician to try to assist with work load a couple times, but it always became to much for them to handle and they leave the company. 

These have only been selected by ""people management know"" and no one actually right for the job. They have refused to post an open position publicly to find someone with the proper experience to help me and seem fine letting me handle it all.

I've hit my limit and have two offers lined up now. Me leaving will be catastrophic to the business ( not trying to toot my horn here, but I'm the only one that knows anything about how to administer and use our entire service stack.) I do like most of the people in the company and know two weeks will put them in a panic. My job offers are both willing to let me give a months notice so I can train someone properly before my exit as I don't want to cause harm to the day to day for my colleagues. There is also a grey line of non compete in these transition offers and taking the high road would likely lessen them from wanting to make an aggressive move. I will not be disclosing to them where I'm going beyond ""considering multiple offers and will be resigning in 4 weeks.""

Any reason I shouldn't give a months notice to allow them time to properly get someone trained as my replacement?

1k22g66,Need your advice-- which internship offer should I take?,"Hey everyone! Just for context, I’m an international student from Monterrey, Mexico, studying at an Ivy League school in the U.S :). I plan to go back home in a few years to take over my family’s real estate development/real estate private equity firm.

Yesterday, I got an offer for a summer internship at a very prestigious consulting firm’s Mexico City office. A friend in the industry in Mexico City told me they have a pretty solid track record of giving return offers to interns. I feel like consulting would help me hone the financial/managerial skill set I need before transitioning into my family business. The WLB might not be the best, but it's just 8 weeks and would save me from having to go through recruiting senior year. The prestige definitely also helps long-term, especially since I'm planning to pursue an MBA eventually. I also think it's super cool that I get to travel and have the chance to work globally, even if it's for work.

With that being said, I just accepted another offer before this one came in (they gave me a pretty tight deadline). It’s with a global cement company based in Monterrey, so I’d be home (a huge plus), and the project I was assigned to is perfectly aligned with my goals in REPE. However, I just found out they’re not planning to give return offers, which makes it feel more like a one-off experience rather than something I can use to build my career, as I'd most likely not be assigned to the same team/project if I decide to re-apply for full time (how much can I really learn in 8 weeks?). The WLB is excellent (6-hour workdays), but I’m worried I’d be limiting myself too early career-wise compared to the broader exposure consulting offers.

I’m super torn-- I'd really appreciate any advice! Tysm :))

So I have no idea what to say or even any about what they are saying. 

I am not that introverted at school and I have plenty of friends and I feel comfortable there.

I never really found a job in this industry besides a little bit of basic freelance work, and a short stint at a printing factory, where I wasn't even doing graphic design work. Maybe a year or so ago however I finally decided I wasn't ever going to get a job in this industry. It's just not a creative process I connect with and it's also currently in shambles due to AI and other tech developments, I really don't see much point perusing it for any reason. 

So since University however I have been working warehousing/store person jobs. I HATE logistics though it is boring, mind numbing work that doesn't even pay enough.

I just don't know what path to go down, I thought I was creative and I wanted a creative career but the reality of that seems unlikely, I feel so lost and confused. I also feel like I now only have experience in warehousing so it feels like I am going to forever be stuck here. When I go to seek to look for other jobs I automatically get recommended more warehousing roles, and they seem to be the only ones that respond to my job applications as well.

1k20ywx,My boss’s boss is trying to convince her to not give me a promotion.,"I’m changing names for anonymity FYI. I (32F) work in finance and I recently applied for an assistant manager position. I have worked with my manager, Valerie, for 3 years and this is the second time I have applied for assistant manager with her encouragement. The last time, I was not going to be her AM directly, but this time I applied for the position that opened under her. Her boss, Janice, doesn’t seem to like me very much and has actively denied me opportunities for advancement. The most recent time was when the previous AM and Valerie requested I be promoted to a Lead role. She denied it and had a LAUNDRY LIST of feedback about me. Some of it was insane like she wanted me to “bleed for the company” and that I look like I roll out of bed and come to work (a combination of vague and discriminatory statements). My managers were so confused and upset. My AM actually went comment by comment with Janice refuting everything she said about me, but she wouldn’t budge and I wasn’t given the promotion. (In response to me “bleeding for the company” I told them “this is my career, not a cult. No.”) Now my previous AM has been promoted and Valerie is full force on having me fill that open spot. Janice acted like she was on board until today. There were two other applicants and we all interviewed today. Janice nit-picked every single thing I said. I’m already a deeply nervous interviewer and she just kept pushing and pushing and I left my interview feeling like I bombed it. Valerie called me after work to assure my that I didn’t, I stayed composed a professional, and to inform me that they decided to move me to the next stage. She told me not to worry and it’s in the bag. However, one of my friends from work called me because she got a different scoop from Valerie, who I think was trying to save my feelings. Apparently after I left my interview, Janice tried to convince Valerie to give the position to a different applicant: An entry level employee who has no previous management or finance experience, who has not completed even a quarter of the training I have. Just as a small example of my qualifications, I’m literally receiving an award for my efforts in coaching my team to increase sales last quarter. So I’m not a slouch. This other applicant has nothing to recommend her besides a delightful attitude, and couldn’t answer Valerie’s basic questions about how she coaches others. Because the position is going to be under Valerie, she gets a say in who fills it, but Janice is her boss so she also gets a say. The next step in the process is the final step and it’s a meeting with the VP and it’s a “get to know you” session. During my entire time at this company, I have never heard of more than 1 applicant being chosen for the final step. Valerie has been with the company 10 years, and she’s never seen that either. Until today. Janice insisted that the other applicant also move to the next stage, against Valerie’s wishes.
I’ve told Valerie this before, but I do feel like I have to work twice as hard as everyone around me to get what I want. I feel like people who work directly with me tend to have a very high opinion of me and like me an awful lot. I’m great at networking, and I have incredibly loyal clients who have nothing but great things to say about me. But if there’s even a single degree of separation, I am deeply disliked. I left my previous job for the same reason. My manager really loved me and wanted me to be her assistant since she was getting an additional one, but the GM didn’t like me, so I was denied the opportunity to even apply. I have ADHD and an Anxiety disorder so I know that plays a part in how I present myself to upper management, and I’ve been burned so many times, I tend to overthink every interaction or I become shy and reserved. I basically expect to be disliked at this point. However, the comments about my appearance (I feel like I’m pretty by the way and I take care of myself and dress professionally) and the way she is actively attempting to sabotage my progression feels blatantly biased and discriminatory. I honestly don’t know what else to do. I can’t imagine continuing to work for this company that I genuinely love and has treated me so well if I get passed up for this promotion all because one cog in the machine seemingly hates my guts. But also, if I do get promoted, how much am I going to have to watch my back? How many times will I be subjected to her telling Valerie “I told you so” when I make a mistake? How much is this woman going to make me hate my job? I’ve been working since I was 18 and honestly I’m so tired of this feeling like I’m never good enough. I’m so tired of getting torn down for every bad AND good thing I do. The quote “people will tear the flesh from you, then talk about how terrible your bones look” comes to mind. 
I’m the sole breadwinner in my household right now as my parter lost his job in tech. All I want is to be properly compensated for the work I do so I can better support my family unit. I don’t know what steps to take to combat this awful woman who wants to squeeze all the work out of me but not promote me and pay me for it. I’m lost.

Present Day: We chose to relocate to Atlanta (closer to home, similar COL, job opportunities, etc), and decided to get married and relocate all in one go rather than waiting another year before moving. We've been on the job hunt, and recently spent the weekend in Atlanta looking at potential places (to rent). We're now at the point where we need to secure a place but haven't landed jobs (wife already put in her notice and I can't keep my job if we move), and the thought of leaving my 127k salary without a backup scares the shit outta me (grew up lower class). We have about 20k in an emergency fund (~6 months of expenses) but I've had a job since 14 so the thought of choosing to be unemployed makes me nervous. 

Additional Context: Work in Finance but my expertise is reporting and dashboards using systems like Excel and Tableau so not sure how easily I'll be able to land a similar job with somewhat similar pay - also contributing to my anxiety lol. 

Would relocating to a new city with no potential job lined up be a not-so-smart decision, even if you have a 'rainy day fund'? Any advice?

1k1znze,Is there still hope left ?,"Hi people, 25M, in desperate need of some genuine advice. I am mentally struggling with my current situation. So, from my college i was placed into one of the big 4 (D) as an analyst, and have been working with them from 2022 onwards. I have been working in data engineering domain. I have been working with fortune 500 clients since my start. I was promoted to consultant after 2 yrs of service and am the top performer this year and last year as well.

But the pain point here is: i am being paid seriously low for my level, and industry standards. Hence i decided to switch. I have been preparing for data engineering roles, since november last year. I was particularly weak in DSA part, hence i was preparing as good as i could, still doing. I practiced SQL, core concepts of Data Engineering subjects etc. I gave a significant amount of time on my resume preparation, talked to various colleagues, friends and talent people and made the perfect resume.

I made a list of companies in which i would like to work, mostly product based brands or MBBs. I connected with various professionals and got referrals for the role, and applied. I even made separate resumes for each company and role in which i wanted to apply tailored to their respective job descriptions. But, recently, i have been seeing outright rejections, and i am afraid that i may never even get a chance for switching.

With these outright rejections, with no context whatsover, my confidence is completely shattered. I really dont know what i can do, what i should do. It is my first switch, and i know for some of you this may seem childish or nit something to cry this much about, but to whoever resonated with this, i really would your appreciate your advice. I haveen getting really bad thoughts lately, and have been questioning my every decision, whatever i made, whatever i have done. Self doubt is at the peak. Maybe even my current job that i got was a fluke, maybe i got lucky, and will never get lucky again. Maybe even though i am top performer, maybe the others are not doing so well, and maybe with avg work too, i am being top performer, all this is messing up my head soo much.

There has not been a single positive ray of hope since last 4-5 months. Either i am being rejected or the status is under-review, and they are not replying.

Please help! What should i do, how should i see things and how can i improve amd achieve my goals, i am willing to work, just need some guidance.",Street-Ad8942,1,1.0,3,1744963552,2025-04-18 08:05:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1znze/is_there_still_hope_left/,4,2025
1k1zfnm,Should I ask my husband to be a stay at home dad?,"My husband and I have an infant and I am currently on maternity leave. We agreed that we would hire a professional nanny to care for our infant when I return to work for the first 2-3 years then transition our baby to daycare after that. I am personally strongly against doing daycare for an infant. We understand that hiring a professional nanny as opposed to daycare will be a more expensive route especially because we want to use an agency, but we weighed the pros and cons and ultimately decided that a nanny will be the best fit for us and we can effort it with our current budget. 

But I am now second guessing whether it is worth hiring someone and paying them more than what my husband is currently earning. My husband makes around $52,000/annually. My annual salary alone can cover our entire budget and we already have a great emergency fund. 

I am questioning whether it makes sense to pay a professional nanny + agency fees, which will be around $60,000/year as opposed to him just being a stay-at-home dad. He takes good care of our baby and I trust him more than anyone else to be with our baby. 

He has aspirations to move up the corporate latter and make more money in the future, so I don’t want to selfishly tell him to just be a stay-at-home dad and focus on building our family business that we want to get off the ground this year and day trade (something he loves to do, but currently does not have time with his new job).

When I proposed the idea to him initially, he stated that he would not be comfortable not chipping into our finances and he doesn’t want to lose or have a gap of any corporate work from his resume. 

Should I push the idea again? What should we do? ",scapegoatkid_97,87,0.7799999713897705,284,1744962573,2025-04-18 07:49:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1zfnm/should_i_ask_my_husband_to_be_a_stay_at_home_dad/,4,2025

1k1xbxi,Feeling like i'm messing up my career with my decisions.,"I have a BBA and MBA in accounting and a little context on my job history.
2 years in AR, I left this job because I was way underpaid.
6 months as what was suppose to be an accountant but turned out to be toxic, spent 6 months and didn't touch not one accounting software instead I became the controller's therapist and the rude CFO's admin. 
1.7 year as a payment technician this was a contract role and now I'm 4 months in at a big4 accounting firm. This position was suppose to finally help me grow in my accounting career especially after getting my MBA but I hate it so much and want to run as well, public accounting is awful. I hate the work that I do, the long hours(busy season never end) and the constant micromanaging.

While I have an excuse to leave every job that I've had, I think not seeing it through has affected my career growth and now I don't know how to not be seen as a job hopper or complainer.

I hate my new job, it gives me the worst anxiety but I've never been blessed with an accounting job to give me the relevant experience. I'm afraid this is my only chance to gain the experience to pivot in my accounting career and not remain entry level. 

I'd love to see my current job through but mentally I can't cope and right now I feel like for any other accounting jobs my resume will be passed on because of my work history. I'm starting to think maybe the career i desire just isn't for me. 

I am also getting an offer to come back permanent at the contract role but while it's loved that job, I'm overqualified for it and will be taking a paycut and won't be gaining any growth or experience relevant to my degree. It's finance, Idk where that experience would lead me to in terms of growth. Initially i took that job out of desperation.

1k1x3bc,Political Science grad with no experience - where do I even start?,"I’m 22 and feeling pretty lost about what to do next. I’ve wanted to be a TV editor since high school, but I was encouraged to take a “safer” route, so I majored in Political Science at a high-ranking university.

While in school, my primary goal was still filmmaking, and I produced and edited student films to build experience. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get an internship, partly due to the WGA/SAG-AFTRA strikes and financial constraints after graduation.

After graduation, I struggled to break into the entertainment industry, and started working full-time as a bank teller just to make ends meet. It was supposed to be temporary, but it’s dragged on and I’ve become miserable. I’ve realized I need a real backup plan, but I’ve never seriously considered any career outside of film. And without any internships or relevant experience, my Poli Sci degree feels hard to leverage.

I’m looking for an entry-level job (ideally $40K+ with room to grow). I’d love something with flexible hours so I can still freelance edit on the side, but that's not a dealbreaker. I studied Political Science because I've always been interested in American politics and government, but since then I've also realized I really love organizing data and making spreadsheets. I'm not sure how to make a career out of any of that.

However, is that all there is to it? I know some people who get sponsored to move to other countries by the same company they're working for remotely, just to pretty much do the same kind of work. There’s no shortage in their country for the role, and the person they migrated can do the job remotely and wasn't even required to go to the office.

1k1uo02,Big Move Worth it??,"I’m a recent graduate from a state school in the northeast and just got offered a full-time analyst position at a fast-growing fintech company in the Pacific Northwest. The job comes with a $50-57k salary and a relocation package.

The team and role seem genuinely exciting. It's very collaborative, fast-paced, and probably a great environment to learn and grow early in my career. 

That said, the pay feels pretty low, especially compared to what I might earn staying in the Northeast. The move would also be a major life change, cross-country, away from family and friends, my girlfriend, and to a city where I don’t know anyone.

I’m torn between:

* Taking the leap for the experience and hoping it sets me up long-term
* Staying put and holding out for a better-paying opportunity closer to home

Part of me feels crazy for even thinking about turning it down, since it seems like such a great opportunity on paper, but I can’t ignore how much the pay and move are weighing on me. Has anyone else taken a lower-paying but possibly high-potential opportunity far from home, especially as a new grad? Was it worth it in the long run?

1k1un95,Advice needed/venting - Not being promoted is leaving me to question my job.,"For context, I work in a small-mid size accounting firm in the marketing department. I’ve been here for about 3 years now. When I got hired, it was to replace a marketing analyst that had left. There were no other analysts for about 2.5 years so it was just me and my boss building out the marketing program and what not. He’s consistently stood out for me in a few different ways and to this day, I feel as though he is a good leader. 

Since then, the firm has gotten bigger. Sometime last year, my boss told me that our marketing team would grow bigger as well. He mentioned that we would be hiring 2-3 new analysts. He said that he was expecting to be promoted soon to an officer position and after that happens, either me or one of the new analysts would replace his role as Marketing Manager. He even mentioned that he wants me to take on more leadership in my own role. So of course this gave me hope that I would be next in line for the role and that my chances were high, having more experience and also being a part of building the marketing program.

6 months ago, we got around to hiring 2 new people. I’ve been taking more charge since then with training the 2 new people, reviewing their work on top of mine, and just showing them their way around everything. I also feel like I’ve taken on more responsibility with the shift in our department. 

Last week, my manager held a meeting with the team. He pretty much explained that they are pulling this manager from another department and that person will now be the new Marketing Manager in the next few weeks as my manager was getting promoted. During the meeting, I honestly felt shocked to even say anything and the same with the other 2 analysts so no one really said anything. No questions, nothing. 

I feel blindsided and feel like my hopes were just crushed. I’ve been working hard because I thought I had a chance, only for them to hire someone who I didn’t even think was an option. Not sure how I feel with getting a new manager since the dynamics of the team might change once everything is official. What would you do in this situation? Would you leave and look elsewhere? Advice needed.

Also wanna add, I love my job and the only issue I have with it is the pay as I don’t feel fairly compensated. I know I’m underpaid compared to the market but the only thing that was keeping me satisfied was that I had a great team, good manager, and also the hope of getting that manager role.",IcyNoise2194,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1744944392,2025-04-18 02:46:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1un95/advice_neededventing_not_being_promoted_is/,4,2025

1k1t12k,My secrets to maximizing every website for job hunting (all with $0 cost),"My goal has always been to exploit every job-related website as much as possible, without paying for any premium or membership. I dig deep to uncover their hidden treasures and make sure no capitalist gets a single cent of my money 🤓☝️ (well…, except for ChatGPT). By combining all these free resources and arming myself with ChatGPT, I turned into a relentless job-searching machine. Results: 3 internships during college, and 2 full-time offers before graduation.

**Job application: different websites for different target roles**  
LinkedIn: Better for Large & Mid-Sized Companies: 1.Find jobs posted in the past 1 hour: Just change 86400 in the job search URL to 3600 2.Follow as many team leaders as you can find: They often post job openings directly on their LinkedIn pages instead of official listings. Many will ask candidates to comment on their background under the post or leave an email. If your background fits what they’re looking for, they will reach out to you for an interview!  
Indeed: Better for Mid-Sized & Small Companies  
A great place for entry-level roles and non-tech positions. Application process is simple, but roles can be highly competitive due to the volume of applicants.  
Handshake: Better for Startups & Student Internships  
Especially useful for students. Many schools are partnered with Handshake, and I personally landed 2 internships through it. It’s reliable, internship-focused, and often features companies actively hiring students.  
**Interview Prep: exploit their free resources**  
Exponents: I won't tell anyone that most of their paid courses can be checked for free on YouTube...  
AMA Interview: 1. Only after registering, you can check their free real question banks covering many positions. At least I don't have to collect them manually from Google 2.Their Chrome extension, which is also completely free, can predict LinkedIn job posting interview questions (it predicts based on the company's historical question database, I met the same questions when I interviewed with BCG). It has a free function that can predict recruiters' personalities based on their LinkedIn profile, but I didn't get the point.  
**Resume Customization:**  
Any resume tools: No paid resume websites are required. You just need an ATS-friendly template, and the resume content can be completely generated by ChatGPT. Just ask it to tailor your experience for the roles you're applying to.  
Coursera: No need to buy or complete any certifications. Each course section costs around $200, a complete waste of money. The only feature is that it links to your LinkedIn, which I honestly don’t see any value in. No recruiter will take it seriously. If you urgently need practical skills, just go to YouTube.",OfComputer,2,1.0,1,1744939174,2025-04-18 01:19:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1t12k/my_secrets_to_maximizing_every_website_for_job/,4,2025
1k1sxmj,favoritism in the workplace making me unmotivated,"I’ve been a Sr. Analyst at my current company for 2 years (8 YOE total + MBA) and have been pushing for a promotion to Manager (IC). After months of asking, my boss finally met with me and dropped a new requirement: I need to develop a ""generalist"" skillset because my specialist role (analytics/reporting) can only go so far. This was never mentioned before—in fact, a few months ago, he emphasized improving my technical skills (Looker), which I’ve been doing via a major Q1 project.  

A day before, I asked my skip level manager about the promotion. He claimed my insights are ""surface level""— despite him previously asking for simplicity because higher ups don’t want to look for the answer. My work involves collaborating with sales leaders/execs who are extremely particular about their Salesforce/Looker dashboards, so I tailor everything to their needs. Funny how this critique only comes up now.  

He also spent half the time raving about a guy on our team who got promoted within a year of us starting —without him asking — because they were afraid he’d leave after giving him a big project.  It makes sense to promote after the project but before it, makes no sense to me. Coincidentally, my skip level, manager, and this guy all worked at the same previous company, and get lunch together. Meanwhile, women on my team (myself included) express interest in other skills and get dismissed. There have been women on the team worthy of a promotion but had to actively advocate for themselves and write up why they deserve a promotion. 

I’ve never had a bad review here (or at my past 4 jobs), but I’ve left roles before when self-advocacy went nowhere. The office politics are exhausting. The only reasons I stay are the work itself (which I enjoy), my hands-off boss (because I deliver without issue), and the 4-day workweek.

1. How do you deal with demotivation after being undervalued?

1k1s358,Job Offer,"Hi! There was a job offered as an Analyst with EvolveNXT on Handshake, and I applied, and the interview process was only three rounds; the company is a startup so there isn't an HR team, the first round was with a project manager (acting as HR), the second round was with the COO and involved a case study, and the third round was the Commissions team, and then I was offered the job; I am based in EST, and the company is PST but it is a remote role, and the job offer was sent a day after the third round, with no phone call for salary negotiation (since there is no HR), and I was given a day to accept the offer, but asked for an extension as well as a call to speak about compensation and benefits, and was told a time to speak but got sick so I had to postpone the call again (and was told that travel was going on, and had to ask for 5-10 min for a quick call); the compensation was not negotiated (but I didnt expect more for an entry level role in this job market), and it seems that I am overqualified for the role; when I accepted the offer, there was radio silence for a day and a half, and asked for the process to be sped up since I have to give 2 weeks notice to my part time job, and then was sent a link to Paychex for information, as well as was told a background check would be conducted, but never got a link or a formal consent form which is supposed to be in compliance with the FCRA, and then was told the background check was clear (which I dont believe because it is not possible to conduct a background check with a third party service without my consent); is this fishy? Or is it common to say a background check was conducted but not actually conduct one? (do I accept the offer, and search around for other jobs in the meantime? How do I know it is not a scam?

1k1rz84,Torn Between Career in the US and Relationship Back Home — Need Advice,"I’m a 25M currently living in the USA. I moved here two years ago to pursue my Master’s and have successfully completed it. I’m now actively looking for full-time opportunities and hoping to stay here on STEM OPT, and eventually file for H1B.

Now here’s the situation:
My girlfriend (25F) is in India. We’ve been in a serious relationship for a while, and her family has been incredibly supportive—they waited for me to complete my degree. Now, her parents are ready for us to get married and are asking me to come back to India, find a job, and start our life together.

They’re willing to wait, but the reality is that she has a younger sister too. In our culture, it becomes difficult for the younger sibling to get married before the elder one. So while they’re patient, I know it’s becoming emotionally and socially burdensome for them to keep waiting.

If I get a job here in the US, I’d ideally want to work for another 2 years under STEM OPT and try for H1B. But bringing her here is complicated:
	•	F2 visa means she won’t be allowed to work, and she’s concerned about sitting idle and creating a career gap.
	•	F1 visa is an option, but it brings financial strain due to tuition fees and potential student loans again.

At the same time, if I go back to India, I don’t know if I’ll be able to get a job with a decent package. After studying in the US, I’d be hoping for something around 10+ LPA, but it’s hard to say if that will materialize right away — especially since I’ll be competing with a different job market.

So I feel stuck between two tough choices:
	1.	Stay in the US – Focus on building my career and future here, try to bring her along eventually, but face delays in marriage and strain on both sides.
	2.	Return to India – Get married and settle down sooner, but possibly sacrifice the professional and financial opportunities I’ve worked hard for.

Has anyone been through a similar situation or found a balanced solution? I’d really appreciate hearing your perspectives or advice.

1k1pi31,Having trouble finding a fulfilling job,"I have been a bit unstable for the past 3ish years in my career and looking for advice on how to get back on track. 

After finishing my MS degree (which I did while working FT), I found a role as a project manager within the Biomedical field that I'm in. Right off the bat, I was given the lead on small projects, mainly on internal reports that I would report to my team. In the 2 years I was in the role  I really enjoyed the work, I was the lead of our global pipeline our company worked on, had several internal projects I was the lead on, and trained/onboarded several new employees.  Part of the reason I left was because about 6  months into my role, I was offloaded everything from the Sr PM who left. At about my 1.5 year mark  I began asking about how I can be promoted and was told they don't promote ppl under 5 years at the company, but to keep taking on increasingly harder projects to be considered for a promotion- not guaranteed just considered. meanwhile there was a newer Sr. PM (hired around my 8month mark) who reported to me in some of the projects we worked on together who was given the title of Sr. despite the original job ad being for a PM or Coordinator level role. While I am not necessarily chasing titles or money, I want to be respected in the work.  

I left that company and since then, only had luck getting coordinator level jobs with little to no leadership and kind of siloed into very transactional jobs. It's not fulfilling in anyway because there's really no space to grow. 

Maybe I lack the resources or just the connections  which I am aware play a very big role in this. I'm just not sure where to look to find roles in Project Management or similar leadership type roles in biomedical/pharma/clinical research that aren't over saturated. I would love suggestions for either networking events, coaches, recruitment companies, etc. I'm not really looking for resume help or how to apply to jobs bc i can always tailor that once I find resources.

1k1olll,How to count years of experience when you've bounced between related (but different) industries over time? Trying to evaluate market worth for salary purposes.,"Hello, all! I am having trouble finding answers to my questions, so I come to you Redditors for advice.

I have been an engineer for about 10 years now, more or less doing R&D stuff for hardware projects (I'm specialized in not being specialized, I guess you could say) at a few different startups over that time. The industries have varied from robotics, consumer electronics, and now aerospace.


I have been at my current role for over 2 years now and have not had a salary raise at all during this time. I want to ask for a raise, but how do I count my years of experience for my ""market value"" salary research appropriately?


I've got 10 years of experience total as an engineer, but only 2 years in the aerospace industry and I've been doing my current, primary tasks for the last 1-1.5 years. Per Glassdoor, the range of market value could swing anywhere from $9k-30k more than I make now, depending if that's 2 years experience or 10 years.


So how does one calculate ""years of experience"" when your job has varied greatly in role over time?

1k1nyt4,Private Sector vs Public Sector - Which job would you take?,"A few years ago, I was laid off and decided to pivot into a more technical career path. I went back to school and took a lower-paying contract with the local public health system to gain experience. Toward the end of that contract, I put a lot of effort into finding my next role — ultimately accepting a private sector offer at a well-known food delivery tech company. Around the same time, I also interviewed with the health system and recently received an offer there as well.

Part of me wants to prioritize job security, especially since I’ve already lost a few years of potential earning. On the other hand, I actually *enjoy* my current job — and the idea of walking away from that feels tough. I’m still relatively young, and I want to make progress toward major life milestones (buying a home, starting a family, etc.) over the next several years.

If you were in my shoes, which path would you take?

# Private Sector Strategy/Ops (Food Delivery Tech Company)

**Pros**

* Work is genuinely interesting
* Hybrid (WFH most days)
* Great culture/learning opportunities
* Could lead to higher earning potential long term

**Cons**

* Company has had multiple rounds of layoffs
* Tech industry may be vulnerable to economic shifts & AI disruption

# Public Sector (Local Health System)

**Pros**

* Strong job stability, even during downturns
* Pension eligibility after 10 years
* Can make good money over time with promotions

**Cons**

* Work isn’t very engaging (for me personally)
* Full-time in-office
* Harder to transition out of public sector/healthcare
* Career advancement takes longer",Amazing-Net-5613,1,1.0,0,1744924575,2025-04-17 21:16:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1nyt4/private_sector_vs_public_sector_which_job_would/,4,2025
1k1n5f4,"My current internship just offered me a full-time role I would LOVE, but I already accepted a really great offer elsewhere.","I (college student, graduating in May) love my current internship. The work I do is meaningful, and I grow every day because I’m trusted with a lot of responsibility and important work. The work I’ve done has actually made a significant difference at the company, I think, because my skills are such a good match for this industry and role. The company is great, and I have a great mentor here. They just offered me a full-time position that would provide me with even greater opportunity to grow and develop, and they said the end goal would be that in 6 or so years, I’d join the leadership team. They know I accepted an offer, but they want to win me over. It was flattering and exciting all at once.

However, I hate where I live right now. I’m in a college town with nothing to do and no young people aside from the students, and I don’t want to live in a place that, aside from my job, has almost nothing to do and no opportunities for growth. The business community is all mom and pop places, great, but I have ambition to be in a bigger company someday, and I'm at the biggest company here.

I have a job offer in my dream city (1.5 hours away), and it pays quite well. I don’t think I’d \*love\* the day-to-day work, but I haven’t tried it yet, so maybe I’ll be positively surprised. I wouldn’t hate the work by any means, but after all the experience with my internship, I’ve learned what I enjoy and don’t, and it’s looking like the accepted job will lean away from some of the things I enjoy most. I like the company and the people (but I don’t know either as well as my internship company, obviously).

I see my entire life in the big city, and I see my entire career at my current internship company. I think the most important things to me are location, salary, and role (in no particular order). My accepted job has location and salary, and I have no idea on role yet. My current internship company has role but not location. Salary is hard because they said they will start me with the intention of a raise after a year or two and then a raise upon leadership promotion. 

How do I decide?



Other important information:

* Because my current company is growing rapidly, they may have to hire the leadership position they’d prep me for before I’m ready and give it to someone else, in which case, I would work under them until they retire or move (so basically I’d never move up…)
* I haven’t worked at the accepted job company, so I have incomplete information and can’t make a completely accurate judgment
* As I mentioned, I’m currently at a very young company, so there is always a very, very small possibility we could fail
* Upon acceptance of the job, my current company is offering to pay for expensive exams/certifications for me that I could use should I ever leave
* My current company does not allow hybrid or remote work for the offered role
* The salary at my current company would be lower than the accepted job company",Wrong_Mall_6539,2,0.7599999904632568,4,1744922473,2025-04-17 20:41:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1n5f4/my_current_internship_just_offered_me_a_fulltime/,4,2025

1k1lq6e,Should I leave a job I like for something more stable?,"To give some background, I was laid off a few years ago and decided to pivot to a more technical career path. During this time, I went back to school and took a lower-paying contract job with the local public health system. Toward the end of that contract, I spent a lot of time and effort searching for my next role. I ultimately accepted an offer in the private sector at a well-known food delivery tech company. I also interviewed for a position with the health system and recently received an offer there as well. I'm at a pretty big crossroads in terms of career trajectory.

I've already started with the food delivery company, and so far, I actually enjoy it. The work is interesting, the compensation is solid, my coworkers are very knowledgeable, and I feel there are a lot of learning opportunities. I also get to work from home most of the time. However, the company has gone through several rounds of layoffs over the past few years, and I'm worried that if things go south, I could find myself unemployed again. On the upside, the strategy and operations experience I'm gaining here could help me land a strong corporate role down the line. The company was also acquired not long ago and now has at least some financial backing.

The public health system job is less interesting to me for a few reasons, but it does have some great advantages. The department is rarely impacted by economic downturns, and the job offers a pension I would qualify for after 10 years. The downsides are that I don't find the work particularly engaging, I would need to be in the office full-time, and transitioning out of public sector healthcare might be difficult if I chose to leave. I could still make a good living by climbing the ladder, but advancement opportunities can take a while to open up.

Overall, the compensation for these roles is virtually the same but there are some clear tradeoffs to consider. The private sector job is more engaging and could open doors for future career growth if all goes well — but it carries some risk given economic uncertainty and the potential impact of AI on the job market. The public sector job offers greater stability and a pension, but it might limit my professional options down the road.

Part of me wants to prioritize job security, but the idea of leaving a job I genuinely enjoy makes me feel uneasy.  On the other hand, I've already missed out a few years of potential earning and I'd hate to experience a layoff again.

1k1j2e1,Help me find a new career,"23yo male with an Associate Degree. Experience in grocery, retail, residential construction, and a little bit of law enforcement. 

Currently growing tired of the construction industry and the trades in general. Industry wages have fallen so far behind COL in my area compared to other fields, not to mention the general lack of benefits. I have looked into union work but there seems to be a lack of unions in my area. 

Spent a short period of time in law enforcement but quickly found out it wasn't right for my family and I.

Some qualities I'm looking for in a career:
-Typical M-F schedule
-Decent wages/ability to provide for a family
(I don't care to become rich, I just want to live relatively comfortable and provide for my family)
-Associate Degree but open to career path with higher education
-Not too strenuous
(I don't want to kill my back, knees, etc by the time I'm 30 if I don't have to)
-Generally has benefits 
(Haven't had health insurance or retirement since leaving LE)
-Helps others
(I want to feel like I'm contributing to the greater good and helping people who need it)
-Mentally engaging
(I enjoy getting my mind engaged in what I'm doing and don't enjoy monotonous tasks)

I am currently at a crossroads in my career and looking to make some major changes. Currently, leadership refuses to hire help with servicing which forces me to have to pick up a lot of the slack which hinders my ability to meet my numbers. I was considering getting my ARM designation and transitioning over to risk management. I hear the below are good areas of focus that offer competitive pay and good work life balance.

- Corporate Risk
- Enterprise Risk
- Cybersecurity Risk
- Integral and Regulatory Risk

I am also considering transitioning into other industries. I have a strong interest in home defense and firearms so I was considering possibly transitioning into companies such as Daniel Defense, Sig Sauer, Springfield, S&W etc. The only issue with that is I hear it’s a difficult industry to get into but once you’re in… You’re in. My other challenge is the transferable skills. I have management skills and sales skills however I am looking for more salary positions and not sure if a Sales Director would be the right fit.

Can anyone provide any advice on the above? Feel free to add any other ideas I may not be considering that could be a great fit.

As far as education goes… I don’t have my degree but I do have a CPRIA designation. I’m willing to obtain reputable designations or certificates to further my career, but I personally feel like the four year degree isn’t necessary to obtain what I’m looking for.

My teachers usually like me and think i will be doing something with their subject in future, because i look normally so interested in the  topic, and as i said, thats right. 

I just feel pressure to do something extra, to choose mi career right, to do something everybody can´t, if you understand what i mean.

When I took the role I was under the impression it was a leadership role and I would have three direct reports (previously I had 8 direct reports and multiple international teams that I was a decision maker for). I knew going into the new role I would be responsible for hiring two of the three roles, I also knew I would do some of the individual contributor work at the start while we hired these positions and as a means to learn. Fast forward a year later, they let me hire one person and eliminated the other two roles (including letting someone go). I’ve been told between myself and my direct report we can manage the workload and there is no budget to hire anyone for the foreseeable future. It also puts me in a weird position with my direct report because we are peers in regards to the daily work, but I am also their manager, have manager responsibilities, and am trying to find a voice in cross collaboration for my “team” (aka myself and another person). The daily workload is too much for one person so I can’t take a step back and let them manager most of it. It’s just really not what I was expecting and doesn’t utilize my skill set.

It also doesn't allow me to make enough money to cover my bills, so I've almost cleared out my savings and almost maxed out my credit cards. I've been sending out resumes, and as many others are experiencing, I'm not getting any response.

1k1f6tr,Anyone else feel like working for big corporations just isn’t worth,"I’ve been working for big companies like Lowe’s and Amazon for the past 4–5 years. They’re obviously huge corporations, publicly traded, and very structured. But over time, I’ve come to realize I just don’t enjoy working for big companies anymore.

Here’s why:

1. Too much pressure from corporate.
There’s constant stress around productivity, metrics, and performance. Everything feels rushed and numbers-driven. I get that they have shareholders to answer to, but that pressure makes the environment feel cold and exhausting.

2. The politics are overwhelming.
There are so many layers of management, approvals, and processes that it becomes hard to make a difference. Office politics, favoritism, and red tape just seem to come with the territory in big corporations.

3. The pay isn’t even that good.
I’ve looked on LinkedIn and Indeed, and I’ve noticed that smaller businesses often pay just as well — sometimes even more — for similar roles. And while big companies might offer slightly better benefits, I feel like the flexibility and work-life balance at smaller businesses make up for it.

4. Smaller companies feel more human.
There’s less bureaucracy, less micromanagement, and you feel more like a person instead of just a number. You can actually contribute ideas without needing 10 levels of approval.

Is it just me, or is this a normal shift in mindset?
Is it normal to realize at some point during your career that you’d rather work for a small business than a big corporation? For example, my wife works for a small company, and she’s making more money than I do — with better benefits, too. So what’s the real benefit of working for a big company nowadays?

1k1eyp7,What career would you suggest for someone who doesn’t want a career at all?,"Like the title states, I honestly don’t want a career.  I never have.  I never had an answer to what I wanted to do when I grow up, and I still don’t at 35.

I’m in the US and I get that I need a job to live.  I’m currently working as a service technician on specific equipment, it’s not bad as far as jobs go.  But I got a taste of the freedom and life I crave during Covid (I’m not downplaying the severity and it was tragic, I also know how bad it sounds but I can’t get it out of my head).  I was laid off and on unemployment, and I just got paid to exist.  My depression was getting better.  I started working out.  I discovered I love cooking.  It was the best I’ve ever felt in my life, and the first time in years I genuinely felt happy and content.  I wanted to LIVE.  And then it was back to work again, and the misery that accompanied it.

I know it sounds stupid.  I know it sounds nearly childish, and, again, I’m not trivializing Covid.  It was horrible, a lot of people lost loved ones, and it was one of the worst things to happen in our current history.

But how do I move past it?  How can I just be happy with a system that wasn’t designed for people like me?  How can I make peace with myself and continue to do this for another 30 years without wanting to end everything?

1k1ey9u,Content writer looking for the next career move - considering law,"Basically, I've (33M) been working as a content writer for 7 years. I graduated college in 2014, took a few gap years to pursue music, and grabbed work online as a content writer. Now, I have a steady job working in-house at a large company with solid benefits, low stress, and WFH. However, I'm seeking improved income potential and more stable job opportunities.

Work was pretty good before the AI boom, but content writing in particular has been impacted, more than other forms of copywriting. I was never very career-focused during or immediately after college, but now that I'm a family man, I feel pressure to do well for my kids, etc. 

I kind of fell into my current role, which I know seems desirable to some. However, I only make $25/hour in a MCOL city. I had a contract role that was supplementing my income, but that's coming to an end, as the company is transitioning to be more AI-dependent. It's been harder to find these types of jobs lately, likely due to the poor job market and uncertainty caused by AI. 

One thing I know is this: I need to get out of content writing. 

However, copywriting is extremely competitive. There's also more age discrimination in marketing and advertising. I could pivot to copywriting, but if I transition to another role, I want to do something that I can do to a ripe old age, without worrying that an inexperienced, younger person will undercut me for less money, which is common in creative fields. 

With all that out of the way—I'm currently working to attend law school since I live in a good city to be an attorney. I know that lawyers are valued as they age and gain more experience, and I was always interested in the law, with some family members who were attorneys. I figure with my writing and humanities background it's a job that would play to my strengths. 

I've taken the LSAT and am currently waiting back on my score. I will be able to get into a decent law school in my area and start the grind. I plan on doing litigation, which is better insulated from AI than transactional law. 

I guess I'm just looking for some input from kind internet strangers. If you think I'm being unappreciative of my job, that's fair. If you think the law is a doomed profession that sucks, also fair. I've done my research, but it's always helpful to get another take. 

Not interested in medical field or trades. thx

Currently Civil Engineering Corps

1k1etwh,Placed in PIP by manager who doesn't interact with me,"So this may sound a llittle strange but as the title states, I have just been placed on a PIP by my manager who has barely spoken to me over the past year. 

So about a year ago, my manager brought up some issues in a meeting with our higher up - a meeting I thought was to address me asking for help because I was overloaded in my role at that time, so, first surprise. They were largely communication issues, nothing major (but also nothing she had addressed with me directly), until she said i was unprofessional in a meeting by making her look bad, and had lied about damage in one of my work areas (bad look for her bc the damage would have been done by her team). She claimed to have looked for and couldnt see the damage and I should have verified it before bringing it up in front others in a meeting. Of course, I had not made up the damage, and it was completely relevant to the discussion at hand, and she never asked me to show her. This troubled me, as I have never been accused of dishonesty at work, and it would have been a completely senseless thing to make up something so easily verifiable. 

I thought I would try to address with her the next day after cooling off. I started by acknowledging we've had some communication issues that we should work on, but I was uncomfortable with her statement that I had fabricated this issue. I thought - hoped - she might acknowledge she could have come to me directly before assuming i had lied, but nope, she immediately said she didn't think we should talk without a witness present, which I took as my cue to stfu and leave, at this point i dont trust her.

And that was it. She doesn't talk to me unless it's unavoidable. I havent had a performance review this year. She tries to work around me and ask people questions that they then have to find out from me. She speaks regularly with my peer and often shifts my responsibilities to her without any discussion. It absolutely affects my performance that I'm not kept in the loop but its also affected my morale. I feel pushed out and it all feels so petty. 

So then I get a PIP. No discussions preceeding it, just out of the blue. I guess I can see they want me gone, but do I have grounds to dispute, or take any action if they do because of the total lack of communication for so long?

My work gives me next to no stress, I work from home 4 days a week and I’m in the office only 3 days a month. And no one micromanages me, my managers a really nice guy and teams easy going.

I love my job and lifestyle my job gives me, but I’m not ambitious, I don’t wish to climb the corporate ladder. I don’t wish to climb to a director or executive. I value my peace and my simple life with my wife more than money and status. My motto to myself is you can always earn more, if you’re on 70k you won’t be happy until you’re on 80k, so on so forth. True happiness and contentment is not through money, what’s the point earning more if you’re going to live a stressful life due to work and you only get to enjoy what you’ve saved when you’ve got one foot in the grave?

1k1df7b,How much of a raise to ask for (they’re begging me to stay),"Background: i work at a call center, i used to be a supervisor many many years ago at this same call center but was not necessarily a very successful agent, but because i had a college degree they kinda just promoted me to keep me. i genuinely do not remember my salary at that time but it wasn’t a lot. maybe 12-15 an hour when it came down to it. 
fast forward now, two degrees more and a couple mental breakdowns later i’ve left my field and am floating around. i go back to the call center with the full expressed intentions of taking a summer job i had last summer again. 

i was at $12 an hour at the call center for about a week and ive been $15 (plus commission) since then (about 2 months) and it’s only about 32 hours a week. i have been #1 agent 6 weeks or so out of the two months ish i’ve been there and the rest of the time i have been 1 or 2. 
my boss has told me i can have 40 hours, coming in with customer service to call out for an hour extra. when i said that wasn’t the only reason i wanted to leave he said how much do you want to stay for just you two (another top agent also decided to quit for similar reasons) she’s decided to leave anyways. but i have no idea what to ask for. 

i told my summer job i need $15 and full time. they still have me at $14 but im pretty sure it’s just not updated yet. the cut in pay isn’t really the point i would rather make much less and work here, but if they won’t give me 15/16 


based on my research it seems like a modest raise to ask for in my situation would be $1-$2 if i were asking without being prompted. however because i’m being begged to stay i feel like i should ask for around $20? ($5 raise, $20 total) this is a sales job. so whatever i say they’re probably gonna come back lower even if i say exactly what they are willing to pay. 
honestly it would genuinely take me $20+ to stay unless i don’t get at least $15 at the seasonal job. (if the seasonal job keeps me at 14 i would stay for anything but im not telling
them that) ",Real_Brother2537,0,0.5,8,1744898184,2025-04-17 13:56:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k1df7b/how_much_of_a_raise_to_ask_for_theyre_begging_me/,4,2025
1k1d8s9,Maybe I was too direct?,"I had an incredibly frustrating conversation yesterday, but after sleeping on it, I realize I might have come off a little too direct.

For context: I’m in my 40s, have worked in construction for 20 years, and I’m currently a Senior PM. I came back from some scheduled PTO to find out that two additional people from my company were now involved in my project. One (Person A) is my manager, so I expected that. The other (Person B) I vaguely knew of—he had been on this project years ago before I joined but had quit. Apparently, he was recently rehired.

My manager had mentioned Person B might be coming by for the day, just to observe—not to take over my role or anything like that. So I had a heads-up, but nothing concrete. Then the actual interaction happened… and now I’m wondering if I should be polishing my resume.

So here’s how it went down:

I stepped into my office to grab some info to finish a conversation I was having with another colleague. Person B follows me in, closes the door, and says, “We need to address the elephant in the room.”

I told him, “Sure, but let me finish this convo real quick.” I wrap that up, come back, and say, “Alright, I’ve got time now.”

And then… the weirdest, most awkward exchange ensues:

Person B: “Do you know why I’m here?”
Me: “Nope, I assumed you were just visiting since you just got rehired.”
Person B: “I may be here more often.”
Me: “Okay, let’s get you a badge then.”
Person B: “We don’t need to do that yet. I don’t even have an email or anything.”
Me: “Alright.”
Person B: “I’m here to facilitate, streamline communication, and help at the program level.”
Me: “What does that mean?”
Person B: “What do you mean? I’m on the program level.”
Me: “Sure, but we’ve had like 9–12 people ‘on the program level’ in the last two years, and I still don’t know what most of them actually do. What should I be coming to you for specifically?”
Person B: “…Well, I’m on the program level like [Name drops Person X].”
Me: “Okay, well Person X usually contacts me when they need help with contracts. Are you going to be asking for help like that? I’m just trying to understand what your role is.”
Person B: “That conversation will happen over a series of conversations. It’s not something we can discuss right now.”
Me: “Alright. Well, when you know, let me know.”

Long pause. He just stares at me.

Me: “Sorry, I was gone for four days and I’ve got 500 unread emails I’d like to get through before everyone comes back from lunch.”
Person B: “Okay, well… we’ll talk more later.”

And that was that. It left me confused, annoyed, and now wondering if I missed some subtext—or if I’m being edged out. But man, that conversation was something else.

Is this a good long-term plan? Does it make sense to build digital marketing experience first and then move into analytics?

Also, my degree isn’t related to either field — I graduated in Film & TV production. Will this background make it harder for me to break into digital marketing or analytics? Or is it still possible if I put in the work?

1k19yvw,Struggling with a decision - to leave or not to leave?,"So pretty basic, I've worked for a local cleaning company for (gasp) 12 weeks. They specialize in bond cleaning but also have a (small) domestic run. 
I started as a bond cleaner, but some of the team were insecure and it got hairy for me being exposed to one in particular day in day out, and they were struggling with the attitude of the domestic lead, so they let her go, and moved me to domestic. The painful staff member has since resigned also. 
I enjoy my role in general - but there are many factors involved in me possibly leaving, including but not limited to - scheduling issues, ie cancellations not passed on, clients being popped into the wrong time slot etc. 
We also cater to a lot of clients that are situated 40minutes away - I have mentioned it's not viable to be paying 2 people to drive that far to clean but it fell short. 
I also work with a *very* young woman. She's a teenager, albeit a nice enough one. She spends a lot of her day in phone land, has little to no initiative but will follow direction if pressed. Her phone stays in the car during cleans, but the entire times between its out as I drive always (another pet peeve) this could be up to 150km a day.  I also get paid the same amount as her, and feel as though I do more work overall. 
The boss is aware, and is happy to move her to the bond team, and leave me to my own devices in domestic land, but that doesn't change the schedule issues, and my boss also has trouble respecting boundaries. It's very blurry as we have clicked on a personal level, but that also means messages at 9pm or on weekends not work related - but can turn work related quickly. 
I have offered to try drum up business locally with new marketing materials, assistance with scheduling, all the things I can think of, but they haven't felt the urgency to grow it like I would like (I do understand it's not my business, but when they hired me they knew I was passionate about it and it's half the reason I got the job) 

I kind of just feel flat, the work itself isn't hard, and at the end of the day it's not my car, and I get paid whatever hours I complete. I have mentioned all of this to them - and they are insisting they will do ANYTHING to keep me. But I just don't feel like there will be a shift. So do I suck it up, get paid and keep working at a basic level ( which is still above a lot of others) and just roll with it. Or do I leave in hopes of greener pastures..",EmotionalWay2407,1,1.0,2,1744887628,2025-04-17 11:00:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k19yvw/struggling_with_a_decision_to_leave_or_not_to/,4,2025

1k190kd,Career help,"Hi everyone, 

This is my first post on Reddit so apologies if this is posted to the wrong area/forum. 

I have been struggling a little with what to do in my career. I’ve always been particularly career driven, and find genuine enjoyment going to work and progressing myself. This past year or so, I left a job I quite enjoyed (probably mistakenly but for good reason) and not had as much passion for the industry or working in general. 

I would like to get that back, but really struggling to see how I even find a job. 

My background for the past 4 years has been car sales, as a sales executive. I was ‘on track’ to become a business manager at the job I left a year ago. Before that, I was a shift manager within hospitality for 3 years. Even my job before this point, was customer assistant while at sixth form / university (I dropped out as not for me), however I was helping out at a supervisor level on certain evenings/days (foolishly not getting paid for it, just embracing it at that age). 

Now I do enjoy sales, I think I’m quite good at it while also being customer focused. I very rarely have a customer complaint with genuine reason, and have sold to even the most ‘difficult’ people. 

Trying to find a sales job in a different industry seems to be near impossible - am I looking in the wrong place? 

Would appreciate any help / advice.

1k17ci7,I’ve been offered a new job and I’m anxious about handing in my notice and burning bridges,"So I’ve been at my current job for around a year, and it’s just not the right fit for me. The people are nice but I’m bored by the work, it’s not completely what I thought the role would be & I think I’d end up ‘stuck’ here if I stayed. So this week I’ve been offered a new role and I feel really good about it. It’s more aligned with what I can see myself doing, it’s more money & I feel like I could grow in the company. The only issue is I’m worried about telling my manager - not because they’re a mean person or anything but because I feel bad about the timing of me leaving.

I feel extra bad because of the way I got the job I’m currently in. Long story short I initially turned it down for another offer that I regretted and managed to backtrack. I’m worried that me leaving within the year is messing them around again & I’ll burn bridges completely. I know that they won’t see it coming either. It’s also not a toxic workplace and I don’t have a specific reason to leave (e.g. a horrible team) so I think that’s making me feel worse. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation and can offer some advice? I know it’s likely a ‘pull the bandaid off’ situation but I’m still really nervous about it (since I am very likely to have to speak to them in person) and don’t know how to approach it in the best way. I’ve handed in my notice at other jobs before and it’s been fine (if a little nerve wracking) but with my recent history at this company it’s adding extra anxiety.

My work was partially customer service, partially consulting and partially projectmanagement. I was good at my job and received 4/5 scores. Eventually I got bored of the job and my firm wouldnt let me learn new skills, I wanted to focus more on reward consulting.

So I decided to leave and go to a more ""boutique"" consulting firm, which is basically only consulting and start there. I talked my way into a position that was of similar jobsize as my previous position, eventhough my current employer felt like I shouldve been in a lower grade.

First off ty for getting me through with alot of career struggles in the past, but here's a tricky one.

Working 2 hrs each day and leaving before noon, I was obviously spoiled by the salary and extremely flexible hours. 

Long story short, the project got called off and now I am to return to main office, 9 to 9 with heavy workload. However they did gave me a new offer, stating I can take no pay leave for 2 months until another on-site project kicks off.

Please advice, thanks in advance.

I have taken all my classes in high school to be centered around engineering with AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2, AP Calculus, but never anything like AP Bio or AP Chemistry, only taking at most honors chemistry and AP Psych. I have to commit to a major soon, and the idea of helping people and being in the medicine industry seems like something I want to commit to. I'm honestly having second thoughts about doing engineering, although I'm sure I'd still love it. I can't shake the feeling of becoming a doctor, but still, I don't have any experience with volunteering at a hospital or anything. Is it worth the blind dive, or should I just go through with engineering? I feel like I might get a little bit more out of doing something with medicine. I'm already aware how stressful practicing medicine can be, but I sincerely feel like it will be worth it. I'm kind of in a career crisis. I just kind of need some help trying to figure out what I should do. I don't have enough experience with medicine to decide if I should be a doctor or not, but I still feel like I really should consider it.

1k15mhp,Got passed over for a promotion but got a substantial raise.,"Some context here. I had originally applied for a higher position at this manufacturing facility, but was offered a position 1 step below as at the time, that was what the company needed. 

In the last 6 months I have out performed everyone else in this position and set the standard of what you should be doing in terms of this position (communication, following up, initiative, ownership). Most of my counterparts got demoted due to them not being up to part with what the position entailed.

During this time I was also asked to cover two shifts ( we work a rotating shift schedule -pitman style) and I did so in order to help both night shifts turn around and start operating at a level that was successful. I established new protocols and even created a repository of documentation for repairs that were outside of the normal circumstances.

During my 90 day review I received 5s all across the board, my boss and leadership constantly rely on me to get the job done correctly and escalate as necessary when things go wrong.

So a few months ago the position I originally applied for opened back up for night shift, the shift I’ve been working on. I waited a bit, but then I was encouraged to apply by my leadership and peers.

First interview with the director of my department went great, he is a staunch advocate of my work ethic and the changes I have helped drive within the department.

I was supposed to interview with the facility director at some point, but after weeks of waiting I got an email from HR today saying they went with another candidate.i talked to my boss about it, and he said it was due to me not having enough manufacturing experience… granted that has not stopped me from running circles around everyone else in my position, and they recognize that and have stated as much, but apparently being put in a more leadership position is a step too far.

I was just recently given a huge pay increase since my temp period was up ( I was going through an employment agency during this time), so I feel like they did this in knowledge that they were gonna pass me over for the position.

Should I stay and dial back my involvement in the role?(a lot of the stuff I was doing was outside of my job description, but I was doing  it because I was invested in the success of the department). I honestly feel like they are not taking me seriously, and it’s kind of disrespectful. 

Am I overthinking and overreacting?

1k15dym,"Existential fatigue, I need advice on what to do going forward","I feel completely apathetic. This feels horrendous. Stuck in a job I don’t particularly want to do living a life I don’t want. All of my instincts screaming. Get out! Get out! Get out! Yet stasis. I genuinely don’t know what do. I feel as though I’ve lost the will to live most days. 

I am a British male in my early thirties with a degree in Politics and International Relations. I live in South-East Asia. I am a teacher by profession. I have lived in SEA for 10 years, teaching the entire time. At this point, it feels like this is the only job I can do. Though I know deep down this isn’t true, I have zero skills or experience outside of this career and working in another field seems like a pipedream.  

I really want to stay in SEA, I feel that the pace of life here, their attitude to life, the cuisine, the landscapes… almost everything here is preferable. However, beyond teaching, there really isn’t anything else to do besides starting a business. Something fraught with corruption, shady business partners and local laws that can be prohibitively inconvenient. 

I could move back to the UK, but for what? I don’t particularly like life there. The weather is awful most of the time and the food, while not as God awful as some say, is certainly no comparison for Asian food. Life feels incredibly expensive back home and nothing feels of appropriate value. Quite the contrast to goods and services here for the most part. Besides, what would I even do? I’m certainly not going to move back to be a teacher. It would need to be a career changing prospects. Something with a salary high enough to have a comfortable life. An impossibly out of reach luxury in my position it would seem. 

Teaching has been okay. Though I’ve always felt it isn’t really for me. I’m a good teacher when I want to be but now, I have no motivation. It certainly isn’t the worst job out there. Three sizeable holidays throughout the year and under twenty hours a week of actual contact time with students for a salary that is five times the national median and nearly ten times that of my profession’s average. I do well. 

But something is breaking inside of me. I really can’t take it anymore and I just need to vent and solicit advice. No one in my friend group has much to say other than, they feel similar or it’ll be better soon, you’ll be okay. They’re in the same boat as me. Maybe they don’t dislike it as much as I do right now, if even at all.

I'm thinking about getting any job now (maybe in hospitality or customer service) just to gain experience and reach the age where I might be eligible for better opportunities like international airlines. But I’m scared—what if I get stuck in a low-paying job and never move ahead?

I have a strong work ethic and am willing to learn or take up short-term certifications if they help me grow faster. But I don’t know where to start.

Please guide me. Any job leads, career suggestions, or just some encouragement would really mean a lot. 🙏",naveen2102,2,1.0,2,1744864144,2025-04-17 04:29:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k14d6r/lost_my_father_need_a_job_to_support_family_19_yo/,4,2025
1k149by,Job Offer Dilemma — Need Advice,"I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.

I’ve been offered a role at Company A (in my preferred domain), and my joining date is in a week. The onboarding process is almost complete—just pending final document verification and the appointment letter (which I’ll get 1-2 weeks after joining). The role aligns well with my background, but the salary is modest.

On the other hand, I recently got a call from Company B (also in the preferred domain) for a very similar role—one that I applied to nearly a month ago. The salary at Company B is almost double what Company A is offering, and the brand value is significantly stronger. This could be a game-changer for my resume, especially since I plan to pursue an MBA in the future.

The catch? Company B has a multi-round interview process (3 rounds), which will take some time. I’m confident in my ability to clear the interviews, but I don’t want to completely lose Company A as a backup option.

Now I’m torn between these options:
	1.	Ask Company A to delay my joining by a week or so (citing personal reasons), to buy time for Company B’s interview process (but I am not sure that would be possible).
	2.	Join Company A as planned and, if I get selected by Company B later, resign shortly after (which I feel is unprofessional and not ideal for my resume).
	3.	Decline Company A altogether and go all-in for Company B (a bit risky if things don’t work out).

What would you do in this situation? Has anyone been through something similar?

Would appreciate any thoughts or advice. Thanks!",JohnWick065,0,0.5,3,1744863748,2025-04-17 04:22:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k149by/job_offer_dilemma_need_advice/,4,2025
1k13ts1,Which medical career should I choose? How do I devote my life to helping people and being a good husband and father at the same time?,"

Hello all, I’m a 27 year old college student about to finish my bachelors degree in about 2 years. I took time off for a while due to personal reasons but I’m back in school again as of a year ago. I plan on doing a masters after that which should take about 2 more years and then applying to medical school. The motivation for me is very mental and emotional. I genuinely want to help people and assist them in achieving better health. 

For a long time now I have been considering neurosurgery. This field is of course the highest paying by a significant mile, but money isn’t a factor in my view for my career really. It’s time, time is what I ponder on a lot.

4 years of medical school would be followed by a 7 year residency in neurological surgery, which is quite a long time, but I have a concern as well that many raise within the profession: work-life balance and amount of time with family.

Most neurosurgeons work close to 16-18 hours per day, 5-6 days a week. They’re on call several days per month, and surgeries can be unpredictable in the amount of time they take. Stress and burnout is prevalent. I have always been fascinated with the nervous system and manual manipulation and surgical operation, but I now as I’m getting older beginning to worry I won’t actually be there to provide love and care and enough quality time as a husband and as a father. I’m not married nor do I have kids yet, but in due time I will get to finally marry someone I love and have kids that I plan to raise to become the happiest versions of themselves they could ever be. I worry that if I stick with this career path and end up achieving it, I’ll pay a price in not being with my family nearly as much as I’d like.

While performing neurosurgery would be very cool to say the least, I want to also make sure the job will even allow me enough time to see my family and be there with them. 

That leads me to this, I’m also considering family medicine or internal medicine, who’s residences last 3-4 years and work hours are much more in line with a fixed-schedule and solidified with a clear work-life balance. Work hours per week are 45 usually to 60 at most. Much less stress, much less occurrence of being on call, and very little burnout from what I’ve read. Less paying but again this doesn’t matter much to me really, if anything money is on the lower end of importance. I just want to live a life where I can achieve both of my dreams of helping people and giving back to the world as well as my dream of having a loving family and giving as much as I can to them. 

Also, I know some may recommend posting this in subreddits for current and aspiring medical professionals , but I’d like an outside opinion as well from people who could view the situation in a more concise and general manner.

1k11w6z,Boss suggesting coworkers report to me,"I am one of 4 team leaders, we report to the same boss (one for each region of the country) My region is based out of HQ so I get the most face time, I have also done the role the longest (3 years).  Two of the other regions are in constant turmoil, do not meet goals, and have morale issues. 1 meets goals but serves a different market and doesn’t face many challenges. 

My boss has sought my opinion on what I would do to improve those teams and has even sent me to the regions to share with my peers what I have done with my team to make things work smoothly. 

On several occasions he has said to me “I wish you were their boss” or “I should just make them report to you”.  I have shrugged it off and said their regions just have different issues or that the commute would kill me. 

Do you think my coworkers could be in danger of losing their jobs? There are supervisors under us, I can see the company removing the other leads and having the supervisors all roll into me, at least for the 2 under performing regions. Or is it more likely they would have leads rolling into other leads? We don’t have another level beyond my current title unless you get to the executive level (my boss).

1k11luy,Rising college freshman with future career question,"As the title says, I will be a college freshman in a couple months, but I have some questions regarding my future career, and hire-ability.

Im currently planning on being a business major, and am also going to do ROTC so I, if all things go according to plan, will be guaranteed to have a decent paying job that offers real world experience in leadership and command which should help a future business career, which is more then a lot of college grads can say. 

But I’m considering changing my major to history, as I am very good at that and very interested, and I see ROTC and the army giving  me the intangibles and skills to succeed in business in the future and help get into a good MBA program. Although I believe I will definitely succeed in the history program, I don’t want to be a lawyer or go into education, which seem to be the top jobs for history majors. 

So my question is, have any history majors (even better if you have military experience like I will) been able to pivot into a good business career, or maybe you can provide other interesting and well-paying opportunities other then law or education that a history degree has  helped you with. Or maybe some of you have regretted getting a history degree altogether and want to talk me out of it- every piece of advice is welcomed.

1k111tj,Leave for higher paying job in the private sector?,"Just recently interviewed for a job after working in public sector (SOE) for a couple of years. I was surprised to get an offer because I didn't think I did all that well in the interview (answered only like 1/3rd of the questions correctly).

New job will start at 170k with bonus and full relocation assistance but pretty average benefits otherwise as the health plans don't stand out and I lose gov't employee status. I'm also not super enthused about the location as it's in a smaller, poorer city a thousand miles away.

This is compared to earning about 125k with DB pension (9.25%--which hasn't vested yet), 457k, and pretty good insurance. 

The biggest change besides location is the number of days I'll need to be at the office which will increase from 1 to 3. From what I know about the company, they're expanding rapidly in some new business segments and are planning to significantly increase their workforce and want people in the office so they can familiarize themselves with all the new faces.

1k10psn,I need to make a big change - What skills should I develop (and how to best attain them) to get a job that fits my work style? (trying to prevent return of mental/neurological illness),"I'm 28 y/o with a master's degree in history (lol, I know, but I got it for free). I worked as an administrative investigator  for 2 years before getting my master's. I was pretty good at it, but the full-time schedule and a toxic direct supervisor caused me to burn out pretty badly. 

I'm currently working in a part-time contract position where I do a mix of the work of a copy editor, a data analyst, and a paralegal. It's interesting sometimes, but not especially stable and doesn't feel like the most meaningful or mentally stimulating thing I could be doing. What I really do enjoy about it, though, is the schedule. Instead of an 5 days/week 9-5 setup, it's often very few hours per month, but I'm essentially on call most of the time, and have to be available to work a few 16 hour days in a row or edit something at midnight. The combination of periods of high intensity work followed by long periods of rest and the variation in the types of problems I have to solve seems to be much better for my mental health. It gives me time to focus on important things like making comics and sleeping 10 hours per day. 

I'm not entrepreneurial or particularly extraverted. I'm good at focusing intensely for limited periods of time, doing research, solving puzzles, and making arguments in writing. I'm very good at being in school and getting high grades, probably because university schedules and projects are similar to my ideal work structure. I'm not looking for a high salary immediately. I'd like to have the immense luxury of living alone in a decent apartment in an interesting city without having to worry about the cost of coffee or avocados. Maybe around a $60k starting salary with room for growth over time? I don't want to be rich. I just want to live an OK life and not have my chronic stress migraines (or other concerning psychological symptoms) come back.

Another consideration: I want to leave the U.S. and work in Europe or Canada. I've researched ways to do this. I think it might be possible to argue that I'm a ""digital nomad"" in Canada with my current job, but it doesn't always bring in a consistent income and the regulations around that visa program are a little unclear to me. It's also limited to 18 consecutive months. I think a student visa leading to the qualifications for an in-demand career could be my best pathway to immigration. 

I'm willing to take on up to $40k in debt for an ideal outcome, as my debt from undergrad is only $10k.

Here's a few things that I think might work, but I'm very open to suggestions and critique:

PhD in history. I would have gotten into an ivy league program this year if not for the budget cuts (cons: guaranteed stipend income for 5 years, then possibly worse prospects than before)

Law school, then either get an LLM and teach/freelance consult, or seek out work as in-house counsel for some kind of institution (cons: cost of degree, unavailability of the type of job that would work for me)

Obtain a second bachelor's degree in data science or statistics and pursue a career as a data scientist/analyst (cons: market may be saturated, may be unable to gain admission to a bachelor's program outside of U.S., cost of education)

Teach myself to be a data analyst, learn SQL, Tableau, etc. on my own and seek out more freelance work (cons: low motivation without the structure of formal education, low pay rates for much available freelance work, saturated market)

Become a successful graphic novelist (cons: this is extremely unlikely, I fear my art may be quite bad)

Get an MFA in Europe or Canada (pros: silly, fun, supports dream of being a successful cartoonist; cons: silly, expensive, and often not mentally stimulating (why do they spend more time writing about art than making it?))

1k10dwp,Seeking Advice on Potential Implications. Job Offer Deadline vs. Promising Interviews?,"I'm in Ontario, Canada. 

I wanted to get some thoughts on a situation I'm in. As some of you know, I've been looking for a job for a couple of months now. I recently received a job offer with a 2-day deadline to accept or reject.

At the same time, I'm also in the interview process with 3 other companies that seem quite promising, and I'm really hoping to land a role with one of them.

Since I don't have anything concrete from those yet, I'm leaning towards accepting the current offer to have something secure. However, I'm wondering what the implications might be if, in a month or two, I receive an offer from one of the other companies and decide to pursue that opportunity, even after signing a contract and potentially being within the 3-month probation period of the first job.

Secondly, if I secure another offer before the joining date, is it safe to decline the first offer?

The offer I have doesn't seem to have any specific clauses about this, but I'm still a bit unsure about the professional and legal aspects of potentially leaving a new job relatively quickly or declining an accepted offer.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation or has any insights into this? Any advice or perspectives would be greatly appreciated!

1k102t2,Stick with Security Engineering or pivot?,"I’m currently a security engineer and have been for 6 years at this point.

My family and I currently dislike where we live and want to move back to our home state; however, the job opportunities there are nonexistent maybe 1-2 roles across the entire state in a good year currently there are 0. So I am trying to figure out if I go more general into security engineering or pivot to something like data science. Currently I have a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering with a focus in signal processing. 

The reason I am considering a pivot is that I don’t care for more general IT security. I could go the pen-testing route as a pivot, but I find it hard to focus on studying for this. The other thought was data science as my degrees fit the needs a lot of real time, multi-dimensional data analysis. But I’m not 100% sure as the initial pay cut may be too large. Current base salary is over 165k in MCOL. I know I will have to take a cut regardless.

1k0zkot,What job suits my skills and experience?,"Hi everyone, I'm trying to figure out what kind of job fits my background and skills, but I’m not sure what title to look for.

I’m a physician from Colombia (I graduated, but never practiced medicine). After graduating, I realized what I really enjoy is psychology—especially research in areas like morality and social psychology. I worked as a research assistant (unpaid) for almost three years at a university doing work in that field. During that time, I learned to use R for data cleaning and analysis, and also gained experience with eye-tracking technology. I managed to write two research papers—I'm the first author on one—and although they're not published yet, I’ve submitted both to journals. I also earned a certificate in Statistical Methods for Data Analysis, where I learned some Python. Recently, I applied to PhD programs in the U.S. but was rejected from all of them. So now, I’m shifting focus: I want to find a paid job (crazy, I know), ideally one I can grow into or even do remotely in the future (I don’t mind starting in an office).

Right now, becoming a physician again isn’t what I want—I’ve given myself one year to find another path. My main interests are psychology, social research, and using research to address real-world problems. I know not having a master’s or PhD limits my options, but I’m open to jobs in related fields where my skills might still be useful.

I’ve seen job titles like: Research Scientist, Data Analyst, Healthcare Data Analyst, Biostatistician, Writer/Editor.

But I’m not sure if I qualify for these, or if there are others I should be looking into. I also can't afford to do another degree right now, though I’m happy to learn new skills on my own if they help me land a good opportunity.

Also, where and how should I be looking for these jobs? I’ve mostly checked LinkedIn and Indeed, but I don’t know if I’m using the right filters, keywords, or even the best platforms.

Any advice or suggestions would be hugely appreciated!

1k0ydar,Was told I need to upskill more and build more knowledge,"I was hired at a startup in a leasdership position from a giant company six months ago.  This role is significantly more broad than where I spent my career beforehand which was more focused in a specific subdomain.  Where there were massive teams focused on particular areas, now my team of three (including myself) do it all.  I explicitly communicated this and my concern around broadening to so much more before I joined, but learning into things was accepted by my boss.

I recently got feedback that I need to upskill more, and bring more solutions to the table.  Essentially get more into the detail, and learn more institutional knowledge, and was reminded that I am a highly paid leader.  Simply put my domain is significantly larger than others and I’ve learned a lot of detail but it will be a long time until I feel like an expert.  

Regardless I have done a good job running my team and prioritizing and executing, sometimes without having full and complete understanding of the complexity.  I have leaned on the subject mater expertise of my team and of others at my level.  But it was expressed that eventually I need to not come to others so much, and be more independent.

1k0xj2y,Am I making a mistake?,"Hi everyone, looking for some guidance. I have a few years of experience as a software engineer, after which I got a master’s in robotics. Since then, I’ve been working in robotics software roles, and recently moved into a senior-level position at a large company.

The role is in their research division, and it felt like a big shift from what I was used to—system design, writing code regularly, doing code reviews, working in agile sprints, etc. When I joined, there wasn’t much structure. It felt more like grad school, with a lot of freedom  on the research topics but not a lot of direction. I figured maybe that’s just how research teams operate and decided to give it a shot.

Recently, the team has been shifting toward a more structured workflow to deliver a production-ready product, and I’ve been assigned to lead the scrum process—helping set up agile practices, prioritizing and drive sprints. It’s a large team (>80 people), and I’ve suddenly found myself in back-to-back meetings and planning sessions, with little to no time for the hands-on technical work that I’m used to.

I know it’s still early, but I’m starting to worry that I might be getting locked into a non-technical track.

Is this just how it goes when you start moving up the corporate ladder? Should I wait it out and see how things evolve, or start thinking about a change? It’s only been a month, but I’m already second-guessing the move.

1k0x12a,Director told my manager I told on her….,"So….. what the title says. 


My current job is in HR. I am a team of 3. It’s me, my coworker, and my manager. 
I handle workers comp and my coworker handles leave of absence. 
I’ve been there a year. My coworker 14. 
Company is shit and most people end up leaving. Now I see why… anyways…. 

My manager is incredibly inappropriate and unprofessional in that she talks to me about my coworker and throws her under the bus to me, talks bad about people to me, and is extremely rude and unpleasant. She piles work on me and I don’t get paid nearly enough to deal with all of it. It’s been months and it’s toxic and eating at me. 

Some examples:

She will call me, delegate work to me and then be like 
“Don’t worry, I’ll have *coworker* also do XYZ. I know she’ll throw a fit, that’s what she usually does but she has to get over it.” 
She regularly talks to me about this persons performance, work ethic, etc. it’s clear my manager doesn’t like my coworker. 

I emailed my director, who is over my manager, and told her what’s been going on. I feel like I’ve been put in the middle of two ppl who truly hate each other. Instead of coming to me to talk more and ask for my clarification, my director went to my manager and told her everything I had just confided in her about. Which is now causing an even more hostile work environment. 

The paycheck isn’t worth the stress anymore at this point. I work overtime and it never good enough and I feel useless. I bring home just enough to pay my half of the bills and rarely have enough for “extras” or even groceries sometimes. 

I’m honestly thinking of quitting to save my sanity and doing instacart or something full time until I can find something else. 

Am I crazy for thinking this way? I feel like now that my manager knows I went above her, it’s going to make things worse. It already has, her attitude is horrible and it’s only been a day since this all happened. 
She treats me like a work mule and I do 10000 things literally am burnt out I feel like im her assistant. She’s already unbearable and now her knowing is just worse. 
They also confirmed I won’t be getting a raise this quarter which makes all of this feel useless 

I’m wondering if I find part time work if that would be better. At least it’s a check. 
I know all work places have drama and they aren’t perfect but the place im at now, I feel like it’s wayyyy too bad. 

I just don’t know what to do I guess. I feel like im really mentally not ok at this point with my job but know i can’t handle not working because of finances. I feel like im having a heart attack right now from stress. I feel irresponsible if I quit bc I have two kids but know if I continue im going to pull my hair out. The toxicness is so consuming.

1k0wodz,Need Advice: Leadership Lied and Used My Name – How Do I Navigate This Without Hurting My Career?,"I’ll try to keep this as clear as possible. I’m a Senior Scientist at a small biotech company (\~40 people), and I started in August 2024—so I’m still relatively new. Recently, a highly valuable SRA on our team decided to leave for a better opportunity. While she technically reported to my manager (a Director), I worked closely with her, mentored her regularly, and we also became good friends over time.

She chose to leave primarily due to what she described as toxic leadership—something I haven’t personally experienced, but I fully trust her perspective. To leave on good terms, she gave a six-week notice so she could finish experiments and transition smoothly. Leadership denied the full notice and asked her to leave within 2–3 weeks, which she accepted.

Here’s the problem: during her exit interview with the CEO, she was told that both I and my manager had been involved in discussions about shortening her notice—and that we supported that decision.

This is *completely false*. I was never consulted, never informed, and certainly never gave any input or support. They used my name to justify a decision I had no part in. And now my former colleague—someone I respect deeply—believes I might have been complicit in how her exit was handled. I feel incredibly disrespected and blindsided.

I haven’t spoken to my manager yet, but I’m struggling with what to do. On one hand, I don’t want to jeopardize my position—I’m still new, and the job market isn’t exactly booming. On the other hand, I don’t want to just sit on this and stay quiet while leadership casually lies and uses my name to save face.

This situation has seriously shaken my trust in the company. I want to address it in a way that protects my career but also holds them accountable. How should I approach this strategically—either with my manager or HR—without putting myself at risk?

Any advice is appreciated.

1k0vztk,Best Internship For My Career,"Hello,

So a couple of days ago, I received a phone call at 8 in the morning from an internship that I had an interview for recently, and the first thing they asked me was ""if I'm interested in accepting an offer,"" and I said yes. Then they told me the details like my pay, what I'd be doing, and where. I just assumed that I only told them that I was interested in potentially signing an offer letter, but I got an email today confirming my conditional acceptance with details about my internship. It didn't ask for my signature and was just a confirmation letter. This really threw me off because I never signed anything, and that's what I was told is the thing that confirms your acceptance for any job. I just said yes on a phone call to ""being interested in accepting an offer letter."" I already signed an offer letter to do paid research (REU) over the summer, and I'm not sure which one I want to do yet. I'm a sophomore computer science major, but this company internship, from what I know, is basically just data entry, while the research is more related to computer science. If I were to decline this internship, would I be blacklisted from the company because I technically reneged even though I didn't sign an offer. Also, the research position that I accepted is related to AI and at my current college so if I were to renege that, would I be blacklisted from my own college?

I’m Justin. I’m 27 and recently started working at a fintech company in the USA that’s building a new kind of retirement product. The idea is that it rewards longevity, meaning the longer someone lives, the more they get paid over time. It’s meant to give people financial security late in life, especially as traditional retirement systems run out of money or fall short.

Here’s the thing: I know next to nothing about finance or retirement. I took the job because the mission seemed meaningful, but I keep wondering… what if this whole concept just doesn’t apply to people like me, my friends, or even anyone in my generation?

Like will any of us even get to retirement? Climate change, global instability, AI, wars... it’s hard to imagine a stable future 50 years from now. And personally, I don’t expect to live to 90. And this company becomes apparently beneficial at 80... So I keep thinking:

Is this company building something real and impactful, or are we just selling peace of mind to a future that might not exist?

Would love to hear from anyone who's worked in fintech, retirement planning, or just has thoughts on the future of work/life/finance. Am I just being cynical, or asking the right questions?

To give some background, my Bachelor’s degree is in Food Science and since graduating I have worked in regulatory and consulting for the food industry, AmeriCorps VISTA doing food insecurity work, another term of AmeriCorps in a Conservation Corps, worked with a Food Insecurity non-profit, and seasonally farmed for a few years while I considered taking over a small, diversified vegetable farm.

I’ve been in Montana for a few years, but haven’t been able to work my way into a financially stable position (most of the jobs have been 25k-35k). I want to start a family in a few years, and have considered getting my masters in sustainable agriculture or food systems, something land management based, or an MBA. I would love to be make 80-100k probably by 35ish and have considered relocating to Minnesota, New York, Virginia, or some of the surrounding states for those locations. At this rate, it doesn’t seem viable that I can magically work up the professional ladder without adding something else to my resume. I am able to get job offers pretty consistently in the $20-$22 an hour range, but nothing more. I have also contacted all of the local agriculture/engineering organizations in my city and haven’t received many responses.

I’m seriously questioning my expectations lately and could use some outside perspective.

I have a master’s degree in Computer Science with focus on Machine Learning from a top German university (with a good to very good grade), and I’m a full-stack developer who can build applications solo - frontend, backend, deployment, you name it. I even wrote my thesis on machine learning (before it was cool) and have some experience with Quantum Computing as well.

After graduating, I joined an early-stage startup (5 employees at the time) and spent 2 years there. Salary was 62k€/year. During that time, I wore every hat imaginable - coding, managing, leading 5 projects simultaneously (with teams), and even building one of the key products the company still stands on today by myself. By the time I left, the company had grown to 30 employees.

Eventually, burnout hit, and I decided to take some time off and travel for a few months. I’m now back in Munich and have been job hunting since - applying widely, but hearing crickets. Most responses were just polite rejections along the lines of: “We’ve decided to move forward with other candidates.”

Now, months later, I finally got two interviews. I aced both (like, the questions felt laughably easy), and I just received offers: One for 55k and the other 65k

Both pre-tax. After taxes, that’s around 38k/year take-home. That just feels... low?

I get that it's taboo to talk about salary in Germany, but I really need to know:
Am I out of touch with the market, or are these offers seriously underwhelming given my background and experience?

Another time, she called my personal cell on my day off (that she approved) about a work related question that could’ve waited and been answered upon my return the next day. The rest of the day that’s all I could think about and couldn’t truly relax. This is 1 of many scenarios over the years.

1k0s97i,Burned out with 2 engineering backgrounds and no idea what to do now,"Hi all,

So let me preface this with my background. I studied Audio Engineering/Technology about 15 years ago. I then worked as a freelance music producer/recording engineer/touring musician with experience in the ad-film and movie industry for about 7 years. While the work was fulfilling it wasn't lucrative. 

8 years ago I decided to pursue another degree to put myself on a more stable career path. I moved to Germany and studied Business Science and then did a Data Science bootcamp right after because I've always been interested in data analytics and how it could have a strategic advantage on business strategic decisions. 

After completing my education I worked at the bootcamp as a teacher for 2 years while managing and training other teams. I could tell the company was quickly sinking (and has all but done so now) so I pivoted into the startup scene in Berlin. I was however not prepared for just how egotistical and full of lies it is. I worked with a company for a few months before having a major fallout with the founders over the fact that they were pushing me to build things that they didn't understand themselves and push it to investors just to secure funding. 

Since then I've had small roles in support teams and interviews for sales engineering positions since I'm quite sociable and knowledgeable about  the current tech landscape with machine learning. But, I haven't been able to secure a permanent role. 

I'm at the point now where I have a mental block against coding because every role I've had around that has honestly just pissed me off. It's not that I don't enjoy coding, I just hate the micro-management by people that have no idea what they're talking about. It doesn't help that I'm convinced I have Asperger's and have problem with large egos and morally bankrupt people. 

So that's where I'm at and I could honestly use whatever help I can get. Because even if I landed a tech interview at my dream company right now I'd probably fail it because I haven't been able to get myself to practice coding or build personal projects in awhile. I think I'd also really welcome a pivot back to the music industry but not sure where to start with that either since I'm not in my home country. 

So advice? Do you think I should look at another role? Suck it up and practice my coding again? Go back to music? 

Thanks for reading and sorry if it was long. ",lilbronto,4,1.0,2,1744829558,2025-04-16 18:52:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k0s97i/burned_out_with_2_engineering_backgrounds_and_no/,4,2025

I need overall advice.","So I know this probably sounds insanely unrealistic to many, but i really don’t want to waste my life away on things I don’t have any interest in nor passion for. I’ve seen people do this kinda stuff but really only have seen rich kids in NYC do it, and I come from a family where I have to buy most things for myself and my parents have low income.

I’m 17F from a small town in Wisconsin and hope for a more communal setting as I don’t have that here. An all women’s college sounds so fun and ideal, like mount Holyoke perhaps (honestly I have no clue) for further education and something under the advocacy lines.

I’m not set on college or anything, but I’m not the greatest in school, but got an 11/12 on my writing act and have an average HS gpa of 3.5.

I overall want to do things that I’m interested in and music producing and djing sound so fun and I’m crazy into music like many, I also really enjoy photography and have done two gigs for people and it’s just one of my hobbies. I would need to buy another camera to pursue that, a laptop and some other things to do all of those and expect any further income so there’s that.

I don’t know if anyone has similar experiences to me but considering I’m from a small country Wisconsin town I no absolutely no one who does anything like more niche and more hobby. Maybe I don’t have a direct question for advice, but a little guidance or people who relate would be helpful as I am pretty alone on my future.

1k0qwxt,New Property Manager—Feeling Misled and Set Up to Fail. Advice Needed.,"Hi everyone,

I recently accepted a Property Manager position and was genuinely excited to step into this role—especially after being assured I’d have a solid team and a smooth transition. Unfortunately, that has been far from the truth.

I feel like I was completely misled about the status of this community. No one informed me prior to accepting the offer that the entire onsite team was planning to leave. On my first day, I was told my Assistant Manager (whom I was planning to lean on heavily) was leaving that day. I’ve since found out that the Leasing Agent and the entire Maintenance Team are also leaving or already gone. I was told just yesterday that leadership was aware of this before I even started.

Why wasn’t I informed? I feel completely blindsided.

To make things worse, what feels like a hostile work environment has started to emerge—and I’ve only been onsite for about a week and a half. Earlier this week, someone from upper management came in unannounced and confronted me in my office with accusations based on team gossip, none of which were true. I feel like I’m being punished simply for stepping into this role.

I’m being told I’m “unapproachable,” despite being kind, receptive, and communicative. My team doesn’t reply to my texts. One team member won’t even make eye contact and stares at their phone when I speak. Upper management continues responding directly to the team’s concerns instead of redirecting them to me, which is undermining my role and authority.

I also received zero training on the property and was basically told to sink or swim. I created reference tools like a daily checklist and a property map for myself, just to stay afloat—and even those were flagged as a problem. I’ve read the company handbook and found nothing that prohibits me from using resources in my office to stay organized.

I was told I’d have a mentor. That never happened. I had a candidate lined up for my Assistant role after conducting interviews, and I’ve now been told I can’t hire anyone to fill it. I’ve been told internal candidates “aren’t going to be the best,” which feels dismissive and unfair.

This week I was also told I “might not meet the company standard,” which felt incredibly discouraging considering I’ve had no support, no team, and no training.

To top it off, when I was hired, I disclosed my visible tattoos and was assured they weren’t an issue since the property is student housing. Now I’m suddenly being told to cover them, which feels retaliatory and rooted in favoritism and cliquey dynamics from the previous team.

I want to succeed. I care about the property and doing well in this role—but I don’t know how I’m supposed to manage a property solo, wear three hats, and meet expectations without support or proper onboarding.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? How did you handle it? Is this fixable, or is this a red flag I should be running from?",Background_Front8348,1,1.0,0,1744826316,2025-04-16 17:58:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k0qwxt/new_property_managerfeeling_misled_and_set_up_to/,4,2025

1k0qfwu,18 and completely stuck on what career to go for — need honest advice from people actually in the field,"Hey everyone,
I’m 18 and currently doing A-Levels in Business, Computer Science, and Accounting. Did pretty well in O-Levels too — got A* in Economics, but I dropped it for A-Levels because I found it too theory-heavy and kinda dry. Also, I barely scraped a B in Maths, so anything super math-focused is probably not for me.

I’ve been going in circles trying to figure out a career path that actually makes sense for me. Not just something that sounds good on paper or TikTok, but a job I’d actually enjoy doing long-term.

Here’s what I do know so far:

I want to work in something that mixes business and tech, ideally more business-leaning

I’m aiming to study and eventually work in English-speaking countries in Europe (UK, Ireland) or maybe Australia

I want something realistic, that’ll still be in demand 10–20 years from now

It needs to be affordable to study, since I’m not made of money

And most importantly: I don’t want to wake up in 5 years hating my life because I picked the wrong path


Some roles I’ve looked at:

Business Analyst

Information Analyst

Tech Project Manager

Fintech-related roles

Maybe even Digital Strategy or something like that


But the more I look into these jobs, the more I wonder:
What are they actually like day to day? Do these jobs even exist the way people describe them? Are they boring, stressful, isolating? What are the entry-level roles like?

I’ve been reading a lot and even asking AI tools for guidance, but honestly, I need to hear from real people. So if you’re in any of these fields (or went through a similar process), I’d love to know:

What do you actually do at work?

What did you study and was the degree worth it?

What do you wish someone had told you when you were my age?

And based on what I’ve said, what career paths would you recommend (or avoid)?


Any advice would really help — even if it’s a reality check. I just want to make smart choices before spending 3–4 years and thousands on a degree I might not even use.

Thanks in advance!

1k0qcvh,Advice for trying to transition into sales.,"Just turned 27 and recently came to terms with the fact that it’s time for a career change. I’ve been really interested in breaking into pharma sales, specifically neuro and psych, since I already work in the field and genuinely like the population I help. That said, I’m open to any specialty.

I’ve been networking a lot on LinkedIn and have had some great conversations with reps who’ve been really encouraging. I’ve made it to two final-round interviews so far, but keep getting the same feedback: “no sales experience.”

The rejections don’t bother me. I’m competitive, so now I’m even more motivated to get a yes. I know it’s possible. I’ve seen teachers and personal trainers break into the field, so I figure I may just need a different approach.

1k0or8u,Should I get a new job?,"This is my first ever ‘entry level’ job and in my interview I was told I would have chances to advance and learn more instruments but it’s been almost a year and I’ve been stuck doing the same thing since then.

I’ve been having second thoughts about if I should go back to school and get a masters or go a completely different route like Radiology Tech. I’ve been looking into other chem-ish jobs but it’s hard when the requirements are 3-5+ years of experience. I could use some advice before determining if it’s worth going back to school or holding out at my job now.

1k0ocs2,My boss changed my report completely and turned it in without telling me…how to proceed?,"This is all a long story but here’s the main points:

-I am the primary point of contact for this grant. 
-I am the only employee from my agency that attends these grant meetings. 
-My boss specifically told me to complete the report. 
-My boss works 4 hours away from me and is in charge of a very large region. 
-To put it nicely, my boss has the education of someone who doesn’t even qualify to be entry level on my team. 
-My boss challenges me frequently on small irrelevant things that don’t matter and can NEVER admit when she’s wrong. We butt heads frequently. 
-I am licensed and have an advanced degree and am a leader within my field and agency. 

-This report was due Monday at 5pm. I emailed my boss Friday that I had entered all I could into the report on the shared google doc. (Didn’t say I was going to finish Monday but also didn’t think she was going to submit it without asking me)
-Monday at 2pm I emailed my final draft to my boss and another big leader. My boss said “I added to what you put and already turned it in”. 
-My boss did not include me on the email where she turned the report in. 
-I had a recurring meeting for this grant yesterday and was sent the report my boss submitted. 
-Upon review, my boss changed just about every single word of my report. She also changed my specific statements and made them very general. Some even included info about the entire system which is NOT what this report is about. 
-My boss included at least two points that were incorrect. Nothing huge but incorrect nonetheless. 
-My boss deleted a success story that was requested that she knew was something I personally did. 
-Yesterday afternoon I sent an email to my boss and other big leader on an already existing chain that said “could you please send me the report you submitted yesterday”? 

As of 11am today, no response from my boss about the report. 

She changed my very detailed and specific info to elementary level generalized statements. She also did not voice any concern to me about my info being incorrect/not good enough/etc. Just changed every word and submitted it without telling me, 3 days before it was due. 

I am confident I completed the report accurately. It appears my boss didn’t include me on the submission because she doesn’t want me to know she changed everything. She also is clearly avoiding me and doesn’t want to have the conversation. This other “big leader” is my regions CEO who my boss sees as a superior but in an unofficial sense. I am open and welcome feedback always. But if my boss thought the report was so bad, wouldn’t she tell me that?

What are your thoughts?

They can’t stand going to work and having to work together. One told me this is the reason they are calling out all the time. They are at the point they will not talk unless it is work related, and even like that they can’t stand each other. They even have had a couple instances of full out screaming at each other. One left and then came back after five days after a fight. It blows my mind they can’t get along.

1k0nvcm,"The Lion, The Witch, The Audacity of this Bitch","Need some advice on how to professionally handle a career situation that’s new to me. 

TL;DR - Former “toxic” coworker wants to use me as a reference for role in my new department. 

Between 2016-2020, I worked for a large corporation in a branch office in a niche department. I had a “toxic” (I know that word is overused, but I can’t think of a better one) manager, let’s call her Karen. At first things with here were OK. About a year into my time there, we were hiring an additional support role in our department. During the talent search, I recommended a strong candidate with relevant experience that I had worked with previously. She was interviewed several times by different stakeholders, and it looked promising. My manager instead advocated to our VP to hire her friend Sally, who had no relevant experience, because she was a better “culture fit.” (Fellow Disney Adult.) 

Fine, whatever. Can’t win ‘em all. 

Turns out that not only had Sally zero experience in our industry, but she had zero office experience. She was a slow learner and often balked at new processes and technology. It was like she forgot everything she learned when she went to sleep at night and we would have to start over the next day. Example: After showing her several times how to use Adobe to process a certain compliance document the proper way, she would still print out forms and fill them in by hand, saying it was “too hard to remember all the steps.” Karen eventually reassigned the task to me to complete.

About 2 years after she was hired, Sally, Karen, and I were involved in a casual Friday afternoon conversation with our regional VP who was visiting the office, and VP used a heinous racial slur three times. The one with the “hard r.” 

After the first time he said it, I boldly said to him it was inappropriate to say that word at work, but he continued to use it 2 more times to “prove a point.” I was pretty rattled by the conversation and later spoke to Karen, my manager, about what the next step should be. Karen told me it was a double standard that white people couldn’t use that word but rappers could. 

I then slept on it and decided I needed to escalate the situation to HR. This guy was, at best, showing incredibly poor judgment and it needed to be addressed. HR interviewed all 3 of us. I didn’t share the details of my interview with them, but Karen and Sally later cornered me and vocally defended the regional VP. He was ultimately let go. I later learned that this was part of a string of incidents where he made racial “jokes” and inappropriate sexual comments to other members of the team and even clients at a golf event. I was not the only person to report him, but it was the straw that broke the camel’s back so to speak.

Karen and Sally then went on to make things in our small office extremely uncomfortable for the rest of my time there. Typical Mean Girl shit mixed with racism (for example, Sally would go on rants about how all Native Americans are alcoholics or make comments about Black Lives Matter “riots” burning down cities and making it unsafe for innocent white people to travel - Boomer FOX News shit.) I tried my best to keep conversations with them strictly professional but it was really difficult to navigate the situation since we spent 40 hours a week in close quarters. Eventually I couldn’t directly communicate with Karen about work without getting a shitload of unrelated bullshit, so I was reassigned to her supervisor and all communications had to have the supervisor copied. 

Almost exactly a year to the day after I talked to HR about the VP’s racial slur, I was let go due to “performance issues.” (No PIP, one documented mistake in procedure.) I was asked to sign an NDA and given 3 months severance, which I took at the time because it was 2020, mid-pandemic, and I needed the money. 

Thankfully I was already actively searching for a new job!  I landed a new remote role at a different company, expanded my skill set in a new department, got some certifications and made some great working relationships. After 4 years at the new company, I was recruited and offered similar role (but with better pay/benefits) at a third company, which I just started three weeks ago. Dream scenario! 

The department I’m in is expanding to tackle more mergers & acquisitions, and we’re hiring 2 more individuals to handle the workload. 

Sally, who I’d honestly completely forgotten about, direct mailed me on LinkedIn and told me she applied for one of the open roles on my new team. She asked me if I “get anything” if she gets hired and wanted me to endorse her to HR. 

Honestly I am absolutely shocked at her audacity. No acknowledgment of the situation she was involved in; in fact she even complained about the “toxic” environment at our old company and told me she got fired too. 

I’m sorry but what the actual fuck is going through this woman’s brain? She has to be the most socially inept person I’ve ever worked with. There’s no way I could endorse her work or her personality to my new company, I don’t care how much the referral bonus would be. On top of the fact that she freely shares her racist opinions at work, she has no actual experience in the role we’re hiring for. 

Maybe she looked at my profile and figured she could land this role because I did, ignoring the fact that I’ve built new skills and relationships in the last 4 years?

I’m somewhat afraid the hiring manager will see that Sally mentioned me in her application and give her a shot, thinking “if Butterbean8686 could make the leap from Job A to this role, maybe Sally can too.” 

How do I give my new manager a heads up about Sally without sounding unprofessional and petty? I’m new and I don’t want to look like I’m an obstructionist or not a team player. We haven’t built the kind of trust in our working relationship where I’d feel comfortable being candid with her about Sally. 

We do urgently need to fill these positions as we have a huge ramp up in our workload looming. I wish I could offer someone else’s name as an alternative, but the 2 people I’ve worked with in this role at my most recent company aren’t good options (1 has a wife that still works at past company, and is probably not looking to make a move, and the other was on a PIP when I left). 

Right now I’ve left Sally on read. I’m not worried about responding to her. Honestly I’m considering blocking her on LinkedIn but probably won’t just out of morbid curiosity. I’m mainly concerned with how to professionally prevent her from joining my team. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading, and I’m looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!

My thoughts are that they want to chat about my previous decision before granting me an interview and I'm after any advice on how to respond/prepare for this. 

Reasons for choosing the other company were I'd always wanted to work for them through previous manager's recommendations and better pay. 

Reasons for leaving were constant expected overtime, not support and zero training. 

After two months I knew it was the wrong decision, but I stuck it out to finish the contract I was on and was glad to leave. When I saw the role come up again, I applied for it, but I've also applied to another major company as well.

So for context I’m 21, on a gap year from Uni, and go into my 3rd year in September. 

So, I currently work as a manager in a company chain and have done for around 3 years. Its a comfortable job, very flexible and I have a good relationship with the area manager there. It pays £15.50 an hour. 

I recently found out that they are closing our store in june, our jobs are all safe and we are being moved to another new store which is an additional 30 minutes journey time. 

Naturally, I looked at other options as the travel seemed doable but a bit too long for me. I stumbled upon a job that pays £48k a year, and to make a long story short, I’ve been offered this job. 

The job is the same level of management that I am doing now, however its 46 hours a week. They also provide 4 weeks of management / company training. I havent been given a location yet, but have been told it’ll be in a good radius from where I live. The benefits are really good, and the company seems to be well organised and well managed (and actually care a lot more about their staff). 

The only issue I have is that in September, when I go back to Uni, I won’t be able to work 46 hours a week. This means I’ll no longer be able to do the job. However, in my current job, I have the option of going part time.

Plant manager asked if I’m talking to recruiters I said if they call I answer the call and have a conversation, but I’m not out actively searching. He asked if my direct manager was aware to which I said he was. Plant manager told me I needed to tell my manager what my plan was. I met last week with my manager and said the same thing, but my direct manager was already aware of all of this. 

Yesterday my direct manager called me into his office to say that the plant manager had called him and told him I am leaving and actively interviewing (which isn’t true I haven’t applied anywhere in over a month) My direct manager said that what I said to him and what plant manager said to him are complete opposites. My plant manager asked my direct manager if he knew when I planned on getting married and starting a family, so they would know a timeline for my leaving. Which I told even have a timeline for that. 

I am worried that my plant manager is going to call me in again and ask me to discuss what me and my direct manager discussed and push me to say one thing or another about my future. Would I be in the right to just tell my plant manager that I don’t feel comfortable discussing my outside life and future plans with anyone to try to end this circle of plant manager, direct manager and me going round in circles to “figure out what my future plans are” 

Looking for advice on how to end this conversation or how to deal with a plant manager that is digging/pushing me to tell him my future plans.

1k0iea7,Where should I go from here?,"I’m 25 now and I’m desperate for financial freedom. I’m currently working in a school through an agency where I‘m a teaching assistant for difficult and traumatised kids. I‘m actually having a really good time with it and get paid fairly decently but now it’s the Easter holidays I’m not getting paid at all so I’m using this time to entertain alternative income streams and do some career planning. When I was 20 I dropped out of my first degree but then went back to a different uni at 21 where I graduated last year in sociology with social psychology where I achieved a first-class degree so I’m in a lot of debt. In terms of employment this past half a year has been unbelievably difficult as I live in an area of scarce opportunity. However, I have managed to get myself on a graduate detective programme with my local police force due to start in September which, would be fully funded and give me a starting salary whilst training. However, I’m also debating if this is what I actually want to do. I’ve been considering educational psychology as, I’ve realised I’m a psychologist at heart but this takes on a lot more debt and further education but at the end of it salaries for psychologists are mega and it’s a profession that is in high demand. 

Right now, I’m living with my parents but I’m very motivated to become financially independent and move out as soon as possible or when I feel financially secure. So my position right now is that whilst I have a job, I won’t be working this next week or so and the job I do have will end on the 25th of May so I need to find an opportunity come summer. I’m fully aware that one day I’ll wake up and I’ll be 40 and (like everyone) I want to be in a position where I gave it my best shot and I don’t have any regrets. I’m a deeply curious person and I’m very motivated to help people so I’m even considering doing video essays or finding fulfilling ways to make money online as I’m burning with ambition and would love to have a side hustle that I can always engage in when I have the time (like now). My dilemma therefore is, I recognise I’m in a privileged position and in this position, should I focus on the guaranteed safe career option that I have secured (the police) and plan around that or, should I look at exploring my true passion (psychology) which is a much bigger and uncertain commitment. If there’s anyone that’s been in a similar position in life or someone who feel qualified to provide their insight I’d be more than grateful to hear from you. Thanks for reading.

1k0hu3j,Tips for first time job in corporate,"I’m starting a new job next month and its my first job in corporate. 27 M, so have had jobs before but never in this role. Worked as a sports coach at a school while studying and then took another job, on the contractual side in sports. 

Current job was work from home, super laid back culture, small team of 6 guys - really a relaxed environment. No real work culture. Official hours were 9-4 but due to the industry, we could have to work any hour of any day, like taking calls from clients at 8pm hopping on a zoom call at 7pm with a sports team etc. Very flexible schedule, no dress code, no real HR so there wasnt a need for professional language amongst us. It was 6 guys working in sport, so you can imagine that internal meetings and group chats weren’t very HR friendly lol. Boss was super cool, we’d drink and talk nonsense on company trips, work hard play hard. Was pretty much a “I dont care what you do, as long as you’re up to date, making the company money and not embarrassing the company, have at it”. Leave days were not a thing for example😅 if you finished all work by 12:30, you can do what you want after (because other days you’d be expected to be on the clock at 6pm). It really was a free for all, based on trust that we’re all playing our part. I had to move as I got lazy with WFH, didnt enjoy being the only employee in my city, so productivity drops and I’ll just never thrive in this environment. 

Absolutely any tips or advice on things I should know going into a conventional office? 😅 I dont want to make a fool of myself. Even tips/advice on how to climb up and better chances for promotions or better jobs at other companies. Doubt I’ll ever be a complete suck up, but I’m sure you definitely have to build relationships with the right people. 

Again, I have zero experience in this culture. If work starts at 8 - do I just have to be in the door by 8 or already sitting at my desk and actually working by 8? 🤣 communication with colleagues on personal platforms or only be email? 

Not a person thats feels “if its not in my exact work hours, I’m not working”. I’m happy to put in extra graft when needed (within reason of course). I’ve been pretty much on the clock 24/7 with my current job so I’ve developed a tolerance to answering messages, emails and calls on a sunday at 10am if it’s necessary.

Any advice, tips, hacks that I should know - absolutely anything will be valuable. 

Thanks! 🤣",ProfitSignificant875,2,0.75,3,1744802054,2025-04-16 11:14:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k0hu3j/tips_for_first_time_job_in_corporate/,4,2025
1k0gxt2,"No career prospects in the U.S.A., don't know what to do","I'm totally stuck. I'm an ex-college drop out that went back and managed to get a master's degree in anthropology/archaeology. I discussed potential career options with the head of the anthropology department, and it seemed like there was a lot of possibilities available. I was careful not to pigeonhole myself. I did want to go for my PhD somewhere and become a historian or professor, or go into archaeology or museum studies or something like that. I was also open to becoming a K-12 teacher, or using the anthropology part of my degree towards something adjacent (the things you learn about people and cultures in anthropology translate well for things dealing with interpersonal relationships and such). 

But I'm stuck. A lot of the pathways available to me have been cut short by recent changes to the Dept of Education, different programs getting their funds slashed, lack of financial aid, and so on. Additionally, I'm concerned about K-12 schools being a political minefield right now. My state for example is passing several bills opening up teachers and schools to lawsuits for things like not outing LGBT students to their parents. I feel like I'd be constantly walking on eggshells no matter how much I might try to avoid politics in the workplace.

Trying to go for teacher licensure has also been frustrating because although I've successfully taught almost a dozen history courses as a GTA (actually teaching the courses themselves, while the professors did lectures), I am apparently required to go back and get a second bachelor's in education. I don't have the money for that, and can't seem to get financial aid since I already have a B.A. This is also a problem when I ask about possible vocational school options. 

I don't know what to do. Even if I could go back to school, I'm struggling to find a job that pays more than $16/hr, let alone a job that will let me be financially independent. Trying to survive on that for 2+ years while also studying for another degree seems impossible. Trying to actually get a job relevant to my field, I keep getting hit with ""you lack experience, have you considered volunteering for a few years to build your resume?"" 

It all feels hopeless. The most exciting thing in the world to me is seeing someone's eyes light up when something I'm teaching clicks with them. I love learning and I love sharing knowledge with everyone. I love seeing kids and adults both get excited about topics they thought would be boring. I'm fascinated by history, by how people change and yet stay the same all through history. That's really what I wanted to do. The resounding chorus of ""well why didn't you major in something useful like business finance?"" is salt in the wound. I can't wrap my head around how much something as enormous as history or educating young people is ""not useful."" I don't understand how people make underwater basket weaving jokes about something so important. And I don't regret anything that I've accomplished. I don't regret trying to get to do what I love. I'm just depressed and bewildered that there is apparently no place for that in this country.

It feels hopeless, I feel useless, I don't know what to do, and I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'll be grateful for any advice anyone has. If the only option is genuinely ""go be a wage slave while studying for another degree for the next X years,"" then that's just my lot I guess. But I desperately hope there's something in the bigger picture that I'm missing. Please tell me there's some way out.

1k0g3ej,How do I stop beating myself up over mistakes at work?,"I'm in my first office job after graduating from my Masters degree. This is my second real week doing work (I was at training programmes for a month before but more like learning company culture, etiquette, etc, nothing specific to my job). I'm working in an engineering company and I am the only person in my office not from an engineering background.

I am the only native English speaker in my office and in my team so often I am given English to review for international projects. On Monday I was given 7 pages in my native language and my supervisor told me not to search things but if I didn't know things then to ask him. I found it pretty okay and only had to check a dictionary for a few technical engineering words I don't know but as a whole the English was good and natural and I submitted it just fine and he didn't say anything. I asked him today how it was and he told me that it was fine but as I'm not an engineer I didn't phrase things in the particular jargon they wanted to use so he went in and changed some of it. He told me next time to just use ChatGPT and fix the unnatural parts. I was under the impression from my training at the start of the job that we cannot use ChatGPT for company sensitive information which is why I spent a long time translating by hand...

I know it's just one silly mistake but there was also an instance someone asked me a question today and I didn't have a clue! After they reworded it I was fine but I'm beating myself up. I know they know I'm not from their country and background but I just feel like I'm being set up to be let go precisely for those reasons. I really like my job and company and no one seemed mad at me but I get the sense I'm just the office idiot...

1k0fg9e,Qld Govt Job suggestions,"Hi guys, I have been offered an AO5 Principal Technology Officer (IT) with Queensland Health in a rural town. While I am very excited about this opportunity, I am not entirely comfortable with the relocating (I am moving from New Zealand) to a rural location. This is essentially because I would be uprooting my family (wifey and young toddlers) - we have a comfortable life with decent earning in NZ. However, career wise my life has become stagnant and don't imagine I can grow here professionally. I didn't have any luck in securing a city-based opportunity (due to high competition and easy availability of local candidates) but managed to secure one in rural part of the state.

- currently employed in a job I enjoy and have a good progression path (in the UK if that makes much difference)
- wasn't looking for another job, but someone i used to work with recommended me and they asked me to interview 
- the packaging sounded appealing so I went to the interview to find out more
- got offered the job but the package wasn't quite what I was expecting and the job didn't sound as fun as my current one
- a couple of weeks later they offered me more money, it would now be about an £11k increase over my current salary with better benefits and a yearly bonus
- between the offers I spoke to the person I know there to tell him, and he said I'm probably right to turn it down as it's actually not a great place to work after all

I have a catch up with my manager at my current job today to discuss pay, and I'm not sure if I should bring the offer up or not.  Like I say it's not like I was looking or want to move, but I also don't want to not use such a good bargaining chip, but I know that can backfire at times.

1k0efd0,Psychology career,"I'm (F21) already in my fourth year of Psychology (Honours) but just feel like i have no motivation even though honours year is the most important. I chose psychology because I was good at it in high school and kinda enjoyed it so I just told myself I'll become a psychologist. So, that means I'd have this year, and two more years afterwards (Masters) but I don't know, maybe I'm burnt out but I just feel a lack of motivation towards psychology and towards my thesis. I also recently started working in a psych clinic as a admin and receptionist and I don't mind the job however it's just been making me think if working as a psychologist is something I genuinely want to do. But I'm already in my fourth year (started 2 ish months ago), I do have my bachelors degree but for me it doesn't mean much, to be a psychologist I need to complete my honours and masters degree. 

The only other thing I know that i would enjoy doing or passionate about, or my dream thing to do, is to write novels and fiction and poetry but I don't even feel the motivation to do that on the side because of my work and uni just stressing me and taking up all my time. I like to be creative but i feel like all my creativity has been zapped these past years in uni. And I know pursuing writing books isn't something that is solid or something that will make you money. I wish I could dedicate some time to write on the side while finishing up my uni but I'm just not sure if it's doable or I have that time. And I already have a decent debt for uni so dropping out seems pointless, but then I'm afraid of completing three more years, having an ever bigger debt, and realising I don't want to be a psychologist at all. 

I don't really know what advice I want, I guess just anybody that may have experienced something similar. I'm so deep into uni in psychology already but the passion isn't exactly there, in terms of uni and I don't even know anymore if I want to be a psychologist. I kinda feel regretful and wonder if I should've pursued a degree like creative writing instead 

I'm scared to talk to family about it because they all have the expectations that I'm definitely gonna finish uni and become a psychologist.

1k0c55b,Advice for an aspiring firefighter/paramedic with bipolar 2? TL;DR at end,"I saw a recent post on here asking about the best jobs for bipolar. Answers were all “part time,” “no night shifts,” “flexible schedule,” “low stress”. 

Firefighting is quite literally a 24 hour (or sometimes 48, depending) shift with several days in a row of rest. Paramedics run long shifts and are underpaid. Both jobs are extreme stress and intensity, with high stakes.

I am 21. I speak 3 languages, I have an undergraduate degree in Spanish. I used to be an academic weapon (perfect ACT score, 97 gpa in a competitive high school, published, etc) but crashed majorly in college and scraped by with a 2.7. I am TIRED of academia. I’d rather end it all than go to grad school or do homework. 

I’m very all-or-nothing, and I honestly can’t see myself doing a 9 to 5 (not to shame that, genuinely nothing wrong, just not for me). My biggest priority is doing something I genuinely believe in, something that feels meaningful and I can engage with everything I have. I’d MUCH rather work at periods of high intensity and have a lot of time in between to decompress. 

I’m a hard worker, I have a good work ethic, and I would never pursue this line of work if I didn’t believe I’d do a damn good job. I know depression hits like a bitch and I can’t afford to call out, but with time I believe I can achieve enough stability and management techniques. 

My goal is to work for 2 more years saving money (I’m making bank at a fine dining steakhouse in a rich city), go to paramedic school, then transition to firefighting. I’m doing 5 days a week strength training, push pull legs, and I’m very passionate about physical health. 

I’ve done lots of research and weighed the risks. This is not about pay - I know what to expect. This world is so shit and I’m cynical of non-profits or non-grassroots social support. I want to do something on an individual level and help as many people as I can, and my language skills are useful for this. 

My only concern is that paramedic/firefighter seems the EXACT opposite of what everyone says is ideal for BP. 

TL;DR: I’m 21F and want to be a paramedic, then firefighter. I’m making bank at my current job but I NEED to do something I care about. I’m a very intense person and firefighting runs on a 24/48 or 48/96 schedule (24 straight hours of work, 2 full days rest). I’ve researched the pay, the working conditions, the skills needed. I am physically fit, pretty smart, and have a good work ethic. I work really well under pressure and have dealt with a fair share of emergencies (don’t ask). I really think I’d do a good job, but I’m wary since it’s the EXACT opposite of what people say ideal for someone with BP.

1k0c1zi,Advice for an aspiring firefighter/paramedic with bipolar 2?,"I saw a recent post on the r/bipolar asking about the best jobs for bipolar. Answers were all “part time,” “no night shifts,” “flexible schedule,” “low stress”. 

Firefighting is quite literally a 24 hour (or sometimes 48, depending) shift with several days in a row of rest. Paramedics run long shifts and are underpaid. Both jobs are extreme stress and intensity, with high stakes.

I am 21. I speak 3 languages, I have an undergraduate degree in Spanish. I used to be an academic weapon (perfect ACT score, 97 gpa in a competitive high school, published, etc) but crashed majorly in college and scraped by with a 2.7. I am TIRED of academia. I’d rather end it all than go to grad school or do homework.

It honestly still feels unreal. But I just wanted to share this small win because the journey hasn’t been easy. While I was trying to find the right path, I also had to deal with a lot of criticism from family for not staying long enough at any job. They didn’t understand that I was still figuring things out, and I questioned myself many times too.

But now, after all the struggle, rejection, and doubt, I finally feel like I’m on the right track. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from all this, it’s: don’t give up.

1k0b2e6,I think my current manager is trying to get me to continue to do my current job on top of my new one behind my back and I don’t know what to do,"Hey guys, long story short, a coworker (Evan) of mine from another branch offered me a job and I said yes. So basically I’m moving on the other side of the country in a few weeks. The job I was offered is completely different from the one I’m currently doing. I didn’t think there was anything else for me out there and that I could ever find another job. I don’t have any experience about the new job but I thought if someone thinks I can do it to the point where they offer it to me, then I probably can. And I’ll be getting a huge raise once I start. Even negotiated a little bit higher. Contract signed and everything.

But the thing is, today my current manager (Nancy) told me she’s been talking with that branch’s boss (Henry) about me continuing to do my current job on top of my new one and said he thinks I could do it. I’m not sure how to feel or what to do about this. When I spoke with Evan about the job he never mentioned I’d still be doing my current tasks so I’m not sure he even knows about this. I feel like Nancy’s and Henry have been talking behind my back and expect me to just accept it? 

The new job is way more demanding than the one I’m currently doing so I’m not sure how I’m gonna have time to do another one on top of it. For a bit more context, they offered me the job before even posting an ad and when I asked for more money they said yes just because of my experience. I’m moving in a more expensive area and the raise will be a huge help but doing 2 jobs for only 15k more in a more expensive area? I feel like I’m getting stabbed in the back. Plus, I already signed my new lease. If I back back out it’ll cost me a over 1000$.

Part of me thinks I could maybe get more money since they immediately thought about me for the job, but I’m not sure how to ask given the situation. I for sure want to talk to Evan about it first.

1k0af6f,"Contract Ending, Staying on as a Casual - Do I get Casual Loading?","I am employed by a non-profit that works primarily on a project-by-project basis, and I have previously been on a full-time, fixed-term contract. My fixed-term agreement ends this week, but they are going to keep me on until the end of the financial year on a casual (full time hours) basis. This works great for me, as they know I don't plan on working in this industry long term since it is a very specific line of work the organisation sits in and is not what I see myself doing for very long, and I'd like to go back to work in the industry related to my degree and other education. This is something we discussed and they would like to keep me around to help finish some projects till the end of the financial year.

So, I got my new casual agreement today and my wage is the same. We do not come under an industry specific award and it is a small company that is doing good by me by keeping me around, so I don't want to distrupt anything. I make $38 an hour still, which is decent for the work I am doing, but I was under the impression that some form of casual loading would be required to be applied since I no longer accrue leave or get paid on public holidays. Beggers can't be chosers, I am so happy to still be in a job while I look for a new one, so I don't want to carry on and I understand I am pretty priveleged to be kept on for the next few months, but I'd thought it would be worth the question. - The only answer I am coming up with, is that the $38 dollars I make essentially is high enough above basic employment standards to not require the loading if I was to sign a casual contract, therefore not requiring them to change the wage?

Thanks in advance - Also sorry if this is the wrong place to post something like this, I saw a few similar questions but none of them with this specific scenario, so thought I'd try my luck.

1k0aem0,Filed for FMLA Leave for Ill Parent while on PIP,"Hi long time reader first time caller -

As the title describes, I (31 F) was (unfairly imo as I was not given adequate OR timely feedback to improve) placed on a PIP this past performance cycle. I had been contemplating taking medical leave as I just received an ADHD diagnosis and my mental health has taken a nosedive (over eating not sleeping etc) with this PIP as it feels like I’m being bullied every day and that nothing I do is good enough. Along with a heavy backlog of work and scope increase, I’m not exactly in a great headspace to look for a new job. 

To make matters worse (or more complicated) my 70 year old father has Parkinson’s disease and has been in and out of the hospital since February. Lo and behold last Wednesday he was hospitalized for severe dehydration and low sodium and was completely out of it mentally until yesterday. 

This has added to mental burden and I decided I need to apply for FMLA - my mom passed away 8 years ago so my brother and I are his living immediate family. I need time to recover from all of this as well as plan my father’s next steps into an assisted living facility so that I can continue functioning day to day. 

However, I’m worried about how this looks since I’m on a PIP. I know they plan to fire me anyway as I’m not naive but I’m worried. 

I have a 1:1 with her scheduled for tomorrow and I’m looking for advice on how to frame this. She knows my dad has medical issues although I’ve not disclosed the severity. I would plan on creating a leave plan with any outstanding tasks / client work since this is a high stress job before I went on leave. Any advice for the guilt / stress? I just want to feel like myself again and this feels like the best path forward. Ty!

1k09z5c,Follow the money? Or follow my interests?,"Hi all,

I could definitely use some career advice as I try to figure out the next move. I've worked for the corporate wing of a major retailer for about 6 years. After 4.5 years I was part of a wave of layoffs. Not performance based, just headcount reductions and role consolidation. I eventually made my back to the company via some former coworkers who knew of an open role. This is in a field I'm very interested in and ideally would like to progress through eventually ending up as a category manager. 

The main issue is the pay. It's also hourly which I'm not big on. There are a lot of great opportunities down the line with this role, but it's likely a year out if not longer. 

Recently, my old boss from my previous role reached out to me letting me know that a role on his team would be available soon. This is a different job than what I was doing previously, but I'm not super interested in it. I can definitely do the work, but i know I'll eventually get bored of it. 

The new role would pay $10-15k more a year as a salaried position. Currently, I make things work financially. I make enough to cover my rent and expenses but not much is leftover every month to save. I would like to get back to funding my 401k again. 

So, what should I do? Take the less interesting role now and make more money? Or, stay in the lower paying role that's more interesting and probably what I want to end up doing long term. For the record, I'm 33 and in no debt with a decent size financial cushion saved.

Honestly, really liked it for a while, but recently got what I can only describe as “the ick” - it’s like my eyes are finally open, the honeymoon phase is over, and every new thing I notice makes it more painful to work everyday. My managers are really great in many ways but their flaws just happen to align with my least favorite qualities in a job, and it’s like I’m finally noticing it all at once.

I think I’ve accepted I need to get a new job (not going to right away, but maybe applying within the next 6 months or so), but part of me wonders how to frame my work/career to mitigate this happening again. I do have a feeling this came out of some self-preservation and caring too much at first.

1k07we9,What to prioritize when choosing an offer? Role or Location?,"How does the job role/duties vs the location of the job factor into your decision when weighing job offers?   
  
I have been looking for a job in my field for about 2 months and I haven't been having good luck (between the job market and my lack of experience, aside from my degree). Over the past two days, I have received two job offers and I'm having trouble weighing the pros and cons of each job as they seem to be very equal.   
  
Job A is in at a hospital in large city in a very rural state. I generally like the idea of the location but it is close to 19 hours away from any of my family and in an area I have never been. The job itself sounds interesting and would allow me to get additional certifications.   
  
Job B is at a factory-ish environment in a smaller city that's 1 hour away from a very large city. I like this location more as I have always wanted to live in the nearby large city. It's also closer to my family as it's only 6 hours away. However the job doesn't sound as exciting and I'm afraid I would get burn-out quickly.  
  
Overall, I like Job A's role more than Job B, but I like the location of Job B more than the location of Job A. The benefits at both jobs are very similar (PTO hours, health insurance rates, etc.) which makes the choose even more difficult. I told Job A that I would give back to them by tomorrow afternoon (48hrs after the offer) so I don't have much more time.

1k07tv5,"Third day in higher role, no pay increase.","Tomorrow will be my third day in my new role, new desk.

For context, I’ve been easing into the role the last few months, in preparation for the official move. I was told prior (by the 2nd-in-command of the company) that I’d get a pay raise to come with it. “We’re giving you a raise now, and then another raise once you change positions”

My county’s average pay for this position is $9 more than I currently make. I’ll be asking for the average, citing the work I’d already been doing/learning. But I’ll be hoping for *at least* $5 more than my current pay.

I asked one HR rep (not the HR manager) if anyone has mentioned anything about me signing paperwork to make it official. She stated “No they haven’t. They’ll probably put you in a 90-day probation period since it’s a new role, then give you an evaluation you after”

Our pay period ends this week so I’m wondering if they’re waiting till the end of this pay week, for payroll purposes.

**My worry is that they won’t increase my pay until the 90 days are up.**

**How do I politely say “I’m expecting an increase” or “when am I signing paperwork”, or is there a more proper way to go about it?**

**And should I wait until the coming Monday, for the new pay period?**

Also, I’m worried that they’ll low-ball me. I can’t exactly say “never mind” but they can’t exactly afford to lose me either. I’m one of three in the department, with one going on leave this month.

1k06wqz,"Unfulfilled, seeking job hunting advice","TL;DR:
27, stuck in a stable remote job making $32/hr but totally unfulfilled. Lifelong dream is creative work (film, photography, games). Lived in LA chasing it, learned stock analysis too. Now just trying to find a way back to something that actually feels meaningful.

-

Ever since I was a kid, my dream jobs were always in filmmaking, video game production, or anything visually creative. That passion has stayed with me my whole life—I’m now 27, and I still absolutely love video games and movies. Over the years, I’ve consistently dabbled in both photography and videography on the side. It’s always been something that excites and fulfills me creatively.

-

My first job was at a movie theater in high school, where I worked for about five years. After that, I briefly worked a seasonal job at Costco right after graduating. It paid more, but I hated it. I then moved on to Starbucks, where I stayed for about a year. One day, while shopping for AirPods and an iPhone at the Apple Store, I had a great conversation with an employee. We bonded over our shared love of technology—another big passion of mine—and he encouraged me to apply.

-

A few weeks later, I built a résumé and walked into the store in person to ask for a manager. I didn’t realize that nobody really does that anymore and that everything is usually handled online. But the manager respected the initiative and told me there was a group interview happening in 30 minutes—so I stayed. A few weeks later, I got the job.

-

I started off doing a little bit of everything at Apple, but I eventually found my place at the Genius Bar. I worked hard, moved up quickly, and became a bit of a leader there. After three years, I was offered the chance to help open a new Apple Store in LA. I saw it as a sign—an opportunity to both grow professionally and chase my dreams in a city full of creative potential.

-

While I was in LA, I doubled down on photography and began trying to transition that into filmmaking, hoping to build an audience on social media and work my way up from there. I also started studying the stock market and technical analysis during my time there. I fell in love with it—the charts, the strategy, the logic. It became another passion I never expected to find.

-

But LA is expensive, and the city wore me down. After about two years, I couldn’t keep up financially and had to move back home. Apple had told me I’d have a spot waiting at my original store, but when I returned, that opportunity was gone. I couldn’t stay on a leave of absence forever, so I had to quit.

-

After that, I went through a rough patch—fell into a depression and spent the next year applying to hundreds of jobs every week. I rarely heard back. I’m not sure if my résumé was weak or if it was just getting filtered out by automated systems, but nothing stuck. Eventually, I figured Starbucks would take me back—and they did. I stayed there for nearly a year.

-

During that time, I met my girlfriend, who worked at a hospital. One thing led to another, and she helped me get a job there. It was a big step up financially—more money than I’d ever made before. About a year in, I transitioned into a fully remote role that pays significantly more than what I started with—currently around $32 an hour, 40 hours a week.

-

That brings me to now. I’m incredibly grateful for the stability and income, but I’m also extremely unfulfilled. Working remote isn’t what it’s cracked up to be. I have no coworkers, no collaboration, no stimulation. The work is repetitive—mostly data review, scheduling patients, and getting more and more tasks thrown at me. I don’t care about the work at all. I’ve been doing this for about six months, and it’s slowly driving me crazy.

-

I know I’m lucky to be in the financial position I’m in. But I desperately need something that excites me again—something creative or technical that I can actually be passionate about. I’m trying to figure out what that next step looks like.

-

I would love some advice from people here that read this and see the skills that I’ve accumulated and could recommend what to do, where to apply, or what I need.

1k05gu2,Navigating the Frustrations of Breaking into Tech,"I find it hard to get along with software developers—not everyone, but a good number.  
I meet some at events, and some are nice, but most, or at least half, are ass hats. I have volunteered and worked on hackathon projects. During volunteering, there was so much arguing during meetings, problems I brought up that I gave solutions for, but I kept getting overlooked because I did not work at Google or Amazon. I keep recommending fixes that keep getting ignored until they're brought up as someone else's idea in the next meeting or until crap hits the fan.

People tell me I'm unqualified for entry-level jobs, but no one has seen my projects, GitHub, or resume. I've had people talk down to me, and it's hard to get any questions answered on Stack Overflow or Reddit, so the only places you can go are AI, GitHub, and maybe Discord. Even when I talk to people about the making of their app, I get ignored (mostly coming from founders asking for tech advice).

I keep telling everyone that not everything needs IaaS—just go with PaaS because you can hit the market faster. I just stopped talking about tech altogether. The job market is even more frustrating, hearing that AI will take your job. I keep hearing that I'm overqualified or underqualified or just not ""full-stackie"" enough (said by a recruiter).

I mean, I have a good opportunity with a guy in another state—I'm going to be painting and doing other stuff—but in the winter, I'll be doing some part-time dev work (probably will move back home to start going to school again and move on campus).

I just had a conversation with the guy, and I told him that starting with Azure/AWS is a waste of time. I mean, how many devs do you have that can make a CI/CD process? I keep saying using Render or something alike would be better for dev speed and lighter overhead at the start, then you can slowly move to another platform once money starts coming in. I think he heard what I said, but it's not going in that direction.

Is it normal to be treated this way as a dev?",Ok_Tadpole7839,3,1.0,2,1744757468,2025-04-15 22:51:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1k05gu2/navigating_the_frustrations_of_breaking_into_tech/,4,2025

1k058uh,Considering switching from teaching to SLP (already signed up for prereq classes). Advice?,"**TLDR: Is the grass greener on the other side? Is SLP a good career alternative to teaching?** 

(this is my first reddit post ever so feedback is welcome)

I'm less than a year out of college and a 3rd grade teacher. I have the most amazing and supportive admin and fun coworkers but I simply do not want to teach anymore. I've dreamed of being a teacher since I was nine and now that I'm here, I'm extremely discouraged. I've been yelled at and ignored by parents, students don't care to learn or do the absolute bare minimum, I'm constantly overwhelmed by the amount of students I have to tend to (25) at once and although my admin says I'm doing amazing and they'd love to have me back next year, I feel so defeated. I teach my ass off just for them to get to the test and act like I've taught nothing. We just took some standardized testing and some of the answers they submitted had me so embarrassed. The pacing guide is one lesson/day and no time for breaks or reteaching. We have a scheduled 20 minutes that's supposed to be used for reteaching and review but these kids are so needy (in all ways) that I can never sit down to actually pull for small groups. 

I feel like I wasted 4 years on a bachelors. My advisor and teachers told me that a lot of the people would leave the profession but that I was one of the strong ones who would make it past the 5 year period in which most new educators leave. My dream is crushed, I must admit. My mentor and coach say I'm made for this but I can't do it anymore. The headaches, anxiety attacks, the disrespect, the being tired after a full 8hours of sleep, not having energy to do anything after work, Sunday scaries, the preps that turn into study halls because students aren't working during class time, the paperwork, phone calls home, focus walls, holiday activities, pencil debacles, it's just all. too, much. I have literally had 6 kids coming up to me talking at once. Mind you I have taught expectations through and through. I use class dojo and a class store system as well as throwing class parties that you have to have a certain percentage of class dojo positives for. I feel I've done it all and I'm just so so tired. I've remembered my why and that next year would be better but I'm sorry. Between the behaviors and the low pay, it's just not enough. 

SLP is appealing because I LOVE phonics, morphology, and language. I also love working with kids, just not 25 at a time. I've worked with kids since I was about 9 as well.  I've never been a science whiz but I feel I could hunker down and really make it through if I tried. I've heard the pay is better and that I have many more options of what setting I'll work in. I'm already signed up for prereqs to start in May.

1k04hol,"Am I crazy or was this situation dealt with badly? Intern with limited work experience, looking for advice!","
22 F, I started working at a small mom and pop business. It’s a 6 month internship, and tbh I don’t have the most experience. I ran my own business and I didn’t deal with operations. So I’d love to get some more developed workers opinions and advice! Btw all this is via teams as we’re remote:)

I’ll try and make it quick! 

This morning I offered to help lead gen, I’m a marketer, but 25 emails a day from sales manager was pretty low. I had experience in my first job. Sales shot me down. Saying it’d be better if I could follow up from emails on LinkedIn, connect and ask if they’ve seen the email. 

As someone developing my career, I felt uncomfortable. It’s local, top businesses and it felt a bit salesy? It wouldn’t be something I had confidence in due to lack of experience, and I had a lot of do anyway. I couldn’t do it efficiently. Plus I thought it might negatively impact future opportunities as it’s a personal account. 

Sales manager challenged what I said. Giving me unsolicited advice, but being younger I’ve expected that now. I nodded and smiled, and my manager the MD, said I can log into his account and do it. Cool I thought it was solved! 

Apparently not. Later on, MD asks me to ask advice from sales manager, although I had a decent idea as to how to approach things. I thought it’d be valuable to ask. 

This segways into him bringing up this morning, I ended up recording the convo. I’ve had issues at work before where it’s he said she said, it’s more a reflex I’ve developed. 

He starts giving me unsolicited advice again, telling me basically how he’s done more than me, how he’s xyz. Not to brag but I’ve done some pretty great things with my own business. Which is now a worldwide e commerce brands that’s worked with celebs. I know I’m not as experienced, but I felt like be was talking down to me/ leveraging his seniority to force me to agree that me rejecting to connect with people was “bonkers”. 

I tried to de escalate, and explained how I have been developing my LinkedIn connections and I’m thankful for the advice. I was trying to be very nice, as I did somewhat appreciate it. But I said it just wasn’t what I was comfortable doing, me and MD already sorted it. I felt like it was more sales than marketing. 

He starts getting upset, agitated. “WHAT DO YOU MEAN SALESY? HOW IS IT SALESY? I DONT UNDERSTAND, I JUST THINK ITS BONKERS”. I’m extremely uncomfortable, explaining I’m reaching out to cold leads selling an event even if free . “ ITS NOT SALES, WE’RE NOT SELLING ANYTHING”. 

I keep saying I’m just not comfortable doing it. He said okay, fine he’ll do it. I remind him me and the MD have already created a work around. 

Then he basically passively threatens me. “ well okay I will be talking to MD about this”. I remind him this has been resolved this morning in our teams call. But if he feels it’s a concern I don’t have an issue with it. 

Anyway I thought I’d let the MD know this happened. I’d rather explain what’s happened my side before I’m made out to be something. I listened back to my recording, I was extremely nice and polite. 

He basically tells me to let it go, because sales manager is going through a lot. What could I learn? How should I have handled it better. Basically I should be the bigger person. This man is nearing early 40s, and had no way to speak to me like this. I shouldn’t just put it in a diary and forget about it. 

Had he validated me etc, I would have felt better. Instead I felt worse. I’m very non confrontational and this made me cry, it was hard for me to hold down my nerves and my ground as an ex people pleaser/ anxious person. 

Any advice? Or any insight on what’s happened and how to move forward and is this normal in a work place? I’m thinking about demanding an apology.

Now, after two layoffs and still landing on my feet (!) — I’m amazed at how chaotic the job search process is. Whaaa…?

I wasn’t expecting how draining it would feel. Between searching for roles that seem like a solid fit, tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, and hearing nothing back, it’s starting to feel surprisingly personal (and, at times, a little pointless).

I’m curious… what’s surprised you about your career at this point? What’s something you thought might be exaggerated but turned out to be 100% real?

(I’m asking both out of curiosity and for a side project I’m updating. Years ago, I talked with others navigating the in-between—but mostly behind the scenes on LinkedIn. It helped me — and others — not feel so alone in it. Appreciate anything you’re open to sharing.

1k03i71,"Sales - Taking the hit on an inherited account, now I'm on a pip. How do I care less and what should I do next?","The title pretty much sums it up but, in a nutshell, I work as a sales account manager but missed my quarterly target due to inheriting an account needing a significant refund from a sale made by another rep. They got the money and I had to take the hit. 

Now I'm on a pip and I genuinely am knocked for six. I've been told it's a blanket rule and despite hitting 99.5% of my sales target (I'd have been well over 100% without said refund) and hitting 103% of my annual target, I'm at risk of losing my job. It's also impacting any pay rise and the opportunity to progress in the company.

I've been here for almost 7 years, I sell based on honesty and transparency and now I've been bitten in the ass because of another reps inability to do their job properly.

It's a tech multinational (surprise surprise) and I work within the EMEA market. I know I'm bloody good at my job, my clients trust me and if I didn't have a closed book I'd be laughing but alas, here we are.

I have adhd and the sense of unjustness in this situation is SO real but I don't know what to do next, go to HR? Take the hit and work my ass off to try and get off the pip? If the job market weren't so screwed I'd jump ship but it's not smooth sailing out there right now.

I'd also welcome any tips on how to give way fewer fucks because this company sure as hell don't deserve it!

Hit me with your advice, I'm all ears!

1k01bc8,Is it time to move on?,"So I'm new in my career, just coming up on my 2nd year. Over the last 6 months I've made a huge improvement in my abilities and output as I've become more familiar with the industry. I'm an estimator, so my job is to respond to requests for quotes from our customers.

So in the last 6 months I went from sending out 25 quotes per day to now sending out more than 60 per day(for context, im now sending out the same volume of quotes that the former estimator did up until his retirement. And he worked there for 30 years). I have not missed a single day(sick day, vacation day, or otherwise) in the two years I've been there. Worked overtime 3 Saturdays a month and everytime else I've been asked to to keep up with the workload.

2 weeks ago, I met with my boss and asked for a 12% raise (my last raise was July of last year). He said he agreed with my improvement and assured me that if I waited a month, he would get it approved by the president of the company. 

Today he finally got back to me and didn't even mention the previous agreement, just simply told me I would be getting only a 6% raise. It really bothers me how he assured me if I was patient, he would get me the full 12% only to be told I'm only going to get half of that. I know with the increase in my production, the company is profiting well more than what I'm asking for and base off of what I've seen myself, I'm pretty confident I could get more with the experience I've gained somewhere else. I'm trying to show loyalty to the company that gave me a shot when I had ZERO experience, but now I feel like they're taking advantage of the situation to underpay me. Is it time to start shopping around my resume?

I tried to make 1:1 call with everyone on the team, but I have to be honest, I am depressed so the connection wasn't the best compares to when I first joined this role. I just listen to what they do and say something along the line of dont mind if I message you if I dont understand anything.

I also had tried to ask to shadow - but what I am shadowing on? I dont even know? like I dont know what I dont know... the meeting talk about so many abbreviation. and when I ask to shadow a process - they told me they'd have to ask the manager for permission to share that with me.. so I feel like I am being blocked from learning.

I also talked to my manager about how I am trying to understand the process on my own and she told me "" dont worry it took me a year to understand it, so I figure it going to take you awhile to get everything""... hmm like no I dont want to wait for a year to understand it.

I am super efficient and I do my job very well. I love the customers and I wish I could do more for them but there’s not much training to guide me and my boss chooses when/when not to be in the office. The only time I get trained is when the agent or their manager are available. I appreciate their effort but it’s little, compared to the workload given to me. I do both sales, services and customer care. We’re only 2 in the office, the manager and myself. It’s overwhelming because the training is flawed. Too much work is not the issue for me, it’s the training that’s overwhelming. If at least they want me to do everything train me properly to do everything. 

My agent can’t train at all and he’s very disrespectful in the process. My manager is better at training but has little to no time. It’s all round draining. 

I face new challenges everyday that need supervision and guidance. If I’m not able to complete a task it’s because I don’t have the right training to and I hate that for the customers because only two people can assist them with their accounts. I refuse to have my name tied to a task that can mess up a customer’s account. It is unfair to the customers.

I just got myself an interview with PNC Bank as a business center manager assistant. Does anyone have any tips for me to guide me through the interview process, will the training be at least better with them?

I have been working with my current company for about three years, I work in the accounts receivable sector of a company. I live in California… which means it’s expensive obviously. I am currently getting paid 25$. I have asked for raises in the past and have always been denied, I did receive a 0.75 raise in January due to yearly reviews. Obviously with inflation occurring, the real wage actually went down. I looked up on Salary.com and it says for my area… the average wage for my position is 30$. That’s what I want to ask for, but a 5$ increase is a “big” jump, and given my track record of being denied when I discuss this… is it worth it? I have a BA in Economics and currently in an MBA program. I have been told by the Director of Finance himself (who is the person I would be speaking to) specifically that I am the only one in my department that knows how to handle all the tasks. A recent coworker departed from the company and when they tried filling his position, two people (on separate occasions, but the same week) accepted the role only to not show up. 

I tried giving as best detail as possible. But I want to know what yall think.

1jzyjsy,26M Feeling stuck — Startup → Family Biz → MBA → Corporate — Need advic,"Hey Reddit,

I’m at a crossroads in life and would love input from folks who’ve been in similar shoes.

**Quick background:**

* **26, Male**
* **Education:** DU (Eco Hons), 8.4 GPA | Class 12: 97%
* **Work Exp:** 2.5 years at a startup as **Senior Revenue Manager (Ecomm)**
* Launched my own brand in **commodities & healthy snacking** — did **₹1Cr revenue** in a year, but had to shut it down due to operational issues and difficulty building a solid team.

Now I’m figuring out the next step. Here are my options:

# 1. Join the family business (Commodities trading)

* Decent turnover, stable
* But very *“Lala-style”* — traditional, lacks innovation
* Doesn’t excite me mentally or creatively

# 2. MBA abroad

* Always wanted a global MBA + international work exposure for 6–8 years
* Great for network, growth, and pivoting
* But risky and expensive, especially with current global job market uncertainty
* Leaving family biz might close that door forever

# 3. Rejoin the workforce

* Been self-employed for 2 years — returning to structured work may be tough
* Likely need an MBA soon to grow fast or explore new paths
* Unsure how ex-founders without big brands are perceived in hiring

I don’t want to take a “safe” route and regret not aiming higher — but also don’t want to ignore practical realities.

**Would love to hear from:**

* MBA grads (especially those who went abroad)
* Folks in family businesses who modernized or pivoted
* Startup folks who exited and moved to corporate or started over

Appreciate any thoughts, stories, or advice — feeling stuck but hopeful I’ll figure it out. Thanks in advance!",NoobKnowsItAll,2,1.0,0,1744740021,2025-04-15 18:00:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jzyjsy/26m_feeling_stuck_startup_family_biz_mba/,4,2025

Also I am an immigrant here and this job market is crazy, so I dont have lots of options. In order for me to stay in UK in 2026, I will need a Visa Sponsorship or Global Talent Visa. I have a tech background. 

September last year, I attended this event about people that were looking for jobs. During networking time, I meet this person named (let’s call it James). He was the director of a particular department in the company he works for. We shared our work experiences and then I started a new job at another company. 

After six months James messages me on LinkedIn and tells me that the company who works for got an investment and now they’re looking to hire and he presented me with a marketing role. OK then I left my job as it wasn’t something related to what I studied.

They suggested I set my own Limited company, and to work as a contractor for them. So now I have them as a client. My day rate is £150. At my previous job i was getting £26.8k/year. when we were negotiating the salary they offered me something similar but I told them that the role that I was doing at my previous job and the role that I will be doing it’s not the same same also the cost of living and everything here in London and they offered me £150 a day. Yes and I know that you don’t have any benefits if you don’t work you don’t get paid. 

When they first offered me this daily rate I was thinking of that’s too much for some reason but keep in mind that I am an immigrant here I graduated did an unpaid internship and then I worked in beauty and retail so it’s not like I have the luxury to have asked them for more being based to my experience. 

so now that I work for them basically I work closely with James I do tasks like: social media management, content creation which includes brochures really high-quality ones because we do be to be a marketing, Zohore CRM event planning because we do events once a month I do I work with the teams in other countries as well. Now that’s totally fine but my problem is said James he also has his company and has the company will work for as a client so James also works as a contactor. 

James knows my situation about visa sponsorship. And since he has his own company and his wife also have a beauty salon sometimes not only I work for the company that I have as a client but I also him sometimes give me some tasks about his wife beauty salon OK it’s not much but you get you get sense what I mean right. Also for a company he’s planning to do this educational course a he wants to sell this course. At first when he presented this idea he said that I would want you to work only a few hours on the weekend and of course I will pay you for that. And sometimes he keeps mentioning the part of the course that we have to do but he hasn’t mentioned anything about how he’s gonna pay me or anything like that. 

I have lots of tasks to do that’s required time and dedication and that requires the tools and it feels like I don’t have enough time to finish the tasks let alone to work for his own company. this is still like a startup company and I know what I sign up for and overall everyone in the team treats me very well and they don’t give me stress I would say but I just feel anxious and I stressed myself regarding my situation and even though it might feel like I’m being used for the moment I have no other option and I have only two months working for them. 

The company I am working for is a really innovative and unique in the UK so just the experience would give me so many opportunities in the future but for the moment it feels like I’m doing the job of five people which I believe it resonates with you. 

i’m just worried about the situation of doing this course for him and I wonder if he’s gonna pay me for that or no he is very kind but at the same time he sometimes says oh just please look up all the documents that you need for the visa sponsorship and I will help you that and someone and I know that he has lots of connections and I appreciate that but sometimes I feel like all those good words are being sad just for me to do some more tasks so I don’t wanna be in a situation where I get you know used even though you might say you’re already being used but hopefully you’ll understand and give me any advice or if you have any similar Experiences. 

Also sometimes I even work longer hours, he keeps texting me about work even after 5PM or 6 PM and it stresses me a lot sometimes because I feel like I can’t keep my mind off work. 

I just need some advice on how to set some boundaries and how to manage stress because I work from home most of the time and it feels like I can’t do anything else I can’t I don’t have time to eat or to have a social life because I’m really occupied with work at the same time I love my job and I love what I’m doing But I don’t wanna be like I’m not appreciating it you know.

1jzwrws,Career advice after graduation,"I'm a bit confused about my career and not sure what path to take

Hi, I’m a 22-year-old student with a B.Com degree from India, Assam , but my CGPA is low. Since graduation, I’ve developed a strong interest in design. Right now, I’m learning different types of design and software, including:

- UX/UI  
- 3D design  
- 2D design  

I’ve been thinking seriously about my career because I don’t have time to waste—my dad is going to retire soon.

Now I’m stuck between two paths:  
Should I pursue a career in design, or should I stick to preparing for government competitive exams?

I don’t really like the usual advice like, “Give it time and things will work out.” I need something practical and realistic.

Is a career in design actually practical in Indiia
And if it is, should I go for online platforms like Coursera, or should I look for proper universities or design institutes?

1jzwnox,Am I crazy to leave my WFH job? I don’t dream of labor ✨,"I have been working in college admissions since I graduated from college myself in 2021. I worked at one school in person and commuted an hour each way every work day. Found a new school where I got to WFH permanently and got a 20k raise, no brainer! I also live in an area that is rural where there is not a whole lot of job opportunity. I’ve been here for 1.5 years and it has started to loose its luster. 

Here are the reasons why I want to leave: red flags

- college admissions is like sales without commission. The KPI matters stress me out. And when I miss my goal, it’s usually for reasons that I cannot control, like a student has to withdraw because they simply can’t afford it, etc
- the school is for profit, 100% acceptance rate (red flag) aka degree mill
- recently there has been word that a department I work closely with is going to be completely phased out and the school will hire a 3rd party and lay off like 6-8 people. Some think this is just a scare tactic but even if it is… what’s worse, just pure greed or using scare tactics on your staff?
- finally, I just don’t believe in the product that I am “selling”. College admissions has made me realize that for some, you don’t need a degree to do what you love. College often sells the idea that “if you do what you love, you don’t work a day in your life.” But the reality is if you want to break the mold and do what you love for a job, you are going to have to work 10 times harder. And not many are committed to their passion that much.

I’m looking at jobs that are in person , about 45 minutes away, specifically a role as a front desk receptionist at a dental office. It pays $3-$4 less an hour, and I would have to commute 35-40 minutes each way, but I would have Fridays off and I like the idea of being able to separate my work and home life again. As much as I love being at home with my dog and getting to put on laundry, cook while I’m working. I feel that the pressure is of doing chores around my house often takes away from my work also resulting in low productivity. But all I do is look around and see everything that needs to be done in my home when at my job it feels like I’m not accomplishing anything, only numbers.

NGL i will miss my coworkers and WFH, but I think I’m ready to make a change. Sure, work will still be work. But at least I won’t be stressed about making numbers anymore.

I’m a 4th-year B.Pharm student and I’m currently exploring different career paths in clinical research. I’ve been looking into roles like Clinical Research Associate (CRA), Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC), Clinical Data Manager (CDM), and Regulatory Affairs Specialist (RA), and I’m hoping to get some advice from people who are already working in these fields.

Here’s what I’m wondering:

* **CRA**: How much travel is involved? I know this job requires a lot of site monitoring, but do you get to work from home at all? How’s the work-life balance with all the travel?
* **CRC**: I’m curious about patient interaction and the kind of workload at clinical sites. How stressful is it? Is there room for growth?
* **CDM**: I like the idea of handling data and making sure everything is accurate. Is this role more stable with better work-life balance? How’s the career progression in this field?
* **RA Specialist**: I’m intrigued by regulatory affairs and the compliance side of things. How does the role compare in terms of growth and job satisfaction? Does it offer good stability?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on the pros and cons of each career, and what kind of qualifications or certifications helped you get your foot in the door.

1jzuozb,Should I Quit My 9-to-5 Office Job or Relocate to a Smaller Town for 2 Years? Need Advice,"Hi everyone,
I’m 25 years old and grappling with a difficult decision. I’ve been working in a 9-to-5 office job, and I’ve recently been assigned to move to a smaller, isolated town for a mandatory two-year period. I haven’t relocated yet, and I’m really torn between quitting or going through with it. My family is urging me to go, but I’m worried about what this means for my life. I’d appreciate any thoughts or advice.
I live in a small town in a third-world country, and the idea of moving to an even smaller place feels like it would make things much harder. The job pays better than most other office roles, which is why I’ve stayed despite not liking it. Honestly, it feels like it’s stifling my potential, and the thought of being stuck in this kind of work forever is terrifying. I’ve always wanted to start my own business and have the freedom to live life on my own terms, but right now, I feel trapped by the need for financial stability.
I’m single with no major responsibilities, but I only have enough savings to cover a couple of months. My life so far has been dominated by studying and working, and I feel like I haven’t really had the chance to enjoy being young. That fear of missing out on more time is making this choice even tougher. I don’t want to regret staying in a job I dislike or moving to a town I’d rather avoid, but quitting feels like a big leap without a clear plan.

1jztyok,How much of salary increase to strive for in searching for a new job?,"I currently work for a non-profit arts organization in fundraising and special events.  I have been quite happy here, although I feel I am overworked due to severe understaffing in my department.  My manager recently retired and told me (incorrectly) that I would be getting a raise and a promotion (not to her position but a bump up from my current position) to compensate for having to take over a lot of her duties while they searched for a replacement.  It didn't happen, leaving me feeling resentful.   The new person started and while I like her a lot, I feel that my efforts were not recognized or rewarded by senior management.  Additionally, the new person is really only doing fundraising, not events, which my former manager did, leaving all of the event management in my lap.  I have begun to casually look for another position.  My question is, what amount of a salary increase and title bump would make it worth uprooting myself from a job I am comfortable in?  I am currently a ""Manager"" making $65K.  I would have expected to at least have been promoted to ""Senior Manager"" if not ""Associate Director"" with a $5K to $10K raise.  Since that is obviouslhy not happening, I am looking at other positions with those titles.  I wonder if a $10K salary bump is enough (for a much worse commute), or should I be looking only at jobs $20K above my current salary.  I recently applied for something in the $100K range, which might be a stretch.  I saw another job that looked good but it is only in the $75K range and is much farther from my home.

1jztatx,Seeking guidance on role conflict at time and material client engagement,"I am currently working in a Time & Material (T&M) engagement with a client (middleast client), where my timesheet is signed monthly by the client, and I charge based on that code. I am at a manager role. Another colleague at the same level manages the project financials. I have been with the client and the firm (multi national consulting firm) for 10 years. Over time, our footprint with the client has shrunk; we had nearly 100 people on the account. Many projects we initiated under managed services have since been internalized by the client.

Currently, we have a T&M contract where we provide solution architects and application architects due to our historical involvement with the client's applications. My role is a solution architect, and previously, I worked as an application architect on two of the client's systems under managed services.

I am under pressure to adopt more responsibilities to improve the account's profitability. I have no issue with this, as I have experience working on proposals and responding to RFPs (in a stealth capacity). However, my client supervisor, who is a micro manager, often requires my presence and he used to monitor what I am doing on computer and in which call I am.

Now, that colleague (may be promoted to SM before me), is pressuring me to act as delivery lead for another project with the same client team. I drafted the proposal for this RFP, and the client is about to assign us this project. My colleague argues that I am no longer profitable in my current role and that our MD has informed him to offboard me. He suggests I take on the DL responsibilities along with my current duties as a solution architect.

I resisted, explaining that my current role requires significant attention to defect calls and design discussions with stakeholders, making it challenging to manage delivery of another project simultaneously. I asked if the client would be okay with my participation as DL in the other engagement? While I am willing to do more, I see a clear conflict here. As it is under the same director to whom I am reporting as SA. 

Do you think I should take on this additional responsibility if the client agrees? What are my options? I am unsure what my colleague will communicate to the partners about our conversation. I need advice.",Brief_Reaction8322,1,1.0,0,1744727366,2025-04-15 14:29:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jztatx/seeking_guidance_on_role_conflict_at_time_and/,4,2025

I’ve been interviewing at other companies but I’m very unhappy with the state of my industry right now and don’t want to continue working in this field. My current work environment is miserable and while I like my supervisors, I dislike working with my other coworkers as their misery rubs off on me.

I’ve given a lot of thought about making a career pivot and going back to school for an M.S. in Marriage and Family Therapy or an M.S. in Social Work. I want to work with people and having a meaningful impact in their lives. I actually was able to interview at an outpatient mental health clinic and I really liked the position and the environment on paper. They offered me a job however I’d be taking an extreme paycut and the benefits are more expensive than what I have now. 

I’d go from making $76K in a HCOL area to $22/hr at 38 hours a week. My partner is supportive of this move but we don’t currently live together. I actually live with my sister and currently pay a majority of the rent while she gets her Masters. This is an amazing opportunity to get direct, hands on experience in the field I want to go back to school for, however this job would cover my bills and nothing but my bills. I have a good amount of savings that I can stretch but that thought terrifies me until my sister graduates and is able to land a comparable job to mine in terms of salary. Advice please as I’m paralyzed about what to do. :( 

If money was no object I would 100% take this job. If it helps it’s also closer than my current position - my commute would be 15 minutes as opposed to an hour.

1jzs7qk,Should I leave a chill $79K Army internship for actual cybersecurity experience with no support?,"Hey everyone, I’m 23 and currently in a cybersecurity intern program with the Army, making $79K. Graduated with IT degree last year and Ive been working here for around 9 months now. On paper, it sounds great—solid pay, job security, and super chill environment.

I have a lot of downtime, which I’ve been thinking about using to study for the CISSP(Associate of ISC2). However, I’m not getting any real hands-on or technical experience, and it’s starting to stress me out long-term. I’ve asked my supervisor countless times for work but it’s never panned out.

Recently, another intern in a different department (same program) told me he’s drowning in actual cyber work—compliance tasks, controls, real-world stuff. He said he might be able to help me transfer over to support him, which would give me the experience I know I need. But there are downsides: no training, no support, high stress, and possibly a pay cut (from $79K to $65K, not confirmed). Also, I’ve built good relationships with my current team, and I feel a bit guilty considering a move—especially after my supervisor mentioned long-term plans for me.

I’m torn between staying put and using the comfort and time to chase certifications, or throwing myself into a high-stress role with no guidance but actual experience.

1jzrxar,Feel like I am at a crossroads,"I feel like I’m going to have a breakdown and need to vent somewhere.
I’ve been at my administrative job since 2016. Generally, it’s a pretty chill job, and I like it. I’m good at what I do. Recently, my boss announced she’s retiring, and suddenly they’re trying to train me to take on parts of her job. Specifically, payroll has been a major challenge for me. I have absolutely no experience with it. It only occurs every two weeks, and there’s no way for me to practice in between. I completely messed it up this time around—made several mistakes—and I feel like a failure.
I can’t handle this. Technically, it isn’t supposed to be part of my job. Due to the responsibilities I already have, regulations say I shouldn’t be handling payroll as well. There are no checks and balances if I’m doing everything. I don’t know if I can manage the new responsibilities they’re trying to give me.
I’m upset that I only have a short time frame to learn all of this. My boss has always been the type to just do things herself rather than teach me how, and now I feel like I’m being thrown into the deep end of the pool.
Currently, I work in government. The pay isn’t great, but the benefits are excellent and, until now, the job has been low stress. I had a phone interview with a private sector company last week. I’m not sure if it will go anywhere, but it pays more and offers a hybrid work schedule.
I’m so conflicted and upset. I liked my chill job. I don’t know if I should keep pushing through and try to stay, or keep looking for something new. I don’t know if I should move into the private sector or stay in government. I feel like I’m failing.

However, on my first job, I can already avail the full benefits of the company, including paid sick and vacation leaves, on the very first day.

My first job trusted me enough even though I was an inexperienced fresh grad with nothing to offer. My first company took the risk and invested in me, without the full assurance that I would stay for a long time.

So, as an experienced hire with already a lot of skills and can surely contribute to the company, to be offered only 5 days paid leave (this is both sick and vacation leave) availed after 1 year of service, feels like an insult.

Stress is normal in a job, I already expected that. But my current company has spoiled me so much that they always reminded me I'm human, I have needs, and I don't need to be a slave in order to sustain those. This company has set my standards in what I should look for, in case I want to leave.

This is my last week on PIP and my manager also made me sign a PIP document. He told me that next Monday we will determine if you pass pip or failed. He also mention he could potentially extend my PIP for 2 more weeks after talking to CTO this week.

2. Should I try to ask my manager on Friday to see if they extended my PIP and take action based on that? Even though my manager said he might extend pip for 2 more weeks, but I don't know if I can trust him.

I work in IT as a data analyst, and I only really took the job since it was the safest way to secure a role post-graduation (also truly nobody is hiring right now, especially for entry level positions). 

Initially, I had a really hard time adapting from academic life to corporate life. I didn’t get the social nuances and corporate structure made 0 sense to me. Now that I am about half a year in, I feel less incompetent, but INCREDIBLY unfulfilled. Some days I can’t even bring myself to do the work that is assigned to me. Which ultimately is fine because my job is so non critical, most people don’t even care if I do it or not (I finish my assignments, don’t fret) 

I think I suffer from two things a) a lack of intrinsic motivation (whether it be from undiagnosed mental illness or otherwise) and b) my boss does not really assign me meaningful work. I’m still being assigned tasks that don’t meaningfully contribute to any project/goal/etc, and if my boss can’t identify that kind of “opportunity” for me, I am asked to take more initiative to find tasks myself.

1jzqc3o,Leverage another company offer,"Hi everyone,  
I’m in the middle of a job switch and I’d love your advice on something that just came up.

A few weeks ago, I had an interview with Company A. When the recruiter asked about salary expectations, I said 40–45k EUR. They came back with an offer of 42.5k, which I negotiated up to 45k — and I was happy with that.

Now, this morning, another company I’d been interviewing with (Company B) got back to me with an offer of 47k. It's not a huge difference, but it’s making me wonder:  
Would you go back to Company A and let them know about this new offer, to see if there’s room to adjust theirs?

I’m still leaning towards Company A because of the role and the people, but the extra salary from Company B is tempting — and I don’t want to leave money on the table if Company A might still be flexible.

1jzpx4t,"I'm about to tell off my boss, any advice?","I have a low-wage job for a retail store. I have to clock in at 4 am to unload the trailer, we get about five trailers a week. After unload, I have to stock shelves, which isn't as hard as unloading the trailer but requires me to get on my knees or climb ladders.

My management has been cracking down on protocol recently, most people are minimally compliant. Crackdowns are on attendance and earbud usage.

One manager in particular, I cannot stand. She's fat as hell and waddles around the store all day, not doing anything but sipping cream-laden lattes and barking orders into her walkie talkie. She gave herself a raise this year. I got a raise too, I got 10 cents because a while back I decided to stop being their ""super star"". I can at least respect my other managers because they actually work, and many of them won't say shit to me about wearing my earbud. 

Yesterday, we had an interaction

Her, in a condescending tone: ""hey we don't do earbuds anymore. Can you take it out. This is the third time we've had to tell you and I'm getting tired of it.""

Me, taking it out: ""yeah I'm getting tired of it too.""

Her: well this is the third time

Me: and then what happens

Her: you get put on a corrective action

At this point, I'm not even looking at her, I'm looking away. I have serious mental health issues from being molested as a kid. I want to yell at her but I just shut down and look away instead. She waddles off. I'm not compromising on the earbud. They haven't enforced this policy for a long time, and frankly, if I'm gonna be in a pit if mental misery and reliving my molestation, I'd like to at least pick the fucking soundtrack. 

I'm posting here because I just want advice. Tomorrow, I plan to tell her ""look, I don't respect you and I don't like taking orders from you so you need to either fire me or leave me alone because I'm not doing this back and forth corrective action shit."" I don't expect them to fire me, they can hardly keep the place open and not many people want to work my shift. I'd go to my real parent for advice, but he's the one who molested me so that's not gonna happen.",Worried-Leather-5009,0,0.15000000596046448,41,1744717984,2025-04-15 11:53:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jzpx4t/im_about_to_tell_off_my_boss_any_advice/,4,2025
1jzph9r,Should I resign?,"I just got a great job offer from a new company but I’m unsure if I should take it. 

Pros of the new job:

- 10k more than I’m making now 
- Seven min from from house plus telework 2x a week after a period of time 
- My new boss seems very nice 

Cons:

- My new boss already told me I have several  difficult people to work with
- Starts at 7:30am and my childcare center doesn’t open until 8 AM. My mom said she would help me get my child to daycare on time but I think that’s a lot to ask somebody to do five days a week.
- I HATE starting new jobs. Like 1000% in my bones to my core hate it. It always create a regular deal of stress and anxiety in me for months.

My current job has an extremely flexible schedule – I can pretty much telework as much as I want (I usually do 2-3 days a week) and make it work for my schedule. I love my coworkers – I have an absolutely awesome team. My immediate supervisor can be a challenge sometimes but overall he’s not too bad. The cons are it 45 minutes to an hour away from my house and last year, my boss told me I had maxed out on salary and could not advance any further. But the biggest pro is that I am extremely comfortable here after being here for 6 1/2 years. And for somebody who has a lot of anxiety, that and a healthy work environment are immeasurable. 

What should I do? I’m really, really torn.

1jzpcho,Would you move to a smaller product company for a significant salary bump involving a different tech stack?,"Hey all, I’m currently a Principal Architect at a large consulting firm, working primarily in the digital experience space. My focus has been on content management, digital asset management, personalization, and related areas. I’m in a strong position at my current company, and I’m up for a promotion in about 2 months that could bump my base salary from 180k CAD to around 200k CAD.

I was recently approached by a much smaller product company, one with fewer than 500 employees. They’ve been in the digital experience space for quite some time but are not widely recognized and haven’t had much growth or market movement in recent years. They’ve offered me a very similar role to what I do today, but with a substantial base salary increase to around 245k CAD.

Now I’m weighing the tradeoffs. On one hand, the new role pays significantly more but is a completely new tech stack. On the other hand, the company is relatively stagnant and lacks the industry visibility for their products (I work on a stack that is widely regarded the best while the new company’s product don’t feature in the top 10) and brand recognition. I’m trying to decide whether it’s worth leaving a stable and globally respected organization for the chance to earn more at a company with more risk and uncertainty. They’ve had a few rounds of quiet layoffs in the last 3-4 years and what seems like a general dip in momentum. I’m also unable to gauge how things are going as of today.

1jzkvms,I [18 F] am feeling like no one at my job likes me,"I [18 F] am feeling like no one at my job likes me. I work two jobs, both at fast food places. At one of my jobs, everyone likes me, talks to me, asks me about my life, is interested in me, etc. 
At my other fast food job, I feel as though I am alone. I try to talk to everyone and I feel like I'm a pretty nice person, but it just seems like no one enjoys my presence. I've talked about my interests to some of them (specifically comicons and cosplay) and they seem to make weird faces. 
I try to be the nicest person possible. I ask how everyone is doing, I ask questions about their lives and everything. They don't seem interested in what's going on with me.
Another thing is my coworker, I'll call her Bea, told me that one of the managers, I'll call him Steve, lets her eat  food all the time. This got brought up because I'm training a new guy and I was telling him you can't eat in front of the general manager or Steve. Bea heard this and said, ""No, you can eat in front of Steve. He only gets onto you if he doesn't like you. He sees me eat all the time and never says anything."" This made me feel awful because he's gotten onto me multiple times for eating my own food I've brought from home. Bea was talking about the fast food we serve, and he's been at me for eating that too. Does he really not like me??
I also try to jump into group conversations and my coworkers seem to scatter as soon as I have something to contribute. I'm not mad about any of this, it just makes me really upset, to the point where I cry a lot about it. My boyfriend has been helping me get through this, but I need advice on how to handle this situation. Is something wrong with me? Am I the problem? Or am I being paranoid/overdramatic?

2. I don't like talking to clients much. I always was introverted but thought it was because of lack of exposure but now I know it's because I don't like it at all.

1jzik4y,Did I screw up?,"So lately everything at work has been on fire and I've been in the middle of it - not as a senior, nor a team lead, not even with any authority. Just a bottom of the totem pole junior software engineer (with the experience of a senior) handling topics that are clearly not meant for one person to take on alone (and may even be well above my pay-grade). 

Anyway, for context, I'm pretty well known on my team for being a jack of all trades, and usually I am always stuck with the tasks no one else wants to handle. Usually I find enjoyment in these tasks because I find ways to improve on the project in some way or another as well as learn new skills. It also gets me recognized both positively and negatively. People come to me with their problems, and it's nice to have that change in my daily routine, but sometimes it can also be very annoying especially at inconvenient times. And well, unfortunately, as of lately this situation has started to really put me at a real disadvantage. 

Recently our company has been reducing headcount, and as a result I've noticed all of the things my previous colleagues were working on has begun getting piled on top of me. And now I'm to a point where my people-pleasing fear-of-failure dumb-ass has allowed myself to be sucked into literal Hell trying to juggle two of the biggest problems which I believe are make or break for the success of our project.

Everything was fine the months prior as I was balancing all of these topics without too much pressure. Though lately since these two really big ones got dropped on my lap I am not so sure anymore if all of my hard work has really paid off or if I'm just sitting on a sinking ship sticking my fingers in different holes trying to stop the inevitable from happening. 

It's like I'm watching a train slowly derail and everyone onboard just being in total denial of the fact. 

These facts have been apparent to me for a very long time (more than a year), and many others have told me I should have left a long time ago (I've been on this project since the beginning - more than 5 years with the company), but for some reason I've become attached to the feeling of being needed, and the work still interests me. Another part of me is also morbidly curious to see what happens when it all comes crashing down. But as I'm seeing now, it's a painful process to get there. Those that stick around, like me, will just get fed to the machine until the very last minute until someone up top pulls the plug. 

And well, this is where I'm at now. One topic I'm stuck with will help us build more widgets. The other topic I've been saddled with will help us sell the widgets we currently have. Both topics are equally as important. And both should have had a lot more oversight. 

Unfortunately, no oversight, nor much accountability has ever been had for these two topics. Those that worked on them before me left a mess, and my team lead told me not to worry about fixing them to a point of perfection, but instead just keep them maintained. Which I've always assumed this meant maintenance work, but as I inherited these messes my curious mind wandered and I began to peek under the hood and realized both of these topics if left in their current state could potentially unleash an even greater mess than what I was tasked with to begin with. 

I tried escalating these concerns to my team lead. I told them between these two topics it was much to much for one person, let alone a software engineer to handle alone. And yet they stayed optimistic and told me they ""trusted"" I had everything under control. 

When I told them repeatedly these two topics are stressful and one could directly cause the other to fail if I'm pulled to firefight the other, they again remained optimistic that I could handle whatever would or could happen. Though each time I shared these concerns I became increasingly more adamant that they needed to escalate the situation. Which a few times they tried to quell my concerns and stated they would escalate to upper management and see what kind of support could be offered. 

Of course nothing changed. And for months I drudged on trying to support both topics. Traveling even to support the one while staying up late in my hotel to support the other. It honestly felt like either no one knew the severity of these two topics and that one person was holding everything together, or they just wanted to see where my breaking point was and how quickly they could burn me out.

Nevertheless, a breaking point finally came when I had to pull the brakes on the one topic that would help us to sell the widgets we currently have. Something screwy was going on. Someone was doing some shady work and I caught it and management put a stop to it. But what do you think their response was? You're right. They told me to handle it. They said do whatever you need to do to fix these widgets, but also be sure you maintain your other topic, plus your other workload. 

This floored me. At that point I realized I was only digging my hole deeper, but there was nothing else I could do but sink or swim.

And that's when the other topic's floodgate broke loose too, drowning me in a sea of despair!

Almost a year since the other topic (helping us to build more widgets) began the people assigned to it never really seemed to have a clue as to what they were doing. When it was assigned to me this was quite apparent. And as I mentioned, no matter how much I shared with my direct manager and my team lead the pain I felt working on this topic they told others I had everything under control and they kept pushing me and pushing optimistic results to anyone above me. 

Well I finally reached the point with this too, as I like I said it was a full year of pointing out these problems and being told it'd be escalated to no avail. And well, surprise, surprise. The means for producing new widgets had blown up in our face. I warned everyone. Even gave a fix and ideas on how to improve it. My team lead ignored me, my direct manager ignored me, and no one ever thought to add additional oversight nor support on this most important topic Why? Maybe because everyone thought I'd just roll over and fix it? Or maybe they're in denial? Who knows for sure. 

But now the team lead and one of the managers that both had such optimism that I'd fix everything and were both strong proponents in peddling bullshit to upper management have been asked to go fix this issue with our production by going to the country the manufacturer is in and fixing it with me on call remotely. 

At first I was chosen to go fix the problems, but after realizing that I had pointed these problems out a year ago I decided it was best to put my foot down and refuse as my team lead and managers did not have my back in escalating these issues before they got this bad. Really I felt no remorse in saying ""no"", and actually I'm relieved that those in charge would be held accountable for this mismanagement and sent in my place to fix these production issues. However, now I'm beginning to think I made a huge mistake career-wise and that my Team Lead and this manager are now going to be gunning for me to get removed from the project or let go from company. 

Should I have any cause for concern here? Or am I just overthinking. I think I could have went and fixed these issues and earned a reputation, but at the same time I realize this is a case of gross mismanagement and I shouldn't cover up the cracks anymore.I'm just worried that I waited too long for this, and my mental health really took a dive from it too, and as a result I may not have sounded the most professional when I pushed back on these topics. They want me to assist these guys remotely when they travel to go fix the problems, which I agreed to but the way my team lead asked me to prepare a handover of my work prior to the trip makes it sound like this is it for me.

A colleague from another team told me I'm not a manager and that I should have never been concerned with these issues I found to begin with and that I should have left it up to management, but I disagree with that mentality because the issues were already dropped on my lap by this point. I didn't go looking for them. I saw some of them as an outside observer and pointed them out, but I didn't harp on anyone until it became my problem directly. 

Also, needlessly to say now. I am no longer working like a workaholic. These two topics have killed my spirit and I'm just waiting for the aftermath of both to see if I even survive. 

TL;DR:
Junior dev with senior-level skills stuck holding the entire dumpster fire together after layoffs. Got handed two massive, critical projects no one else wanted, both a total mess. Raised concerns for over a year, got ignored, told “you got this” while everything crumbled. Both projects blew up like I predicted. Management still expected me to fix it all. I finally said no. Now worried I’m on the chopping block for not being a team player.

1jzhwne,Looking for advice on different career fields- what should I look for?,"Hi everyone. I'm in my senior year of my undergrad degree in International Business. I've been doing some thinking about my future lately, and I'm trying to figure out the exact sort of jobs that fit what I want to do. Of course, I am not absolutely rigid in exactly what I do, but I'd appreciate any advice based on what I like doing!

As a preface, once I graduate, I will be pursuing an MBA in Japan (in English) and then attending a two-year Japanese language school program. That is where I plan to end my formal education.

I recently completed my senior thesis, and I loved it. I had to write about Tesla entering a S.E. Asian country to set up a factory, and I was assigned Singapore. My 120-page report covered: 1)analysis of the industry in Singapore and the region 2) strategies for establishing operations and cross-cultural management/communication 3)strategies for marketing to consumers of the region, taking into account specific tastes and cultural values 4)Pro-forma finance data for 5 years, including income statements, NPV, sensitivity analysis, as well as strategies for mitigating foreign exchange risks.

I didn't struggle with any part of the paper, but I know my finance knowledge is not as strong as those who have majored in Finance. It's also not really what I'm passionate about. What I did find my passion for was understanding different cultural dynamics and working with them to devise management strategies, as well as using an understanding of cultural values and market research data to develop marketing and promotional strategies for different markets. 

  
That's what I want to do in my future job, but I don't know what to look for. I don't mind having some quantitative finance duties, but I don't just want to analyze numbers all day, every day. I want to be involved with the other aspects as well, particularly the cross-cultural aspect if possible. 

  
What are jobs like this called? I really don't know what to look for. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",Easy-Bed-1471,2,1.0,1,1744687229,2025-04-15 03:20:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jzhwne/looking_for_advice_on_different_career_fields/,4,2025

1jzh6sm,First proper job starting soon and I’m beyond nervous about it,"I’ve lived at home for most of my life. The college I went to is only like a block away from me. But I finally got a full time job that is out in DC, and it means I have to move. I am so fucking nervous about it and constantly getting in my head. I am basically shifting my entire life to go to this job (in the career I think I want). I don’t really know how to handle it, or even how to find friends when I’m in DC. Now I need to go out and buy a proper car, set up a place to live, etc. It feels overwhelming… I’m really just writing this as an outlet, I’ve just been thinking about this constantly when I’m not distracting myself.

I’ll only be ~6 hours from my home, and I have family in and around DC. I’m just scared for how I’m gonna meet new people and find friends. I love to cook, but only because I can do it for my family, cooking for myself feels like a massive chore.. but I really don’t want to stop either.

Plus I have a cat and I’ll be traveling a lot for this job.. so I also need to worry about getting a roommate (also because rent costs).

1jzgeeu,Best way to ask for a pay match?,"My previous employer payed me 38 an hour and i got hired with this new company at 32. When HR called me with this offer I accepted and didn't even try to negotiate...I regret that. 
The pay range for my position is 32 to 48 an hour.

Tomorrow I plan to speak with HR and ask if they will be able to match my previous pay or atleast meet me in the middle. 

I'm not sure exactly how to express what I want in a way that increases my chances of them saying yes. 

Oh also they initially sent me an offer via email stating 41 an hour then they called me after to discuss. When they told me the offer is 32 I said that the email they sent me originally said 41 and they replied saying that was a mistake. 

Field of work is industrial maintenance

1jzgaz8,Renegotiating and unsure on how much to ask for. How much should I aim for realistically?,"Long story short I am currently working as an executive assistant to a VP of sales of a small insurance agency based in the North east. I am mexican and currently employed by an agency that sells my services to the insurance agency.

My boss absolutely loves my work and says im the best she's ever had, now I've been with her for 6 months and I decided to ask her if she would be interested in hiring me directly as im thinking of leaving the offshore agency regardless due to the compensation, she said yes.

Now we are at the point where this week we will have an actual conversation to talk numbers and Im wondering how much should I ask for. Obviously it cannot be too much because then it would make no sense to offshore the position if it doesnt save her money.

I was thinking of asking for 35k usd a year, no benefits, no pto, no workers comps, as all that would be taken care of with that amount on my end in Mexico. I feel like that is very competitive as trying to find someone in the US with my 7 years experience, bachelors in commerce, perfect bilingual, would run her in the 50-60ks per year and that number doesn't even include the whole payout including 401k match, workers comp, medical, etc, plus she already knows how I work and Ive become crucial for her.

What do you think, is that realistic?

1jzfxmr,"After speaking with 20+ hiring managers and team leaders, my insights on the job market","Five years ago, you could prepare your resume after graduation and still land a good job. But now, even with two FAANG interns and countless projects, you might still find yourself jobless five months after graduating. many companies are now avoiding visa sponsorship unless absolutely necessary. Even candidates with top-tier BG face automatic rejection when sponsorship is required. As an AI startup co-founder, after speaking with many hiring managers from large companies to startups, and combining that with my observations from current hiring situations, here are some insights I’ve gathered:  
  
Roles like Financial Analyst, Equity Research Analyst, M&A Analyst, Investment Banking Analyst are increasingly hard to get into, not only due to fewer openings but also increased competition from candidates with full-time experience. Even if you’re from a target school or have strong referrals, it doesn’t always work.  
  
Entry-level roles like Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Data Scientist are saturated. Many companies have paused hiring altogether or expect 2+ years of experience even for entry-level postings. Startups often deprioritize hiring junior analysts because they prefer someone who can do a bit of everything: strategy, data, marketing, even product. Meanwhile, large companies are slow-moving or on hiring freezes. If you're aiming for a data-related role, try pivoting to hybrid roles like marketing analyst, growth analyst, or strategy associate. These blend business insight and data but offer clearer business impact, something hiring managers care about more than raw SQL/Python ability.

1jzfoii,Commute 50min to and from work,"Just posting this out here to get people’s genuine lived experiences on long commutes.

And by this I don’t mean people who only do one or two days a week work I’m talking people who do the standard 35-40 hour week five days a week.

i’ve recently moved and had to take a job That’s 50 minutes away from where I live. this is in comparison to a 20 to 30 minute commute previously which was okay. For both these comments I have had to drive as there has been no public transport.Currently the 50 minute commute seems quite daunting as you can’t read a book or do life admin like you can on a train. The payoff is I get to live in a nice coastal town as opposed to a busy city .

Has anyone experienced a similar timeframe of commute and would like to share their lived experiences for how long it took them to get used to it (if you did) or if you believe that is too much?

1jzflhe,I am stuck,I am turning 30 soon and I feel so stuck. I have adhd so was an overachiever through school without really trying which has spilled over into my adult life and now i’m a massive underachiever. I have no degree. I’m a single parent of 2. I have NO career whatsoever. The longest I’ve stayed in a job is 2 years and that was over 10 years ago. I bounce from job to job doing short term contracts via agencies which require me to do the bare minimum whilst earning a decent enough wage. My highest salary is £49k paid weekly. Every year around this time i am unemployed due to budget cuts and take any random job to get by until a better opportunity comes. Most of my work has been administrative and project support. I am very good at it and always get compliments from my managers and senior management and/or end up doing most of their work for them because I am more skilled than they are which i don’t mind at all because the work itself bores me to death and i don’t want commit to it fully because it’s not challenging at all anyway. I used to have my own business doing hair but i had to stop because of an illness and safety reasons but the novelty wore off anyway so I didn’t fight to keep my business going but i know if i did i’d be quite established by now as I was taking at least 4 clients per week. I have about 25 jobs on my CV and its 8 pages long. Through the pandemic i was over-employed and at one point i had 5 jobs at once. But now I’m getting older and my kids are growing up i’m deeply ashamed of my work history and none of this is sustainable. I can’t land a good permanent job because my work history is so sketchy and i see lots of jobs i know i could do but i don’t have any valuable experience. I really want to build a career or start a business i can be proud of that’s fulfilling and challenging for me and requires me to actually work hard but i have no idea where to start. Ive looked into things like digital products and saas but i feel like they are all promoted by people who really are just making money selling courses to people like me. I have an interview this week for another dead end contract at a council that will lead absolutely nowhere and I am just dreading doing this all over again. What can i do? Does anyone have a genuine career i can start from scratch or use my current skills for and bury myself into that will keep me challenged and pay me a decent salary.

1jzff8z,I’m thinking of leaving my job but I don’t know if I’m overreacting. Any advice is greatly appreciated :),"
Hey, so I’m a pre k teacher and I just started at this school around 6-7 months ago. 


——they show severe favoritism to some kids in front of the other kids. 

——they used AI for their progress reports, (the class sizes are real small, my class only has 8 kids and 3 teachers, so idk I just thought that was crazy)

———-they show severe double standards:
           - I’ve gotten redirected by the manager to put away my phone as other teachers are actively on theirs in front of the manager
          -I got sent home for being 15 minutes late when I first started even though the whole week I was having car trouble bc I had just gotten a car, and it was my first time behind the wheel in over a year.* Meanwhike there is a teacher from a different classroom that will come into my classroom and chit chat/gossip about the kids, current events, etc. with one of my co-teachers maybe six seven times a day, everyday. And there’s no repercussions. 





——They’ve guilt tripped some of the kids for latching onto a new person in front (!!) of the kid, even calling them a traitor (?!?!) like hello the kid is three they’ll find a new preferred/fav teacher in like 2 weeks. 

——they’ve spelt out bitch, calling a kid that in earshot or directly in front of some of the kids, when a kid might be giving attitude or something. Sometimes in a joking manner but other times when the teacher is genuinely annoyed. But why do that in front of the kids, especially when they can repeat that to their parents. I’m surprised they haven’t already. 

——They’ve lied when giving tours: about what they give for snack, and how many times they go outside. (For reference, they mainly buy cookies, cheeseballs and stuff from the dollar tree, sometimes animal crackers from Trader Joe’s and pretzels, but they’ve told prospective families that they serve fruit and grain every snack time 🌚) 

——In one instance, a kid was being mean to another kid at snack time and when Teacher A redirected him, he threw his napkin at her. So teacher A said okay you’re not getting snack. (I would have just gave a warning and separated the kid if the behavior continued) but you can’t do that right?? Like the kid wasn’t complaining that he was hungry or anything, he was more upset that he got redirected in the first place, but still. Then the manager just happened to walk in, Teacher A told the manger what happened and the manger backed up the Teacher A, so I didn’t say anything, and the kid forgot about it like 10 mins later, but I still felt so weird and bad for the kid like I was enabling something but idk what. Was I???






- There are so many things ineffective with the classroom environment and just structure/flow of how things go, that make transitions and stuff so much harder than they need to be, and then bc of the repeated the friction, some children almost have learned helplessness. And then they get in trouble when they don’t do something or want to do something.

For example
-we have these grand windows in my classroom almost floor length. And none of my kids ever sleep at naptime, maybe one or two on a full moon, but usually not. I’ve brought up closing the curtains so it’s dark so they’ll have an easier time sleeping, come to find out the manager doesn’t want the blinds closed. For what reason I don’t fucking know and they actually have Velcro ties or something on the blinds/curtain rings so you can’t close it….
Then complain that none of the kids ever sleep, and they don’t play calming music or anything or white noise, I’ve done it a couple times, but I take my break in naptime so I have to turn it off when I leave bc of my phone.

- there’s so many containers for the toys that don’t fit all the toys. And then clean up time takes 3 years.

- they don’t give the kids limited options in free play so the whole room will be ransacked bc some kids just overturn toy buckets and then hop over to another toy and cleaning after yourself is not consistently reinforced in regards to toys. So as a result, clean up time takes forever everyone there’s free play. 

- project time sometimes is ridiculous bc the focus is, I hate to sound like stickler but it’s product based rather than process based, so they stress over getting a nice picture to send to the parents of what activities were doing, sometimes yelling at the kids to smile, and I cringe so hard at that. I know they mean well bc the boss wants them to do that, so they kinda have to follow what the boss says but idk. I’ve never been for all the extra bs that some centers do, I think you can be laidback while meeting your kids where they’re at in thier development and doing what works best for them and the whole classroom ecosystem, so this always gets on my nerves. I have so many cool ideas that I know they’ll love, like sensory stuff or classroom origination or behavior management (like a visual timer, blackout curtains, in ear thermometer, for example) and somethings I’ve suggested have kinda stuck, like replacing a broken toy container or having the main table face a different way so al the kids can fit, but there’s only so many times that I can bring up something without it seeming like I’m pushing it/being pushy, you know?

-sometimes I get to do circle time, but that’s if the other co teacher doesn’t feel up to it. 🤷🏾‍♀️

I do what I can, like I bought bubbles and chalk for the afternoon, bc we needed it, then the manager bought some the next day, it felt weird like it was an indirect way of saying, you could’ve just asked. And then another teacher asked, do you really need that for the afternoon (for reference, this teacher leaves at 2pm, the other afternoon teacher and I leave at 5:30) 

I’ve begun dreading coming to work. The kids and the other afternoon teacher make it tolerable, but there’s so much unnecessary tension and double standards and unnecessary inconveniences, it’s like they have nothing better to do and they jump on any opportunity that’s even a little “drama”. I feel like I’m just babysitting, and I try not to overextend myself, by buying stuff for the classroom or making DIY projects for the afternoon, but if I don’t I feel like I’m just sitting there doing nothing, watching the kids ransack the place. And it’s a 60/40 chance Ill be backed up if try to put out like 3 or 4 options for them, when the place is already ransacked. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve bought some used books and and take them in for the kids to read to them as like a special treat, and to break up my day. 🤷🏾‍♀️

*Im a 21F and financially on my own and living in my own, since age 19 bc of worsening and ongoing domestic violence from my parents. I moved from FL to MA alone, and didn’t have a car that whole time up until when I started this job. I didn’t realize how big of a learning curve it would be driving in New England vs FL, especially taking the backroads for a 47 min commute, and no experience driving on the highway. So the week I got my car, was my second week at the job. Monday, I got two flat tires, and a ticket (and they helped me get it towed and the tires fixed, then deducted the price from my first couple paychecks, that’s why I was so taken aback when they sent me home, I thought they understood my situation) Tuesday, my WiFi disconnected while driving to work so my GPS wouldn’t re-route, when I got off the highway bc of the donut I had in place of my tire. Resulting in me being 35-45 minutes late. (Bad I know) and Wednesday I was just running 5 mins late, but traffic and missing one major turn added like 9 minutes, so I was around 15 minutes late. And I got sent home as soon as I walked in, didn’t even make it to the classroom.
 
Granted, the whole week before I was either 5 mins early or on time exactly bc of Uber. And I put in work, blood sweat and tears when I’m there!! But I understand you have to be on time. 

I keep ending up in job environments I don’t like  prob bc I’m always leaving the last place out of  desperation, so I’ll end up taking anything. And here I am again. There’s things they didn’t tell me, or maybe I should have known already, like my paychecks are averaged to cover the couple of weeks we have off during the school year, but I didn’t know that until I got my check and was short like $200 🥲🥲🥲🥲 and for reference I rely on this income bc it pays all my bills, it’s how I support myself and I dont have family or close enough friends to rely on.  I’m currently in school, for my CDA and also my BA in Elementary Ed in the Fall (all online until student teaching practicums) 


But yeah lemme know what you think, any advice is appreciated!  Sorry it’s so long. ",ReaderBeware_ur_in_4,1,1.0,7,1744679591,2025-04-15 01:13:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jzff8z/im_thinking_of_leaving_my_job_but_i_dont_know_if/,4,2025

Hello all, I'm writing today to ask how do you become a doctor? I have always wanted to become a doctor and help our medical system but seems like an impossible task. I just have a high school diploma and I'm currently living in Canada. 

Im 27 and currently working full time as an engineer at a government job with good pension and time off. I want to pursue medical field and would like for anybody to just help set a right career path. Any advice is welcome. Thanks guys!",ritiksharma2424,5,0.7799999713897705,9,1744676035,2025-04-15 00:13:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jze73p/how_do_you_become_a_doctor_when_youre_old/,4,2025
1jze6ph,Where do I go from here? Laid off and feeling lost,"
I was laid off last year due to budget cuts. Without being too specific, I worked in healthcare in a position I created, and it was awesome, but we got a new director after working there for a decade and she didn’t feel my position was valuable.

This position and job was amazing for several reasons. First, I created it and ran it and was solely the person doing it, so I had a lot of freedom and creativity in my role. Second, it helped people on a daily basis, my main goal in living my life. Third, it paid well enough that I could live comfortably. Not rich but I had good savings. Fourth, it had medical benefits. And lastly, i have several chronic illnesses and have had a ton of surgery and it worked around that.

Then I got laid off.

I live in Canada and am collecting employment insurance. I get paid more through that than if I was to work again right now. Jobs that are out there that I could do I’m just not eligible for.

I am thinking going back to school is the only way to get out of this. I am just not sure how to go about it healthwise, cost wise, and travel wise.

Right now I have two masters degrees in fine arts and one of them related to healthcare. I have a lot of experience working with oncology and MS. I want to stay in a healthcare field and helping people. 

Some other things:

- I can’t move but can commute within reason
- I can’t do things that would require 12 hour shifts or anything like that as I would definitely have a relapse
- I couldn’t be a PSW or nurse because I am not good with vomit. It was the one thing in my past job that I had a lot of issues with. 
- I don’t want to be self employed or solely self employed — I need insurance. I was self employed before that job for years and I’m over that. It’s a lot of work. That said I would do side work self employed. 
- hoopp would be desirable but it’s fine if it’s not
- I am a casual professor at a university but that doesn’t pay the bills… it’s just every other year when the course I teach is offered. 

I looked into social work as I would love to be a social worker. There are two programs in Ontario that don’t require a BSW but one was so many prerequisite courses I couldn’t fulfill and the other requires so many hours of related experience that I don’t think my previous job would count. But it might. I am looking into that. 

I would love to be a PA as well, but I don’t think I could hack it health wise and the vomit thing would be hard. 

Other than that, any suggestions on how to move on? 

I do not want to get a trade despite it being good pay and short schooling. I want to stay in healthcare, do something feasible, and simply help others.

I know this is long and I can provide more info but I don’t want to be overly wordy.

Thank you if you read this far! I am being vague on a few things to stay anonymous.

I really appreciate your time.

1jzdkix,Feeling stuck and unfulfilled,"I have a BA in Psychology, and a dual MBA in human resources and strategic management. I currently work in health insurance doing authorizations, which is only a high school diploma level job. I am extremely good at my job and meet my numbers every month. It's really stupid if you connect meet your numbers and complete 100% of the audits. My audits are always 100%. My supervisor even says that it is surprising that I consistently meet my numbers and always have 100% audits (I will assume my coworkers do not). 

I need a new job. I have been doing this since May of 2022. I cannot look at another request for medical Services. I'm totally checked out.

I'm not getting a raise, even though I do my work. 

So I need help in getting a new job.

1jzd5j5,Manager Threatened Me With a PIP (non-profit),"I work in the non-profit space doing legislative/environmental policy work. I’ve worked in my current role for a year and a half now and today during my check in, my manager bombarded me telling me I’d failed to complete the latest IT training (phishing, MFA, all that) and that this was another example of how I’d failed to get things done on time. I took complete accountability for missing the IT training, but also mentioned that for the past few months now she’s expounded that our legislative work takes priority over other ad hoc things (goal setting, reviews, other random one off admin things). All my policy work, relationships, and mission critical stuff I stay on top of! To that she said that she feels as though this is a time management issue on my part and not a workload issue and when asked for an example she quickly jumped to a time a couple weeks ago where I printed materials (bill fact sheets, legislator profiles) later than I ‘should have’ despite the fact the team we were working with finalized these things the same day I printed them (I QUICKLY got together my receipts to prove that 100% and sent over asking her to confirm receipt and review) to which I told her “I hear you, but I feel that’s a subjective take” considering we only meet about once a week (switching off between deputy director and director). We see each other in office when I go in, as well.

She practically demanded I come in the office three times a week at a designated time for us to run through my days with her — I pushed back on accord of my signed job description stating my position is remote and I already typically come in twice a week. She then threatened me with a PIP, saying she should be putting one in but is trying not to. 

My performance review in Feb was 99% positive (constructive point was to better prioritize work and needs with our chapters—the same work I was prioritizing that made me forget to do the IT training). 

Thankfully I’m in a union and I spoke with my rep who said she’s entirely out of line and probably projecting her own stress towards me. Because let me tell you—just last week she came to me while I was in office, the same day this IT training was due and asked me to take on more work because she was dropping balls left and right. The plan she asked me to create was finished the same day.

Overall, this was a very weird situation and seems to me as though it is a projection of the stress she’s facing, but to minimize the work I’m doing (that’s lauded by other teams throughout our organization) is a slap in the face and also not give me any room to express my thoughts and telling me I can’t take feedback is borderline insane to me. So my question is:

Do I file the grievance? ",PowerfulInevitable97,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1744673062,2025-04-14 23:24:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jzd5j5/manager_threatened_me_with_a_pip_nonprofit/,4,2025

1jzctjb,"23 M Indian: I'm in desperate need of guidance, help a brother out!!","I'm a cybersecurity guy from India with just over 2 years of experience now, and have a good reputation with the client and within the management( both india and uk ) but I feel like I'm not doing anything productive to be fulfilled. The job doesn't bring joy to me anymore.

Hence, I had decided for a career switch to DataScience, AI or ML, where I'll be able to create stuff, analyze stuff and take out insights to make better decisions.

That being the reason, I'm deep into the process of applying to universities from Germany ( have already done so for 4 of them )

A week ago, I was introduced to a fully online course from upgrad partnered with IIIT Banglore and Liverpool University, wherein I can complete this in 19 months or so parallel to my work, that way my salary won't stop as well and I'll have a degree from 2 uni's and a lesser loan burden on my head (5 lakhs). It was mentioned they'll be giving placement assistance as well.

Sometimes I lean towards the online course and most of the time towards actually going to Germany, struggling there, give my all to be the best in those subjects while trying to look for part time jobs to support me during my studies. The loan burden on me in this scenario will be ~ (20 lakhs)

Germany is a lot uncertain to me, one won't know what'll actually happen when I get there. It is all unpredictable.

Is it going to be worth it going to a country, giving it my all or should I just juggle between the online course and my job until the course is over and I can switch.

Given my mom is a govt employee and I don't want anyone to feel the burden of the loan i would've taken, there'll be a lot of pressure on me to actually deliver - ofcourse the pressure won't be from my family but it'd be me trying to push myself.


I request you, if you've read this far to give me any kind of guidance to help me decide on one thing here, I feel a lot confused now.

To add to this confusion, I was given a 25% hike on my CTC .

I'm currently looking for a one-year online program that could help boost my career. I hold two bachelor's degrees in Web Marketing and E-trade from France.

Due to my wife's job, we have to relocate quite often pretty much every year. (She's Japanese, I'm French.) However, we're planning to settle in Japan for a longer period in about two years.

Because of our frequent moves, it's been difficult for me to build a stable career. I'm now thinking that pursuing an online program could be a great step toward establishing myself professionally.

I've been considering a program in HR or recruitment. I speak four languages fluently, so I feel like I could really thrive in a role that values communication and multicultural experience.

Does anyone have recommendations for a good diploma or online training program in this field? Preferably something that can be done fully remotely in about a year.

I’ve been working in retail for 9 years (since I was a teen), and I think part of the reason I’ve stayed so long is because it’s the only thing I feel capable of. I get really anxious when it comes to anything career-related, and the constant rejections during job hunting just make it worse.

1jzcjzl,eCommerce career growth,"**Hey everyone**,

Recently, I was presented with an opportunity that could significantly impact my future development in the eCommerce field.

I’ve been working in Shopify eCommerce for over two years as a **Shopify Developer**. On one of my projects, which also happens to be the biggest one I’ve worked on, I was offered the chance to become the manager of the entire project. This role involves developing the project further, planning its future, and also taking responsibility for the technical side of things.

I’ve been working on this project for quite a while, have done a lot of work on it, and know every technical detail inside and out. Eventually, the opportunity came up to lead its growth and guide the entire team’s efforts. The team includes an SEO Specialist, a Data Entry Specialist, and a Google Ads Manager.

I agreed to take on the role and so far, things have been going well and I’m genuinely enjoying the process.

That said, I now find myself wondering: who am I professionally at this point? Before, I had a clear understanding of my role in the job market and the services I could offer. But with this new management experience, I’m not exactly sure how to position myself moving forward, mostly because there are so many types of management roles within eCommerce.

**Just to clarify:** I fully understand that I don’t yet have enough experience to aim for high-level project management roles. My question is more future-oriented. I want to understand what I should be working towards.

I also really like the fact that I have a strong technical understanding of development — especially in Shopify ecosystem and I’d like to continue using that skill set. I’m good at organizing workflows, structuring tasks, and planning ahead. I’m quite responsible and methodical by nature. I know how to break down large, complex goals into clear steps. Because of this, I’ve always felt I had the potential for a role like this.

**So here are my main questions:**

1. What kinds of roles can I aim for in eCommerce (with focus on Shopify) management that leverage both technical knowledge particularly in Shopify and leadership skills?
2. How I can go deeper and develop my skills in eCommerce management? Any courses can help or there are only real world experience applicable?
3. And more broadly: how relevant is technical expertise in the world of eCommerce management today?",Professional_Mud_726,1,1.0,0,1744671436,2025-04-14 22:57:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jzcjzl/ecommerce_career_growth/,4,2025
1jzc1q7,"Weird setup/experience at work, what to do?","Hi! I'm not quite sure if I'm posting in the right place but I just wanted to share my weird experience with my current job. So I've recently started with this new company a few weeks ago, and it's not quite what I expected. I technically work in HR, the company works with clients and we provide HR support. I was hired for a role and initially I was quite happy with it despite having a bit of doubts with some parts of the offer and the company. It's a legit one, don't worry, just that I have minimal knowledge and don't know anyone who has worked there before but I read some reviews online and it seemed okay. 

Now since I started with them, I've run into a couple of issues already. Before my first day, my recruiter called me and said that the account I was supposed to be in was already at capacity and that they'll move me into another account, I said sure cause I know there's still going to be a training anyway. My very first day, I was expecting ofc to be onboarded but discovered that I'll basically do that my own. They issued me a company laptop and basically had to fend for myself to set it up with the minimal details I have from a previous email sent to me. Then the POC they gave me told me I was supposed to be under another POC and was added to her by mistake and was given the contact details of my now team manager. Once I had set up my pc, I had to watch these videos, basically LMS, for the timekeeping tools and whatnot. I did that then basically waited at the office for other instructions until my manager called me for a quick meeting sesh as she (and the rest of the team) was working from home. My manager is nice, thank goodness, but I learned that she's also new. The next day and the weeks following, I was asked to report from home as well. My recruiter told me that I'll be working in a hybrid setup, full onsite for the training, but suddenly I'm in a full blown wfh setup.

I was expecting to have training sessions of course but it's been weeks of nothing and I don't have any access yet for the client we're working with, no account email set up, no access to tools and other resources. I've had  maybe two meetings about some introductory details regarding the client we're working with, some process and a couple of side by side with tenured support but I'm not really doing anything. I always have to ask what I'm supposed to do for the day which again, is basically nothing. If it were any other person they'd be happy to not have to do anything and still get paid but I'm a very anxious person with regards to work and I'm really getting stressed with all the issues I've encountered. Can I contact HR about this? I wanna ask if there's a possibility for me to transfer to another account or something but don't know how to go about it. Can't really leave bc I have a cash bond if I resign under probation period.

Five years ago, you could prepare your resume after graduation and still land a good job. But now, even with two FAANG interns and countless projects under your belt, you might still find yourself jobless five months after graduating.After speaking with many hiring managers from large, mid-sized, and small companies, and combining that with my observations from startups' current hiring situations, here are some insights I’ve gathered, particularly for entry-level business and data roles:

1. **Finance-related roles are especially challenging for land** — positions like financial analyst, equity research analyst, M&A analyst, and investment banking roles are becoming increasingly difficult across the board.
2. **Entry-level data roles are almost saturated.** Jobs like data scientist, data analyst, and business analyst are facing hiring freezes at many large and mid-sized companies, and even at smaller ones. While thriving startups are still hiring, these roles aren't always a priority for them, to be honest. Right now, companies are more open to growth roles. If you can blend market insights with data and turn it into practical strategies, that’s probably the smartest move for entry-level candidates.

My current boss Val is very concerned and upset by a conversation he had with my former boss Greg. They have the same role in different states and don’t know each other well. They met today at a regional event. According to my current boss, Greg bee lined for him and went on a diatribe about how I was a bad employee and without saying it, a failure. Now I’m in the uncomfortable position of explaining why my former boss said some negative things about me. 

The truth is wild. Greg was/is jealous. That’s the only conclusion I can draw. Greg was overlooked for a promotion at the exact same time I was handpicked for one. Different roles obviously. That's when he did a total personality 180. 

When he was my boss I brought my entire department’s metrics up in every catagory and maintained them for the duration of my employment. My boss's, boss's, boss hand selected me for a flagship property which was struggling - where I’ve been for the last month. 

Greg started being a dick when I got promoted and started micromanaging like crazy. During my 30 day notice he sent me an email that said, “My expectations for your next 30 days,” and within the email it said, “I expect you to complete these tasks by \[date\].” The funny thing is, if he had any clue how that department ran he’d know that I literally did or oversaw every single item on his stupid checklist every single day….. *That was literally my job.* 

He then informed MY TEAM to give all the deliverables for the month, TO ONLY ME. That happened during my second to last week of work. He took ALL their work - ALL OF IT - and gave it to just me. They ultimately answer to him so they had to comply but... wow. 

On my last week he moved me to, what is essentially the mailroom. Think Elf - dark, dingy, drunks. I had literally never worked in the mailroom once. He decided that was the day he needed to personally collect the mail for the department (something he has a fucking assistant for). He came to MY window. 

After I left, a lot of good people left because they didn't want to work with Greg. Numbers there are in free fall (I can see this) and mine are shooting up in the short amount of time I've been here. 

So much more happened, I could go on and on and on about he how he literally snapped. We got along perfectly fine until my last 30 days. I keep saying, the best decision my company ever made was overlooking him for a promotion. That man doesn't need anymore power. 

That said, my boss doesn't know any of this, but is very concerned with Greg's comments, and is providing me the chance to give my perspective/feedback. I have no clue what to say. Should I write a big statement about everything that went down in my last 30 days? Should I CC my former boss?

1jzam24,Failed career. Please help,"TL:DR; I have been fired, piped or laid off from every job. I am 39 now ( late bloomer) I don’t know if I can continue anymore.

2010- got a btech in non-cs degree from a top university. Then got into an analytics consulting firm, then got piped within six months. So I left for Masters

2013- Graduated with a meager 3.5 gpa and luckily got in Amazon as an analyst. Got piped after first year. Successfully passed pip and then continued another year. TC : 75K

2015- The got into another big tech as a data scientist , where I was the top tech guy in the team. Got fired because of insubordination and criticising leadership. Too much ego. TC - 115K

2017- Luckily got into another FAANG as a product data scientist. But got piped again for lacking in communication. This time I said fuck it and didn’t even try. TC - 145 K

2018- So I left for a non tech company. The non tech company was highly toxic and political, got fired for taking too much time off after a year. Uff. TC - 125K

2020- Joined a tech unicorn startup in the valley. First year was okay. Second year got piped. Why? Only one  out of five stakeholders complained about me and my manger didn’t like me. I was sad cuz I worked really hard but the results were unexpected. TC -320 K

2022- Left the start up, went to another unicorn in the valley. Got laid off as interest rate went up. Side note- Got married and divorced within six months. How much more can I ask for? TC - 380 K (paper money 180K)

2023- joined a public tech company as a staff data scientist. But got fired due to performance after a year. 
Now I am jobless and loveless. TC : 380K

It seems like tech career is not going to work out. My parents are worried about me. I feel like I have failed in life so bad. It kills me everyday.

I am considering a career change at this point because even if I get an offer it’s inevitable that something will crop up.

1jza4we,New Graduate in Finance Having Troubles Finding Full-Time,"Hi everyone, I’m a 21-year-old recent graduate from a mid-to-target business school with a 3.2 GPA and have passed CFA Level 1. My background includes investment experience through a student-managed fund, along with full-time summer roles in customer service and as a Tax Advisor at Intuit.

I’ve been fortunate to land interviews with a few banks for entry-level finance roles, and while the feedback has consistently been that I “interviewed well,” I keep hearing that my experience doesn’t stack up, mainly because my investment background stems from a student-run fund rather than formal work experience.

After going through this a few times, I’m starting to get discouraged. I’m curious — how can I better position my student fund experience so it’s taken more seriously? Or what can I do to bridge the gap when I don’t have traditional co-op or internship experience in finance?

So just a basic introduction. I'm a 28 years old Pakistani guy. I have completed my BSCS (Bachelors of Science in Computer Science) around 6 years ago in 2019. I have been working professionally in the niche of digital marketing starting my career in Online Reputation Management. I then joined a company's SEO department and then was offered the opportunity to work in PPC department. I am currently working as a PPC Manager. I'm technically proficient in digital marketing ranging from automation to tracking to tool integrations. I plan to move towards Martech as it's a growing field and I've the relevant qualification, expertise and experience for it. 

I do plan on going for masters to abroad. However as I've mentioned that I graduated 6 years ago I suppose I'd have to complete a master within Pakistan to have an active degree as the gap between Bachelors completion and current year is 6 years. I'm looking at options like MS Business Analytics, MBA (Marketing) and MS Management Sciences (Majors in Marketing). Which option should I go for? Do note that I'm already at managerial level and earning quite good. My personal preference is to do MS Management Sciences from Pakistan and then go abroad for MS Business Analytics. However I'm open to suggestions. Would love your help on this.

1jz8zk5,25 years old. Feel boxed in at my current job. Need advice from someone more seasoned than myself.,"Hey everyone. Guess I should start with the story so far.

Worked some sales related roles in college, knocked on doors getting leads for a lawn care company, sold mattresses at fundraisers, did a brief internship with a life insurance agency. I got a degree in communications in college because quite frankly I had no idea what I wanted to do, cool, I’m sure a lot of you can relate. 

Got out of college, got a sales role selling copiers outside sales, did pretty good at it. Was on track to make around 80k OTE. But I wanted to get the hell out of my college town and take some time away before I started a career, because I had pretty much been working nonstop since I was 15. I really wasn’t ready for the full time commitment of outside B2B sales.

Moved off to Wyoming and was a hippie in the woods for a bit and that’s a whole other story. Got some of that urge to travel/do something different out of my system. Moved back home. And got the job I’ve currently been in for a year and a half. Making good money right now around 80k. But it’s a mostly operations based role in a company with an extremely hostile and negative upper management and I’m really not learning any skills I feel I need to get into the types of companies that are worth staying at. I do some sales, but it’s about 85% operations 15% sales when numbers are down or business is really slow and I’ve got the time to do it. 

I say all of this to come back to the point that I am quitting in about a month. I’m moving to a new city where my long term girlfriend currently lives and has a job that she loves making excellent money and she’s supportive as fuck.  I’ve got 20k in the bank. All my bills are paid up for the next six months (car/student loans). So I’ve got a safety net and I am very seriously looking for another job. Preferably sales but for the life of me I feel absolutely overwhelmed in finding a new position. I’ve gotten very far into the process of several new entry positions at large companies just to get shot down and I partially think it’s due to the fact that I’m 25 and I’m applying for jobs that are mostly targeted towards guys fresh out of college. I had one interview where the guy basically was like “so I see you’re working a middle management sales and operations role at this multi billion dollar company what the hell are you doing applying for a BDR role?” And yes? I get it but damn it feels like there’s nothing else open to me. Everything else out there is either a BDR role among 55k OTE or an account manager position that requires 10 years of experience in a SaaS environment and I’m just looking around and wondering where the hell I can even get my foot in at. I want to go somewhere where I can really grind my ass off and make something of myself but goddamn it seems like I’ve boxed myself in with my current career path. And quite frankly I’m scared to death of not being able to find another job. Because come May 21st I’m quitting my position and moving job or no job because it logistically makes no sense for me to move otherwise. 

My backup plan is if I don’t have a job when I move is to put on a some nice slack and a shirt and walk into car dealerships until I can find someone hiring, but that’s not my first option.

Anyway. Sorry if I rambled there towards the end but I’m very stressed out about this and would love some advice from someone more seasoned than myself.",bannedandback10milli,1,1.0,0,1744662170,2025-04-14 20:22:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jz8zk5/25_years_old_feel_boxed_in_at_my_current_job_need/,4,2025
1jz8d6x,I keep getting fired because of my terrible personality,"I honestly need some advice because I genuinely want to grow and change and this is really taking a toll on me. Just got fired for the third time within 12 months where at all jobs, I was an extremely high performer. I’m talking like picked everything up within a few weeks and immediately started exceeding my quotas. 

My first job, I got fired after one of my best days ever because my manager didn’t think our personalities aligned.

My second job, I kind of expected to get fired because my direct manager didn’t seem to like me from the start, and unfortunately I am an extremely defensive person so people don’t tend to grow into liking me. Fired at the end of probation.

And my third job, one I finally felt safe at because I was doing EXTREMELY well. My manager was one of those people that likes to chat with all their employees a lot and such but he and I never really grew into that type of relationship. I didn’t really care though because I was working really hard. Last Friday, he did something to mess up something I was working on, and I got into it with him, and I got really upset. Fired first thing today.

I am trying to be as self aware as possible and take responsibility for my wrong doings. I have a very defensive, focused, and generally unlikable aura. Like I would never be the personality hire. I also struggle with maintaining my calm when someone wrongs me, which happens a lot at work places. I just don’t know where to go from here.

1jz7ytl,2 interviews last week - still no call back,"Last week (Tuesday) I had an interview at a doctor's office for their receptionist position. It went well and they even told me they were looking for someone with experience working with insurance for their billing team if I was interested in that role. 

I said that either role would be great, and the interviewer seemed excited to get me on board. She scheduled me to go in for a working interview the next day (Wednesday). 

The working interview was essentially just me observing a front desk employee for two hours. We got along well and I really liked the office and their system they use. When I left the working interview, I was told the person who interviewed me originally was out of office but would contact me the next day (Thursday). I didn't hear anything so I called to follow up on Friday afternoon. She had already left for the day. So I called again today (Monday) to follow up and was told ""she will call you if they decide to move forward"". 

So now I'm left here in limbo... I really liked the office and it seemed like it would be a great fit for me, plus they reiterated in both interviews that they are understaffed and looking for people to work.

1jz7o0y,Is my manger micromanaging or over controlling? Or am I overreacting?,"I just started a new job recently and I already feel so disheartened by the way my line manager (who’s also my mentor) treats me. I’m the youngest person in the company, and instead of helping me settle in, he’s made me feel small and like I’m constantly doing something wrong.

Some examples:
He gets weirdly strict about time, even though I’m putting in my full hours. I come in from 7:30 to 4:30 (which HR told me is completely fine), but he still made a passive-aggressive comment that “it’s not the policy” even though it clearly is but  he said I have to come from 7-4 or 8-5. I told him it’s the same amount of time and HR said it’s fine!! But he wants to have an attitude.

I was late from lunch by 10 minutes ONCE and he acted like I committed a crime, even though I made up the time during lunch and I come a half hour early to work. Other people do worse, but apparently I’m the exception. When I got back from lunch he was yapping away for 15 minutes doing no work but oh I’m the problem, My friend in the other department takes a half hour longer lunch break and his manager says nothing! It pisses me off.

He once told me during a break that from what he observed of me, I “haven’t been through much” and that I “probably just sit at home and let my mom take care of everything.” Like—what? Who says that to someone they barely know?? I’ve never even spoken about my personal life to him (because he doesn’t make me feel comfortable). And then he says things like “I’m not trying to insult you” with a chuckle after saying something weirdly personal or condescending. Mind you that was on my first day!!
	
I honestly feel like I’m being nitpicked and disrespected constantly. I was really excited to start this job, but now I feel anxious every day. I even turned down another interview offer because I didn’t want to seem flaky, and now I’m wondering if I made the wrong choice. I get scared to even talk to him because I’m worried he’ll say something I don’t want to hear. But he’s so nice to everyone else nobody would believe me if I told them. Which makes me worry that I’m overreacting or that’s just how management is? It’s my first job so I would like some insight and guidance.

* What would my approximate hours look like for both the summer and school year? I’m concerned about maintaining full-time status for income reasons.
* How does paid planning time work?

Additionally, given my qualifications and experience—as well as the uncertainty around available hours—I was hoping we could consider adjusting the hourly rate slightly to $27/hour. I believe this more accurately reflects the value I would bring to the role.

1jz4u1v,How to negotiate a notice period increase?,My employer (start-up) just raised my notice period from 30 to 60 days in lieu with my promotion and salary increase. I’m not even in a managerial position and it’s almost standard in my industry/country to have a 30-day notice period - even managers at large MNCs or banks have 30 days. What are decent points I can raise to potentially negotiate this? It definitely feels like they are trying to lock me down. I’m really stressing out about this.,ManSpoder,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1744652244,2025-04-14 17:37:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jz4u1v/how_to_negotiate_a_notice_period_increase/,4,2025
1jz4kys,Is it a bad idea to change my major from biochem to media and entertainment?,"I am in my second semester of uni right now and before i even started my plan was to be an art major. I wanted to major is sequential arts, but then i had an incident that changed my perspective. I realized in the art world that the degrees can be essentially useless, and that it is hard to be successful and sustain a life in that career. So i switched to a stem major in the hopes of learning to like it and having a guaranteed better paying job after getting my degree.

I am in my second semester now and I feel more miserable than I have ever felt in ny entire life (sounds like an exaggeration and honestly I wish it was). I honestly feel hopeless, defeated, and lost. In hs i was an a students with a 4.0 gpa and good prospects, but now im doing very poorly in my classes, i feel incredie dread just thinking about my future, and I feel like i failed myself and my dreams. 

I love writing, and I love telling stories. It is something I have always loved and wanted to do since I was a kid. I am also very much a media enthusiast and when in hs, i took a class on screenwriting which honestly changed my view of how creative writing jobs actually can be. I loved it, and I have never felt more joy and happiness in a class than I did in that one. 

This pressure and conflict I was feeling ultimately pushed me to change to stem from art, but being miserable just does not feel worth it. I know you can always change your mind and its still early for me. I guess I am just wondering if I would be better of switching into screenwriting and studying something I actually enjoy with the risk of not having stable income in the future, or tough it out in stem and have guaranteed job stability. 

I would appreciate any advice. I have seen this situation work out different for other people. My dad wanted to be a musician, went to school for it, even had connections in the industry, but gave up because it was just impossible to have a stable living from music and became a mechanic instead. My mon went from pharmaceuticals to baking because she loved it, but then baking became more impossible to maintain and had to go back to pharmaceuticals. But i have also seen people I know start businesses from the ground up and grow quickly, becoming quite successful. 

I really don’t want to feel suffocated anymore, but I don’t want a future where I am struggling every day.

For a bit of context, I'm in the UK (16M) and I want to be a train conductor after I complete my A Levels. In order to gain some experience for my application I volunteer at a local heritage railway in a customer facing role (welcomer/platform assistant). 

I've made a CV and when looking online for tips to optimise it there's a recurring theme of quantifying your successes to fit the STAR method as this is more attractive to recruiters. Fair enough. 

However, I'm really struggling to quantify my successes as I don't really feel that my role is that impactful in the grand scheme of things. All I do is check tickets, answer customer questions and sometimes assist with loading and unloading catering from the trains. I can't think of any way that I can put that into numbers. 

Would really appreciate some advice on how I can or other ways that I would be able to make my career history section more attractive to recruiters without quantifying something.

1jz33om,Resume/LinkedIn Entry,"I had just completed 90 days at my first full-time lab position when I sustained an injury that prevented me from coming to work. Because I had not worked at that company for over a year, I did not qualify for FMLA. My job demanded that I come in for light duty, but I refused, knowing could not tolerate these conditions. This intolerance to handling work was documented by my doctor at the time (which went as far as to qualify me for short term disability), but the company still refused to change their position on the matter.   
  
I was in good standing with the company beforehand, but while fighting to keep my job HR asked that I come in on threat of termination. I sent a strongly worded letter to HR, the CEO, and my direct manager detailing my situation. With the company being rather small (no more than 40 employees), I also Bcc'd the rest of the company. Several days later my employment was terminated due to ""excessive absences, refusal to accept accommodations, and violation of the code of conduct"" (my email to the entire company).

Months later, I am trying to begin searching for a job again, and I want to know if it would be worse to have this position on my LinkedIn/resume or have a three to four month gap in my resume.

1jz058e,"Left a high-stress startup for a chill corporate job, now I’m questioning the trade-off","About 2 months ago I quit my last job (3 YOE) after getting a solid offer from a different company. I left because I was getting extremely stressed out and there were constant fires that I just couldn’t keep up with. I could feel myself start to slip and so I wanted to “leave the party while I was still having fun”. I was the only developer at the company for a couple of years, and eventually we added more but it seemed like everything would still fall on me since that was the norm from before. I don’t blame anyone, I think I just didn’t handle delegating my work well enough. My old job was a startup so I think this can be pretty typical with those.

My new job is a corporate gig at a huge company, which I figured would be a great opportunity to grow, and get me out of the frying pan at my last job. Came with a slight pay increase as well so I jumped. I’m much less stressed at this new job although 2 months in, I’m not really enjoying it as much as I thought I would. I can’t help but miss my old job every day, especially the people. The tech stack at the new company is super old and nothing is really built well, at least at my old company we had the tech in a pretty good spot before I left. I feel like this new job has an extremely light workload compared to my old job and I’m not really busy ever anymore. It sounds nice, but I’m still early in my career and don’t want to stagnate. My old job really pushed me to learn new things which was stressful at the time, but looking back it helped me grow a lot.

I left on pretty good terms with my boss, he even wrote me a really good recommendation letter and told me the door is always open. Even with that, I’m hesitant to reach out to see if I could come back. I worry that I will fall back into that stress trap again.

Anyone have a similar experience? Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.


TL;DR:
Left a stressful startup job (only dev for a while) after 3 years for a more stable corporate role with better pay and less stress. Two months in, missing the old job—especially the people and better tech stack. New job feels slow, uninspiring, and not challenging enough for early-career growth. Left on good terms and could return, but worried about falling back into old stress patterns.

1jyzq2m,Should I stay at my job or just take a break from everything,"*24M*  
I’ve been at my current company for over a year and a half. I used to work in IT, but about 6 months ago I switched to the product management team, hoping to try something new.

Truth is I’ve been feeling lost for a while, even before the switch. I don’t feel passionate about anything anymore. I’m just floating, stuck in a comfort zone, not growing, and feeling more and more disconnected from everything around me.

Recently, my teammate (who had more experience) quit, and now my manager wants me to take over. But I don’t feel ready at all. He barely trained me, and now I’d be expected to handle communication with other departments like sales and the data team. The problem is, I really struggle with communication especially cross-team stuff. It drains me.

The CEO is understanding and offered to assign someone part-time to help me, but honestly, I still feel burned out, unmotivated, and unsure if I even want to be in this field.

If I quit, I have enough savings to live for about 2 years.  
Should I try giving this new setup a chance or take time off and figure out what I really want?

**Note**: I know some people might say I’m lucky to have a job at all, especially in this market but it’s hard to explain how emotionally draining it is when you feel completely lost and disconnected.

1jyzc3b,Is it normal for a boss to talk down to you? Or is it just me?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to get some perspective—am I overreacting, or is it not normal for a boss to regularly talk down to their employee?

Some quick background on me: I was a biological researcher for about 7 years, but I got bored and started transitioning into software engineering after getting interested through some bioinformatics work. I ended up getting an MSc in CS, and about a year after graduating, I landed my first SWE job—where I've now been for about 1.5 years.

The company is an AI drug discovery co., and there seemed to be a lot of upside when I joined. My first annual review was positive. But lately, I've noticed a pattern with my boss that feels... off. He often talks down to me, and it's getting harder to ignore.

For instance, I was recently presenting a decent-sized project I’ve been working on, and he interrupted to ask if I even understood what I was doing. In another case, I was leading a major project that went a bit off-track while he away. I had completed \~90% of the work, and just needed to finish setting up some software in lab. His response over Slack was:

“Understanding that Slack doesn’t necessarily convey tone very well… this is pretty disappointing, you guys.”

That hit hard.

He’s always been a bit of a micromanager, but it’s felt more intense lately. In another situation, we were discussing storing some data, and I didn’t fully understand what he meant by ""how we will be referencing the original data."" I asked for clarification, but his tone got sharp and dismissive—basically saying, ""I don’t care how you do it, just do it."" It made me shut down and not want to ask anything further.

More broadly, I’ve felt like I don’t really fit in here. My team can be hard to talk to and often come off as condescending. At first, I thought it was just me being sensitive. But then my wife overheard a call and asked why my boss talks to me like that—which felt validating, but I know she could be biased.

That’s why I’m here. Am I misreading this? Has anyone else experienced something like this?",djlisko01,11,0.7699999809265137,34,1744638575,2025-04-14 13:49:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jyzc3b/is_it_normal_for_a_boss_to_talk_down_to_you_or_is/,4,2025

So I had another interview that went pretty well. During the call, the client told me multiple times how interesting my CV was. Well, thank you. Although the interview was on short notice – just a couple of hours after posting – I managed to find out the company's brand name and some news headlines. I knew a product name that was not mentioned in the posting, which the client specifically pointed out that it made a good impression.

* Tidy candidate page and CV in project portal? Check.
* Experienced in the required skill-sets for this assignment? Check.
* Apply within less than 30 minutes after the offer was put up in the portal? Check.
* (Bonus: authentic application written without AI? Check.)
* Answer the client's messages in my inbox no later than a couple of minutes? Check.
* In time for the meeting and no tomato sauce stains on my shirt? Check.
* Organized and prepared with knowledge about the company and some pre-noted questions? Check.
* Answer technical questions? Check.
* Letting the client know I would like to take on this contract? Check.

And again, a day later, ""we have decided for another candidate"". What gives?

Now, this wouldn't be much of a surprise if it wasn't so often for clients with happy faces in our video calls. Who often point out how great my expertise is. Sometimes they are a bit more reserved, but if a recruiting agency is involed (unlike the last one), they most times give me very positive feedback in a separate call after the interview. I was, for instance, told  ""never witnessed such a harmonic interview before"" or ""you are practically sold to the client, they would just need to hear the remaining candidates pro forma"".

This time, there was no agency shielding me from the client, so I took my chance to ask him directly why ""someone else was a better match"". The first response was ""the other candidate could outline a more precise plan on how he would solve the problem."" Interessting. I will take note for the next one. What followed, though, seemed to me like the real motiviation: the price. The other candidate undercut me with 30 EUR per hour. During the interview, I hinted I was willing to give a discount, yet a negotiation was never requested.

Here is the problem from my angle:

* Apply with my perceived ""I am worth that money"" rate, which is above average: row filtered by price column in a spreadsheet → no chance
* Apply with an average rate: someone else still does it for less → no chance
* Apply with a less than average rate: perceived mismatch between skill and price → no chance

That's a stalemate for me. A skilled worker who wastes time writing applications instead of solving problems (and earning money). The effect: customers will only do ""window shopping"", i.e. ber looking into my CV, talking to me, yet (almost) never buy.

No matter how hard I try to find an answer if and why I suck as a freelancer, the only recurring hint is about the price. At the same time, though, everyone aknowledges that my regular (non-discounted) price tag matches my experience!

Question to you freelancers: is such mismatch of feedback and outcome normal? Does it match your experience?

1jyxg2s,"I am preparing my CV for a Data analyst/Business analyst  role / Masters program , I have learnt the skills needed but I think i have to lie about some stufff on my cv!!","Okay so I am a CS grad, not very good at coding , opted for pursuing a data role, I want to mention everything truthfully on my CV but in today’s market I think I we need to inflate our CV to stand a chance .

My qualifications and grade points are going to accurate ( it’s average but I don’t want to fuck around here cuz a background check will definitely happen )

What I want to inflate is my communication skills( like I organised an events in my campus,I was part of this data science group…etc)
Disclaimer my communication is okay (got a 7.5 in IELTS) and I can usually speak well…so I thought if I add any of that stuff, I would prepare one day before the interview on what to say about it.   

I have built 1 good project but I want to add another project which I didn’t do by myself,I just got the source code with me, I was like I would take 2 or 3 days study, analyse the code and it’s working , how to use it and why it’s beneficial, in case the interviewer asks me about it.

To be honest , I don’t know I am doing the right thing or not ….i know it’s wrong but the Job market is as saturated as it can get, AI is literally just waiting to get more advanced to take away jobs, cooperations are anyways going to sap the life out of u….so just why not try to level the playing field.",LongjumpingMud9377,1,1.0,0,1744633140,2025-04-14 12:19:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jyxg2s/i_am_preparing_my_cv_for_a_data_analystbusiness/,4,2025
1jyx6l3,Should I retire from my sport to get a job,"I am currently very unsure about the next step to take in my career, for context I am 24 and currently a professional hockey player. I grew up in the USA but currently play in France. Since this is pretty minor pro I am not making insane money, lets call it enough for my needs to be met and a little bit for extras. I've been aware of the moment I will need to get a real job for a while now as I didn't make the NHL so this was obvious. This is why for the past 5 years I have been attending online colleges to get a bachelors in finance as well as a masters in corporate finance. The question becomes, is now the time to retire from sports to get a corporate job as the opportunity cost of a year without any work experience will be more and more as I get older. I imagine it being much harder to get an entry level job at 30 than it would be at 24. I've always been passionate in finance, and do look forward to beginning that part of my life. Furthermore, pro sports requires a lot of sacrifice and you are constantly moving, changing teams, as I am currently engaged and getting married next year, the cycle of constantly moving is exhausting for me and my future wife. However I've herd the corporate world is terrible and so is the job market so any extra years that could be spent not working could be beneficial to my overall happiness. I also have no clue if I will even be good at this and am afraid to end up without any work or fired after 6 months and eventually regretting my choice . 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated thank you. ",Equal_Limit_7139,27,0.9700000286102295,49,1744632294,2025-04-14 12:04:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jyx6l3/should_i_retire_from_my_sport_to_get_a_job/,4,2025

He has always been unapproachable, I felt he always led by fear and he always had a closed door policy. Though he is really an effective CEO that has led the organization to different levels of success, he was very impersonal. During the interview a few questions came up. “So, why did you leave us” and toward the end he asked “So, how badly do you want this job”. Though both questions seem reasonable, I want to add that it was his tone that was questionable. Almost like a power trip type of tone if that makes sense. Especially when he asked “how badly do you want this job” I felt he wanted the person to beg or something. If offered the job, I almost want to say thanks but no thanks. Thoughts?

1jyuls1,Advice on quitting a toxic job,"Am I crazy for considering quitting my toxic job?

I’ve been in my role for a few years and it’s been living hell. Working round the clock due to lack of respect for timezones and outrageous workload, terribly cut-throat politics, backwards processes, and double standards. My direct manager has tried to impact the culture positively, but was retaliated against for disagreeing with their manager. I’d go into more detail, but want to avoid anyone recognizing me.

My health has declined - I’ve lost weight, get daily stress rashes, panic attacks that either prevent me from getting to sleep or wake me up in the middle of the night. I’ve also started developing low grade fevers in the last month randomly throughout my work days without being “sick”. My relationship with alcohol is also starting to become troubling. I can’t relax without a drink.

Mentally, I have been depressed and have crippling anxiety. Lately, I’m so tired all I can do is rot on the couch or try to sleep on my days off. I have no physical or mental energy left.

On my birthday (which happened to land on a Friday) I got a last minute fire drill from a senior leader so I had to work until 8 PM, and at that point I hit my breaking point. I started googling whether suicidal ideation was covered under FMLA. The icing on the cake was that the content they had me create wasn’t even necessary by the following week. 

I’m finally at the point where I’m ready to quit without another job immediately lined up. My husband fully supports me quitting, and just wants his wife back. I also have a connection from a previous job that is opening a job req that they want to hire me for. 

I have over a year’s worth of an emergency fund built up to cover expenses. We’re childfree (and staying that way) and my husband has a very stable job that pays well and is where we are getting our health benefits from. Additionally we live pretty well under our means (1 vehicle, no student or credit debt).

Am I crazy for quitting? I realize I’m in a privileged position, especially with the state of our country - but I am feeling so much anxiety about this decision and the potential consequences to my career. At the same time, as I lay awake in the middle of the night typing this, I think this job is seriously taking so many years off my life.

I also respect everyone and treat them all the same way. This time, I asked him nicely to do something because that is the rule and he started defending himself. I told him it’s fine I’m just telling you based on what I saw. A few minutes later he came up to me with one other worker, and that worker came up to defend him too, so I felt like I was being attacked by both of them. And again, I was being respectful the whole time. I know I’m not sharing many details but this is the best I can do.

1jytkma,I just walked away from my family’s six-figure business to start from scratch in NYC—and I’m freaking out.,"

My dad has owned a very successful grocery store for over 20 years. It was profitable, bringing in six figures, and I was lucky enough to help run it for about 2 years. During that time, I managed to grow sales by 35%, which I was proud of.

My dad is 64, tired, and the stress of running the store has taken its toll. He’s always been extremely detail-oriented, to the point where it was exhausting. He’d ride employees (including me) over every little thing. I respected the hustle, but man, it was mentally draining.

Eventually, it came down to a fork in the road: either I fully take over the business or leave and try to make something of myself with my not-so-great degree in New York. After a lot of back-and-forth, I chose New York. We sold the store recently, and now I’m 23, sitting here with some savings and a ton of anxiety.

I’ve been comfortable for so long in that store. I kept telling myself, “I’ll leave eventually.” But now that it’s actually happening… I’m nervous. Will a 9-5 suit me? Did I walk away from a sure thing just to chase a pipe dream?

That said, I also feel like this move is the first real chance I’ve had to find myself—to be independent and see what I’m really made of without anyone hovering over my shoulder. I know how lucky I am to have even been in a position to make a choice like this. Most people don’t get that.

I’m just here to hear from others who’ve done something similar, or who’ve taken big risks. How did it go? Do you regret it? What helped you push through the doubt? Any advice or even just thoughts would be appreciated.

1jyqgzz,Feeling lost about my career path as a 3rd year IT student – need some advice,"Hello,  
I'm a third-year university student in IT, and lately I’ve been feeling really lost about what I want to do with my career.

Last summer, I was lucky enough to land an internship with the Canadian government. I’ve been told that getting into the government is a great opportunity and that it can set you up for life. But after two semesters of reflecting, I’m starting to realize that I’ve mostly been doing what others expect of me, rather than figuring out what I actually want.

After graduating and saving up a bit, I’d really like to move to the U.S. or to a bigger city. I want to experience life away from my family,  build some independence, and start feeling like an actual adult.

What worries me is whether I’ll be able to transition from a government role to the private sector—especially outside of Canada. I'm not sure how attractive my government experience will be to companies doing different kinds of work.

My degree is in IT with a focus on interactive media – things like web design and game development. I’m super interested in game dev, but I’ve heard it’s really hard to break into and the job security isn't great. That makes me nervous, with my past experience being unrelated, and especially since I want to eventually be financially comfortable while still enjoying the work I do. 

Right now, I’m just trying to figure out how to finish my degree with a clearer path. I want a job that pays well enough to live independently and still lets me feel fulfilled creatively.

1jyq3g1,Burnt Out After 4 Months,"Hello All, 

Not sure of the protocol here as this is my first time visiting the subreddit, but I’m at my wits end and need some serious help. I currently work in the private equity space and am so burnt out my body feels numb and I have broken down in tears countless times in the past weeks. (I’m a large male who has great mental health and haven’t cried in years prior to this) 

I came from a non-target background and had to climb the ladder to get to this point, making a number of strategic job moves over the past 5 years to get where I’m at. The worst part is, I’ve done all this work to get here and thoroughly hate it. 

I work on a lean team (myself and two other people) who are all remote as we are slated to open a West Coast office for our East Coast based firm “shortly”. The opening of the new office was part of the reason I joined this firm as I saw it as an opportunity to join an established firm on the ground floor. However, being remote for the first time and the lack of onboarding from headquarters has had me scrambling to constantly prod people for what to do on live deals and feeling like I’m constantly behind. In addition to feeling like I’m missing key steps of the deal process, they have thrown so much work on my plate that I have worked Saturday’s and Sundays for the past 5 weeks straight. By my estimation I am working 75+ hours a week when this was sold to me as a 45-55 hour a week role. I’m so close to quitting with no job lined up and no savings to get me through, but wanted to hear some external advice from those who have a different perspective. I’ve toyed with the notion of me feeling overworked with my manager and the general response I was given was “this is the way things are”.

1jypp0c,Am I being greedy not taking 25% pay bump?,"Looking for a quick gut check as I’m weighing a new opportunity.

I’m currently a Senior Digital Marketing Analyst at an agency, making around $72K. I’ve got 8 years of experience across strategy and execution—paid media, SEO, email, analytics, the whole mix. Fully remote, based in a midwest MCOL city.

I’m the top candidate for a fully remote Demand Gen Manager role at a legal tech SaaS company. I’ve had two solid convos with the VP of Marketing and they’re ready to move quickly. The range is posted at $80K–$90K. If they came in at $110K, I’d sign tomorrow.

**Why I’m interested:**

* Big step up in title, scope, and ownership
* Full KPI and revenue accountability
* Clear path to Director level in \~3 years
* Chance to help build out team and strategy from the ground up
* Legal SaaS feels like a stable, growing space

**Why I’m hesitating:**

* $90K is the top of their range, but feels light for the scope
* I’ve been aiming to break into $100K+ and don’t want to undersell
* The process has moved fast—tough to know if that’s just momentum or a red flag
* I’ve got other apps out there still in early stages

Trying to decide if I should push for $105K–$110K now before they formalize the offer, or lock in the $90K and bet on long-term upside.

If you’ve made a similar move—from agency to in-house, or from mid-70s to 90s or above—would really appreciate your perspective.

1jyp5zf,Does anyone have inspiration or testimonies for bouncing back after layoff and reduction in pay?,"Long story short: I'm in my late 30's. I've been in finance/banking since my early 20's. I started in a call-center and eventually made my way through default and origination operation jobs. In 2021 I started working as an Account Executive for a finance company and cleared six-figures easily. I was excelling at my job, then the rates went up and I was laid off mid 2023.
After 600 applications, I landed a job at a small local credit union making 40k. 400 applications later, I ended up with a large institution making 50k. Just got a sh*tty yearly increase that boosted my pay to $51.5k. Since being laid off, I've applied to approximately 1140 positions. I live in a blue collar town and cant move for family reasons. I just started taking courses to pivot into Data Analytics. 

Does anyone have any inspirational REAL stories about how they suffered a devastating drop in pay, but God/The Universe/Life rewarded them with a better paying job? I know my bounceback is coming but i feel so broke/embarrased and I need some inspiration. I won't answer follow-up questions. I wish I could wear a mask or veil to hide my face in public from shame.

1jyp4ma,Feeling ungrateful,"I will keep this as to the point as possible. 

Current employer is a major manufacturer and it has been the hardest and best opportunity I’ve ever had. I spent 6 years working the production floor before moving into supervision and starting my associates degrees. I excelled at supervision and then covid hit and I was offered an operations promotion that I had never been more proud of. I continued to work on my degree as my employer was paying for this. 14 months into operations in the height of the COVID great resignation period I was tapped for a HR role that I was told would open opportunities for me. I mulled this opportunity and decided to take it laterally with better hours, flexibility, pay, and visibility. I was told opportunities for development would come my way as well as projects.

Fast forward to today I’m 2.5 years in and feeling still very much a fish out of water. My manager is very shrm trained and avoids direct feedback or ownership. I destroyed most of my previous reputation in production moving to HR and know I feel very depressed. I spoke to my manager about the opportunities he sold me on and he did not respond well. I’m the first one to not lean on someone else for their future and I should have never trusted him based on years of gaslighting at this point.

Positive side. I’m paid ok but had I stayed in my previous role I would have been promoted twice at this point to well over six figures. Those roles don’t offer much life balance so he is acting like he saved me. I am not one that enjoys a job for how easy it is. It’s also not been easy because I’ve been put in charge of hiring, training, and placing half or more of all hires roughly 500-1000 per year. I am currently working on my bachelors which he made me change from what I wanted and now doesn’t seem to care. 

He told me I could have gone back at any time and he would help me find a new role but I probably wouldn’t like the path which means a demotion or long wait. He refuses to mention any opportunities in the current path and claims he has no plans to move me or anyone up under him. 

I have received exceptional review ratings and he has given me a lot of grace with my frustration. 

Should I be grateful for this “season” or move on before I lose all momentum. The operations side wants me in some way but I will probably be pushed very high very fast to failure.

1jyomuc,Need career advice,"I’m in my mid 20s and graduated with an Electrical Engineering degree 3 years ago. I’ve been working full time making good money but I feel somewhat complacent with my job. Ive been entertaining the idea of changing my career to being a pilot but ofc I’ll need to go through schooling again. I don’t know what else is the process besides getting a PPL then instrument ratings then a CPL. The reason why I didn’t go for this career initially after high school was because of how much it costs and being an immigrant, i was raised with a frugal mindset which deterred me from this path. Getting an EE degree wasn’t cheap either. I went to CC then finished the rest through uni and I worked full time while living with my parents. Anyways, the biggest reason why I’m hesitant about changing my career, is the time it’ll take and the cost. If I were to go back in time I would tell myself to take the risk and go to flight school.

I worked full time since graduating and I get paid fairly well. There are parts I enjoy about my job but I get little satisfaction at the end of the day. The job is definitely stressful and I don’t see myself lasting in the company in 10 years. I thought about doing flight school while working my full time job, but I would be EXHAUSTED. This job isn’t the typical 9-5 where you clock in and clock out, results matter so I often bring the work and stress home with me. I don’t know why it took me this long to realize that the office job isn’t for me, or maybe it is, but I just need to change to another engineering work.

1jynuuy,"IIT grad → Incoming IIM MBA → Want to do a PhD in Finance abroad (Europe preferred, open to US) | How to build a strong research profile & application while at IIM?","I’m reaching out for some solid guidance. I’m an incoming MBA student at one of the IIMs and a mechanical engineering graduate from one of the IITs. While most of my peers are (understandably) chasing placements, my long-term dream is a bit different: I want to go into **academia**, ideally in the **finance domain**.

My plan is to pursue a **fully funded PhD abroad** after my MBA — preferably in **Europe** (due to slightly lower competition and good programs), but I’m also open to the **US** if I can build a competitive profile.

Eventually, I’d love to come back to India and teach at a top B-school (like an IIM). But I know this is a long road and that I need to start planning **right now** — especially because MBA programs in India aren’t traditionally designed with research/PhD pipelines in mind.

So I have a ton of questions for anyone who’s been down this road, or knows people who have. Any insights would be super helpful.

# My Current Background (my_qualifications)

* BTech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT.
* Starting MBA at an IIM soon (2-year full-time program).
* Deeply interested in **finance, especially academic finance** — could be behavioral, corporate, empirical asset pricing, etc. (still exploring).
* No prior research experience (other than some academic projects in undergrad, not related to finance/econ).

**Main Areas Where I Need Advice**

# 1. Building a Research Profile at IIM

* How can I **get involved in research** during the MBA? Are there specific professors at IIMs who supervise independent research or allow MBA students to work as research assistants?
* Is it realistic to aim for **a working paper or co-authored publication** during these two years?
* Would a **summer internship in research (like with a prof or think tank)** help more than a traditional corporate internship?
* Are there any **research competitions, finance journals, or student research consortia** that MBA students can submit to?

# 2. Academic Preparation for PhD

* What subjects should I focus on to be ready for a finance PhD? I’m thinking of:
   * Corporate finance
   * Microeconomics
   * Statistics/Econometrics
   * Maybe machine learning if it applies to empirical research?
* Should I do **online courses (MIT OCW, Coursera, etc.)** in econ/stats to strengthen my foundations?
* Should I **audit or self-study** undergrad/PhD-level textbooks during the MBA? (If yes, which ones?)

# 3. Letters of Recommendation

* How do I build **strong relationships with profs** at an IIM for LORs?
* Are MBA professors considered credible recommenders for PhD applications in finance, or do adcoms prefer recommenders from econ/finance research backgrounds?
* Is it important to start working with profs from the **first semester** itself?

# 4. PhD Applications (Europe vs. US)

* What does a **competitive PhD application** in Finance look like (especially from an Indian MBA background)?
* Which schools in **Europe** are strong in finance research but also reasonably accessible?
   * Thinking of places like LBS, Bocconi, Tilburg, HEC, INSEAD, etc.
* What are the **typical profiles** of admitted students at these places? (GMAT/GRE scores, research experience, academic background)
* How do **PhD program structures differ** between the US and Europe (in terms of coursework, funding, length, etc.)?
* Do I need a **GRE** for finance PhDs or is GMAT fine?

**Final Thoughts**

I know this isn’t the most conventional path from an IIM, but I’m super passionate about **research and teaching**, and I really want to make this work. I’m willing to put in the effort over these 2 years to build the right profile, but I’m not sure where to begin or what exactly PhD admissions committees are looking for — especially in candidates coming from an Indian MBA.

If anyone here has gone through this process — or knows people who have done a PhD in finance/econ/related areas after an IIM or IIT — I’d *love* to hear your advice.",Relative_Reality4614,2,1.0,1,1744595860,2025-04-14 01:57:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jynuuy/iit_grad_incoming_iim_mba_want_to_do_a_phd_in/,4,2025

Would love to hear from people who took either path — what worked for you and what would you suggest?",Rawat_Aayush,2,1.0,2,1744581232,2025-04-13 21:53:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jyj42c/should_i_pursue_a_bca_degree_or_focus_fully_on/,4,2025
1jyj3vw,"Overworked, underpaid, unsure what’s next and looking for advice","I’m a 29, Black, female, working in government communications in a really niche part of the education world. I’ve been in my current role as a communications specialist for almost five years. It’s a small state agency. I’m close to finishing my Accreditation in Public Relations, which I know isn’t broadly recognized, but I couldn’t afford a graduate degree and I’m surrounded by them.

I started here through a nontraditional path. I worked at a marketing agency for about a year after college and saw myself going down that path until the company went under in March 2020. I stumbled across an admin opening, and within six months, I used my marketing skills to move into the communications specialist role, and I’ve held it ever since. I knew I needed to put in the time and effort to prove myself because I was fairly young and didn’t have direct communications experience. I’ve learned a lot and stuck around because I thought it would lead to something more.

However, my lack of comms experience early on, combined with the small organization's size at the time, led to a lot of administrative duties still falling on me. That slowed my ability to dive into the comms work how I wanted and needed to grow in the space as much as I feel I should have by now.

Over the past year, things have shifted. The agency has gone through a lot of changes. I’ve taken on things outside my job description in the spirit of being a team player. I was even the agency’s de facto IT person for two years, responsible for setting up new staff members and everything. Alas, it only hurt me. When evaluation time comes around, they only look at what’s officially in my job description (not everything else I’ve taken on). So, I end up being seen as underperforming, even though I’m doing so much more. I partially blame myself because I didn’t know how to hold boundaries, manage my work properly, or have the language to advocate for myself. But I hold resentment toward leadership, too, for not recognizing this and instead letting me drown. Or maybe pushing me under themselves? Who knows. Oh well. I can’t spend too much time looking at the past.

Something I did during this last evaluation cycle was set boundaries. I asked for breaks from duties that didn’t make sense for my role so I could dive into the comms work without distractions, and I’ve indeed done that. This past year, I’ve built out new weekly and monthly communications to stakeholder groups by the thousands that are highly engaging. I’ve worked on updating branding and redesigning websites, and I’ve been able to sit with organizational experts to focus on the content coming out of our agency, which has seen some genuinely positive impacts. I’ve also had the opportunity to be more strategic and proactive in media and PR, especially in the current climate, which has felt really important.

At the same time, I’ve worked on myself professionally. I struggle with ADHD, and I’ve been working with a new therapist who has truly helped me recognize a lot of my symptoms. That’s allowed me to build out tools and systems that have made me an overall much better worker.

I’ve been hopeful about how this past year has gone and what my growth trajectory might be for the first time in a while.

But now, a team member just quit, and I’m being asked to take on a big chunk of their responsibilities, too. That includes managing student records requests, overseeing the intern program, and receiving operational and financial school updates that I’ll need to report out in ways I’m still figuring out. I asked for a compensation review and was told it’s too soon to talk about that. Decisions on who will officially get these duties won’t happen until June 30. In the meantime, I’m expected to do all this additional work with no extra pay. For over 90 days. It feels unfair.

To be honest, I’m tired. I’ve been trying to meet expectations without clear support or direction, and I feel overworked, underpaid, and taken advantage of. I know I’ve played a role by not setting boundaries or speaking up sooner, but I’m trying to change that now.

At the same time, I know I have solid experience. I’ve handled media relations, internal and external communications, stakeholder engagement, social, website, content, you name it. I’ve thought about stepping out on my own someday and doing consulting. Others who left my agency have already done that because of the niche of this field. But I’m not sure I’m ready at this stage. Plus, I have a mortgage, two dogs, and regular health needs, so I need stability and insurance. That’s a big part of why I haven’t left.

So I’m here asking for advice.

The job market scares me a little, but I’m a go-getter and truly believe I can figure anything out. Also, I love government comms, but I have to be honest with myself. Being Black and female in government may not always work in my favor. I don’t want that to be a deterrent, but I live in a red state and feel like I’d need almost a hired agent to help me navigate this landscape. That feels exhausting.

I also feel like maybe I should start slowly building something on the side, stick it out a few more years, and create a launching pad for when I do decide to leave. But I have to be careful about conflict of interest. I wouldn’t even be able to contract with schools until I’ve left my job, so how can I prepare for that?

This is a lot. Thank you for reading. ",blackyogini,3,1.0,2,1744581217,2025-04-13 21:53:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jyj3vw/overworked_underpaid_unsure_whats_next_and/,4,2025

1jyhqgm,Interviewer gave me tips on how to answer questions in an interview.,"Hello everyone! This is kind of embarrassing because I do not know how to take it. I’m in the process of interviewing for a job that I really want. I finished my second round of interviews on Friday. 

However, during the final 10 minutes of the interview, the interviewer started to give me advice on how to answer interview questions. She said I need to sell myself and be confident. She also gave me a method to answer situational questions. 

She then asked me one more situational question and told me to use the method she gave me. I did and then we got to the regular HR questions like “are you willing to relocate and if so, where would you want to move to?” 

Obviously, I am taking the advice to heart. I appreciate the advice, but it has me scared. I don’t know if this was a good or bad thing. I couldn’t tell if this was an indicator that my answers were lackluster, or if it was genuine and the final question was to see how well I can follow instructions.

1jyh7py,Deciding Between Two Jobs,"I’m trying to decide between two job offers and need help selecting which one would be better.  Both jobs have the same salary and commute time, so that is not a deciding factor between them.  I outlined some info as well as pros/cons:

I currently work on a finance team as a budget analyst for a local public school district in the pacific northwest, where I have been for almost 8 years.  I generally enjoy the job but was getting a bit burnt out and wanted to try something else that is still a finance role and also within non-profit and/or government.  I would ideally eventually like to work in finance within the public health space.

 

Job 1: Director of Finance within a major environmental non profit

Pros:

\-          Everyone in the office/chapter seems really nice and genuinely enjoys the work

\-          The mission of the organization is great

\-          Pretty flexible hours/schedule, as the only non remote day is 1 day per week

\-          My would be boss is really nice and we click well

\-          The organization is obviously within the environmental (and a little bit health) space.  I am interested in eventually pursuing a career that aligns with public health.

Cons

\-          I would be the only finance person in the whole office/chapter, which makes me a bit nervous as I have never had a position where that is the case.  I have always been part of a larger finance *team*

\-          Because I would be the only finance person, I basically am part of leadership which means I would need to interact with the board regularly

\-          My would be boss is currently only *acting* as they will be hiring someone else more permanent for that role within the next few months, who I would be reporting to

\-          I don’t have experience within this industry, so I am nervous about being in such a high up position within an industry and organization that I am not familiar with

\-          Their finance/budgeting system(s) seems very chaotic, unorganized and almost non-existent (which really makes me nervous/wonder why they feel it is ok to only have *one finance person* for the whole chapter!)

\-          When I first met with the team during the interview (my would be boss wasn’t there), I felt like something was… off for some reason.  Like, I feel like I didn’t really click with them

 

Job 2: Senior Budget Analyst within a large private University in my city

Pros:

\-          My would be boss is really nice and I think we would get along well

\-          I would be part of a finance *team* which I am more comfortable with as that is also what I have been used to throughout my career

\-          When I met with the rest of the finance team, we got along and clicked really well

\-          It is work that I feel would be more straightforward and easier to manage since I am somewhat already familiar with the industry and type of role.

\-          I really enjoy being/working on a college campus atmosphere. Working at a state school university eventually might be a good backup plan for the public health route

Cons:

\-          Their remote days are only 2-3 days a week, and in the interview, they said they are likely going to soon require an increase on the number of days we need to be in the office

\-          It is a very small University and the enrollment has been decreasing over the last few years, which means they have had to make large budget cuts to staff, etc.

\- This role is obviously within the education space, which I am likely not very interested in staying in much longer (since I hope to pursue something more related to public health)

 

I really appreciate your thoughts/insight 😊

1jyfrlt,Boss said I was second choice,"I am two days into my new job so far. Boss seems supportive and have been sharing advice/behind the scenes/context about colleagues/situation/other departments. When we were out getting lunch, he told me that  he had a hard time deciding which of 2 candidates to choose from when filling the position I accepted and started. He agonized over the decision and talked to his leadership team since the other candidate and I had different strengths. According to boss:

1) When boss reached out to the other candidate, that other candidate withdrew candidacy since it was a lateral position and was promised a promotion if stayed in organization (this position is a promotion for me). Other candidate was considered to be more technical with experience in a specific platform/area my team and I will be focused on.

2) When considering my candidacy, boss likes I had extensive management experience (even though position is a promotion for me, in another life I was a SVP serving as a department head overseeing 18 people). Boss's management team thought management experience was more important.

I don't exactly remember how Boss phrased it but along the lines of wanting to be honest and share/tell. I told him I am glad he was honest and that we were fortunate that other candidate did not string everyone along and declined candidacy early on. Later in the day, I said to my boss not to be self serving but I was the stronger candidate for the role. My rationale was I met some junior team members later on my first day, I noted while they seemed capable, they were very young and would benefit from a supervisor with management experience. My boss gave me a look.

Can someone tell me if my boss is trying to passive aggressively put me in my place? It so, was it a huge faux pas on my part to respond as I did?

1jyfk96,Going back to previous job after 1.5 years,"I worked an office job for 7 years. Consistent annual raises, but I started at such a low rate that my pay was still lower than where I wanted it to be. Asked to take on more job duties for a raise and was told no twice. I also had a lot of stressful things going on in my personal life and fell into a deep depression. I started to slack off at work as well, bad appearance, crying in my cubicle, not socializing with anyone etc. I was close to the edge so I simply did not care anymore. I was having mental breakdowns. I put in my 2-weeks notice and my boss tried to get me a raise to stay, but my boss’ boss wouldn’t do it. They did not fill my position once I left, instead they dissolved it. 

Moved to an entirely different field, was there for 6 months, and was able to improve my physical health, stress levels and mindset within that time frame. But wanted to go back to a structured office environment. 

Then moved on to another office job, but a different industry. I’ve been there over a year. I now make only $1 more than what I was making at my previous office job on year 7, but my workload is WAY more and the environment & boss are so horrible. Like made me cry at work horrible because my boss was directly rude to me and used foul language. No HR department so nothing I could do but just take it. My boss just acts like nothing happened and everything is okay. Never any apology or accountability. 

In hindsight, I wish I had stayed at my first office job because it was a huge corporate company so there was great benefits, top of the line equipment, no issues with payroll and an actual HR department for any issues. But my mental health made me spiral and I made a lot of bad choices in the time, with my career, relationships etc. Not just work. I’ve since gained perspective of how other companies operate and I definitely took for granted the great job I had.  

There is an opening at my first office job, in the department I used to work in and with the same boss/coworkers. Not the exact same role since it was dissolved, but very similar. I want to apply for it but I feel so scared. I’m 99% sure that I would have to take a pay cut of $2-3 since I would be “starting over” again at the company. I really don’t think they’d start me at a higher pay rate just because if my experience. I’m also scared they won’t want me back at all since I slacked off then left. I kinda feel stupid for even leaving. Should I call my boss up and say something like, “Hey Boss, it’s MyName! I heard so-and-so is retiring, and I would love the opportunity to apply for the open position. I really miss working at Company, it was such a stable and positive environment, and I’d love the chance to apply. Would it be okay if I sent you my resume?” etc. 

Is it appropriate to text, or is this only a phone call? Boss & I always texted for work stuff, but my family said it’s unprofessional to text about it. Is my message too grovely? Not grovely enough? It’s been a year a half, so I’m hoping they won’t remember my last six months when I declined. I gave 6.5 amazing years of work before that.

1jydkth,Money and work-life balance or job satisfaction and purpose?,"F(27). I’ve been in a soul-destroying HR job rotting away at a desk for the past 5 years, earning a low wage to make money for the big bosses. Not my idea of a meaningful career. I’ve recently had two job offers, one to work in HR in a charity, home based, better pay. The other to join the police force as a PCSO.

Here’s what I’m weighing up:

1.	⁠A 9-5 home based job earning a decent salary, where my partner (current PC) and I can get a dog and be home for our children when we have them in the next few years. But little job satisfaction in a sedentary desk-based job.

2.	⁠Being active, outdoors, helping the community, and making myself useful, but in a lower paid job where I won’t be home as often for said future dog and kids.

I’m leaning towards the PCSO role as I feel it will bring me more job satisfaction, but I’ve seen many videos of people ripping into PCSOs and taking advantage of their very limited powers in confrontational situations. I want to bring value to the community, not be ridiculed by little shits.

1jyd85a,Mid-career manufacturing engineering manager (UK) looking to grow salary & step up — where to start?,"Hi all,

I’m 37, based in the UK, and currently working as a mid-level manager in manufacturing engineering. I manage a team of 14, and I’ve been in this role for a number of years. For the last four, I’ve been working remotely (which was great while my kids were little). My children are now 7 and 5 and much more independent, so I’m ready and able to transition into a hybrid role, I’m thinking 2–3 days a week in the office.

Here’s where I’m at:

* I like what I do and I’m good at it, but I feel like I’ve plateaued.
* I want to step up and grow my career — and more bluntly, I want to significantly increase my salary. I’m on £65k now, my next step I’m looking for is £80 - £85k. I’m aiming to be at £100k in 5 years.
* I’ve got solid experience managing teams, improving processes, and leading cross-functional projects, but I don’t know how to position that for the next big leap.
* My current employer (50,000 employees in the UK) offers limited opportunity for the next step. I’m also not very happy with some internal things that have happened over the last  6 – 12 months so I really want to step away from this company.
* I’m unsure where to look — standard job boards seem flooded with roles that are either too junior or not a good fit. So I be looking at industry fairs, networking events, career coaches, recruiters, mentors? I’m unsure how to find someone reputable in this space.

 

Some additional context that might help:

* I’m a German national and bilingual (German/English), which I feel could be a strong asset in the right context.
* I’d consider a remote role with a European company (based out of the UK) — especially one that includes some travel.
* I’m open to different paths — whether that’s stepping into a more senior leadership role, exploring adjacent sectors, or even doing further training/education if it makes sense.

I’d love any advice from people who’ve made a similar move, especially in manufacturing, engineering, or ops/leadership roles. How did you break through that mid-career ceiling? Where did you look for opportunities that weren’t just sideways moves?

Specific questions:

* What platforms or recruiters are worth checking out in the UK (or EU) for senior engineering/ops/leadership roles?
* Has anyone here worked with a career coach? Was it worth it?
* Would it make sense to do some kind of MBA or leadership course at this point in my career? I’m quite academic and like to study but with family and work life already keeping me busy, am I wasting valuable time on this?
* Any general advice on navigating the “next level” of a career when you’ve got experience but want a real step change?

Thanks in advance for any guidance — I’ve been in this field a long time, but shifting into career-growth mode feels oddly intimidating after years of head-down focus.

About four months ago, I was hired by a car manufacturing company for the position of a service engineer. The pay is alright, the company itself is considered one of the biggest in my country, and there are many nice perks to this job. There is one catch, though...

The car factory I'm supposed to work at is still under construction, and it seems that the construction is far behind schedule. Because of that, it is basically impossible for me to do my job (which is to maintain factory equipment that's not there). What I'm told to do meanwhile is assisting with the construction of the facility.

That may sound cool on paper, but I'm having to spend all day just doing things that require little to no skill, like tightening nuts on hanger beams or driving a lift. I'm essentially doing a lot of plain manual and physical labor when I'm supposed to be gaining knowledge and experience. (This is my first job, by the way.)

Also, our department is the only one in the company that's contributing to the construction works (even though we have nothing to do with it), whereas other departments are going through training for when the factory launches.

That's why I've been feeling like quitting the job, but some of my family members tell me to suck it up and be patient. Do you think I should quit? Is it normal for companies to get employees involved in such things?",Sea_Calligrapher4093,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1744563174,2025-04-13 16:52:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jyc64h/tricked_into_doing_construction_work/,4,2025

1jyaqbo,I rage quit,"Here’s the picture. 5 years ago I started as a designer at an interior / architecture design firm. There was just my boss (let’s call her Agatha) and another director (let’s call her maud), and me. Agatha stated she wanted both myself and maud to be self employed. I started working freelance part time for them during Covid and it had always worked well for me as I have my own business on the side. 

Throughout the years things have changed and we completed some big projects - and we worked together really well as a team. During this time I got to know them well as friends including their families. On my 5th year of being in the business my boss was diagnosed with cancer and maud went off on maternity leave to have her first child at the same time. This put a massive strain on me trying to still juggle this workload part time with not a lot of support but I kept going. After 9 months of working this way, Agatha gave me a pay rise of £10 a day and a £1000 bonus. She never spoke to me in person to say thank you, just an email. I had never asked for a pay rise before this because I felt so guilty as she was unwell. Then another 10 months rolled in, Agatha finally came back to work with full health and maud started making a come back by a half day or day every week. Things started to change. I was then questioned by maud about some decisions on a project, which had never happened before and she effectively went in a strop over something silly. I was also pulled up and emailed over a small mistake which maud had noticed and then told Agatha, which had never happened before. They started to hire more junior staff to take the workload off of me, and wanted us to be in the office in fixed days. (We always had flexible working / wfh beforehand which made the job for me easier). 

During all of this time I started to feel completely burnt out, felt like I wasn’t getting paid enough, and it started effecting my side business as I couldn’t give the same time to it. I really cared about Agatha and maud and I cared about the future of the business, which is why I had worked so hard over the past 18 months. 

I queried this with both of them and said I prefer working from home if possible, as freelance to me means working in a way that I can dictate and there was always respect around this being self employed. They didn’t like this. I was told I needed to be in the office on set days and that was that. Maud started coming back more days but she was allowed to work from home. I was not. Maud decided she only wanted to do certain parts of our job, leaving me with tasks she refused to do because they were on software she didn’t want to pay for - which I had paid for. I then ended up paying for her software she said she needed to use for her husbands sisters wedding - but then she began clearly using it for work purposes too. She didn’t ask me once if it was ok to use the software or offer to pay a cut. 

I decided to pull Agatha aside and asked my future within the company. I didn’t mention any of the issues maud was causing, because at this stage I could tell in Agatha’s eyes maud could do no wrong. Agatha said she would get back to me. 

I then recieved a email from Agatha gaslighting me into believing I would get the opportunity to work as a senior designer - which is what I had already been working as for the past 3 years. Turns out she was having similar chats with one of the members of our team who is a lot more junior than me, and she had copied and pasted the same email she sent to them to me - confirmed by the more junior member of the team I became friendly with. 

I sent an email to Agatha calling her out for this and telling her I couldn’t work to this capacity anymore. I stopped eating, stopped sleeping with the stress of it all. How could they treat me like this after all I had done to keep the business afloat? 

I didn’t come in for a week due to stress. Agatha then very reluctantly said I could be director in future, and she would look at ‘giving me something’ to show her commitment. She admitted the business wouldn’t have gotten through the past 18 months without me. She also raised my day rate by £15 a day. At this point, I was very concerned the business was growing, and I was being treated like an employee, without any of the benefits. She asked me if I could work more days. I agreed and appreciated her making the effort. 

The next week, I came into the office and maud had decided she wanted me to change my seat from where I usually always sat. I questioned why (because I was getting weird vibes) and she shouted at me infront of the team that it was her seat before maternity leave and she wanted to sit there. Baring in mind it was almost now 2 years since she had left for maternity leave and she still wasn’t fully back. She had never spoken to me in such a way before and I was really shocked and angry.

Over that weekend, I couldn’t sleep again, I had a panic attack, and the stress affected me so badly I quit on the Monday morning. I couldn’t go on with it. 

If you’ve made it this far congratulations and thank you for listening. What do you think happened here? I’m really glad I’m out of the situation now and I’ve definitely done the right thing - but it was a bizarre situation and I’d love some outside perspective. Am I the asshole?

1jy96kv,Should I have a conversation with my boss?,"I honestly don't know what to do. I've been at a job for 2 months. It's an ""entry-level"" position, so my boss is training me. I can't get away from her. It's a staff of 3, and we work in the same room. She's the owner of the business.

\- If I try to answer my own question, she impatiently makes me ask her the question.

\- If I ask her a question, she acts annoyed that I have a question, and sometimes responds sarcastically. Or will say, ""remember?"" or ""doesn't that make sense?"" Sometimes she just takes over the task and does it while huffing and puffing in front of me.

\- She's a terrible teacher. She either does things for me or leaves me to do them on my own. She never waits to see if I'm doing the task to her standards. Then, when I'm done, she ruthlessly criticizes what I did.

\- I wouldn't need to bring this up to her, but often when she shows me how she would do something, it's much worse than how I do it, and she ends up criticizing my job anyway.

\- She almost never compliments me.

I really need a reference. My last jobs have not ended in solid references. It's possible that after I know what I'm doing, she will be happier with me, and give me a good reference. I'm worried, however, that I'm going to respond to her behaviors in a less-than-professional manner if I don't pick the right way to deal with this. I'm also worried that having a conversation with her may make her label me as ""difficult."" We're heading into the busy season, and I would drive her insane if I quit.

Should I have a conversation with her, or try to ""correct"" her behavior in the moment, in smaller (but multiple) doses?

1jy7m4z,Should I get paid for agreeing to work part time before the contract’s official start date?,"I was recently promoted to a new position, effective March 18th. After this, they sent me another version of the contract where the effective start date was April 1st, and I signed that version too. However, on March 12th, the recruiter, my hiring manager and my previous manager agreed and told me that between March 18th and march 31st I would be working in a 50/50 scheme to transition between jobs. In my company we get paid on the 20th, and my March’s payroll had a bit more money than my normal payroll; I assumed this was ok due to the agreement made. 

This week an onboarding analyst contacted me and said that the extra pay that I received in March will be discounted from April’s pay, as the contract officially says I started on the 1st. I told them that I did work in the new job during those days. For the record, in my country’s political constitution (aka the supreme law) it says that there will be primacy of reality over formalities and that in case of doubt, the employee must be favored. I already reached out to my former manager, my new manager and recruitment, and I tried to communicate with the payroll team but had no response. On Monday I will speak with a senior manager who used to be HRBP and we have a good relationship.

1jy6old,Biology vs Medicine vs pharmacology,"So i’m an 18 year old and preparing to choose my university degree and i’m torn between biology medicine or pharmacology 

I’ve always been intrigued by biology and in general science and how things work in the world, i’m a fairly good student so i’m confident i would succeed in both.

My issue is that I don’t like patient care at all and I don’t want to work in hospital since i find them dirty and unorganized. I’m a woman so I want to have a family and be active in the life of my kids so the long shifts of medicine aren’t that appealing either. 
Money isn’t an issue either, I just want a job that pays me enough to live comfortably 

Given all the above I’m leaning towards biology  or pharmacology but my family and friends keep telling me that medicine is a better choice as it will give me more stability. 

Ideally I would want to do a phd and then teach at a university or do research and work in a biotech or in pharmaceutical manufacturing. Im also interested in genetics and neuroscience

I went through interviews and was offered the job. The salary is more than double my current base plays an incentive at the end of the year. I was not looking for a new job as I like my current job, but was severely unhappy about my compensation for 2 years and they knew it. This new opportunity feels like it is a great career move with opportunity for growth and the compensation is great. I told my employer I was resigning Thursday afternoon and my boss said she wanted to try to keep me. Friday morning I met with our VP who told me she would be sad if I left and if I would be interested in staying if they could do something for me. I told her I wasn’t sure but that I do enjoy my work there. At the end of the day, the GM called me and reiterated wanting to save me and he had to at least try. He said he wouldn’t be able to match the base but he would see if he can get creative (I have commission with my current job) to get me where I need to be. He asked if they can have until early next week.

The problem is, I don’t want to keep pushing off my offer as I want to be respectable to this new company. I am also annoyed that I spoke to 3 people at my current job and it was all talk on saving me rather than a counter offer. The GM said they were trying to work on things for me but the budget for Q1 was tight and they had to spread it across multiple people and that I would need added responsibility for a promotion. There is also word that we aren’t doing too well with new business. For the last 2 years, I have been vocal about my pay. There was also an internal position posted in December of a job similar to what I was doing with a larger salary base and I spoke to the VP about it, they said if they were to match it, if I would stay in my position and I said yes but I need assurances that will happen and they said they understand and we had an opportunity to do that in Q1… and that didn’t happen. I feel I have been strung along and promises have been made and not kept. The issue is, I like my job and the people I work with. I also have a lot of flexibility with this job. The only thing I think holding me back honestly is fear of not knowing if the grass will be greener on the other side. The saying of sometimes the devil you know is better than the one you don’t is playing in my head. I have been with my current employer for 9 years, so I am having a hard time taking the leap. I am also worried if I wait around for the counter, that the offer I did get may get rescinded.

1jy4sp9,"27 y/o with science degree and low GPA — exploring next steps for a stable, well-paying career","I’m 27, based in Alberta, Canada, and I have a Bachelor of Science in Natural Sciences with concentrations in chemistry and biology. My cumulative GPA is 2.8, which has ruled out a few paths I was originally interested in, like optometry and physiotherapy in Canada. I looked into Australia for physio, but ~$200k in loans feels like too big of a risk for a career with ~$80k average salary and limited upward mobility.

Here’s a bit about my background:

• Certified personal trainer with experience in both one-on-one and group settings (across all ages and fitness levels)

• Completed a semester as a physical rehabilitation assistant during undergrad

• Worked as an optician assistant for a year (pretesting including OCT, tonometry, etc.)

• 8 years of retail assistant management and customer service experience

• Currently doing remote contract work as a chemistry content trainer for an AI company (well-paying but not permanent and not always available)

• Also have hands-on experience — working on cars as a home mechanic and comfortable with tools and physical labour

That said, I’d prefer not to rely on my physical ability for long-term income. I'm looking for a career that can offer long-term growth and stability.
I’ve considered some of the polytechnic options here (like civil engineering tech at SAIT), but I’m hesitant to commit to something completely disconnected from my science background or that may not be widely in demand outside the region. Ideally, I’d like to build on what I already have, if possible.
I also feel like my GPA doesn’t fully reflect my ability, as I had some tough semesters adjusting to online classes and lockdowns during COVID, including a couple of 1.0 terms that really brought down my average. I think I could do much better going back to school now, but I’m still trying to figure out what’s realistic. I am open to relocating and prefer to be somewhere new. 

If anyone has been in a similar spot — low GPA, science degree, unsure of what’s next — I’d really appreciate any insight. Whether you went back to school, changed fields, or found an alternate route, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

I have to wake up at 5:30 in the morning and I get home at 5pm. The commute is 1 hour and I have no personal or free time and my social life is dead, I can't even make friends where I work because it would be an hour to meet up with them.

The pay is terrible too, I live with my mum though so all I need to pay for is my car payments and fuel. It is difficult work because it is physical work in a factory. It isn't menial labour by any means but it is physical work that exhaust you. I find engineering quite interesting, but when I applied for the job, I thought it was going to be more of a design role rather than working physically in the factory. It is very loud in there and when I shut my eyes at night, I hear the loud beeping and noises in the factory.

I'm a 20-year-old Commerce graduate, currently working in a Big 4 in India. I’ve been with the Forensics team under Risk Consulting for 6 months now. Let me explain what my role involves so you get a sense of where I’m coming from. My team mainly assists clients—mostly private equity investors—with integrity and due diligence checks.

As a Specialist (which is the entry-level role), my work starts with receiving the names of target individuals or entities. I search for them across public databases, government sites, and social media, and take screenshots of every search—regardless of whether I find anything. If there are any hits, I check if they relate to my target, gather supporting info, and write it up in a report. If nothing comes up, I still have to document and back it up. The report itself is pretty basic—just a summary of what the target does, contact details, public domain results, and a short conclusion. The process is super repetitive: fixed list of databases, same search steps, and then writing summaries, often with help from ChatGPT. After that, the report goes to an Associate who reviews it and gets back to me with corrections.

The problem is—there’s absolutely no consulting here. I’m not learning anything new, there’s no data analysis, no client interaction, and no real challenge. It’s brain-dead work. On top of that, the deadlines are intense, and I occasionally breach them because I’m often pulled into other backend work. My People Manager is chill and doesn’t nag, but there’s another Manager who constantly ropes me into Salesforce tasks and client onboarding activities. These tasks are ideally meant for Project Managers, not juniors. I don’t get chargeable hours for them, and it pushes my actual work behind. Plus, this admin work doesn’t add much value to my career, aside from saying I’m familiar with Salesforce.

The team has 40+ people spread across locations. At my office, we have one MD, six Senior Managers/Managers, two Associates, and three Specialists. It’s a male-dominated team and I’m the only female junior here. I’ve been on the receiving end of misogynistic comments from a peer, but I didn’t report it because the team seems to like him more and this fucker is 2 faced asf. He acts polite around the team and shows a completely different side when alone with me, which makes it harder to speak up.

There was another incident where a Senior Manager assigned a task to a Senior Associate, who then dumped it on me after hours without any context. I hadn’t done that task before and hadn’t been trained, so I took over an hour to finish it. The next day, the SM pulled me aside and was upset because it had been an urgent client task, and apparently this task would've taken her only 10 minutes but I caused a delay. Later, I overheard her badmouthing me to another Manager, mocking how long I took and how I always stay late in office (which I do just to avoid the crowd and heat). Since then, I’ve noticed that Manager giving me more of the admin and Salesforce work—none of which the male juniors are asked to do. It’s making me feel like I’m being seen as some clueless bimbo. The male juniors get greeted in the mornings, share laughs with seniors, go for coffee, and get high-fives, while I don’t even get a basic “good morning” unless there’s some extra work to be done.

There’s another vertical in my team that handles Level 2 work—where they reach out to market sources via calls (under false pretexts) to collect information. This work is considered high value and gets the most attention from clients. I thought of doing L2 work to gain more visibility so to learn L2, I volunteered to help with transcripts for these calls. But after listening in, I realized how ethically grey it was, and I don’t want to compromise on my values for the sake of client deliverables. Unfortunately, now that I’ve started, the Level 2 team keeps pushing me to take up more of their transcripts. Again—no chargeable hours for this either. And I've not gained any visibility unless it's to give me more work. 

I even reached out to my People Manager and asked if I could be part of more client meetings. He let me attend one and then never again. I’ve also been asking him for a 1-on-1 feedback session for over a month. I reminded him twice, but didn’t want to keep nagging him. When I reminded him again last week, he said we’d talk for sure—but then left office on Friday without speaking to me. I was planning to use that meeting to bring up all these issues and to ask if I could explore other teams within the Line of Service. I feel like I’m not learning anything meaningful and my work has become painfully mundane.

I don’t have a strong relationship with my PM, and I haven’t pushed harder because of the sexist comments I’ve received from that peer about me and my PM. On top of that, the managers have their own cliques and are often gossiping about each other. Honestly, the whole team feels toxic at this point and I want out.

When I joined as a trainee, we were told during onboarding that we’re allowed to explore different teams based on our interests. I really want to do that now—but I’m not sure how to go about it. I’m interested in finance, management consulting, India markets, PE strategy, or even the government sector teams. I’d love to work in any of those, but I’m worried I might not have the right skill set. I’m also scared of ending up in a team that’s even worse than my current one.

How can I request a transfer without causing bad blood? I know people will judge me regardless, but I’d rather work somewhere I can grow. Also, are there other SBUs within the firm where the work is less brain-dead and more strategic? I’m just trying to figure out how to make the most of this experience without feeling exploited and invisible.

He hasn’t mentioned promotions in his request or hinted either way his reasoning for requesting this on me. I’m not sure if I should straight up ask why I’ve been tasked with this.

1jy1ope,Career change/school?,"
Hello everyone, 
I posted this on career guidance and haven’t gotten any response so I thought I’d try my luck here.
I need some advice on what direction I Should go. I (23m) went to culinary school and spent what little money I could have used for college on that. I’ve since worked in the restaurant industry for the last 4 years and have decided to make a career change. I’ve considered it before but decided to give it another chance, but as much as I have a passion for food and cooking and being creative I realize that it doesn’t transfer to the profession. I’ve never been content and I haven’t been happy working in restaurants and honestly hate the food industry for what it is. I did well and made pretty good money, but I’ve decided it just isn’t the direction I want to take. 

I’m trying to decide what my next move will be and have been extremely twisted up now that I don’t have a direction. I have no idea what I want to do and it’s quite terrifying. Multiple people are pushing me to go into the trades (election, welder, etc) but I have no interest in working those fields. I understand that it can be a great career for some and can make good money but some of the aspect of that are exactly what I want to get a way from. It’s just  not the kind of career I see myself being happy in. I could possibly see myself being a welder but it’s still not something I strive for.

I can’t seem to find any entry level jobs that have opportunities to grow that doesn’t require a degree or 3-5 years of experience. All I know is food and I hate that I feel like my only options are working with 16 year olds making minimum wage or joining the trades. I know there are other jobs that pay decent that don’t require a degree but I haven’t heard of or seen anything that I can see myself being content with. 

I’ve been seriously considering going back to school, doing 2 years and community college to transfer for bachelors, but nobody seems to think that it’s a good idea since I don’t have anything specific in mind. But I would rather put my head down for a few years and come out with a business degree giving me more options and opportunity to pursue something I am interested in as well as being able to make more connections and gain more  exposure to different things while in school. I never liked school much but right now it seems the best way to invest in myself. I could work part time and be frugal for a while to get myself through. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m insanely overwhelmed, with people close to me giving conflicting advice. Should I go back to school? Or should I give welding a chance? I would really appreciate some unbiased words of wisdom, and don’t be afraid to be blunt.",Sharp-Implement1301,1,1.0,0,1744527087,2025-04-13 06:51:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jy1ope/career_changeschool/,4,2025
1jy15oo,"Need Advice, 2024 CSE pass out still no job.","I’m writing this after having tried everything I could to get a job — from walk-in interviews to reaching out for referrals — but unfortunately, nothing has worked so far. I now find myself at a crossroads, unsure of what to do next. Although I got one offer from a company but I think they have ghosted me. 

Some of my friends have suggested pursuing an MBA, but I have two major concerns:

1. I don’t feel like it will truly solve the problem.
2. My financial condition doesn’t allow for it. I have two sisters who are still in college, which puts a significant financial burden on my family.

I feel completely stuck. I'm genuinely looking for direction — would preparing for GATE be a good option in my situation? Or is there something else I should consider?

Lately, I’ve even been considering completely stepping away from studies and joining my father in his business. I’m at a point where I feel stuck and unsure about my future. Most of my friends have either secured jobs or are moving ahead with their lives in some way, and that comparison only adds to my frustration.

It feels like I’m just sitting here doing nothing while the world moves forward — and it’s deeply frustrating. I haven’t felt motivated to study at all; in fact, I haven’t opened a single book this entire month.

1jy0n5i,SWE - Got two job offers. How to navigate this?,"I’m a Junior Software Engineer and I’ve got two offers to move up to Professional and need help navigating this decision.

I’ve been a junior in my team in a large company for about 2.5 years and six months ago I applied to be promoted to Professional but got denied due to budget constraints. They said they’re very happy with my performance and I got a glowing review from a principal engineer in my team to help my progression. I got very disappointed and started applying for Pro positions within my company and got an interview but no offer. They said I didn’t have the experience in a specific field they wanted. 

Anyway, time went on and then a colleague of mine quit and my current boss came to me and encouraged me to apply for his vacancy which would be a professional title hinting at that it would be a done deal. 

Before any of this is signed off the manager of the job I was interviewing contacted me and offered me the position because they hadn’t been able to find anyone.

So what do I do? I’m leaning towards switching teams because that position would be more future proof but it would probably mean a pay cut compared to staying on my current one because there’s an oncall clause in the contract which means more pay.

1jy0fl5,Do I Need to Pivot?,"I’m (21f) and I just graduated university with a business degree. My first internship was last summer as a procurement intern where I handled supplier outreach and onboarding for multiple procurement projects, managed RFPs/RFQs, collected product and pricing info directly from vendors, and did market research on industry trends and raw materials to help guide sourcing decisions.

I worked at a mid-sized baking company that got acquired by a giant company while I was interning there. I was working for the candy category.

My entire procurement team (except for 1-2 indirect members) was always working overtime. And it’s not even about overtime, they were STRESSED and always on the go. My manager would work til 6pm or even 3am. Every time she hopped on Teams with me, she looked so disheveled and stressed. 1 month into my internship, I was also being overworked.

I kinda like procurement because there is always something to do. However, I fear there is just TOO much to do. I understand that ingredients/food industry for procurement is very stressful. I searched around for other industries and while some of them are a bit more laidback, I feel I would get bored because there aren’t as many market changes or events happening like in the food industry.

That’s all the input I have from my 4 month long procurement experience. I’d like to have a role where I am important but without the high stakes so I’m not stressed. I know procurement is super high stakes because you’re dealing with money and tight deadlines and all. Hence, I wanted to ask… is procurement just always stressful?

Is it better that I find another role/industry if I want a more chill job?

4.5 years > 6 months > 9+ months

I recently got an offer for an entry-level position, and while I’m excited, I’m also a bit unsure because I never actually spoke to my direct manager during the hiring process.

Here’s what happened:
I applied for a role that’s regularly hired across different teams. I interviewed with two people (let’s call them A and B) from Team 1, but got a rejection a week later. Then, a week after that, the recruiter called me and said A and B had given good feedback—they liked me but were looking for something else.

Turns out, Team 2 had an opening for the same role. They discussed my interview feedback internally, and based on that, my future manager (let’s call them C) decided to bring me on board. So, I’ve been hired, but I’ve never actually talked to C.

Now I’m wondering:

1. What should I do in the first few weeks to build a good relationship with my manager?

2. How can I understand their expectations when we’ve never met?

3. Any tips on how to start strong in a new team?

Worked 10+ years within a photo studio for a retail (worked my way up from the bottom and left as a manager) After a few drastic company changes I decided it was best to exit and was able to get some remote work quickly still within the imaging and retail umbrella. Unfortunately this was at a time when the digital retail roles were hit hard with layoffs and as a new person I was let go. Since then I’ve been able to acquire remote temp work in non related fields (healthcare and claims). I’ve had the hardest time trying to re-enter the digital retail world. I’m discouraged that my application reads with these new unrelated roles first and people don’t read through that I’ve had 10 years in the field. 

I’ve researched companies and roles on LinkedIn and have tried reaching out to recruiters when I can track them down. I’ve remade my resume. 

Does anyone have experience in breaking through to roles in which your most recent experience may not apply? What do you recommend to stand out on these applications? 

Thanks everyone! ",fishonmyside,1,1.0,4,1744514876,2025-04-13 03:27:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxylny/how_to_reenter_a_field_after_you_left/,4,2025
1jxylbh,Fresh Grad Mechanical Engineer – Can I Still Work Offshore If I Start in a Mill?,"Hi everyone, I’m a fresh graduate in mechanical engineering and my goal is to eventually work offshore, ideally in the oil & gas industry. Since I don’t have any experience yet, my initial plan was to join a contractor company to gain onshore experience and later transition to offshore roles.

However, it’s been really tough to get a job in that direction.

Recently, I got a job offer to work at a mill plantation. I’m considering accepting it because the company provides certifications like Steam Engineer, which I know are useful.

But I’m wondering:
	•	Are the operations in a mill similar to those in oil & gas refineries?
	•	Will mill experience be relevant enough to help me transition to offshore jobs in the future?
	•	Is it still realistic to pursue offshore work later on with this background?",Mundane_List_2492,2,1.0,1,1744514840,2025-04-13 03:27:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxylbh/fresh_grad_mechanical_engineer_can_i_still_work/,4,2025
1jxy0vw,How to respond to coworker gossiping about you?,"Hello. I’m in need of some advice. A coworker has it really in for me. He’s been talking behind my back. It’s not completely false, but he is twisting my intent and words. 

For example, I told our small team of 6 people that we should show initiative and make an improvement in our work process ourselves. I mentioned that it’s better for our job security that our team works on improving our own process, compared letting another team take it over.

My coworker, who is part of our small team, then told another team that I said that they are trying to get us fired. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. I don’t think the other teams are trying to get us fired. They are good people and wouldn’t do that. I just really thought it would be better for our team to do it ourselves as it is our team’s work process. I don’t want us to be seen incompetent either.

Did I mess up here? 

How do I defend myself professionally? Will people, generally speaking, listen to his gossip about me and think poorly of me, or would they think poorly of the person gossiping in the first place?

1jxw7zw,Promotion announced company wide but actual promotion is 6 months away,"I have been placed in a rather awkward position by my boss (Senior Management position) and am lost as to what to do.

Quick backstory: I have been the pseudo leader of my department for a few years to the point every one in the company comes directly to me for questions regarding the department. I have been focusing on larger multi departmental projects the past year and we recently had a reporting restructure to reflect that where I report directly to senior management. I like my job a lot, love my colleagues, enjoy the anonymity and flexibility, and love having my boss and his boss pull me up through the ranks to better utilize my skillset.

I have a promised promotion this year (boss has always been good with his promises before), but recently my company newsletter came out stating I had been promoted to this role already. I have received a lot of congratulations, and thought that my boss had just moved up the timeline and the paperwork would be on its way shortly. So I went ahead and got on a call with him to talk about it and here is what he had to say.

Promotion timeline is closer to the end of the year.
The announcement was a way to get people to stop coming to you over the old department matters so you can focus of the larger projects. 
I asked this directly and he confirmed, the promotion timeline for later is to get a larger overall raise as it'll come after the yearly merit raise.

All the reasons are fine and dandy, and I was completely content doing the project management stuff without the title for a while before all this. But now I'm left either backing up his facade publically (I hate lying so it bothers me greatly to just go along with it) or tell people it hasn't actually happened yet and deal with negative public appearances for both of us, damaging my relationship with him.

So in the end I feel forced to lie to everyone, act like I got a big promotion and raise, but don't actually have anything to show for it. 

Would love this subs words of wisdom.",Dragonkindren1,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1744506636,2025-04-13 01:10:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxw7zw/promotion_announced_company_wide_but_actual/,4,2025
1jxw61z,Just found out I'm going to most likely be laid off in 18 days after looking at CFO's calendar...what should I be doing now?,"Alright this is nuts but my startup company is like evil incarnate the past 5 years and I've always spied on our CFO's Google calendar to try to get any idea about what's going on. He's the only one in our management team with a public calendar. But usually I can't tell much what's going on, other than seeing investor meetings or when something bad might be happening in general. Our past 3 RIFs, which I survived but were awful and always heavily affecting my team, still always managed to take me by surprise with their swiftness. 

Well this morning, Saturday no less, the CFO writes me asking if I can send him some figures for a meeting. I naturally check his calendar to see what this was about afterwards, and there's he has an invite for an investor call that includes an entire email chain in the meeting invite. It's a cold evil discussion about 3 options for most of my department: how my team will either be transferred to a foreign company partner if they want to take us basically (I think the chances of this are nil), transferred to a government grant I'm currently writing that we probably have a 30% chance of getting and wouldn't be awarded until September, plus current admin and I think it's extra unlikely to get it, so I don't get how that even makes sense, or RIF'd. 

Worse, I think my immediate supervisor, who is a VP not in the management team, knows about all of this. He asked us for our bios on Friday to try to sell our capabilities to the foreign partner company. I also just received award notice a week ago for a large federal grant as PI and my company as the prime organization (there are subawardees we would distribute funds to). It was supposed to be announced in our All Hands meeting on Thursday, but they pulled the rug on it without even telling me with no mention. I wrote the guy who makes the all hands slides and he told me the CEO said it's ""not finalized"" yet and asked him to pull it out last minute. I was so angry and asked my boss what's going on and if there's something I don't know. He genuinely seemed surprised and concerned that they didn't mention it, but no one is telling me a damn thing still since Thursday. So now that all makes freaking sense. Neither of these grants cover my salary by the way, I only have like 10% of my time on each (I'm a Director), but team members under me who would've actually done the work were on there for up to 100%. 

So I think the by far most likely scenario is that me, everyone in my team that I lead, a whole other team, and part of another team are getting axed in 18 days. Should I talk to my supervisor about what I found out? I already messaged him saying I found out something concerning, think he knows about it, and asking if we can talk this weekend or Monday. He hasn't read the message yet - I could pull it. 

What the hell else should I do, other than job searching? (my husband is not paid enough for us to live in this area on his salary alone, but he has a job opportunity right now that will increase his pay so we might need to move for that now...I really don't want to move there though). I'm thinking to take some PTO, and come up with excuses to delay starting some experiments that would be going beyond our expiration dates. Getting all the useful info, contacts, etc from my work computer that I can take with me, and cleaning it up. Maybe WFH more than usual because I don't know how I can face everyone constantly, knowing what I now know. Any other ideas?

Btw, its ticketing services po at app testing & documentation (may ambag ako kahit iba ang job description ko hahaha)

Then, nasanay na ako sa remote setup kaya nagself study din ako ng ibang niche like SEO, SMM, Shopify.

Ok fast forward and I for a new boss and he didn’t like me at all from the get go and he let me go out of the blue to hire someone in his network. Ok I’m still pretty salty but I had some connections and I got an interview for a really great position and I spoke with the CEO, a consultant, a dept head and the CTO. Now this role is a bit of a stretch for me but I was honest and did well in the interviews and last week on Wed I had my last interview and had to submit a 60 plan for what I will do to make an impact in the first 60 days.

1jxs8gi,PM vs PMM Career Focus — Need Advice as an Intl MBA Student (Graduating May 2026),"Hi folks!

I’m an international MBA student in the U.S. with upcoming summer internship in product marketing. I’ve led PMM work in South Asia (telecom, AI bots, GTM campaigns) and have really enjoyed working alongside PMs—enough to consider making the switch. I’m now trying to figure out where to focus my limited time and energy. The job market is ridiculous now. Wondering if it is even feasible to land PM roles in this market without a technical background or direct PM experience.

# 

# My situation:

* **Graduating May 2026**, targeting **September 2025 hiring rounds**
* **International student** (F1 visa): I have **90 days post-grad to land a job** or leave the U.S.
* My priority is to **secure ""any relevant job""**—title is secondary to staying employed and on a visa.
* Can commit **\~2 hour/day** for prep
* Using **Exponent** for interview prep, but it’s overwhelming to prioritize
* Open to **side projects or certifications**, but only if **truly valued by hiring managers**

# 

# The fork in the road:

**🅰️ Option A: Product Marketing (PMM**)

* Strengthen my PMM portfolio for the U.S. market
* Focus on landing a PMM job, then explore a future switch to PM

**🅱️ Option B: Product Management (PM**)

* Start PM prep now: Exponent, roadmapping, side project/MVP
* Apply to PM roles this fall, fall back to PMM if needed

# 

# What I’m looking for:

1. Which path (PMM → PM or direct PM) gives me **better odds** under my current constraints?
2. Any **PM or AI-related certifications** that are actually **recognized in interviews**? (not just pretty badges)
3. How helpful is a **side project/product** in PM recruiting if I’m not technical?
4. For folks who moved from PMM to PM — what helped you **position yourself credibly**?
5. How would you structure **1 hour/day** for maximum ROI in either direction?

I’d love your thoughts, frameworks, or even cautionary tales. I’m not fixated on a title—I just want to make **informed moves** so I can land a job, stay in the U.S., and eventually build a career.

1jxs4us,Am I being too paranoid about getting fired?,"I know people have posted things on here before feeling the same way I am feeling right now. Basically to be succinct, they put me on one of the biggest account and the account is huge with a ton of solutions. The org was undergoing transformation, and all I can say is that it's a hot mess. And there things started to fall thru the cracks. The client escalated things and my boss moved me off that portion of the business.  That's strike one. Though my boss did acknowledge that my assignments were a lot. 

Strike two was last week, when the EVP of the client said a few associates flagged some things related to my performance where it took awhile to get something done. This was on me. Again, the length of time to get something was resolved was out of my control. I could have done a better job emailing saying there were no updates to an update :P. 

  
I schedule a call with my boss Friday and asked if everything was ok, and he gave me the run down and told me he's moving me off all of the business of said company and they will be transitioning it to someone else on my team. I straight out asked him if I'm going to be let go, and he said no ( I  mean legally speaking he can't tell me if he is, so his no could be a yes or a no). I asked him to be honest and asked if it looked bad on me, and he said yes. My boss said he'd move some accounts around so that I can build my way back up or maybe explore other options that maybe I am better suited for. I also noticed that he was giving my colleagues high profile topics to be SME and giving me the bottom of the barrel topics. 

  
Then as a side note, we all had a dinner with our SVP and the SVP said hi to everyone EXCEPT me which was blatant. Don't know if I'm reading too much into it.

Wisdom of personal opinions would be much appreciated.

I’m preparing my small behavioral health facility for a Joint Commission survey, and it feels like a huge challenge. I’m ADHD, organization isn’t my strength, and most of the responsibility falls on me. There are hundreds of standards across 15 chapters that I need to:

1. Determine if we meet the criteria
2. Implement any necessary changes
3. Collect and analyze data

1jxr0ss,"Sr. AI Product Manager at Salt Lake City, or Contract Product Owner at Boston?","Hi, I recently received 2 offers and I'm debating which to take. What do you guys think? I'm a single 35M living in Boston.

Offer 1: Sr. AI Product Manager at a mid-sized company in a niche market. The company culture looks great, but it's a fully onsite role. The company is based in Salt Lake City so I'll need to relocate from Boston. I don't know anyone there. I have friends in LA/SF but they still 2 hours flight away.

Offer 2: Contract product owner at a big healthcare company focusing on data. The work will be challenging but I can probably learn a lot. It's fully remote so no need to relocate. And the role will not convert to full time, best case scenario they just extend the contract on a yearly basis.

Pay wise, the base salaries are the same in numbers. But since offer 2 is contract only, it takes a discount in the total compensation. Also Salt Lake City is way cheaper than Boston. Total compensation wise the difference is probably 30% or even more.

So, which would you take? A less stable role at a big name company where you could learn a lot, or a more stable role at a smaller company with a good job title and better pay? Would a contract role give me a leg up in applying for FT position? Thanks for the advice!

1jxq9ns,Fired twice in the past two years during first 90 days,"Hi everyone. I’m feeling very defeated and I just need some advice. I moved to a new state in 2023. In the previous state I had lived in I was never fired from any job. Fast forward to my first job, it was at a restaurant. I was fired after one month of working there due to continuous mistakes. After this I picked myself up and found a great job that I stayed at for a while. It was part time though, so it wasn’t paying the bills. Then, I got a full time job and left that previous one on good terms. This job was an office admin job that paid more and was full time. I thought everything had finally fallen into place for me. This job had me doing all sorts of things. I cleaned, I did billing, shipping/receiving, etc. It was a whole new world for me and I tried my best. I asked questions, I took notes, I kept a binder with all of my training and also had an email folder of training notes. But again, I was fired 2.5 months later for the same thing: mistakes. When I asked them to give me an example, however, they were mistakes that I had only made once and corrected or things that were completely out of my control. What I’m trying to figure out is….is it me? Is there something about my personality that doesn’t click? Am I just finding toxic workplaces? I’m just trying to do some self reflection because this can’t keep happening to me. 

Edit: I want to add that I never called in sick, was late, or argued with anyone either during both these jobs. I showed up on time to work and learn with a positive attitude.

1jxp645,3 months into an internship & I have a feeling they are going to fire me,"so, I've been working as an intern at this organization for 3 months now, and I've always had a feeling that my manager did not like me (even though, she hired me). She's very passive-aggressive and talks to me in a condescending tone as if I'm a child or stupid. However, I haven't really done anything about it because its a summer internship and I figured I can just put up with it until its done. BUT, the other day, I hoped on a call that I thought was going to be just between her and I (a weekly check in sort of thing), and the HR guy was there. They were basically giving me tons of negative feedback, claiming that i am not communicative and that they question my motivation. I explained that I am still interested in the internship and that I do my best to ask as many questions as possible (even though every time that I do, I am told that I should know this stuff already). They said they would be sending me an email with their expectations. Where do i go from here?

1jxoi8q,Can I wear the same outfit to work everyday? I plan to dress like Makima from Chainsaw Man and call it a day.,"I’m starting a new job soon. I’m going to be joining the tech team for a really big international law firm. I plan on buying 5 white button downs, some black slacks with pockets, and a black tie. Google Makima and you’ll see the exact outfit I’m thinking of. I want to wear the outfit 5 days a week but I don’t know if it’d be acceptable. 

For context I’m a young female & I think I’m considered very? attractive from what I’ve gathered over the years. I really don’t want to attract unwanted attention in the office. And I don’t want to spend money on “office” clothes for several reasons. I have limited closet space. I have a shit ton of clothes already, none of which are office appropriate—think parties & raves. I want to save money too. I don’t want to buy work clothes just for work, especially when I hate the work clothes that are meant for women. Blouses, dresses, skirts that go below the knee, YUCK. I just want to go to work, work, and leave. 

Anyways, how will this play out? Does anyone else wear the same thing to work everyday in an office setting? Will this do badly for office politics?

1jxnkd9,My non-conventional advice for an IT Career,"Hello CareerAdvice!

I would like to write out some advice myself, and hope some of it helps someone out there.

I am very non-conventional, and certainly this advice will not apply to everyone. 

  
Background:  
I am a college dropout (gasp!) who has held Director level positions and many sysadmin positions in IT. I have many, many certs, and have specialized many times throughout my career. Lately, I have performed hiring duties, usually on small teams, for specialized roles.  
  
In total, I have followed the path from Helpdesk > Networking grunt > Sysadmin (2) > Director (2). This has mostly been in the public sector, and do not have much experience going for positions at Google, Apple, etc.

  
I hope my comments are helpful, but at the same time I guarantee they will not apply to everyone.  


**AI:**  
Lately, I have reviewed so many applications that blatantly use AI Copy and Paste. These are very easy to see, and are immediately thrown away. I absolutely recommend using AI to prepare for Application or interview questions, etc. But Copy and Paste will get you blacklisted very easily. If you are blindly copy pasting AI Generated answers to a potential job, what will you do to our customers and vendors?  


**Length of Resume:**  
I have a very controversial opinion apparently. Resumes should be longer than 1 page.  
So many resumes I review lately have no certifications, no trainings, and only focus on the degree and skills.

When reviewing these resumes to offer a follow up interview, the more information the better. I personally review all resumes since my teams are small, and the positions are highly specialized. I understand some bigger companies will receive 500+ resumes for one position, and this isn't possible.

  
**Training:**  
If you list SQL as a skill on your resume, I would expect you to be competent in it. If you are applying for a SQL role and took a Udemy course on SQL, that's great! But so many resumes lately don't even show that. I have to find their linked in to see any trainings they have been working on. Listing it in the resume and application would do wonders for those people, but they can use it daily in their current role, but haven't listed it anywhere for me to see that, and show no training on it either.

If you have any other training or are working toward Certifications as well, that is great to see, and gets me excited to help you keep pushing forward in those areas.

  
**Degree and Certs**  
In my role, I have the freedom to value Degrees and Certs as i see fit for the role. Personally, I don't care if you have a bachelors in Computer Engineering, or any degrees at all. In my experience, many out of college grads I have worked with have not been prepared to work in an enterprise setting, and simply cannot adjust without an entry level position. Many positions Require a degree (Or equivalent experience) on paper, but I will make the argument anyone (degree or not) that is coming from an entry level sysadmin position into ours, is way more prepared than a college graduate.

This goes one step further with Certs. It is simple, If i have 2 exact resumes with exact experience and one has a CCNA, and the other doesn't, on paper that person gets ranked higher.   


**Job Hopping**  
If your Job history shows several <6 month full time positions, that would be concerning. Hiring is an immense effort. 1 Month of applications and getting you hired. 2-4 weeks of simply getting you caught up with access and documentation, and then committing to larger initiatives and projects, it is simply too damaging to hire someone that will jump ship in 3-6 months, and the process resets.   


Length of Positions, or good references will help show you are reliable and are willing to stay a bit.

  
**Following up after application or Interview**  
To be completely honest, I find this annoying. If you applied, you are already on the list. If you got an interview, you are already on the list. If you follow up, I don't want to ignore you, but at the same time I don't want to be selective and engage. If you are following up to provide verification of things we discussed and perhaps asked for, sure. But personally I don't like when people follow up.



**Workers Rights**  
This is truly disheartening to me. I see other managers, HR, etc and how they treat employees. Hey, I am an employee, I have been entry level, grunt work, etc.

You do not have to put up with abuse for a good title or paycheck. Golden Handcuffs are real, but you still have rights.

I am talking about rejecting vacations, call ins during sick time, selective enforcement of  procedures, workplace/sexual/racial harassment, Not paying overtime, etc. I have seen so much of all this, and was exposed to it early on in my career without thinking anything of it. Like this is a normal way to abuse employees. As I entered Management, I started to understand workers rights much better.

Employers will try to get away with everything. HR will not look out for you. Likely your manager will not look out for you. Only you can educate yourself, familiarize yourself with the employee handbook, and local laws, and **Document Everything**.

  
Final thoughts: I have only hired the last few years and not applied. I read and see how bad things are. It breaks my heart. Employers not replying or even rejecting applicants is dumb. Anyone expected to go 3, 4, 5 interviews is out of their mind as well. 

Many hiring processes are truly heartless, but there are some that take interest, and seriously want to find the right candidate, and build the best team.  


I have lots more to say, but just felt like writing some stuff out.

I hope this helps!",Every-Ad-5267,2,1.0,2,1744481516,2025-04-12 18:11:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxnkd9/my_nonconventional_advice_for_an_it_career/,4,2025

1jxmgk5,Compensation Negotiations,"Hi all! 

I am currently an Account Executive for a SaaS company and am interviewing at other startup style companies, as I have been with my company for 3+ years and feel it’s time for a change. I found company I really like and just finished the interview process. I expect to receive an offer from them next week.

With that being said, I may have sold myself a little short in the introductory interview. When discussing compensation I got a bit nervous and said I wouldn’t accept a position with less than $70,000 base salary (my current company is closer to 55,000). On target earnings are double salary at this start up, so roughly $140,000. After checking back into the original job posting, I discovered that they actually have the base salary listed at $90,000 and on target earnings being $170,000, as well as listing equity opportunities. When I get the offer, assuming it’s going to be that 70,000 base 140,000 OTE that I mentioned was acceptable, how should I go about negotiating for what’s listed (or higher?). Is it too late?

1jxler4,PIP after being hired 8 months ago,"I apologize for the vagueness, but I don't want to give too many details.   
  
I was hired into a management position where the situation was chaotic from the beginning. Training consisted of being told to just watch and observe and not do anything, only to having tasks delegated to my desk immediately after. The other manager I am technically under does not answer questions, but will complain if I make a mistake and didn't ask about how to do something properly. When I do ask questions, the answer is ""why don't you know this already."" 

The relationship started out good, even friendly, but has soured over time and I was put on PIP for performance issues for careless mistakes. The PIP is vague, has only specific mark ups of the incidents that occurred (nothing that effected clients, and were caught before they became significant. For example, missing a deadline for pricing when there was a miscommunication - from my boss - what they wanted. The issue was fixed with a new deadline, but was considered late. Since then, the pricing changes have not even been implemented.   
  
Another example: I messaged a client use of a room that did not have one element necessary in it and, before the order was finalized within the deadline of review, messaged them alternatives with an apology, which was fine and went smoothly after confirmed. I was told that issue should have never happened. However, my boss has made mistakes like this or similar over the course of my time and it was brushed off.)

When we have PIP meetings, my manager puts his complaints in the wrong column of the PIP, where he's supposed to put my progress or how I addressed the issue, and has not put any improvements at all. There are also no specifics to address performance, they feel general and basically like ""you should know this, this shouldn't be an issue."" It's a 45 day plan, and although I've put in the work and have improved - and again, I'm dealing with hundreds of clients a day and the complaints from my manager (not from clients) adds up to 10 total mistakes over 8 months that were quickly resolved - I feel like there is an intention to get rid of me right after being hired. 

The main issue is that, these careless mistakes were taught or not trained to avoid and I'm wondering if I have a chance of arguing poor training practices vs. poor performance. Is it worth it? Or should I be going into the trenches again? In every other way in this job I am thriving and receive compliments. There have been 0 complaints from clients or VIPs. The only write ups are these mistakes that, granted, would be easier to avoid if things were standardized, but they insist I should just know these things off the top of my head already. There are thousands of little details to know and I am the only one who hasn't worked there for years. I spent a few weeks trying to show my manager that I am in this wholeheartedly, but even after my efforts I am now starting to realize whatever I do to improve might not matter anymore. 

Is this a situation to fight for? To give up on? To be honest, this is my first time working in corporate and I am just starting to understand that a PIP is mainly a way to get rid of me, but we've had conversations where my boss has said they still feel I'm the right person for this job. I feel confused and not sure what to do.

1jxl5ut,"For anyone who finally broke through the recruitment cycle, what helped you the most?","Hi everyone,

I’m a recent grad currently going through a really tough job search. I did my bachelor’s and master’s degrees back to back, and now I’m out of college for the first time. I studied my masters at an Ivy League school, if that even matters, and I’m looking for analyst roles or product management opportunities.

I’m also on a visa in the U.S., which makes things even more stressful. I’ve applied to so many jobs, reworked my resume, tried networking, and recently joined a startup in an unpaid role just to keep my visa active. The work is not very visible or impactful, so I constantly question whether it is even helping.

Right now, I feel stuck and have breakdowns almost every day wondering what else I can do differently.

Some things I’m considering:  
• Should I stay longer at the startup to build up more experience even if the work is not that impressive?  
• Should I invest time and money in a certification like risk analysis or business analytics even though I’m not sure it will make a difference?  
• Are there other entry-level roles that pay well and do not require heavy coding that I should be looking into?

I have a mix of tech and business in my background, so I’m open to roles in both areas. I just do not want to go into core coding jobs. I have put my product dream on pause for now and just want to get my foot in the door with something that works with my background and visa situation.

If anyone has been in a similar position, especially on a visa, I would really appreciate hearing what kind of role you landed and what helped you break through.

1jxkrdl,Targeted by co worker during probation,"I started a new job about 7 weeks ago as a Marketing strategist for a university. My main responsibilities include setting up ad campaigns, increasing enrolment, improving awareness, and developing a marketing strategy. I’m still within my 90-day probation period, and I’ve been doing my best to get up to speed—setting up paid ads, analyzing performance, attending meetings, brainstorming ideas, helping in areas where I can, and starting to build a long-term enrolment strategy.

However, I’m having issues with one coworker who’s been in the department for a few years and works in a more tactical marketing coordinator role. She’s been cold and harsh with me from the beginning—frequently talking down to me in meetings, pointing out minor mistakes in front of others, and generally acting dismissive. I’ve tried to stay professional, but it’s been difficult to build a positive working relationship. It’s clear she does not like me.

What’s concerning is that she went to the manager and pointed out some small errors I made. It felt like she was trying to make me look incompetent behind my back. I haven’t received any feedback from my manager yet, but now I’m feeling anxious that I might be pulled into a performance convo—or worse, let go—based on her perspective.

I know I’m still new and learning, and I definitely have areas to improve, but I’m trying. I haven’t been disengaged, and I’m genuinely committed to doing well in this role. Has anyone else experienced this type of dynamic with a coworker during probation? Am I over reacting or is there a high chance they will let me go? 

The university is struggling with getting students in, and even though I haven’t received any negative feedback yet, they could use the “funding” excuse to boot me out.

1jxj98f,How did you leave the 9–5 and build a more flexible life with passive income? Looking for paths that work with chronic health issues + creative goals,"I’m 24, recently graduated in graphic design and currently doing a 6 month internship — but I’m realizing the 9–5 (or in my case, 9.5 hour days) just isn’t sustainable for me. I feel like I'm running out of time and energy to build something to get out of having to work , and just stuck in limbo surviving and counting down the days till it's over.

I just started working in UAE and the working hours are 48 hours MINIMUM. If I were to get a full time role later one it does not seem sustainable , despite me not having to pay rental costs because of family being here.

I do want to go back the Sydney where I was before or elsewhere, but the rental costs seem like too much.   
  
Singapore or Dubai is an option but I don't really like it here, the environment and work culture. The only thing good about it is just free rental, and being with family sometimes (although it sometimes causes more conflict).

I live with chronic health conditions (including tension/pain, gut issues, anxiety).  I’ve been pushing through, and want to do more but the truth is, it’s making me feel worse — physically and mentally.

To be honest I dont feel like working because Im constantly dealing with being more prone to burnout and mental and physical health issues, I feel like I'm surviving now.

I'm aiming for a lifestyle that’s more flexible, healing, and meaningful: something that blends creativity, nature, and helping others. I’m drawn to things like:

* Freelance and small creative business (illustration, stationery, comics, content creation).
* Things of interest such as fine arts, storytelling, interior design/ set design, architecture, creating stories/concepts for animations/ comics/ short film, games, film (directing, concept, writing and cinematography), photography, event, exhibition design, experimental marketing. Creating a indie story game, things that allow me to express myself and my unique ideas and world building...   
* Living closer to nature or even hobby homesteading one day.
* I love to travel and want to learn more and work with nature, maybe even conservation (but I think that makes no money) and I need to have better health first to constantly travel.
* Hosting art/wellness workshops or community-based projects
* Eventually having passive income (e.g. rentals, digital products) to take financial pressure off my health

But I’m stuck on how to realistically get there while being able to heal and manage my wellbeing. This hustle culture is not working for me. I am not rich.

One of my parents helps me a little financially right now, but they’re also emotionally abusive and unpredictable. It’s made my health worse, and I feel this huge pressure to become financially free ASAP so I can finally be safe, stable, and heal.

So I’d love to hear from anyone who’s managed to break out of the 9–5 and build a flexible or passive-income lifestyle — especially if you:

* Started with low capital
* Have chronic health conditions or mental health struggles
* Wanted to pursue creativity, wellness, or community work
* Had to step away from the workforce — and later returned

**My questions:**

1. How did you transition out of corporate work? Or find good companies with remote/ hybrid or flexibility?
2. What was your timeline, and how did you make it financially sustainable?
3. Is it realistic to return to a job if things don’t work out — or does a resume gap ruin your chances?
4. What are the easiest passive income ideas for someone with low funds and limited energy?

Any kind advice, stories, or support would be greatly appreciated. Please be kind — if you’re going to call me lazy or spoiled, just scroll past. I’ve been through enough and I’m really trying my best.

I know some people will be like ""nobody wants to work these days"" But to be honest who does? If I could I would be travelling the world and volunteering,  being more in nature, learning other creative degrees in university, doing arts, helping build communities. But I need income.

1jxj7qn,"Desire to pursue a career in mechanical, electrical, or software engineering?","[28M] I want some guidance here. So lately, I’ve been struggling to settle into a stable job. Heck, I’ve wasted most of my 20s making poor decisions career-wise. I’ve been jumping job to job, mainly working in warehouse and driving (also tried sales and customer service). I’m tired of working in a dreading labor job for a crappy paycheck. So, I recently worked in an aerospace company as a packager, and I’ve seen how the people in the office would work on certain parts through the computer. And it honestly attracted me because of all the numbers and charts.

Get this, I’m very good with computer, also can type 75-WPM. I’ve always been a “numbers” person, and I’m very introverted. In high school, I’ve always loved math. I was very good at it. I started my freshman year in Algebra I (I wasn’t the brightest student before high school). But after 9th grade, I decided to challenge myself by taking Honors & AP courses, and I succeeded in them. And in my junior year, I wanted to take Calculus the following year, but I needed to take Math Analysis first beforehand. So, I took a Pre-Calculus course in college during that following summer (I got an A- in that class), and took the chance to take Calculus my senior year (“Stand and Deliver” movie inspired me lol). 

I’ve always loved school, but when I got to college, I dropped out the very first year because I wanted to make money instead. And from there, I made very poor decisions, quitting job after job, and not lasting one for at least 6 months. I’m glad I’m not depressed and insecure like I used to be, but I do feel the urge to go back to school. Throughout the 20s, I would think college was a “scam”, because I got so brainwashed by so-called entrepreneurs (I blame the fake world of social media) thinking I don’t need school and that I could “work for myself”, without any real-life practical guidance. 

Once I started working at that aerospace job and seeing how the inspectors and engineers would work on the parts through the screen, it reminded me of my love for math, especially geometry and trigonometry. So, I want you guys to tell me if I should go back to school to pursue an engineering major, and to get myself plugged into an internship. And please give me a good reason why to pursue it because it honestly sounds intimidating to go back knowing I’ll be turning 30 soon. Also because I recently dropped ridiculous money on a vocational school as a medical assistant student (my gf pressured me to go and I know, I was not very confident back then). Please let me know and correct me if I’m wrong on what I’m expressing. Thanks so much!!!!",Gfunk714,2,1.0,1,1744470002,2025-04-12 15:00:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxj7qn/desire_to_pursue_a_career_in_mechanical/,4,2025

1jxigsz,CAREER CONUNDRUM PLEASE HELP,"I'm currently active duty navy with a wife and two young ones. This summer I'll be finishing my bachelors in psych online through liberty. Then I want to start a MSW program the falling fall semester through a different college. However, I'm also applying to this MSW program through the Army at UOK (Kentucky U). If accepted I would become an Army officer and move to Texas with the fam and start the program. Fully paid for including clinical hours and I'd be making military officer salary the whole time. I don't mind the commitment years because I'd more than likely make it a career. 

The conundrum is that I'd have to wait until February of 2026 to find out if I get accepted or not. So I'm inclined to start a MSW program on the side just incase I don't get picked up. This way I do not miss out on potential 1-2 years of work I could have been doing in the meantime. Also, my contract ends in the summer of 2028. So if I don't get accepted before 2028, the goal would be to finish my MSW with a different college get licensed and then do my clinical hours with a good salary on the outside. But if I do get picked up regardless on whatever attempt (for the army program) I feel like I'd be wasting my GI Bill, time, and etc. 

Tuition wouldn't be a problem because of TA and GI Bill. I'm just in search for some wisdom and advice to see what the best decision is. Please help!

I’m here to share a little bit about my journey and open to any advice from anyone as well.

I was completely lost in life after my business went to shit and I lost all motivation to do anything in life. I got into gambling (big debts) and I’ve essentially lost 2 1/2 years of my life just doing nothing but wallowing.

Fast forward to now, I received an opportunity from my friend who’s a PM for a marketing agency and he offered me a referral link telling me to apply. I didnt have any qualifications at first, nor do I have a college degree. However, through researching  Reddit, I’ve found out about the CAPM and it helped me land the job.

The job was a contracting gig with potential be a full time employee. Two weeks ago, I had a conversation w/ my supervisors and I officially have a FTE. 

I’m officially a project coordinator with hopes to be a PM eventually ( I was told it would take potentially 18 months or less).

Anyway, does anyone have any career tips or advice for me? This is my first time in a real coporate world, so I’m curious. Also, once I become a PM, is it easier to transition to other careers (Tech, Construction, etc)

The company I work for now specializes in pharma/consumer brands and I’m fully remote as well.

1jxgxq9,Urgent help,"
Hi everyone,
I am from India, and today I want to share something that has been hurting me. I took three drops for NEET, but I didn't get selected. I've never been a topper. In my 12th grade, I scored 86%, and at that time, many of my friends took a drop for NEET. In FOMO, I also decided to take a drop.
In my first attempt, I didn’t get selected, and my ego was hurt. So, I decided to take another drop for the second attempt. In that attempt, my marks increased by 120, but I still didn’t get selected. I broke down again, and some of my friends convinced me to take a third drop. Even though my parents didn’t agree with the third drop, I still decided to go for it. After three months of preparation for my third attempt, I felt very saturated. I had no more interest in NEET and started looking for options abroad, but they were all very costly, and I come from a middle-class family, so I can't afford that.
Now, my last (third) attempt is on May 4, and I know I will likely fail because I didn’t prepare well. I am feeling depressed, confused, and frustrated. I feel like this is the end of my career, and I don't know what to do. Some of my friends who opted for college after 12th are graduating this year, while I am still just a 12th-grade pass. I am now 21 years old and still just a 12th pass, and I literally don't know what to do. I don't have an elder brother or sister to guide me. Now, I have to take admission in a bachelor's program, but I am very confused about which one to choose.
Please guide me. I don’t know what to do next.

My employer has agreed to let me work remotely part time as i pursue my education, it's beneficial for them because i can continue to work on on-going projects. And since i've been here for 2.5 years, I am familiar with the work, as opposed to having to train new full-time analysts and run the risk of making many mistakes. There's only 2 analysts on the team (myself included) and the other one is 3 months into the job, and to be honest i dislike working with him: he either ignores my questions or replies hours later so the times i get a chance to discuss work with him, it's usually at his terms, which can be frustrating. He still gets his work done at the end of the day, so i guess i can't complain.

I want to be able to afford my masters and cost of living without taking up a loan, and avoid a ""gap"" in my employment history, so it's in my interest to continue working as well. 

i'm likely to graduate in Fall 2026 amidst this economic uncertainty or recession. There's also no guarantee of a job for me full time at my current company once i'm done with my studies. Deferment is not an option, and i don't want to let this opportunity cost go to waste.

1jxeinl,Torn between returning to my previous job or staying in a struggling startup I co-founded with a close friend,"Hi, I’d really appreciate any outside perspectives. I’ve been sitting with this decision for weeks, and it’s taken a real toll on me mentally and emotionally. New account coz my friend knows my reddit account.

Earlier this year, I left my corporate job where I was working as an HR manager. I was burned out from long hours, endless projects, and leadership decisions I didn’t agree with. Around the same time, a close friend from high school invited me to co-found a virtual assistant business with him. I was already in a place where I needed a break from the corporate grind, and the idea of building something new with a long-time friend felt like a promising next step.

It’s now been about four months, and despite all the effort of doing cold outreach, shifting target industries, launching campaigns we haven’t landed a single client. We had two meetings early on, but they ghosted after the first call. Our latest campaign hasn’t gained traction either. I’ve been handling the operations side full-time, but it feels like we’re stuck in place.

One of the harder parts of this decision is the personal dynamic. My friend and I have never worked together professionally before. He's never worked in corporate and works in his family business. He works whenever he feels like it, often sending messages at 2 or 3 in the morning or on weekends and holidays. While he doesn’t expect immediate responses, just seeing work messages at all hours keeps my mind in work mode. I’ve found it really hard to mentally disconnect or rest.

I’ve also found myself feeling more like an assistant than a co-founder. I am to handle daily operations, HR, and finance but he asks me for reminders, notes, links from emails. While I expected to carry weight, I didn’t expect to feel like a support person instead of a true partner. He also relies heavily on AI tools for decision-making and often seems to trust those more than my input. It’s disheartening at times.

He’s optimistic (at least telling me he is) that we’ll land clients soon, and I know he believes in what we’re doing. But he also has a family business behind him, so the personal risk for him is much lower. For me, if this doesn’t work out, I’m the one with no fallback. I’ve been in that position before wherein I had a nearly two-year career gap (hello covid) before my last job, and I nearly ran through all my savings just trying to stay afloat. It was my old boss who gave me the break that got me back on track, and now she’s offering me another one and with better conditions.

My friend has been paying me a salary, but it’s around 40 percent less than what my former company is offering now that they’ve invited me to return. They’re also offering medical and life insurance for me and my mother, whom I support. On top of that, my former boss has promised more support this time, including hiring someone under me so I don’t burn out again. I left on good terms, and she’s made it clear she’d like me back, but I need to give her an answer soon, or the role will go to someone else.

So I’m torn between two choices:

* Stay and hope we finally gain traction but continue absorbing the career and financial risk with no guarantee of progress. I am afraid that by the time we decide to stop, I'd have a huge gap and have a hard time getting a new job.
* Go back to a more stable job, with better compensation and benefits, and step away from something I helped build with a friend I care about

If anyone has gone through something similar, or has thoughts from the outside looking in, I’d really appreciate your perspective.

1jxdsmg,"I messed up at work and the client was not happy. I feel incompetent and incapable, utterly disappointed in myself.","Hi all,

I recently made a series of mistakes on a work deliverable, some of which were basic (e.g., formatting and naming errors), and others were more technical (e.g., referencing outdated information, using the wrong numbers, etc.). While the overall outcome of the work wasn’t drastically affected, the number of small mistakes added up—and they were visible to the client.

The thing is, I’m not completely new to working life, but I’m still relatively new in this role and still learning the ropes. My manager had given me a fair bit of autonomy, and I think there was some trust that I could handle things independently. Now I feel like I’ve completely let them down.

I took responsibility, apologized, and said I’d fix the issues. My manager responded politely, but I can’t shake the feeling that they’re disappointed, and that the perception of my work quality has dropped. I’ve been beating myself up over it ever since—crying, feeling embarrassed, and honestly questioning my capability. I don’t understand how I didn’t catch the mistakes, even after reviewing the work multiple times.

I don’t want to make excuses, but I also wish I had been given a bit more support or a second set of eyes before things were sent out. I’m scared to ask for more guidance now, though, because I worry it’ll make me seem even more unreliable or less competent.

Have any of you been through something like this? How did you rebuild confidence and trust? I just really needed to get this off my chest—and would appreciate any advice or encouragement from those who’ve been there.

Thanks for reading.

1jxbesv,Going back to a job after a failed business.,"Around last November, I made a decision with my family to venture into a coffee franchise business. Truthfully, this was never part of my career or life goals. I majored in Economics and Finance, and I always aspired to work in investments or banking.

But during the final year of my degree, I hit a really low point. I couldn’t secure internships in finance, my grades were disappointing, and I felt like I was falling behind my peers. I was lost, demotivated, and started to believe I wasn’t good enough for the finance industry.

That’s when my mother introduced the idea of starting a coffee business. And honestly, I got pulled into the fantasy. I started consuming a lot of red-pill content that romanticized the “escape the 9-to-5” life. I kept feeding myself confirmation bias — telling myself I could earn more, have more freedom, and be my own boss. But the truth is... it was naive.

Fast forward 5 months into running the business, and it's been rough. We picked a terrible location with very little foot traffic. Sales are bad — so bad that we’re not even breaking even. I haven’t received a salary for months, and my savings are drying up. Ironically, I'm now working 9am–9pm every day — longer than a corporate job — just to keep things afloat, while my employee still gets paid and I get nothing.

The worst part? I'm not even learning valuable skills. Making drinks, handling cash, and managing daily operations isn't what I envisioned for myself. It’s work meant for employees, not for someone trying to build a long-term career. I feel stuck.

Looking back, I realize I only started this business because I didn’t want to be told what to do. I wanted time and location freedom — not realizing that without solid experience and skills, I had no foundation to stand on.

Now, I just want stability. I haven’t given up on my goal of working in finance. I want to pursue the CFA, but that requires money I currently don’t have. I’m thinking of getting a job — any job — to start earning again and to learn something real. I believe the business can still operate with just one employee for now.

I don’t even care about being rich anymore. I just want to stop bleeding financially, build a stable income, and slowly work toward what I *actually* want to do.

If anyone have been through something similar or have advice — whether career, finance, or life — I’d really appreciate hearing from you.",starking118,2,1.0,1,1744441099,2025-04-12 06:58:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxbesv/going_back_to_a_job_after_a_failed_business/,4,2025
1jxayhf,Risk and future careers,"So i quit my well paid job in October or November of 2023 and spent most of 2024 traveling. Tail end i got a job in NZ, shit pay, country is really expensive.

Fast-forward to 2025 i moved in with family and im applying for a visa to live in Spain without the right to work. Considering the economic situation and not working much, i cant actually afford this, but on paper i can so im moving forward with the move despite how stupid it might be.

Now, where i need advice. Im taking a huge risk moving and hoping i find a job that will get me a work visa once there. But, if i cant find a job i want to do a master's program. My bachelor's degree is in chemistry. My work experience is in polymer science. My dream is to become an archaeologist. But more realistically, i know that i should probably try to get an engineering degree. I found one in chemical engineering and environmental engineering that is of interest, and will probably come with more work opportunities. I could also go into materials science, since that's where my work experience is, but im undecided. And still have time to make a decision. My thought is, if im already taking so many risks and will definitely struggle with money, should i just take the extra risk of studying archaeology? In the end I'd have a master's i can leverage to possibly lead teams if cant find work as an archaeologist. Or should i go the safer route of engineering/materials science? Love and passion or money and security. I know that compared to other engineers im not as dedicated to work. I work to live, not live to work. That being said i know i can afford more fun as an engineer than as an archaeologist. But at least for archaeology I'm already interested in everything about it. 

 I'm also considering an engineering degree in renewable energy. since im not an electrical engineer already, it seems like there's no chance I can go down that path. So the dual degree of chemical and environmental is my closest option.

I kinda just want to hear how different people think, weigh pros and cons. Maybe something someone says will click.",germanus_away,2,1.0,1,1744439177,2025-04-12 06:26:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jxayhf/risk_and_future_careers/,4,2025
1jxaxu3,How do you factor in your country’s political future to your career plans?,"I'm in the US and I worry about our potential for rolling back so much of modern American life that I'm used to and have committed career planning to. 

I'm looking at grad school to pursue further nonprofit work. I currently have been working in nonprofit, building a career that has begun with 4 years of AmeriCorps VISTA service. 

I have many dream roles so switching dreams isn't the biggest issue. But school is a commitment to the future and I worry about what the US will look like in ~2-4 years.

As I plan in general for the future, I wonder if I should consider careers abroad and doing things to progress toward settling elsewhere. If things get worse here, I'd hate to have focused on school or career experience and not be prepared to leave or already be somewhere else. 

I want to make the most of time. I do believe the US has a great potential to take a drastic change for the worst (I've been reafinv different opinion blogs by historians and reflecting on what i know of history and geopolitics and I don't believe it's far fetched to consider a real 'fall of America' could happen sooner than 10 year time frame and even that timeframe is short enough to make me consider jumping ship. Of course we can only speculate and try to predict but if you have any reflective insight I'd love to hear. 

During 2020, i prevented my own homeless for many months by just by the skin of my teeth on a monthly basis by staying with friends, living in airbnb monthly rentals, and moving temporary homes almost every month. Before getting employed again and signing a lease, the longest I stayed somewhere the year prior was 3 months. Ever since, if I know I may need to move I either react with lots of anxiety and panic and depression from still being exhausted by all those moves, or I go into planning mode especially when I see that I have time to figure it out. Right now I'm in planning mode. I know in life we have to roll with the punches. Fellow Americans, historians, people with experience in this realm in any way...do you have any advice for future planning and decision making if a potential traumatic event out of our control could cause major disruptions to life and future planning? Or any markers of change I should be wary of to decide which decision I should make?

I’m interested in either Building Services/Planning or Finance. A role such as Rates Officer/Payroll etc or Planning Officer or any admin role would be something I’m interested in. I like paperwork and looking at detailed documents such as contracts and building plans.

These are some pathways I have thought about:

1jxa1rg,Anyone Relate to This?,"Hi everyone,

I work for a Managed  
Service Provider (MSP) as an IT Analyst, and I'm currently contracted to  
provide support across several different organizations. One of the companies I  
support is genuinely great—engaging work, solid systems, and for the most part,  
a good team. I’ve expressed many times how grateful I am to be assigned to this  
particular client, and I’ve done my best to stay positive, communicative, and  
continuously improve in my role.

That said, there’s an  
ongoing challenge that’s been weighing on me. A manager within the client  
organization rarely communicates with me directly. When something goes  
wrong—even something minor—he doesn’t reach out for clarification. Instead, he  
escalates the issue straight to my MSP manager and CCs me, often without giving  
me a chance to explain or respond first. This has happened multiple times, and  
in a few cases, I've been blamed for missed alerts or gaps in record-keeping *that occurred before I even started* on the contract.

To complicate things, I  
share this role with another technician who’s been with the company longer but  
tends to be quite disengaged. They’ve made repeated mistakes—some of which I’ve  
quietly cleaned up—yet I seem to bear the brunt of the blame, perhaps because  
I’m newer and more visible.

A recent incident was  
particularly frustrating. I received a call from a user who said they were with  
someone who was locked out of their account. I asked for the name, searched  
Active Directory, and couldn’t locate the account. I asked them to spell it out  
multiple times, and eventually, they mentioned the user might be from an  
external partner organization. Based on that, I advised them to contact the  
appropriate external service desk and provided the number. About 30 minutes  
later, I followed up to check in and was told that the issue was resolved after  
the internal manager stepped in.

I thought everything had  
been handled appropriately, but the next day I was unexpectedly invited to a  
Teams meeting with my MSP manager, where I was informed that the client-side  
manager had submitted a formal complaint about the way I handled the situation.  
I explained the context, the unclear information I was provided, and the fact  
that the user had incorrectly identified the locked-out person as external.  
Thankfully, my MSP manager was understanding and the issue was dropped—but once  
again, there was no direct communication from the client-side manager to me  
before it was escalated.

Has anyone else  
experienced something similar? A situation where you're doing your best, but  
one particular stakeholder seems to have unrealistic expectations or avoids  
direct communication? I’m trying to remain professional and keep growing, but  
it’s tough feeling like you’re being set up to fail.

Would appreciate any  
insights or strategies on how to manage this kind of dynamic.

1jx9mxj,"I am very stuck. What kind of career can I pursue, or should I further my education?","Hi everyone,

I'm stuck and unsure about my future career or education, so I need advice on the best path. I live in Texas and am 28 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in sociology and public health. I was in nursing school but ended up dropping out because I found out it is something that I do not see myself pursuing. All of my experience was unhappy. With everything and the constant pressure, I became severely depressed.

I am looking for something I can pursue to increase my salary as my expenses are increasing, but something I enjoy pursuing. I am running out of time for what I can do and understand that at the end it is my decision, but I was wondering if anyone can help me with advice or insight.

I am currently working for a financial aid office for an education system for a university. I currently make around $46k with an increase to $50k soon. I am sure there will be future position openings and chances to move up the ladder to increase my salary. However, I am unsure for this time frame, but I do make an effort and do my best to increase my skills. This is something I enjoy doing and assisting students with, but I do have other interests and am open to pursuing them, but I'm unsure what path or the best way I can pursue. I also would like to pursue a career with my degrees, such as working for the state or local government for the department of health, social work, etc. I enjoy working with the general population and traveling within the city.

Basically, I have come up with different plans, but I am afraid of pursuing one only to end up in a dead end. First, I would like to keep this job for now and do my very best. The reason for this is because I know finding work at this time and working hybrid—mostly from home—is hard to come by. One of my plans for this job is to keep working and learn as much as I can, but I'm unsure what I can do to further assist me in pursuing the ladder. Such as obtaining a license, certification, or degree. I am unsure if I can speak with my boss or someone from work on how I can improve myself to get promoted. Not sure if I can do this or how to pursue it.

My other plans are:

Try to see if I can go back to nursing school even if I dislike it and force myself to finish it.

Work while applying to jobs with my bachelor's, but I feel like most jobs will be better with a master's and experience. I have minimal experience and not sure how to increase my experience without leaving my job.

Work while pursuing a master's degree in public health and apply to jobs at the city or state level for the department of health. However, every everytime I read about someone pursuing their master's degree, it is very limited, hard to find a career, and the starting salary is very low. It is the same that I am now. With the cost, I will try my very best to apply to scholarships and grants to reduce the amount of loans to take out.

I was also wondering what other fast-track programs/degrees/certifications I can pursue with a good salary.

1jx6um0,Junior in CIS - No idea on how to proceed,"Hi everyone, I am a junior in college and am now starting to think about applying for jobs and internships. I am currently doing a Bachelors in Computer Information Science and have little to no interest in coding. 

I know it might sound bad ( and somewhat it truly is) but I majored in CIS due to familial pressure and no matter how much I try to like coding, I simply can’t stand it. I can do basic stuffs and do problem solving but to actually sit down and write codes or debug them is where I have a lot of difficultly at. 

I was wondering if there were any other jobs that I could do with this degree that wouldn’t require strict coding. Frankly, I think I am pretty good with people and don’t hate desk jobs. Admittedly, I don’t mind academics and would love to take up any certifications that would help me along the way. 

And before anyone starts talking about changing my major now because “you can’t survive the tech field if you don’t have passion”, just know I can’t. My family situation puts me at a tricky situation and I absolutely cannot change my major, especially now. So if you have job fields that I should check out or have any advice for what to do next, please let me know!

The culture, pay, and the overall team is much nicer/less stressful than my old department. I have been required to help my old department out with work since management is unable to keep up with losing staff. I have been doing between 30-50% of my weeks helping them out, therefore slowing down my training at my new department. There is another employee who did the same switch I did and still has been asked to help them out- after 2 years!! I do not want to end up that way. This makes me want to reconsider working here if I am being roped into helping the other department out for years to come. I have asked my managers to please limit the times I help them since that is not my job anymore, but they “listen”, but don’t listen if that makes sense. What would you all suggest?

wants something stable. good salary. pet industry, if possible.

but every application comes back with the same line:  
“you don’t have AM experience.”

1jx3o2k,Career transition: Trade Marketing to HR,"Hello everyone! So I recently quit my very well paid job at a prestigious FMCG company in my country. I was over burnt, stressed, and tbh, I only accepted that job offer for the financial benefits in the first place. It is worth mentioning that there is a crisis in this field since young ppl prefer to take up jobs in marketing since it gives more credibility, and trade marketing is highly misunderstood. However, I managed to land that role and got very excited since it was my first ‘management’ position. Little did I know that the position was beautifully wrapped around a nice salary and did not match what was presented in the interviews. Ever since I was in school I ran away from maths and anything to do with it, but I found myself in a position that requires numerical knowledge to do an ok job, let alone climb the corporate ladder. My current experience is +1,5y in trade marketing, and I believe my skills are transferable(I was mainly in charge of operational and administrative tasks, keeping track of marketing campaigns and collaborating with clients, prepping materials for meetings with my managers and so on) . Realistically speaking, my academic profile is more oriented towards a hr role than marketing since I have a BA in Comms and a Master’s in Politics.

I found an opportunity on Linkedin and for whatever reason, I have a really good feeling about it.It’s recruiting and hiring assistant role, entry-level, minimum requirements, at an even bigger company. After passing a generic skill test, I recieved an invitation for a virtual interview. How should I sell myself and build credibility? What kind of questions should I expect and what would be some good answers for this kind of position (coming from someone with my kind of professional experience). Lastly, for people working in HR, how does it feel? Is it rewarding? What would be the most challenging aspects of a role like that?

Any tips, thoughts are appreciated.

1jx3j9b,(M26) PM stressed out of my mind am I about to be chewed out hard?,"I have been a Project coordinator for two years. First in automotarion and now water treatment. 

I operate under the assumption the difference between a PM and a PC is that I manage the project, not the people. I coordinate between the different departments in order to get the job done and communicate to the customer.

I have a new buyer II who has no idea what she's doing at all. I have to explain to her everything over and over again and she won't talk to any of the other departments.

It's kind of the straw that broke the horses back because I'm at my witts end with the job. Nobody tells me shit and then deadlines come and that's when it's ""i can't hit it."" Not by a day but by weeks. I can't track procurement and every other instance of my many many many other projects. I do but then I have to tell this buyer ii to legitamently do every part of her job.

I give engineers slack because to be honest they do all the work but tracking a PO should be easy (I should know when I worked in automation I did the procurement as well as managed projects).

I hate that I hate this new worker so much. She's just trying to make a living but she's ruining what was a decent job for me.

Anyway she has basically been calling me for 2 weeks trying to get these parts on order and everything set up for fabrication, assembly etc.

I went on vacation this week(coming back to like 900 headaches & 40 hrs of unpaid extra work from what I can tell. Woo PTO totally exists) I set up automated emails as reminders for her and she basically obviously has not got anything done.

She has now set up a meeting with her boss and mine on Monday. With nothing indicating what it is in reference too but the project she has been struggling with

Granted I don't know all the ins and outs of doing her job. BUT I have told her what needs to be done and by when.... that is when my job should end. I am not her manager. Engineers don't come to me with engineering questions. Programmers don't come to me with programming questions.

1jx3hbu,"Compliance went nuclear when I asked about SOP’s, how to I calm things down?","As a background I’ve been with this organization for some time but I’m newer to this team and office. My company has a help desk for SOP’s where you can inquire about them and get guidance on how to comply with them. This is not HR and they usually just give interpretations on policy. 


I’m someone who regularly references SOP’s to make sure I’m above board, although on this team I’m noticing thats not the case and leadership can be unaware of existing SOP’s. I’m not nitpicky on others behavior I just focus on following it for myself but there’s a specific policy on my team that contradicts the handbook and also negatively impacts a lot of my team. 

The SOP does provide a lot of the decision making to our leadership, but there’s do seem to be some minimal policies that need to be followed. Before bringing this up to my boss, I checked in with compliance to better understand what is required by our company and what office leadership can dictate, to be better prepared.

Well… at first the person did not properly answer my question, and insisted I talk to my boss about it. They were combative in a way I wasn’t used to, and the response was more defending the policy rather than explaining what it was. When I asked for more clarification on a different part of the SOP, they went nuclear and escalated my issue to the ethics department and told me that since I had such a problem with it, I needed to stop doing an activity that is essential to my role until it gets resolved. 

AHHH. I don’t know how to respond to this and I hate how this will hurt my relationships at work. My boss is very reasonable and before this I had full faith that I could have a conversation with her and point out the rules and settle the issue, but now I’m worried about the conflict it’ll create Monday .

So far i liked the job, its fully remote and pays well. However today i visited my agency website and I'm a little shocked.

They remade it and it says there now that they provide marketing for casinos, pharma and even 3scort. The thing is I don't any of those, the clients that i work with are literally cbd company and computer company.

I'm afraid that if i put this company in my resume and HR will just google it, nobody will hire me because the agency does services for these clients.

Both in office.

I’m a single dad, 45 , in very competitive IT fortune 50 company.  I’ve always been a top performer with glowing reviews.  But I’ve got no fallback if I were to lose my job and I would have to be extremely careful to jump to another job/ company because I can’t risk getting into a bad, toxic team and be made to quit. Or laid off.

Almost certain massive cuts will come in 2025.  The company lost half of its value in the stock market and lost revenue and will continue to in the coming years.  I am not sure of the time horizon.  Minimal info shared in town halls. I’m kind of freaking out with so many unknowns. What are the chances I’m retained?  So I started looking for a new job outside of the company - and got an offer - better pay, in IT, not manager but senior level - BUT - it’s a FAANG.  They have conducted layoffs too last year and this year.  So I’m hesitant in taking the plunge.  Why - I’m a single dad, taking a risk on income is very hard.  Since the new company has conducted layoffs I could be targeted too in the near term and more so as being new.  I’m tired of working in fear.   
Any suggestions?  Is there something I haven’t thought of?

And my current job - Let it play out and if get let go draw unemployment?   New manager, higher job title (I’ve worked hard and feel I deserve it) but it just seems like there’s so much politics.  

 Please help me think this through!!

I spoke to my dad who got me the job about it and 
he told me that you aren’t “ supposed to like your job” and that i can’t just “ jump from job to job because employers will see that and not want to hire me.” Is this true ?
Should i “ thug it out “ or would leaving mean that i will not be able to withstand a career ?

1jwzuhf,I don't know if I'm making a good choice about leaving my job.,"There's a number of reasons why I want to leave this job but I don't know if it's just an over reaction or not.
I'm a mental health technician on weekends (9a-5p) currently and I've been at this place for 4 month and I feel drained and I am so done working there. I'm holding out until may when my second job (that pays the same amount) and starts and at this second job I'll be working 40hours a week compared to 16 hours.

1st things 1st. I was promised in my interview that I would be able to pick up more hours when the school year ended...ya not happening now bc I get last pick which is fine but the way it works is based off of newest employee, im not the newest anymore but the new person who is older than me gets to pick up more hours. 

2nd: staffing is awful. The person I work with on weekends falls asleep on shift and vapes in in the office and blows it all over including on me. My would tell my supervisor but he told me ""don't come to me with complaints about staff bc it'll just rope back to you"" so I haven't complained. 

3rd: I don't get pto, I dont work enough to get it. My boss told me today I cannot take off for at least 4 months. I have a pre-planned vacation that I mentioned before I was hired in June. It was fine then but after that conversation I'm concerned about what might happen.

I really don't know. It would be fine if I left because of my second job, im not worried about money but I don't want it to look bad bc I've only been there 4 months.

1jwyyjk,"Going back to school, dental hygiene, or ultrasound tech?","I am going back and forth between doing dental hygiene or ultrasound tech (sonographer). I get all sorts of direction on what to do in my life and I guess looking for more, but from strangers

Pros to dental hygiene that I think of is good pay but similar to sonography. Good hours right at the start, may have to work some weekends but no overnights, rotating shifts, etc. Variety to career, while every day would be pretty similar, you can vary in family clinics vs peds vs orthodontic, etc.

Cons, back and neck overuse/injuries are most common. Work can be very repetitive and may get boring fast. Otherwise not sure on many more cons.

Ultrasound tech pros: Again similar pay to dental hygiene, from the outside sounds more interesting to me, can work in hospitals or clinics

Cons: odd hours, wrist injuries/arm injuries again is repetitive and may get boring

Writing it down on paper they are fairly similar, but obviously they are very different jobs. I am leaning toward dental hygiene but it's a new interest while sonography I've been interested in for a while.

1jwxxfe,Internal offer from VP vs. Amazon interview in progress – career advice?,"I'm currently a financial analyst (~5 years experience) at a large multinational +50bn in annual sales. A VP recently approached me with an offer for a new internal role—Business Operations Consultant—which he’s creating and wants me to take on. He shared his own career journey, mentioned someone once gave him a similar opportunity, and said he’d like to do the same for me. He’s already spoken to senior leadership and wants to fast-track the move.

At the same time, I’m interviewing with Amazon for a Senior Financial Analyst position. I’ve completed the first round, and the loop is coming up. They haven’t shared the salary range, but they did proceed after I shared my expected number—which I gave before the internal VP offer came up—so I assume it’s aligned or close.

The dilemma:

The internal role offers mentorship, senior visibility, and fast growth—but I worry it could limit future mobility outside the company.

Amazon offers a stronger brand, probably more money, and broader long-term options—but it might take years to reach the same level of exposure and trust I have internally.


Has anyone faced a similar internal vs. external fork in the road? Would love to hear how you thought it through.

I’ve asked some of my instructors (who teach me) for some tips and advice and was told it’s a good idea to include a photograph of myself doing a Pilates exercise and a photo of myself (headshot style I guess), is this common practice? To me it feels a little embarrassing and maybe even vain? But perhaps I’m overthinking it 😅 people working in the fitness industry please give me your opinion ! 

And does anyone have any other general tips and advice? I don’t have “relevant” previous experience so I’m assuming my employment history section should be brief/minimal and I should focus on other areas of my life maybe? My Pilates journey etc? 

If any instructors or employers or people working in the fitness industry have any advice it would be massively appreciated  

Thanks in advance 🥰",SeafoamTrollop,2,1.0,1,1744396220,2025-04-11 18:30:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jwwz9k/advice_for_a_newly_qualified_pilates_teacher/,4,2025

1jww9r7,"My job was supposed to be contract-to-hire. Now that the contract is over, they keep extending my contract 1 month at a time, saying my direct hire is “just around the corner”. The work and pay are both good. What should I do?","I signed onto a contract-to-hire engineering role about 11 months ago now at 25. My contract said that after 6 months I would have the option to sign on direct with the company or extend my contract 6 more months. At the end of the 6 months, my supervisor said they had a temporary hiring freeze but that it should all be worked out in a couple weeks. He extended my contract 1 month, assuring me that everything would be worked out by then. 

A month later and it’s the same thing. “I spoke with my supervisor and we should have an update next week”. Next week it’s “Sorry, people have been traveling and we haven’t heard anything definitive”. Then it’s “Sorry this is taking so long. I don’t want to promise a date yet but we should be able to sign you on in the very near future.” This has gone on for 4-5 months now. 

It’s very frustrating. As a contractor I don’t get holidays off (although I get 30 days PTO per year, which is nice) and my future at the company does not feel as secure. Also, the contractor health plan is not great, which sucks cause I have type 1 diabetes and am spending a lot out of pocket. Additionally, the laptop and monitor they supply contractors are not good, and I would be much more efficient with the better laptop and multiple monitors they supply to direct-hires. 

On the other hand, it’s a very good job and it pays very well. I’m making 6 figures at 26 years old to work remotely in a MCOL city doing the work I like to do. I don’t want to cause problems and lose what I have, but I was also promised more and feel like I’m being strung along. 

Since this position does not feel secure, I’m continuously applying for other jobs just in case. 

How do I handle this? Do I just keep putting up with this until they either sign me on or let me go? Do I push harder and risk rubbing them the wrong way? Should I try to land another offer and basically tell them “I’m leaving unless we’re able to get this done”?

Tl;dr: My 6 month contract-to-hire job has turned into an indefinite contractor role. It’s a good job but I would like to be hired direct, as I was promised.

1jww3d6,Scientist seeking employment!,"Hello everyone, I am seeking some job advice or recommendations. I will be graduating with a PhD in a molecular/microbiology related area in May but was turned down from both of the federal fellowships I applied for. 

I am seeking a job that combines bench science and public health/epidemiology. I was hoping to join a fellowship to learn some epidemiology skills as mine are limited and I wanted to see if that’s a field I want to work in long-term. I have a lot of experience in wet lab techniques and extensive leadership experience in the form of student organizations. I am also a huge believer in science communication and think that is something all scientists could work on. 

I also aim to work in a supportive environment with a mentor/boss who can both encourage and challenge me. In recent years, I have gone through some health issues and would prefer to work for someone who understands that I may have to take appointments during standard business hours (although I would do my best to schedule these with minimal work interference if possible). If I had to choose a geographical location, I would prefer the Midwest or Colorado, but I am up to discussing other areas.

1jwtolm,Should I keep trying to pursue a career in the beauty industry?,"For reference I’m a 20yo girl and I need some external career advice. I currently still work at a smoothie bar making 12$ an hour and I am severely depressed. I also work part time at a department store selling makeup, but I currently only work around 10 hours a week over there. Combined I work around 40 hours a week with very little to show for it. 

I graduated high-school in 2022. I’ve always been into beauty, makeup and skincare. I decided I wanted to go to cosmetology school to avoid student loan debt. I worked 3 jobs for over a year to save up all the money to pay tuition in full. During that time I decided to switch from the cosmetology to esthetics program. I graduated in July 2024 and got licensed in November of last year.

If you look at the Esthetician sub you’ll see just how many issues that field has right now. It’s over saturated and customers aren’t getting services like they used to. I’ve applied to all the chains within an hour of me and I’ve got rejected from all of them. I’ve been having interviews but no offers. Most places have told me I don’t have the experience they’re looking for. I do have a hydrafacial and chemical peel certifications but no experience outside of school and doing services on my friends.

I’m feeling very lost I’ve tired so much to make this work. I’ve dropped off my resumes in person, I’ve used LinkedIn and Facebook constantly following up with emails. But still no offers. My school was awful and offered zero career support so I’m completely on my own.

I have worked in retail for quite some time. I have worked at Ulta for 2+ years but that’s really the only experience I have going for me. I feel really stuck and I don’t know what to do. I’m not in a place financially where I can try to start my own business or anything like that. Plus I feel like I don’t have the technical skills to succeed on my own at this point in time. 

I’m overall really depressed because I do have a passion for this field. I know I’m still young so I could try to go to community college for something else if I really wanted to. I would have to completely start over as I didn’t take any AP classes in high-school. I’ve also thought about getting my cosmetology license and maybe doing hair instead. I feel so lost and behind. I really don’t know what my next step should be. I would love to only be able to work one full time job and have a decent salary. But it feels like it’s too much to ask for.

I’m hoping to get some advice from this awesome community—thank you in advance for any insights!

\- \*\*Tax Analyst\*\* (3 years, current role)

I’m not 100% sure where my experience could take me, so I’d really appreciate your thoughts on:

\- Career paths that might be a good fit (e.g., financial analyst, portfolio management, something else?).

\- How to leverage my accounting and tax background to make the switch.

Has anyone here made a similar career shift? What worked for you? Or, if you’re in finance/investing, what roles do you think could match my background?

I’m trying to bulk up my skillset and certs, going through software engineering/web development route. With IT as a side I guess. I’ve mainly taught myself through video courses, self practice, and vocational schools.

I have no on the job experience in SWE, Web, or IT thus far but last year I studied and passed CC and CySA+. After half a year learning web development and programming, I tried to jump straight into to AWS SAA but I’m hitting a major wall, I’m consistently failing practice exams at 30% even after watching Stephane Mareek’s course end to end twice. I just seem to struggle with networking architectures.

At this point, I don’t have a lot of time to waste (Months on months) studying for one cert. because I need a proper job soon. I need experience soon. And the people who are basically paying for these on my behalf are getting hella impatient. 

Should I carry over my attempt at understanding SAA and scale down to the AWS beginner cert (AWS CCP)? Or should I just pivot down to CompTIA Security+? Even though it looks redundant next to CySA+? Or should I go down to Network+ or A+?

1jwqv07,I feel guilty that my job no longer stresses me out,"I started my career in healthcare at age 22 and am now 34. By 23 I was working in the busiest ER in my state, and frequently found myself taking care of patients in life or death situations. I became proficient in multiple areas of my hospital, and after seven years there I switched to a new location. At 29 I began working in an even more stressful location, taking care of critically ill neonatal and pediatric patients. The stress here became so intense that I began to take Trazodone as a sleep aid. I stayed there for six years as the department I was in became shorter and shorter staffed.

  
This past year I switched gears to an outpatient location. The hours are better (8am-4pm instead of 5am-7pm). I have more of a work-life balance, I no longer use Trazodone. I am overall, way healthier than before. There are aspects of my personal life that I've really wanted to grow for a long time that are seriously thriving now. I have a ""side-hustle"" that is proving to be very financially lucrative. My marriage is better. But for some reason I feel guilty, and while I want to enjoy this I feel like I shouldn't. Like I should be self flagellating because of it. I feel like I matter less because I'm not going home every night stressed the fuck out and losing sleep over whether or not I screwed up at work.

1jwq49b,Struggling with being a little socially anxious in corporate sales support job what might I do?,"
Whatever my job is I can always do it well, I have no problem talking to people one on one or in my team.  

However I have no idea why I took this job in sales when I’ve had sales admin jobs before and I thought well there’s nowhere for me to go since I obviously am not a sales manager type of person. I work remote but when I had to go in for something it was SO overwhelming. I felt so awkward even though everyone was nice, they all seemed so much more outgoing and open and talkative. 

Also I don’t have an easy time talking in larger meetings, or any brainstorming things. Especially because I need to know things ahead of time to be able to think a lot and decide what I might have input on. As well that since I don’t actually manage anything and am not any particular expert, I don’t have the confidence to say something. Yet sometimes I might have a passing though I might add but I don’t because I don’t like to butt in and I get nervous and the time passes. 

I feel bad like I’m dead weight on my team even though my actual job I do well, so at least maybe that I’m not some rockstar even though I’m overqualified for this position.. but big meetings and in person things so hard, and I worry that some people might think I’m stuck up for not coming around to talk to them or something. But it’s intimidating to randomly go up and talk unless I have a reason. But again if they came up to me I can be friendly and talk, but even outside of work sometimes maybe people can feel im nervous and they go off to talk to someone more fun. Even though if they gave me like a few more minutes I warm up more.

Anyway I feel I’ve been held back (and by myself as well considering I need to find something not in sales) and it sucks so much. I feel even worse and less confident when I see all these younger people who maybe do go very above and beyond but are also loud and of course they get recognized and grow more. 

But I feel stupid I’m so entry level with all these recent grads?? I don’t even want to be anything high up I just want some mid level job to stay in.  I also think it could be even harder that I work remote and while many do work in the office (I don’t have the option bc location). Also hard that the company is so good but not too big so there’s not much openings and I don’t even know where I’d want to go (though I have talked a bit with my manager about possible areas.. except who knows when they’d open)",wavydavysonfiree,2,1.0,2,1744378764,2025-04-11 13:39:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jwq49b/struggling_with_being_a_little_socially_anxious/,4,2025

1jwq05s,"Don't just ""follow your passion,"" and why","I paraphrased 80000 Hours' part 1 of their career guide to deepen my understanding and to expound upon their view, and I thought others may find it interesting. They're a non-profit dedicated to everyone find and earn the highest impact jobs for both meaningful and more fulfilling careers, and all credit goes to them!

Why one should not just ""follow their passion"" for a good, satisfying job according to 80000 Hours:  
  
1. It doesn't teach you to consider the other important factors for a fulfilling career (it feeling engaging and meaningful, and without negatives like unfair pay or long hours).  
2. Since nearly everyone follows this advice, and passions are largely in the same things, you'll likely face much higher competition---and for jobs that may not even meet all the criteria for a fulfilling career.  
3. It can make people choose a career that they end up not being passionate about over careers that they would become passionate about if they started them, as they believe they already be passionate about it. You can become passionate about careers because the criteria for a fulfilling career can be increasingly met as you get better at your job, develop greater social support, are given more freedom to choose how to approach tasks as you earn trust, earn the ability to diminish negatives like a long commute by convincing your boss you can work remote, take on more responsibility that makes your work feel more meaningful, and more.  
4. Similar to that, people's interests change a lot more than they realize over time, so their passion(s) will likely change anyways over their working life. The belief in ""one true passion"" is limiting because of that as well as ignoring the possibility of multiple passions, plus it reinforces the belief that everyone needs to search for this singular, specific ""calling"" of sorts, which is highly inflexible.   
5. It makes people further miss out on other options when they stop self-reflection at considering what they want to do before starting their career. Not only is that information unreliable for choosing an actually fulfilling career (per some flaws in human psychology---and not even considering ignoring the factors for a fulfilling career), but it's the opposite of what the research tells us is the best career-building approach: experimenting to make increasingly better informed decisions with a series of targeted reflection beyond your emotional intuition.  
6. Side note: higher salaries do make people happier, but much, much less than people believe, so it should not be their top priority like census data says it is. Also, choosing a job because it's easy leads to boredom, although unhealthily high levels of stress are also undesirable, so find the level of challenge in between.  
7. But all of this is good news! It means that, if you follow the latest research, you'll face less competition for careers that are a lot more likely to be satisfying, and actually consider paths that you would otherwise ignore, which could be the difference between a miserable career and your dream job. And if you don't have a passion or are now uncertain about your current passion(s) for choosing a career, it can give you hope of becoming passionate about a career, thus giving you more power over you life.",Delicious_Book_2392,1,0.6000000238418579,3,1744378452,2025-04-11 13:34:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jwq05s/dont_just_follow_your_passion_and_why/,4,2025
1jwpz9g,Help with next career move,"I left the workforce last summer, resigned from a position I genuinely liked due to a safety issue at work. I then decided to take some time off as I had some medical treatments coming up, and wanted to start looking for work again after the treatments. The medical stuff ended up not going exactly as planned, so I’ve been out of the workforce for longer than I anticipated. I’m looking to rejoin, but feel somewhat directionless.

I have a bachelor’s degree in agriculture business and a masters degree related to human rights. I spent ~ 10 years in agriculture with ~ 7 years of this years at one company in credit, senior credit roles, and a short time in payroll/benefits. I earned my masters degree during that time, then left to work at a non profit related to my masters. I left that job and went back to the corporate world as an instructional developer (the job I left last summer).

I am driven, a great problem solver, I have a strong attention to detail and can also see the big picture. I have a heart for helping people, facilitating growth in others, and I enjoy being creative. I have always had very strong performance reviews, and my bosses always say I’m asset to their teams as a leader and team builder.

I just don’t know what my next move is. I truly loved my instructional developer work, but am not that experienced in it, only like 2 years and no formal education related to that.

I feel like I was in upper mid level roles and now I can’t find anything at that level.

Any advice or guidance is greatly appreciated. I am feeling discouraged that I’ve not been able to find anything. I really want to get back to work soon.

1jwp356,"I realized I’m good at analyzing and optimizing systems, is there a name for a job using these skills?","Granted, I have been in very dead end jobs where people don't care a lot about their work (restaurants, housekeeping) but in every environment I've been in I realized I am good at noticing where mistakes are made and adjusting the system to correct those mistakes. For example, I work at a gym now and we have daily tasks based on when I lead was entered but they are assigned to specific people so the Day 2 task often gets missed if that person doesn't work that day. So I suggested assigning everything to ""sales person on duty"" for example. I worked retail and we had boxes for returned items and we were constantly trying to find the right boxes for each department so I ended up labeling the wall instead of the boxes which was much easier. Both of these seem incredibly stupid tbh and I don't know why no one else had thought of them, but every job I've had I seem to be the only one making efforts like that. What do you call this skill on a resume? And is there a career path or title that makes sense? Like systems management? I'm not great at managing people but how could I leverage this skill into a better career?

i was falling apart. burnt out, anxious all the time, crying in the bathroom before meetings.  
and she just looked at me one day and said “you don’t have to push through everything.”  
then she told me to log off and take the next day too. no questions. no HR approval. just… go.

like. that was the first time i realized i wasn’t crazy.  
that maybe i wasn’t lazy or weak or “bad under pressure”  
maybe i was just human and exhausted and needed someone to not treat me like a f\*\*\*ing resource.

she fought for my raise.  
told me to apply for stuff outside the team even though it meant losing me.  
covered for me when i froze up in meetings.  
never made a big deal of it, just quietly had my back.

and now i’m stuck in a job where i feel disposable again  
and i keep comparing every manager to her.  
and they all fall short.

i just want someone who sees me the way she did  
and i don’t know if that even exists anymore.

if you’re stuck somewhere soul-crushing, i help people find better.

she did not email me the entire day.

1jwofie,Offered Internship + Full-Time Role with Changing Terms — Should I Accept or Keep Looking?,"Hi everyone,  
I’m a final-year B. tech CSE student with a CGPA of 9.1 from Tier 3 college, currently looking for my first full-time opportunity in Android development. I’ve done multiple internships, worked on solid projects

A company (fintech) offered me the role of **SDE-1**, and here’s what happened:

#  Initial Offer (Shared Verbally + Offer Letter):

* **Internship:** ₹18,000/month stipend
* **After Graduation:** ₹4 LPA fixed + ₹1.5 LPA variable (5.5 LPA total)
* Full-time role promised after completing college

#  Later, They Withdrew This Offer:

* The HR told me their **legal team said they can’t pay someone who is still in college**, so they had to pause and revise the offer.
* Also mentioned that since it was their **first time hiring interns**, the initial ₹18K offer was made without consulting legal.

# New Revised Offer (Verbal):

* **2-month unpaid internship - i had negotaited but they are not paying anything for this**
* **6-month probation:** ₹25,000 gross/month
* **Post probation (1-year contract):** ₹7.44 LPA CTC
   * ₹50K in-hand/month
   * The rest is performance-based variable

They say that this is confirmed now, but it still hasn’t come in official written form yet. I’m a bit confused and honestly stressed about whether to trust this process.  
  
My Questions:

1. **Is this offer structure normal or should I be concerned?**
2. **Should I wait and accept this once it's in writing, or keep applying elsewhere in parallel?**
3. **Does unpaid internship + low paid probation make sense for someone with my profile?**

Unfortunately, the manager there is known for being a bit of a micromanager and not the most sensitive person to work with. On top of that, the workload in that team can be pretty overwhelming.

I brought up my concerns to my current manager, and told him that I would like to stay in the department and work under him.

Here’s the context: I’m a high school student in Sydney (University of Sydney), and I was rushed into a degree I don’t enjoy AT ALL, and I pushed away my underlying interests in fear of job security, employability, finances, etc. I realise now that I want to follow something I genuinely care about and am interested in. 
- that, is the field of psychology.

I’m switching at the start of next semester to one of two options:

1. Bachelor of psychology (minor is neuroscience)
2. Bachelor of science (major in psychological sciences, major in neuroscience)

The bachelor of psychology has 60 credit points (cp) in psychology, and so neuroscience is reduced to a minor (36cp), while in the bachelor of science each major is split evenly at 48cp.

Right now, I have a large interest in neuropsychology specifically.

To form two questions:

1. Which course should I take? I’m torn between the two based on what balance of neuroscience and psychology I would need to get into honours psychology, and then eventually a masters in neuropsychology. 
2. This one’s a bit more general, but to anyone who has experience as a neuropsychologist, or knows of the experience well, what’s it like? More specifically, what’s the demand like, how does it pay, is it worth the years of tuition, and has it brought you fulfilment?

1jwj313,Lateral move (right choice?),"I (30F) took a lateral move about 10 months ago. I’m a product manager and my last role before was more on the product marketing side. I wanted to get more true product experience and build things when I was looking for a new role. I got two offers: 

1) my current one: which was a true PM role but it was a lateral move so I went from manager to being a manager again.

2) senior manager, product operations. This role was more operational and sort of like program management but for products. You don’t really dive deep or own a lot of things. But it would be a title bump. I think there was opportunity to also have one direct report (an analyst)

I ended up choosing the first one which is my current role on a few factors:

1) even tho I would be going from a manager to sr manager for the second role I would be offered the same exact pay for both roles because both roles are still considered in the same “grouping”
2) I know I’m really good at operational and execution focused roles but I wanted to challenge myself in a true product management role where I could build things but also think about product strategy (which is my weakness)

Although I made my bed and made my choice I can’t help but wonder if I set myself back from not choosing a role that was a higher title and gave people management opportunities. My rationale was that if I wanted to be a people manager my time would come and I’m in no rush, I’d rather focus on building my subject matter expertise and confidence in a niche so I could be a confident leader.

1jwj1bw,Should I accept a counter offer.,"I recently announced to my manager that I’d be leaving for another employer. The new job isn’t a direct competitor but is in the same industry. The pay is roughly the same, albeit the base salary and bonus breakout is better at the new job. 

Part of the reason I decided to leave is because the company environment has changed. Our industry is extremely cyclical and performance has been difficult recently, which has revealed a lot of ugly spots in our corporate culture. I absolutely adored my work, but it has soured on me recently and I felt like needed a fresh start.

After announcing my departure, I got separate calls from each member of our executive team asking for me to stay, and for clarity as to why I was leaving. A day later they sent me a counter offer, creating a new position based on my feedback with a sizable pay increase. They also gave me guaranteed minimum compensation for the next two years (this year’s being more than I’ve ever made and next year’s being significantly more than I’ve ever made). Over the next 2 years I’ll likely be giving up ~$115K in guaranteed money if I make the switch due to the counter.

1jwizdn,Set up a casual conversation with the lead recruiter. How do I convert?,"I am not doing great. My wife and I both got fired very suddenly at the beginning of the year. She's just recently diagnosed chronically ill and racking up new, concerning diagnoses often. She's signed up for Medicaid but we could really use some solid health insurance and, well, income.

I am feeling the pressure.

I am job hunting hard and networking unapologetically, and managed to get a formal conversation with the lead recruiter for a firm I want to work for. It's for the subject I went to school for and developed an extensive niche expertise in, but I've not had a job in this line of work for 5 years. I have two job experience points on my resume that are basically ""worked for the Harlem Globetrotters of this industry for 6 months before 2020 hit and burned everything to the ground, so I had to change industries.""

I like this company. There are approx. 3 fairly different roles there that I have very strong skills for, and that's how I plan to frame the conversation, i.e.:

""I have been researching your company and have really started to connect on some of the core values. Looking closer, I see three roles that really mesh with my current trajectory. I was wondering if we could discuss those roles and see if there may be a particularly good fit."" Then, zero in on whichever seems to be looking like the most-likely possibility and say ""I was sure I liked the company, but now I'm extremely excited about this role, and plan to send in an application later today. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me, I look forward to hearing about potential next steps etc etc."" (Also any advice on how to say that without sounding like a bot would be greatly appreciated).

I am confident in my abilities, I am skilled and well-recognized by my peers in this small circle of niche experts, but I cannot for the life of me convert. I feel like I have this recruiter on the hook, how do I keep them interested and give myself the best chance to convert this into a job, and, hopefully a foot back in the door to doing what I am most passionate about?

Thank you for any and all advice.",Guilty_Scheme_6215,2,1.0,3,1744351373,2025-04-11 06:02:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jwizdn/set_up_a_casual_conversation_with_the_lead/,4,2025

I’m 25yo, degree in CS from WGU, transitioning from SWE to IT and I received two offers here in Vancouver after 3 weeks of applying:

1) from an AI startup that focuses on vulnerabilities and security for $8xxxxCAD as an “Technical Support Engineer”. A lot of python, and working with their main platform helping clients know about vulnerabilities in their AI usage.

2) from an IT solutions company (Kaseya) as a “Technical Support Expert - Level 1” for $6xxxxCAD. All things Kaseya and their softwares. Linux focused, virtual machine, a little network and cloud stuff (I think).

This will be my first IT job and I don’t exactly know which direction to take my career into (Windows sys-admin vs. DevOps, automation/scripting and Linux), but I am currently studying for my CCNA before I eventually plan to move on to obtaining a large number of Azure certs. If you guys could help me decide which one is better to start out with and which one would help me more in the long run, as well as judging my general career directions and certificate route - that would be awesome.

1jwgtyy,What do I do? I can’t find a job in this shitty job market. Feeling lost!,"Don’t know if I should switch careers. Feeling lost in life, still early in my career

I’m 25F, and am currently unemployed for about 4 months since my last job which was at a very good company but it was a seasonal role. I went to college for video production media and honestly thrived in an academic space so I enjoyed college although it was ruined by the pandemic. 

However, I’ve taken more of a marketing/social media route with my beginning stages of my career and I thought it would continue on that path. I have good names on my resume, but all those roles have been temporary since they were seasonal roles except one that really fit what I wanted but I had to leave it due to unfair job conditions and it was very toxic and cost me my health and my autoimmune disease got worse.’

I know people say you don’t end up doing what you graduated with unless it’s a clear path of nurse doctor lawyer etc. so I’m not upset if I don’t end up full time in the social media or marketing space… but I’m wondering if I need to pivot and try something else while I’m young and have the financial backing from my parents. I am so grateful, but they did tell me I need to be established in something by 30 which is very fair. The job market is super rough right now, even simple part time roles I have a hard time getting. 

I’ve had discussions with my parents and they think I should go with my passion of making latte drinks / matcha and go to pastry school, learn the craft, work as a barista. Honestly that would be great, and I can see myself
Opening my own cafe but I don’t know if that’s viable and seems a hard to reach goal. What if things go wrong and there isn’t job stability? They know I’m applying to jobs and tell me I need to figure something out, but I don’t know what that is. I’m having a difficult time seeing a future job I could rly enjoy. 

Next, I’ve thought maybe I need to just go into another career with more stability, maybe medical field? I’ve thought about being a phlebotomist as I have had a lot of bad experiences getting blood drawn, I want to be the one that makes the difference. I’m not sure of other options I have and wanted opinions from the older people of Reddit. What should I do? What jobs would be available with minimal schooling and it’s not too high paced stress environment? (Looking out for my health). I feel I’m behind in my life career wise compared to my peers and I’m feeling more down every day.

1jwgswj,Expecting (unexpectedly?) to fail drug test for dream job,"I just landed my dream job after months of interviewing in a competitive industry (8 interviews for this role). I accepted the job, then was told I’d need to take a drug test prior to my start date. 

I am not currently a drug user - I smoked weed years ago in college, but nothing since. Until I used an illegal drug for the first time about 2 weeks ago with some friends. I’m 27. I know drugs are bad, and I’m not even close to a regular drug user, addict, or anything that would affect my ability to function. I take full responsibility for what I did. The problem is, this is a hair follicle drug test. 

To save anyone reading time and research - I’m going to fail this, because of it being a hair test, and test positive for a narcotic. I did not expect a hair follicle test (this is quite rare for corporate jobs) and would otherwise pass a urine, blood, etc test. It stays in your hair for a few months. 

Certainly coming to grips with the fact that I completely screwed myself. I take full responsibility. My problem is, I told my family, girlfriend, and friends I landed the job. A little embarrassed with the gf/friends, but I’ll be ok. 

How should I proceed to tell my family that I didn’t get the job? Or any other advice you have in my situation, specifically, would be appreciated. I would really appreciate your help.

1jwgn7l,Company values vs reality — am I expecting too much?,"Earlier this year I experienced a traumatic family bereavement. I spent three weeks in Europe with my family to grieve and support each other. When I returned to work (a company of \~20,000 people), I started putting the pieces back together.

I worked in a small team of four. Three of them were kind and supportive. One never mentioned my loss at all. In the broader team of ten, only one person offered their sympathy.

My closest colleague informed me he tried to organise something through management to be sent to my home, but nothing ever came. 

One of the company’s main taglines is *“We care.”* But my experience was the opposite.  
Colleagues from a previous employer—who I haven’t worked with in over two years—reached out, sent a sympathy card, and flowers. Meanwhile, at my current company, I got the occasional awkward “how are you?” and silence from most of the wider team.

To be fair, maybe no one outside my immediate team knew what had happened. But I assumed that people I worked with regularly might notice I was suddenly away, or be curious or kind enough to ask.

The disconnect between the company’s stated values and my experience was so stark, I decided to leave. I’ve never had an employer respond with such coldness—and it genuinely shocked me.

I’m a friendly, outgoing person, and I’m usually the one who checks in on others. This experience has made me reflect a lot on what *culture* really means.

So, I’m curious:  
**What have been your experiences with company values in Australia?**  
**Have you found that companies actually walk the talk when it comes to care, empathy, and support?**  
**Am I expecting too much here?**

Grateful to be moving on and using this as a reminder to build stronger connections in my next role.",Quantum_Canoe,1,1.0,0,1744342568,2025-04-11 03:36:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jwgn7l/company_values_vs_reality_am_i_expecting_too_much/,4,2025

1jwfhbw,Pitching ideas at work?,"I work in an operations role at a tech company. No one on my team knows anything about the product or how it is developed. We are focussed on business and people operations mostly, but that's only recently - in the past it was more product focussed. 

It is a huge organization with a ton of issues and the development teams are always super stressed out. 

I've started to notice common themes with how the dev teams function and common complaints. 

I've automated a lot of my work already and don't have enough on my plate so I take on extra work from a dev team (like managing backlogs) just for the learning opportunity. 

I went to my manager with a suggestion on how I could potentially help improve operational efficiency on the dev teams but he shot me down. 

I don't think I gave a very good pitch, I was vague about the problem, and he has serious anxiety about stirring any pots on the extremely stressed out dev team. 

Should I keep working on (better) ideas to help streamline some issues on the dev team or just keep cruising? 

I'll get more professional satisfaction/learning out of having an impact instead of continuing to cruise as our team likes to do. Alternatively I could also just focus on micro solutions for the dev team that is assigning me work on the side and focus on developing my skills on that team instead of on my own team.

Basically if I leave or quit or die, the company I am with essentially loses 2 accounts I'm overseeing as per the contract agreement specifically stating my involvement. Approx. worth $500k\~

Now I found out since it was explicitly shown and told by a higher up. Which essentially screws me over for the last two years at least.

I had a conversation with my manager to express my concerns to which there is no fire lit under their bums, but more of a ""we have decided to give you a 5% raise."" Which to me on the grand scheme of things is minimal and I've also expressed. I feel anxious now more than ever since its like a total reliance on my part and direct impact. But if I direct impact positively I don't see much of a return sadly.

I'm not sure how to navigate this and would like some insight. If I quit, I burn a major bridge with a major company within my career field and would definitely lose out on long term future opportunities. For example, my employer has currently at least major coverage of the industry I am in and is expanding that at a significant rate year over year.",Butwhythus,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1744335383,2025-04-11 01:36:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jwefk4/what_happens_when_you_become_too_valuable_to/,4,2025

Current job has made me a depressed shell and not sure what to do next so just looking for any insight. 

I like some aspects of HR (training and development, employee experience) but mostly do not enjoy the field after having worked in it for 8 months. I want to be liked and feel helpful, and currently feel like all I do is tell people that they can’t do something because it’s against the rules. I also have a hard time following these rules because I find them unnecessary so that’s another reason why I don’t think I’m cut out for HR. 

I really would love to pivot to something creative in the hospitality sector, like resort management or interior design. I want to feel useful and be part of a team. I want to work a job that’s flexible and lets me see the sun and not sit behind a computer for 8 hours in a windowless office. I don’t want to deal with office politics or drama. I just want to be my authentic self and help people. 

I think I may be undiagnosed autistic and adhd, so looking for any advice on how to succeed with these traits. Also just want to hear that it gets better.

I’ve been seriously considering pursuing a paralegal certificate through Boston University, both because of the strength of their program and because I ultimately see myself building a long-term career in that space. But the challenge is, law firms seem hesitant to even consider candidates for entry-level roles like legal assistant if they don’t already have direct experience in that setting.

1jwcmgr,Requested a later start date during an interview - feel like I lost an opportunity,"Hi guys, I had an [engineering] interview yesterday that went really well (Early April). Towards the end, she asked me about my start date, and given I have a partially refundable (would cost me $400 and memories) vacation (1 week Monday-monday) with my girlfriend planned mid-may, I asked for a date at the beginning of June (but also stated that it's not a deal-breaker if I have to start earlier). 

I really like what the job looks like and think itd be really good for me. I'd be willing to start earlier and cancel the vacation if it guaranteed me the job since my girlfriend is starting a program in August in a new city, and I have 4 months to find a job in said city before her to make things much easier financially/logistically. I didn't mention this to the manager and didn't make it tooo clear that I'd be flexible if it was the difference between getting it and not getting it. It doesn't seem like there's a way to start and take pto since it's accrued.

At the very end, she said that this was the last interview and said that she thinks I'd be a good fit. However, given the time before my ""ideal start date"" (her words) in two months, she's going to leave the req open, and maybe she'll find that she needs two people instead of one for this role (again, all her words). She was very transparent with me on this.

She said she'll be in touch in about 1-2 weeks but gave me her email for any questions. I sent her a thank you with a question a few hrs after the interview yesterday and haven't received a response yet today.

It's a big company and for a relatively niche junior role (so probably not a huge rush to fill the seat). It didn't seem like she had any interviews lined up immediately based on her wording, and my resume is basically the same as the job description. 

I feel like I might have messed up my chances for a really good opportunity simply because of the start date, as Im woreied someone more experienced might apply for the role and take it from me.

I've applied to a lot of other jobs around the city and feel like there's not much more for me to apply to. I plan on sending another email once she responds to my question. I plan on indicating an earlier start date (Late May, right after my vacation), and making it clear that I can be flexible in this email. Is this the right way to go about it? I don't want to come off as desperate.

Also, if anyone has any other words of wisdom simply for my anxiety's sake, I'd really appreciate it. 


TLDR: Have a 1 week vacation with my gf planned so asked for a start date 2 months from now during my interview for a niche junior role. Interviewer said I was a good fit but is leaving the req open for now, said she'll be in touch in 1-2 weeks. Feels like I could've gotten it (and I sorta need it for easy logistics for me and my gf) if I had an earlier start date but now feel anxious I missed the opportunity.

\* 2 months released from a 1.5 year prison time served.

\* Have feelings of career-paralysis / anxiety about falling back to what i've always done vs studying for a new pathway at 40.

\* Pressure to get into full-time work in which I may lose the drive to branch off into something I am passionate about.

I am struggling coming out of prison and going on a benefit. I have been a CAD draughtsman since I was 20 and now I am 40. Luckily my workplace experience is transferable as its a skill that is versatile. However being in prison has not only given me a large break from work-life reality. Its given me time to slow down and assess my direction. I've studied various computer programming books and starting to really enjoy learning and I would love to do some part time study in software engineering. I think I want to get into something like embedded engineering. Something where my computer skills meets my love for hardware tinkering. However as I am on a job seeker benefit, I know that I will need to find myself something temporary full time to get myself back on my feet.

My biggest worry is that I will find something comfortable and then do the kind of work i've been doing my entire life and it wont challenge me. I have yet to reach out to companies or course providers. My savings have mostly gone from getting a 2016 reliable car + laptop which will help get myself back on the horse. I only have about $15k left in the bank + $40k kiwisaver.

I know if I do something physical parttime I may come home with drive to study and practice. But if I go fulltime into a job position I am used to, I will get stuck. Is there any advice someone can give regarding switching it up around my age?

1jwc25q,how do I pick?,"I'm a trans woman from Egypt. As most people would know, it's not safe for people like  me here. I'm applying to college, and I'm not sure which career path to pick. I'm very versatile, I like programming and finance and I really like biology so the main problem isn't finding my passion as I'm sure I can do well in all these fields, but knowing which career path could lead me to a country that's safe for me. 

Currently I have my eyes on Thailand (my ideal country), Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Scandinavian countries. The issue is that these countries are not the easiest to travel to. 

For bachelors, biotechnology and clinical research are hard to find jobs for and the fact that I'd have to travel constantly isn't very appealing due to my rights varying a lot in different places. As for finance, the career paths that are available (investment banking, financial analysis, project management) are pretty appealing but I'm not sure if I should take a minor or a double major and what type of minor I should take. I'm considering taking a minor in something programming related as I do have an interest in programming and it may open up remote work opportunities for me.

Finally, in the case of masters, the problem isn't deciding the subject, but where I should take it. keep in mind that I'm going to be taking my bachelor's on a scholarship and I have no funds for a master's degree, so I'll need another scholarship. My question is, are graduate scholarships abroad easier to acquire than bachelor's? because getting a scholarship from any western country as an Egyptian for a bachelor's degree is almost impossible. 

I really would appreciate not being told to just choose my passion because I really do enjoy these three subjects, and I need to pick something that can help me leave my situation as I'm in danger.

1jwbqja,Taking a Pay Cut for a Job That Feels Right—Am I Making a Mistake?,"Hi all,

I’m 23 (soon to be 24) and currently navigating a big career decision. I’ve just been offered a job for a position that aligns more closely with the direction I want to grow in long term—personal development, client success, and meaningful communication. The environment felt aligned, and I saw a real opportunity to learn and grow.

That said, the pay is $24/hr, which is a significant cut from what I was making right after college ($53K). Over the last two years, I’ve moved between a few roles—some due to instability on my part, others because the environments didn’t align with my values or goals. I’m now trying to rebuild that consistency and commit to something I can actually grow in.

I’m wondering: is it worth taking the pay cut for something that feels more aligned with my purpose? Or am I setting myself up financially for more stress down the line?

Would love any advice from those who’ve taken a similar leap, or from anyone who’s had to choose between alignment and compensation.

Thanks in advance.

I worked in consulting in Life Sciences for almost 9 years but I’m tired of constantly switching projects and politics/ being a female in IT is kinda annoying too dealing with the IT bro type personalities and being constantly looked over for being a female, especially a female of color. I’m planning on going to school for radiology technology or Physcians Assistant if I can get clinical hours, it seems like things in healthcare have better job opportunities. I’ve been laid off 3-5 times in the past 3 years (I think I’m being black balled and also do want to pursue legal action for unfair termination…) Overall I’m sick of dealing with the discrimination and job hunting, especially in todays economy. Do you think going back to school for a healthcare degree is a better option? For some context/ background I have a degree in biomedical engineering which is already a complicated degree.

1jw9zaj,Leaving company after two months. Do I bother with a two week notice?,"Started a new job about two months ago. Pretty quickly figured out I wasn’t going to be a good fit and started applying to other jobs basically immediately.

One got back to me today, and it’s a nearly $40k pay bump. They’re willing to start me on Monday.

Sooner I get on that payroll, the better (obviously). But, I’m not sure how to handle leaving my current role.

I don’t really have any critical responsibilities yet. If I left tomorrow progress on some projects would stop, but the gears would keep turning.

Do I even bother submitting a two week notice or do I just say adios. I don’t see myself working with any of these people again, I’m switching industries and it’s almost an entirely different career path altogether (data analyst —> PE associate).

Also, selfishly. I think it would be really embarrassing to show up in the office every day after putting in my two weeks.

1jw9quo,Do I get an MBA,"Hello, so here’s my situation.

I have just graduated with a bachelors last year and have been in a new job for the past few months (since January). It’s a low administrative role for a PM team on a big construction project (for a big company).

Although I am currently on the PM track, I do not think I would like to stick with it, and plan to move laterally into something like preconstruction/client relations. But i definitely want to stick in the same company. 

With this being said, I am someone that wants to grow as quick as possible, and when I say that, I mean it. Like I mean as soon as I have the chance to be promoted, I want it. Not to mention, I would like to go as high as I can as well.

Would an MBA help this in my position? When I say MBA, I mean an online program that I can while I continue working. None of the job descriptions ahead of me mention a masters, so it’s not sought after (as far as I can tell).

1jw94rw,Seeking advice!!,"Hi everyone,
I'm a 22-year-old male in the final year of my BTech in Chemical Engineering with a Minor in Management from a 2nd gen IIT. Unfortunately, I haven’t been placed yet, and I’m at a crossroads trying to figure out the best path forward. I’d really appreciate some honest advice or perspective.

Here are the options I'm considering:

1. Prepare for GATE and aim for a PSU job — 1 year prep, but not sure if I’m passionate about core jobs.


2. Prepare for SSC CGL — Job security and government tag, but not very exciting work.


3. Prepare for banking exams like SBI PO — decent pay and stability.


4. RBI Grade B — Seems like a good role, but very competitive and will take 1–2 years.


5. Upskill for 3–6 months (Python, Excel, SQL, PowerBI, etc.) and try to get a Data/Business Analyst role — feels practical and aligned with market trends, but I know it's tough to get a decent-paying job off-campus without prior experience or strong referrals.


6. CAT for MBA — Was considering this, but I don’t have work experience and I’ve heard going to IIMs as a fresher isn’t worth it.



Long-term dream: I want to start a business or a startup within the next 5–6 years. I’m also fascinated by top-paying roles in VC, PE, IB, or Management Consulting — but I don’t know if those are even realistic for someone like me.

I'm completely lost and overwhelmed with all these options. If anyone here has gone through something similar or has advice based on experience, please help.

1jw7x3r,Is it normal to have THIS many meetings and check ins?,"I (25F) have been at this nonprofit company for about 8 months now and I am unsure if this is normal or if I need to raise concern. I have 2 weekly standing meetings that are 1.5 hours each (often run over time and enter the 2-2.5 hour mark), and daily 15-30 minute check ins at EOD, AND I have to give updates multiple times a day during the day via our chat service. I also update multiple trackers to document the fine details of everything I’m doing every day. I’m owning every work stream alone with very minimal support. 

During my performance review, I scored well on everything and my “area of improvement” that the manager put down was that I was “too competent” so I know it isn’t a performance issue on my end. I’m just so frustrated because I feel like I’m being gaslit.

**My career trajectory is as follows:**

* 1st Job: Consulting Analyst - $75K

* 2nd Job: Startup Strategy Associate - $110K
* 2nd Job: Startup Strategy Senior Associate - $120K

* 3rd Job: Big Tech S&O Senior Manager - $440K. ($215K Base | $225K RSUs)

**1st Job: Early in your career always pick the option that opens more doors later down the line. (Optionality Theory)**

Optionality Theory, when applied to careers is the idea of making choices today that maximize your future flexibility. You need to be picking paths that *keep doors open*, rather than closing them too early. Classic example: choosing to study engineering in college gives you the option to be an engineer *or* pivot into business later but doing a business degree rarely lets you become an engineer. Same with careers: consulting is prized not because everyone wants to be a consultant forever, but because it gives you exposure, skills, and credibility that translate into a wide range of industries and roles later. Optionality compounds over time,  early choices that give you more options tend to lead to even *more* optionality later.  

Specifically this is important because 95% of people don’t have any idea what they actually want to do so it’s always good to get the option to pick later on. There is even value in identifying optionality in what you do at work (not just the industry/role itself).

**My Example:**  When I started in consulting leadership was goin to pigeon hole me into our Cybersecurity practice. I knew I wanted to have a broader range of skills that could be more widely applicable and I fought hard to work on more Analytics type of projects that would then be applicable to a wide variety of roles (Strategy, Data Science, Product etc.). This also allows you to catch any wave that comes up later on (e.g. AI). 

**2nd Job: Index on skills learnt and outsized responsibility vs. titles and/or company prestige (Work at Start-Ups/Smaller Companies)** 

Not all of us are lucky enough to get into a Google or Goldman Sachs right out of college, so in order to break into the top companies that pay the most, you need to work somewhere non-brand name BUT do a lot of things so much so that your variety of experiences should that exceed that of someone in a similar role at a bigger company. Early in your career, the fastest way to accelerate is to put yourself in environments where you *do more than your job description*. Startups are a great way to do this. 

**My Example:** I joined early at a series B start up and was the first member on a team with barely any resources. Basically wore like 5 hats, solve real problems, and as a result got early promotions based on the impact I drove. I did everything from sales, analytics, strategy to even some of the product work and it was great time. This 0-1 experience is actually what made my third company hire me. (Not making this up they told me post interview). 

**3rd Job: Identify high growth industries and/or high growth teams and target (Try to catch Macro/Micro Tailwinds)** 

In other words — target high-growth industries or high-growth teams, because growth creates opportunity. When an industry or team is growing fast, new roles, projects, and promotions naturally appear. It’s much easier to level up when you’re in an environment with momentum (vs. a stagnant one where you’re fighting for scraps). This applies at both the macro level (AI, climate tech, healthcare, fintech) and the micro level (joining a small but fast-growing team inside a big company). If you did #1 and #2 correctly you should have some ability to choose where you go mid-career, at this point you will want to either select (A) a normal team/role at a company that is a booming industry (example: Project Manager at an AI company) or (B) a very high growth team within a more mature/stagnant company (example: Krogers new division for a new product line that is quickly expanding). Ideally you have both. 

**My Example:** I joined a newer / fast growing division of an already large public tech company. The division had nothing to do with any of my previous subject matter expertise, they just need smart people who go crunch numbers and manage other people to get things done (I had never worked on these types off problems before). I chose the team because it was more of a 0-1 type of role that had runway to expand into the future and because of that my compensation/promotion timeline has reflected that as the team grows year over year. 

**Bonus #4: Performance is 50/50 Perception and actual execution.** 

The sad truth is work politics matters and first impressions matter. At a baseline you need to be good at your job and need to be able to execute, these are table stakes. But the degree with which you have to work (e.g. how much your work life balance suffers) depends a lot on your perception as a hard worker. If you can make people perceive that you are good / hard worker you have a lot more room to slack off. This usually comes from making a really good first impression (e.g. work really hard your first 3-5 months when meeting a new team/boss) then coasting after. ",Krooai,0,0.4399999976158142,18,1744315393,2025-04-10 20:03:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jw7axw/best_advice_that_helped_be_6x_my_income_75k_to/,4,2025

This other company was willing to take some employees, which they have given agreements out. It is a slower transition, and there is no start date for the new job that has been accepted.

Options are 
- Pursue similar career with new company (job is physically demanding and im not happy doing it but pays decent)
- Do another role within current company (rumours of more downsizing after moving)
-  Get Layed off and take a severance (which you would think is decent for how many years ive worked) and i wouldnt have to commute and be closer to family. Small town doesn't have as high paying jobs but taking a big paycut and switching  careers has been worth doing for some people.

1jw6x1v,1 Week Notice - difficult timeline,"I think for the first time in my life, I have a good opportunity while working a decent job. I don't want to mess it up.

I like my current job, it is probably the best one I have had. The ideal manager, who encourages and supports me, and values my work. I do a lot of research on my own time, and my manager provides the time and tools I need to apply it at work, and the position is aligned with my career path. The ideal work life balance. The only issue is the salary and growth - the salary is $30 an hour, so I am underpaid for my skills, and there will be no promotions in this company. I am also old and got fucked over enough to know that things can always change. 

I just signed a job offer on Monday with a start date in 2 weeks, and they haven't really communicated since then. I am nervous, due to the economy in the USA. This new job pays a bit more, with paths for promotion. In exchange, there is less time off, less work life balance, and probably more evenings working.

I plan on waiting 1 week, then giving my manager 1 week notice. I would like to ask my manager for reference if needed in the future. I have already finished most of my projects, and created how-to guides for anyone who needs to use the projects I have built - but I have basically idiot-proofed them. If there is a chance to do so, I would be open to working for my manager part time, or returning in the future if anything changes. 

Does anyone with more experience have advice?

I am in my early 40's, but changed fields into tech, so I am much older - many of my colleagues seem fresh out of college, while managers have been the same age as me. Because I am  new to the field, and don't have the same industry experience and network as college graduates, I have a really hard time applying to jobs and getting interviews (but have exceeded metrics once I get the job). I keep getting entry level roles at start ups, and have been laid off from each, and I think that my age and experience makes me more vulnerable to changes in the economy. This is the first time I am getting an offer while employed, so I am not sure how to go about it.",No_Tuna,19,0.9200000166893005,7,1744314454,2025-04-10 19:47:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jw6x1v/1_week_notice_difficult_timeline/,4,2025

I know bad management is nothing new in this industry, but this guy genuinely seems to get off on disrespecting people.

Recently, I asked for a basic employment contract — something that outlines *my* rights as an employee. In response, he screamed at me over the phone for 45 minutes and told me to “use my brain.” Instead of a contract, he tried to force me to sign a “policy manual” that was basically just a list of *their* rights as employers. No joke — it was all rules for us, zero accountability for them. When I pushed back, he threatened my job.

He constantly expects people to be available 24/7, blows up your phone if you can’t cover a shift last-minute, and throws tantrums when you say no. He’s cut people’s hours with no explanation and keeps hiring more staff while shortchanging the ones who’ve stuck it out.

Everyone I work with agrees he’s toxic, but the owner is completely MIA and wouldn’t do anything even if she was around. There’s no one above him to hold him accountable.

Some context: 

I’m currently feeling burned out with work, putting in 10-12 hour days, and honestly, I don’t like my job anymore. I’m really ready for a change and not just switching companies, but transitioning to a new career path altogether. The problem is, I’m struggling to find the time for self-discovery and need guidance on how to navigate this shift. 

My career has been all over the place – I’ve jumped jobs every couple of years and worked in multiple industries, so my resume is a bit of a mess at this point.

I’ve always been interested in getting a career coach, and lately, I’ve been seeing ads for Strawberry Career Coaching on Instagram. From what I’ve seen, they seem to have decent reviews on Reddit and Trustpilot. The cost is $70 per week, but my company also offers EAP coaching services.

1jw5fij,Considering dropping out of my PGCE,"So I'm 24m living in rural England near Manchester. Since September I've been studying my PGCE in Primary Education, during my first placement I was in a KS2 class and I honestly loved it, work felt purposeful and I had such a good bond with both of the classes in that year, I would come back home with a smile on my face and I felt fulfilled. Don't get me wrong behaviour management was an ongoing target and I was told that the boys saw me more as a friend than a teacher but I still felt confident that I could improve in the future.

Now since starting my placement in KS1 at a different school I no longer have that drive or motivation, my mentor is blunt with her feedback telling me if I don't improve after the Easter break I'm going to be at risk of failure, I find the class challenging due to the high percentage of class with SEND needs and I struggle with behaviour management. Over the Easter break I've been really torn and confused on what I'm doing with my life and if teaching is for me, the idea of going to back to this school fills me with dread and anxiety, I no longer go into placement with confidence and fulfilment.

In 2023 I graduated with a 2.2 in business with accounting and finance, after that I worked as an activity instructor for two years with voluntary experience in South Africa as a teaching assistant and sport coach before starting my PGCE. Honestly if it weren't for the money I would want to stay activity instructing, I enjoy working outside during the Spring/Summer and miss this at the moment however most roles are seasonal. 

Some part of me is considering dropping out or postponing studies to next year because I'm really not enjoying this experience right now and I'm no longer confident if I would make a good teacher. However, I don't want this past year to go to waste and walk away without the QTS. 

My main goal for the next two years is to move out into Manchester, this is where all of my friends from home are moving to and I like the idea of living in a city. I've been considering getting into banking or look at something that involves my undergraduate although my 2.2 grade and experience may limit my chances as most jobs I've looked at require a 2.2. Also I really fucked around in university and not sure how much I actually got out from my degree. 

I'm just very confused on what I want out of life right now and what my future looks like, I miss having money that I worked hard for, I want a job that's not minimum wage and can support rent, I need a kick in the right direction.

My sister just became a nurse and will be making more then me on her first job. I dont know if I could handle being a nurse, but I always though I was the one in my family making the lucrative choice to pursue IT.

1jw4ph1,What do you think about AI interview cheating tools?,"Recently, I’ve come across a lot of discussions about interview coders, especially after the founder was criticized by Columbia University and Amazon. There are also several products that assist candidates by showing real-time answers based on the recruiter’s questions. It sounds like, for candidates who get interview invitations, there’s almost no need to prepare anymore, they just need to practice acting natural in front of the interviewer while using these tools.   
  
I’m starting to question the meaning of all those sleepless nights I spent so much time grinding LeetCode and ended up with a learning notes as thick as a textbook, and I clicked extension thousands of times to predict interview questions for the hundreds of jobs I applied to on LinkedIn. All the time I spent on refining answers, practicing, and even the whole career coaching industry or college career centers. I’m really starting to wonder if it was all worth it.

1jw3wq9,I don’t know how to feel about this,"
hi, I was approached some time ago to work in the special education. I am a speech therapist and normally I work 1 on 1 with a client. However, within this school I was assigned a class of 5 kids. So I would be working in a classroom setting, along with a teaching assistant. The goal was to encourage speech and language skills and communication. The children are non verbal and very autistic, ages 4-6. When I started it suddenly turned out to be 7 children instead of 5 (I had not been told this). There were no toys in the class even though the class had started a month earlier. There was no onboarding, no one knew what the intention was and I had to figure everything out on my own.The assistant couldn't tell me much either, she just returned after a burnout. I had no access to children's files (only after 4 days).Parents had been told that I was on vacation for a month and therefore did not attend earlier (I was still working at my former employer, why say I was on vacation???).

After 2 days the assistant got sick, apparently she had just started again after a burnout, but again she was not doing well. Then a teacher came into the classroom, this was nice because for the first time I saw how it worked in a classroom. The next day another assistant was put with me, but she had started the same day as me..we were both new and didn't know much yet. The next day I was all alone in a group of 7 children. Totally irresponsible and not okay towards the parents and children.I had to entertain these children without toys.

I indicated that I have no experience with a class, since you normally work 1 on 1, and that I do need something of help/help. I also indicated that I was surviving and did not experience the first week as positive. My supervisor was quite light-hearted about this.She indicated that this is normal and everyone feels this way the first 6 weeks.Then I was asked how I wanted to work towards the goals of this class, I indicated that treatment materials should be provided first.“Oh, we may have to order that...indeed there are no toys,” was her reply. Then she said “maybe we should sit down next week to discuss things”.

Colleagues were not okay with me not receiving guidance and said there should be a teacher in front of the group instead of a speech therapist (and on reflection, I agreed).I have no experience in a classroom setting and much more was covered than just language development, speech and communication. Behavioral problems etc., personal care (1 day I was just wiping butts). There were many employees with burnout, a lot of employee turnover.Not much seemed right about the organization.The supervisor said “you don't really need to do anything with the kids”.

After my first week, I immediately quit and left. The lack of treatment materials/toys, no supervision, onboarding, lack of communication. It all didn't feel right and thats where my decision was based on. Now looking back, I'm thinking: should I gave it more time? Maybe I would have get used to it. I don't know.

Let me hear your opinions.

1jw32l4,How do I tell my employer I'm looking to go back to law school?,"I did an LL.M. in Maritime Law back in 2023, and recently changed to a new job in February. The role isn’t legal, and while I like certain aspects of it, I’ve realized that not being able to sit for the bar is really bothering me. I’m now seriously considering going back to school for a JD.

When I took this job, my employer was a bit hesitant to hire me since I’m a foreign-trained attorney because they assumed I’d leave quickly. Truth is, I can’t just leave because I’m on a work visa tied to them. But I’ve also realized that I do want to move forward in my career, and that probably means law school.

The company is a family-owned business, and people do tend to move on eventually since there’s not much long-term growth. Still, I’ve only been here a couple of months, and I’m not sure how or when to bring this up to them.

Any advice on how to approach this conversation without burning bridges or making it sound like I’m jumping ship right away?

I have a wonderful supervisor who I really like and like my coworkers. My supervisor the other day said he sees me leading a city and wants to mentor me to get there. The negatives are that I wear 4-5 different hats and only get to focus 40% of my time on my actual profession which is communications and engagement. It’s pretty stressful at times and I could use support but I won’t get any due to lack of resources. I also have young toddlers and would love to have a more flexible schedule so that I can be more present with them. I did talk to my supervisor recently about coming in at 9am so I can drop my kids at school every day once they start. They agreed but are going to take a week of vacation away. I’ll be working 9am-5pm. I also work some nights and weekends. 

There is a part time comms job open right now that I’m considering applying for. Still offers a fantastic retirement package and health benefits for me and independents too. It is farther away, 30-40 minute commute but my sole focus would be communications. I also have a feeling I can work remotely some days. It would be a lot less stressful. Cons are I would be farther from home and would face a significant decrease in pay going part time. And I’d lose a mentor and upward career trajectory. Pros are slower pace of life and time with my kids.

1jw28vj,Quitting My Dream Job,"For the past few years I have had the kind of job that I never thought I would have. The kind that sounds SO GOOD on paper and my whole family is proud to talk about when it comes up with other people. Great for my ego after not working at all for many years when my kids were young. Feels like a culmination of something I have loved my whole life. The problem is that on the inside it has been rough for most of the time I have been in it. An unkind, impossibly demanding, disorganized boss, long hours, low pay (sometimes up to 30 hours unpaid overtime in a week). Recently due to some structural changes in the company, what little hope I had for advancement has completely evaporated. If certain circumstances were different (if I was younger, lived somewhere else, etc) I would stick it out. But for now if I stay, this is my role and my boss for the next 20 years until I retire, unless something unprecedented happens.

It hasn't been all bad. I love the group I work with. I like my boss as a person, I would actually be happy to stay friends if I dont have to report to/deal with them daily. I have some nice perks like occasional travel. I have 20-25% good days. But I also think about my kids and what advice I would give them if they were in this situation - I would absolutely tell them to leave if they aren't happy. Life is finite. No guarantees. Don't waste time in a role that makes you unhappy and physically unwell. I worry that by staying I am setting a bad example.

I am thinking of quitting and working part time. I would make 50% less to start but work 75% less hours. I would be outside, not stuck at a desk. The budget would be tight but, to be honest, my partner's income (which is more than triple mine currently) does the heavy lifting. I need some income and would eventually like to grow beyond this part-time entry position but I feel more optimistic about my chances there than where I am now. Still, it is a sad idea. This could be my one shot at working in a glamourous industry. Also my partner, though supportive in general, isn't thrilled about the loss of income or the idea of having to be strict about tightening our belts for it. They wont say no or that I shouldn't leave, but they aren't sold yet.

I studied political science in undergrad and don't have a business degree. I come from a family of lawyers who run their own practice, and the plan was always for me to go straight to law school after college to join their practice. But I backed out because I was afraid I wouldn't like it.
Now I'm nervous that I won't be able to make the kind of money I want. People always say, ""Do what you love,"" but the older I get, the more I see how important money is — not just for status or security, but for the freedom to enjoy the things I love outside of work.

1jw0n33,Getting back into frontend development after a long break — looking for guidance,"As a 38-year-old person, I’m feeling a little stuck right now and could really use some advice and support as I try to get back into frontend development.

A few years ago, I worked in startup environments where I wore many hats — from coding (HTML, CSS, some JavaScript) to handling HR tasks, gathering client requirements, and managing projects. I also had some hands-on experience with Angular, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. But because I had to juggle so many responsibilities, I never got the chance to fully focus on one area or build deep confidence in my coding skills.

Eventually, I moved to Canada and took a warehouse job to manage my living expenses while settling in. At that point, I didn’t feel confident enough to apply for tech roles. Later, I explored UI/UX design since I had some past experience with tools like Figma and Adobe XD. I completed a few online courses, built a portfolio, and even went to some interviews here in Canada.

Now, I feel drawn back to frontend development, especially Angular. But it's been 5 years since I last wrote code, and I’m not sure where or how to begin again.

Here are a few things I’m struggling with:

* I haven’t coded in years — how do I restart from scratch and rebuild confidence?
* Are there still opportunities for beginner or returning frontend developers in today’s market?
* How do I stay relevant with all the new changes, including the rise of AI tools?
* Can you recommend any good learning resources or structured paths for relearning Angular (YouTube channels, projects, exercises)?
* A lot of jobs ask for real-world or enterprise-level project experience. How do I tackle that if I’m restarting?

1jvy862,CFA Lv3 candidate—Is UTS Master of Quant Finance worth it for getting a finance job in Australia?,"**Hi everyone,**

I'm a Korean national with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Finance specialization) from the U.S. I've passed CFA Level 1, and I'm on track to complete Level 2 this May. I plan to finish Level 3 before completing my master's degree.

I have about 1.5 years of experience working at a small investment firm, and I'm currently considering applying to the **Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance** program at **UTS**. I was hoping to get some insights from anyone familiar with the program or the Australian finance industry.

Here are a few questions I have:

1. **Job prospects in finance** – Assuming I complete CFA Level 3 before graduating, what are the realistic chances of securing a job in Australia's finance sector as an international student?
2. **Reputation of UTS** – How is UTS perceived in the finance industry compared to G8 universities?
3. **Internship opportunities** – How feasible is it for international students to land internships while studying in this program?
4. **UTS Master of Math and Quant Finance program** – What do you think of the program overall? Does it have strong connections with the finance industry? or should I consider a different program from target schools(unsw, usyd, umelb)?

Any advice, experiences, or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",beep_bo,2,1.0,1,1744292588,2025-04-10 13:43:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvy862/cfa_lv3_candidateis_uts_master_of_quant_finance/,4,2025

Combination of work and personal things.

My duo told me it's okay to be honest with HR since I don't want to work the job anymore.

I would then ask HR how to solve this situation?

Also, I'm currently enrolled in a Python bootcamp (soon will enroll in a full-stack bootcamp so I can start builting my portfolio website).

1jvwh4z,Indecisive about MSW,"Hey everyone, just wanted your advice on this. So it’s always been a long term goal of mine from college to be a clinician. I started an LMHC program in 2022 but soon realized that a MSW program matches my career/personal goals more. But since I had already started the LMHC program I decided to stick with it until it came to the internship part. I was coming across difficulties trying to complete it because I was working full time and was not allowed to do it at my job within my job functions. It was overwhelming at the time and I figured that because the program wasn’t the best fit for me anyways, to close out my degree with a masters in Psychology. I graduated with that and kept it moving but I’ve still had this goal because I still work in mental health but of course not making the money I want. 

What I want to ask is if it is worthwhile to go back to school and get my MSW. This will take 3 years part time. I will still work full time. I have enrolled in a state school so it’s more affordable, I might would have to take out small loans but I also plan to pay for some tuition out of pocket and through scholarships. 

I also want to ask about the pay. I see that a lot of clinicians I have worked with have 2+ jobs. Why is this? Is it because one of the jobs do not pay enough? And how much of a pay increase will I get with an MSW. I’m making mid 60s right now. I have thought about this so much and I’m ready to just stick to a plan. I’ve gotten advice from others to go for it, but others are saying that I can find other ways to make money in my career. I do enjoy helping people, it’s been a passion of mine but I also worry about burnout and vicarious trauma. Thoughts?

1jvwb0u,Semiconductor validation engineer looking to transistion to developer role,"Hi all,

I am a semiconductor validation engineer ( currently searching for new jobs after getting laid off)

I want to transition into a career into a dev role

Like a small backstory about me

Joined BTech in 14 and completed in 19(backpapers) . After clearing btech I joined  a institute and did a course on Data science foundations and I continued as a intern there for 6 months doing multiple projects( couple of chat bots) while I was searching for data science and dev jobs also. Then I got the opportunity to join UST as a semiconductor validation engineer so I joined as there was a bit of family pressure for a job and personally I was devastated for not getting a job worked as a validation engineer for 4.11 years. In this role I used python in a small way to develop test scripts( not much) and developed a django dashboard for my team to track projects.

Now since I am jobless I am looking to get back into validation or QA roles (as it is the easiest path) (6 interviews done didn’t cut it) I need a job fast due to emi’s

So once I join back into validation I want to discover my passion by transistioning into developing

So is there any way I can do that considering I am experienced in 5 years of validation

I was thinking courses certifications and projects

Any other tips

1jvw8sp,I quit after 10 months and I’m spiraling looking for perspective,"Hey everyone,  
A friend recommended I post here. I recently gave notice at my job after 10 months, and I’m really second-guessing myself even though I *know* it was the right move.

I worked at a small startup in a small tech ecosystem. I liked the people a *lot*, but I just never clicked with the product. It started affecting my energy, focus, and general drive—I’d show up late, avoid work, and just felt completely disconnected. That’s really not like me.

Today, I gave my 30 days' notice to the CTO. She was disappointed and said I should’ve raised a flag earlier and that 10 months isn’t enough time to evaluate a job. And… maybe she’s right. That part’s really weighing on me.  
But who want to raise a flag? it's like saying fire me next?

To be clear, I wasn’t fired. I left on good terms I found another opportunity at a company I actually care about (coincidentally the one that acquired my old company a while back). They offered me more money and a better fi so logically, things are working out.

But emotionally? I feel like crap Really! Like I bailed too early. Like I failed some invisible test. Like I burned a bridge.

Has anyone else gone through something like this?  
How did you move past the guilt and doubt?  
Is leaving after 10 monthss really that bad in tech anymore?

1jvw8im,I think I am about to be fired from my job or they are trying to get me to quit. What are signs you're about to be fired? Am I just being paranoid?,"I'm working my first job ever. I've been at this job for over a year. It's a retail job. Recently, my instinct has given me a bad feeling that I am about to be fired. There's three warning signs I've noticed. First is out of nowhere I got my hours cut massively. I used to work 4 or 5 days a week. Then out of nowhere for the past 3 weeks I've only been working 2 days a week and less then half of the hours I used to work. One day I arrived at work and still had a few minutes before I needed to clock in. I went to use the bathroom and on my way there a co worker mentioned something to me. They said something to me about me about to be getting fired. It was very random and it massively caught me off guard. I kind of tried to act calm, but it made me worry a lot. Like a week after this happened, my hours began to get cut. At this job I've never been written up before so I'm not sure if it's some kind of performance problem. 

The entirety of 2025 I never had a manager pull me aside and say hey your performance is a major issue or anything like that. I've never been late to this job either. Despite all this, my hours have been massively cut randomly. The third bad sign is that I also compared my hours to my co workers and have noticed my co workers in my department are getting 4 or 5 days a week and the company has suddenly hired like 3 to 4 new people in my department. I've started looking for a job since I just have a bad feeling. What are the warning signs I need to be looking out for if they're trying to fire me? I've read warning signs are you start getting written up a lot, your co-workers and bosses starting acting distant towards you or they start being very mean to you in hopes of getting you to quit. I've noticed most of my bosses and co-workers are still acting friendly and normal towards me though. Am I just being too paranoid or am I about to probably be getting fired? If I find out they are trying to make me to quit should I quit or let myself be fired?

1jvvtm5,Would like some advice on a pretty big decision,"So I (37 male) have been looking for a job since January after being let go from my previous position. I was working for a company who is a cloud provider and was working in the Microsoft division giving partner support. I worked at the company for almost 3 years and in that position for 2. Since I was let go, I have been mostly looking for more general IT/help desk jobs. I got a decent amount of initial interviews or just straight passes.

But this past week I have had 3 interviews at 3 different companies, all at varying knowledge levels. Now I don't really have any formal IT training, it's been mostly self-taught through my PC building hobby and general interest in the subject matter. I am going to have to make a decision between the three companies.

Choice one: Lowest pay, to start, would be a tier 1 help desk agent. This position will be more working on basics and fundamentals with an emphasis on learning and growing in the field to become a potential specialist. This would be a very start from the bottom and work your way up approach.

Choice two: Possibly the highest pay, working at a relatively young startup in their help desk team. From what I understand it is quite active and would be good for on-the-fly learning, which I think I'm good at, but a little intense. Will probably have a lot of projects to work on too, which I might not necessarily have a lot of experience with. Very much start from the middle and work up.

Choice three: Would be working for a cyber security company with one of their clients who wants an in house IT person. This would be the closest thing to like becoming an instant Jr. Sysadmin and working towards being a Sysadmin. It would also be quite the plunge into the deep end, but I think I am confident enough to keep my head above the water. Straight deep dive.

I guess the main advice I'm looking for is if I should focus more on learning and fundamentals first or try to go for the deeper dive, considering my age. I think up until now I have been lost on what I have wanted to do as a career and this is the direction I want to go in, but just wanted to hear from some outside sources.

I live in Southern California with street vendors everywhere selling tacos, hotdogs and whatnot. Is it a good idea to try to sell them lemonade in “bulk” im thinking 30 for 5 gallons is fair but should I charge more or less? I only have to pay for sugar because the lemon tree and I have a water filtration machine so I would only be paying for sugar. I still have to sit and make the lemonade so there’s the “labor” but I’m still trying to make money while not ripping the vendors off because I have respect for them and don’t want to do bad business. Also would 2 dollars for a 8 fluid oz cup be fair to sell at my stand? 
Side note I’m also thinking of selling quesadillas with Oaxaca cheese which is authentic (I’m Mexican) and they cost around 1.5-2.5 dollars to make depending on where I buy my ingredients. It depends because I would have to walk and I don’t want to the ingredients to go bad in the heat while I walk back home. So how much should I charge for a plain quesadilla. I was thinking 4 dollars each and 7 for 2. Then maybe with the lemonade have it for 2 dollars and have a “meal deal” type thing with a quesadilla and lemonade for 5.

I graduated in 2023 from my university, where I was on the Dean’s List and likely in the top 5% based on CGPA.

1jvsbqy,Breach of Right to Rest?,"Not sure if this is the right sub but I had a new manager start over the winter and I’ve had a few issues with him involving shift patterns going against labour and rest laws.

I work in retail and before he went live following induction and training I explained that, because I commute via train, there’s a day a week I can’t cash up. Busses where I am are infrequent at best and the last bus leaves about 3 hours before we close up shop for this particular day. The train isn’t for over an hour until I leave. We have late night opening on Thursdays, closing at 8:15pm. I won’t be walking back through my door until 10pm-10:30pm, depending on delays. No problem usually, except that I’m in for a delivery at 6am the following day. Again, on its own not a problem. 

The issue is that it leaves me with less rest time than is legally required between shifts and a 7 day uninterrupted working week. This is something that has happened a couple times before and I raised it each time, only to be told “that’s a you problem” or “that’s not my problem”

I just wanted to know if I’ll be in the right to go above my line manager to the regional manager. I don’t want to cause issues but, after speaking to my colleagues, I’m the only person that is having these issues. I’m a supervisor so it may be different and I’m in the UK, if that helps. Employers are required by law to allow an 11 hour rest period between shifts. So, finishing at 8:15pm, I shouldn’t be back on shift until 7:15am the following day.

I have screenshots of the shift patterns as proof, I’m trying to locate my contract and relevant policies on the employee portal too. I have been actively looking for a new job closer to home too.

1jvs3el,Is degree from a top university a major deciding factor when looking for a job abroad? (US/UK/Aus),"I’ve decided to switch my career and due to a good amount of work experience in Dentistry and a masters in it I have the opportunity to get selected to top universities. But this also means that I’ll have to apply for a scholarship or take out a loan, in which case ROI becomes a big factor. Since I’m 34/F and any degree in the field of  my liking will finish by 35-36, after which I’ll be looking for a job. My question is, is it worth it to keep repaying a loan after 36, as I’m hoping to start being financially stable after that. Should I apply to universities that fulfil the basic criteria and are not top 10 in the world, manage my finances with less loan and then go to work in US/UK where the pay is good? Maybe I can get an opportunity through a multinational company if I’m luck enough to get recruited..

Please give me what is reality after any masters. I’m looking at MPH/MHA/MBA with health and MPA currently.",BeginningSurprise308,2,1.0,0,1744269798,2025-04-10 07:23:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvs3el/is_degree_from_a_top_university_a_major_deciding/,4,2025
1jvrqd2,"career switch at 25 : from geology to design and marketing, advice or guidance?","Hi everyone,  
I am F 25, and currently navigating a career pivot—and to be honest, it’s a lot. It’s overwhelming, uncertain, and sometimes exciting too. I did my **master’s in Geology**, but I knew early on that wasn’t *my path*. What *does* light me up is creativity, storytelling, psychology, problem solving—things I found rooted in **UI/UX design, visual design, and digital marketing**. So I started learning. Bit by bit. From scratch.

I recently landed a **graphic design internship**, where I’m working on marketing campaigns and creating content. Simultaneously, I’ve been offered a chance to help with **social media strategy and content for a startup** (run by someone I trust). I also keep hearing from people that I’m a good communicator, and I’m starting to believe that strength could become part of my professional toolkit too. I’m beginning to see how that, too, can play into building **reels**, **content**, and **brand narratives**—especially in a startup environment.

I’m hoping to:

* Build a **portfolio** that combines visual design, strategy, and communication
* Apply for **UI/UX and creative roles** and get a high paying job by October or November of this year. (I am willing to work my ass off)
* Become **financially independent in 2025**, doing work that feels aligned and future-ready and to create the kind of mental peace I’ve never had, to move away from a toxic environment, and to build a life where I can breathe, grow, and thrive.

If you’re someone who’s pivoted careers, especially into product/design/content/marketing, I’d love to learn:

* How did you blend different skills into one cohesive career story?
* What helped you stay consistent and focused during early exploration?
* How do you position yourself as a generalist with strengths in design + marketing + communication?

But here’s the vulnerable part: I often wonder, *“Can I really do this?* \*”\*Is it too late to switch?  
Can I keep up with how fast everything’s changing—especially with AI reshaping the game?

I know I have a long way to go. I know I’m building multiple skills—design, marketing, communication—and I still need clarity. But I’m not afraid of learning.  
I just need a little **guidance**, a few **stories from people who’ve been here**, and maybe someone to say, “Hey, I see you. And yes, you’re on the right track.”

So if you’ve made a similar pivot—or you’re in product design, marketing, content, or early startup roles:

* How do you manage the fear of not knowing enough or being late to the game?
* What helped you stay consistent when your *why* was big but your confidence was shaky especially cause you feel the pressure to get out of a toxic place?

I’m here, showing up anyway.  
And if you are too, I’d love to hear your story.",skeptical_nerd,2,1.0,2,1744268223,2025-04-10 06:57:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvrqd2/career_switch_at_25_from_geology_to_design_and/,4,2025
1jvrizf,Feeling Stuck After Years of Struggle – What Should I Do Next with My Career and Education?,"I’m writing this because I’m at a point in life where I feel completely stuck, and I could really use some guidance.

I completed my 12th in 2017 and spent four years preparing for NEET, but unfortunately, I couldn't clear it. In 2021, I took admission in a BSc program and recently graduated in 2024. Since final year I started working as a teacher, for 2 years I worked as a teacher but now I feel like my life has become stagnant.

Every time I look back, I see years passing by while my peers have moved ahead in life. I’ve always been a mediocre student — not great, not terrible — but I never realized how much that mediocrity could cost me. Now I feel like I’m so far behind, and I don’t know what direction to take next.

Despite all this, I still want to continue my education. I want a good education, a decent salary, and a life that I can be proud of. I’m thinking about pursuing a master’s degree abroad with a fully funded scholarship, but I don’t know if that’s even possible for someone like me.

If studying abroad really is the right choice for me, then what steps should I be taking right now to make that happen? What kind of master’s programs should I look into? Which countries or scholarships are realistic for someone with my background?

Is it too late? Is it unrealistic? I’d be really grateful if someone could share some insights or suggest possible paths I can consider.

1jvq89t,Lost in Early Career -- Want to Get out of Games,"Warning: Long Post Ahead:



Hi everyone! I was recently laid off in a mass-firing event and have been rethinking my career, so I wanted to get ideas on what to do next. New account because some of this info could be identifying and doxing bad etc.

During highschool I did a lot of web design stuff, culminating in an internship where I got to meet people, discuss their needs, and design UX/UI for a mobile application. I eventually got hired on there and worked there until I graduated. This was enjoyable -- I liked the tactile nature of the discussion, brainstorming, and iterating with customers.

In college, I got involved in a couple research projects where I did Unity C# code for VR. I did one short stint exploring smells in VR for Alzheimer's research, and one much longer project exploring AR navigation UI for astronauts with NASA. During the second project I was a C# programmer, then the team lead. Again, the brainstorming was the most fun, including a 30 page technical paper that I wound up writing to get project approval from NASA and our grant people, but I also enjoyed implementing mechanics into code. We did a bunch of outreach as well, but I wasn't really a fan of pitching our project to outsiders, conferences, etc.

During this time, I also served as a peer mentor. I enjoyed the problem-solving of creating a remote learning environment during Covid, and the one-on-one sessions with confused students. I was told that I was good at teaching, and I really enjoyed it as well.

I graduated with a B.S. degree in Game Dev and a certificate in Business from Harvard Business School online, as well as a cert in Android App Dev. I think that this was largely a mistake.

My first job out of college was a consulting gig where I built a web app for a friend of mine. Although figuring out the tech specs from his copious ideas (built over decades in the consulting industry) was super fun, the implementation dragged on and on and on and became a nightmare. I actually got depressed by the end of it. I don't think that coding is for me if I'm not on a team. I did learn a lot about python development and web applications, though.

Finally, my most recent job. I got a bottom-of-the-barrel Games QA job, because it was/is(?) my childhood dream to create videogames. I quickly learned the ropes and began onboarding new testers until we had a full team. Lots of attention-to-detail work and bug reporting/regression, which was fun. I got promoted pretty quickly to a more management position (although that's largely because I was already coordinating testers for adhoc tests anyways). I wrote a lot of test plans and pages of documentation, synced with the game devs, and otherwise thrived in this weird sort of middle territory. Figuring out what needed to be done (discussion with devs and review of documents), breaking it down into chunks, and presenting the neat chunks to the testers and supporting them through the workday was satisfying. I also got the opportunity to do some side projects with data visualization with python, which I enjoyed. However! one thing that I did not enjoy was, ironically, the games industry itself. The passion just wasn't there, because it was someone else's game, which is the whole point of being in the games industry in the first place. Games is rather exploitative, with low pay, high stress, and lots of job instability. Which is kind of the 'devil's deal' that everyone knows going into games, but after working in it for a time I realized that the team matters a lot more than the work, which matters a lot more than the dream.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone had ideas what I might do next? I wouldn't mind going back to school, but I'd much prefer a career shift that doesn't take too much training to get into (or any, preferably). I think I want out of games, especially in the current market. I'm U.S. based but could be interested in expanding my horizons. 



Especially interested in job titles/fields that seem in-line with what I've been doing that maybe I don't know about (assume I know nothing).

1jvq6r4,Trying to get career back on track after hitting rock bottom,"TLDR: Lost my job in 2021 (as a designer) after divorce and addiction issues. Moved in with parents but my shortly after my father was diagnosed with cancer and ultimately passed. Wasn't in a place that I could bring my A-game to my career for the past 4 years. Have a huge gap on my resume. NOW I've got my addiction issues under control and motivated to get back on track. But insecure about my career hiatus. Wondering if - because I'm a designer - listing ""freelance"" is ok? I had a couple design gigs and also have been taking an online course. But otherwise I've been working at restaurant jobs and other entry-level jobs to pay the bills - should I mention that at all? Any advice on what absolutely NOT to say? Any insight into what recruiters might actually respect that I'm insecure about??

Long Story: Pre-pandemic, I worked as a designer for 10 years. My last full-time job, I was making good money but had a mental breakdown (this was 2018). I stayed at the job for a few more years but it was toxic and highly stressful the entire time. Then in 2021, I decided to get a divorce and also jumped right into a toxic relationship where substance abuse was involved; I struggled with addiction from that point. Divorce, chaotic relationship and substance abuse obviously affected my performance and I ended up losing my job also in 2021. I eventually moved away from the toxic relationship and in with my parents but soon after I got home, my father was diagnosed with cancer - I tried to help my parents while also trying to heal myself which was really rough. He ultimately passed away recently.

Especially since 2021, I haven't been in a place that I could bring my A game to a career. But now my addiction issues are under control and I'm really eager to get back to work. (I know the economy is rough right now, too).

Since I've had a couple design gigs, I've put in ""freelancing"" even though it's literally been like 2 gigs. Is that terrible to lie? Should I just leave it as a gap with some kind of explanation (like ""career break"")? I know people would understand illness and death in a family BUT that wasn't my full-time thing. I wasn't officially my dad's caretaker for the entire time and I feel like people handle these things while still working?? I'm not sure? I also just don't feel great about using that as some kind of excuse when it's only part of the story - have a lot of shame around addiction. I have been taking an online course for design which I guess I can add? Should I mention or leave out working at unrelated work places (like restaurants and whatnot)? The few interviews I've had, people don't seem to ask a whole lot of questions about a gap but once in a while, if they ask about availability and I haven't told them I'm working part-time at a restaurant, I get kind of tripped up. I don't know if, during interviews, I should just be up front about unrelated work. Or if that is a huge turn-off for potential employers? Any and all advice would help - even things I'm not asking. I just want to get back in the game.",Chemical_Result6413,2,1.0,3,1744261869,2025-04-10 05:11:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvq6r4/trying_to_get_career_back_on_track_after_hitting/,4,2025
1jvq4mm,Would it make sense to continue interviewing after starting a new job?,"After working as a temp engineer for 6 months right out of college and many interviews later I landed a full time job with good pay benefits and they even gave me a relocation bonus. Problem is after working there I find out my office is usually empty and they’re cutting the budget on an already small budget and the job is kind of boring.

I’m grateful to have a full time job right now but it’s frustrating that there’s no real mentorship and I’m basically just sitting in my cubicle on my phone for half the day because i’m waiting on another person and that i moved to the area for the job. I feel like my time at this company is not going to help me develop the skills I want. Most of what I will be doing at the job doesn’t line up well with my personal career goals either and the company is very niche so a lot of the things I’ll learn there may not be transferable to other jobs.

I wanted to stay at the company I was temping at but due to the state of everything they decided to not increase headcount and my manager recommended I take the offer due to how bad the job market has been.

I decided to continue interviewing with different companies on the down low but I don’t want to say i have another job that i just started. I can’t tell if it’s a bad idea or if i should be focusing my energy on other things another concern i have is my current company could lay me off at any point due to the budget cuts.

1jvppat,Should I say my true opinion?,"Hello! Question for you all. 

I just left my job for a competitor. I was at that previous job for 8 years, top performer and overall had a fine experience. 

I left the job due to career growth, looking for a change and overall culture wasn’t very positive. 
The culture was greatly due to a senior exec and other person on my team. They were extremely close and the senior exec gave my colleague so many hand outs and truly created a monster with a huge ego. It rubbed everyone the wrong way in the organization. This colleague was a gossip and a very toxic person. 

Their relationship was a big reason I left the organization. I never complained about this to anyone. Kept my mouth shut and did my job just fine. 

3 months into this new job, the senior exec is coming over here. No direct reports but still somewhat involved. I was just approached by my new manager asking if we can discuss my thoughts around bringing the said colleague over to our new organization. My manager is looking for my thoughts on feedback of my former colleague. 

My question is- Do I be honest about the culture they created? Do I just keep my mouth shut? I don’t want to rub anyone the wrong way to say anything negative about anyone, especially being so new. This was a big career move for me and I would be extremely disappointed if I am back to the drawing board. I came to this competitor because of their positive work culture and strong desire to work hard.

1jvokp1,How to turn a job offer into a raise at my current job?,"I’m currently working as an engineer fresh out of college (graduated 2024). While I was in college I worked at a startup and was an integral part of the early stages of the company. Once I graduated, they were not in a great financial position so I found the job I currently have now. Recently, the startup was aquired by a multi-billion dollar company and have relocated to a new city. They reached out to me telling me they’d love to have me back and they are offering me an extremely attractive salary. I currently make 72k at my current job, but work crazy hours and make roughly 120k with overtime. (60-80 hour weeks). The aquired startup is offering me 140k base salary with equity options. 

I would like to make more money while having more work life balance as I am starting to feel burnt out. However I really love where my current job is and I am very passionate about it. In the year that I have been at my current company I think I have proven myself as a valuable part of the team. I regularly work more hours than most people at the company and have worked hard to develop a good reputation. I think I would enjoy my current job more. I do not think I would like to relocate to the city that the new job is in. 

I was hoping I could leverage this offer into a raise. I do not think they will match the offer because it is literally double my salary not even considering the equity. I was hoping that by telling my boss I was approached by my old company it would not look like I was shopping for jobs. I was thinking of telling my boss about the offer from my old company and that they were trying to get me to come back but I said no. I would hope this would show him that I am loyal to the company and passionate about what I do and he would hopefully offer me a raise. Is this a stupid idea? Or is it a better idea to bring this to my boss and tell him I know you won’t be able to match this but I would like my base pay to be 100k? My reasoning is that if I get a raise to 100k then by continuing working ~60 hour weeks I will make the same amount of money that I would at the new job.

I’m on the younger side and unfortunately look even younger than I am, but I am an old soul who started working young and has industry knowledge from a young age. I.e. I was 11 years old when I graduated from a 6 month IT certification course populated by industry professionals who were all 30+. I was using computers, hacking and repairing people’s hardware since I was 8 years old and younger. I started working in professional settings when I was 14. I interacted with and hung out with and partied with adults in their 30s since that age. I am in an IT job and now in my mid 30s. I worked for pay in professional settings since I was 18. I worked full time throughout college and postgrad education. I led teams and became a director in my 20s. My husband of 7 years is 40 and I’m more comfortable socially with people in that age group and feel, act and have interests and experiences matching that age group for the most part. People think I’m 24-28 based on looks and I have an “eager student” energy in many ways at work because I just enjoy doing things well, but I am self aware that this one specific trait doesn’t code maturity…. But everything else does? My job function is identical to 60% of current leaders. My direct manager is a great person and I value his support, but he doesn’t give me direction as much as support. His support is amazing. He is the only one on the leadership team that leads 2 separate functions, and there is one more person who is a close second to him in terms of the kind of work he does. One of the other leaders (female) has the same title as me but sits on the leadership team. The other 60% basically have the same job as me but are 10-20 years old than me. They get to sit in the leadership team too and have higher level titles than me and the one female leader. I don’t know how to break into this leadership team. I don’t know if I should want to break into this leadership team. My manager has made comments to me about seeing me as peer at this point in terms of our job functions. I care about my manager a lot and don’t want to rock the boat for him at all, but basically I want more pay and I want a seat at the table. I got an effective demotion (my title was changed to manager though I was hired as director “because it aligned better with necessary HR changes across the organization”) and that still stings as in my private life my past colleagues and peers have expressed their respect for my director title which has been effectively removed from me. My job duties have not changed and mirror the duties of these other 60% of the leadership team, and are in fact less strenuous than the duties of the 20% female leadership that has also been affected by the mysterious organization changed that impacted our titles and has the same title as me but more reports and more work than me and the rest of the 60% who have same duties as me and similar or less # of reports. Cost of living is crazy and I am a parent and my spouse doesn’t have a secure career and we just bought a house. So I need more cash and have this emotional need for the validation of being accepted in the leadership team. But some of them have made comments about my age and I get the sense they think I am too young for it. But I don’t know… I like the company and I like the job and I like the people I manage and don’t want to abandon them, or I would just look to make a move somewhere where ages and culture matched more with me and I could get the seniority I crave.

1jvllam,How do I survive call center hell until I find something new,"I work in a call center, with a large corporation as the ""client"" I'm assigned to. I loved it at first but after a year I am in the WORST mental state of my life. The call center and corporation are both hyper fixated on budget stuff, leading to severe micro management in attempts to cut costs.

Every last breath I take feels monitored. Nothing is clearly communicated, other than what we're not doing well enough (literally every task they say is not good enough- no matter how much we improve it needs to be better). Call center policies regarding certain topics are unfair to begin with, and only getting worse.

I've been job searching for a while, but due to some physical and mental limitations in addition to the job market as a whole, it's slow. Today I had a BAD breakdown, starting quietly at work and eventually exploding in the car the moment I got off. I need therapy but don't get paid enough to afford it.

How do I survive? The micro management, nonstop criticism, judgement, and lack of support are killing me- then you get a day of rough calls and it's even worse. I would have quit by now if I didn't desperately need the money to help my family.

1jvlg7k,How do I (26M) get out of a very comfortable but soul-crushing job situation ?,"I've been working for the past two years as a consultant in tech and the public sector. It's a pretty decent job as the pay is alright, the people in the firm are nice and there isn't a lot of pressure.

The massive issue is that I hate the work I'm given with the clients : project management and tech related things bore me to death and I’m bad at it as well. I think the biggest joy I take from this job is the time I get to spend not doing it. I tell myself that I should use it to write a novel, or find a job that excites me more, or enjoy life but the problem is that I don’t manage to do anything with that time, it just slips away online and I feel myself becoming more and more lazy and uninspired with the time. I see so many peers of university having great passions and jobs that i would love to do in creative fields, research or government work, and that makes me disgusted with myself for accepting such an easy, aimless and mediocre path in life.

The big thing I did this past year is take advantage of the job stability to buy a flat near paris (where most of the government jobs i'm qualified to do are anyway), and I’m moving there next week. If the renovation goes well, it shouldn’t be too expensive every month and I might be able to live with my potential unemployment benefits for about a year and experience more precarious jobs, so I’m wondering if I should just quit the job for a few months to get out of the spiral of laziness, travel a bit and find what really inspires me. But I don’t know if things would really change or if i would just spiral further. 

My parents think it would be crazy to quit without another job lined up and I should stick to this comfortable job until I find another one that suits me better. The issue is that I’ve told myself that for a long while but I can’t motivate myself at all in this current situation.

I know that's a very privileged situation to be in, but still I feel stuck. I'm wondering if i'm not experiencing bore-out. I don’t know if anyone has found themselves in a similar situation and got out of it, or maybe has an advice for me. ",Sampaole,3,1.0,1,1744245885,2025-04-10 00:44:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvlg7k/how_do_i_26m_get_out_of_a_very_comfortable_but/,4,2025
1jvl7ik,Unsure what to do,"(Sorry for the long description context is needed) 

I recently graduated from university in London with graphic communication and coding. I quit my bartending job and started an internship for an experience design agency which I really enjoy under a 6 month contract (job A). Between this job transition I worked as a designer for a small company (job B) with a boss who would antagonise me none stop and had expectations like a website should all be designed and made in a couple of days for me. 

Unfortunately my current 6month contract for job A only pays 25k a year which being in London is nowhere near enough to live on. They promised me that it would become full time and that I would be well paid after the 6months which is why I joined them as well as it being a job I’ve always wanted.

I don’t and have never had any financial support from my family who don’t live in the UK. To counter this I struck up an offer with Job B saying that I would do all their branding, website design/code and UX/UI for them from scratch as they wanted a complete re-brand. They pay me 25k a year as well (I’m aware it’s nowhere near enough for someone by themself to make for a complete medium sized company rebrand - I just needed the money so I could carry on working where I really enjoyed).

The combined income therefore is 50k, however I’m sometimes working 80 hour weeks. Job A is a 9-5:30 and I’m often doing job B every night from 7pm to 1:30am including weekends.

As a result of this the experience I’ve gained had been great though tiring. I’ve rebranded a company from scratch by myself and learned so much. However I’m not appreciated and the boss constantly treats me badly, often messaging me drunk saying I’m bad at my job (which he then goes back on when sober).
Job A love me and even though I’m a junior I run projects and even have head senior ux/ui developers etc jokingly tell me i devalue their jobs with my skills. 

Now I’m 1 month away from my contact ending with job A. The head boss has told me they can’t afford me even though they have given everyone a pay rise and promotion but me (the company earns 200million a year). And that they want to extend my 25k a year salary for another 6 months with another promise of a job at the end of it again. Though I love the work I can’t continue living on that… 

Job B has now come in and says they want me full time starting at 50k going to 100k by mid next year. The moneys great but the work would be boring compared to this and I wouldn’t like the people I am  around.

I was hoping anyone could give me any advice. Should I choose one of the jobs or just quit both and continue my own way and try and find a new job that values me?",SadZookeepergame5565,2,1.0,2,1744245119,2025-04-10 00:31:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvl7ik/unsure_what_to_do/,4,2025
1jvktgd,Feeling lost and dumb,"Hey guys , 22F here and after I finished 12th Grade, I was 18 when I got a job in a small taxation company and I worked there for 4 years while doing my Bachelors in Accounting which was a 3 year course. I honestly never enjoyed the work and I hated tax and accounting , even my boss treated me like a piece of crap and I’ll be honest I stayed there for 4 years and I didn’t learn anything , I didn’t even know how to do a single tax return, I only stayed there for my parents because they were mentally driving me insane by saying you have to learn tax because accounting is your profession and things like that. My parents forced me to do accounting and I hated it because I never liked Accounting  , it felt too analytical and stressful. When I finished my course , I started studying Chartered Accountancy and started full time with that trash taxation company .I just wanted to escape that office because of the work itself and the people there so I found a job as an admin/ accounts payable clerk in a small company. However when I worked there, I had to lie to my taxation boss that I was sick even thought I was not because I wanted to see how my new workplace will be , I thought it will be good but I got terminated on my probationary period . I even cried to the manager saying I really can’t go back to my taxation job because my old manager is toxic . But I just left and thought why my life was this hard . Then I was stuck in the same place for another painful 5 months where parents kept comparing me to other people my age and boss kept humiliating me and verbally abusing me even more. That’s when I got to a point I was like nah this has to stop , I can’t work here anymore, so I started to apply for jobs every single day even during work I just clicked apply for every single admin job that  I found . I also applied to graduate programs in Big 4 because the only thing I enjoyed in Accounting was risk for example the types of risks in a business and all that . However I got a job in this company that manages salary sacrificing and all that and I left the other job for good and let me tell you it was the best moment of my life , I literally enjoyed waking up to go to my new work place, I loved the people and it felt like I finally belonged to a work place that I loved , I even loved the work I was doing because it wasn’t stressful . However that all lasted until I got terminated after a month due to a small mistake in the pays . That manager fired me in front of everyone . Like that I went home completely heart broken . Even thought my parents were comforting me they did say you should stick to tax and accounting , because this job wasn’t your thing . I stayed home for 3 weeks until I found a job through my co worker who initially left the taxation job that I was working in previously , she referred me to a job which was also another taxation company , we both work in the same company. It has not been easy at all , the new boss is one of those bosses that you see in movies , angry, racist and even questioned me if I had a degree and that person without a degree is doing better than me . It’s been 6 months here , I don’t like the job but it’s better than that old taxation company but I’m just having the dreads every day thinking of working here. I get jealous honestly when I see people younger than me enjoying their lives going to uni , having fun and truly no stress . Here I am being tormented by my family , this stupid boss , this job . Why is this happening? Am I cursed with bad managers ? Am I bound to do tax forever ?

1jvk9ak,Just need support,"First post. In a bit of a pickle.

Wife and I had a baby in late December. I was driving 2 hours to work and sometimes 3 hours home through the city. I leave around 5am & lucky to get home by 7pm.

I spoke with my district manager, my manager, Hr, everyone last October about transferring closer when the baby comes and I come back from LOA. Everyone agreed and said no problem it will be arranged.

I’m set to return now and my HR has asked me to come back to the same location until they can find a placement.

My wife did not return after LOA, she will be taking care of our child as we have no friends or family here. My wife also has epilepsy so being close is very imperative. 

I have to respond to HR tomorrow and I’m going to tell them politely that the commute is too far to be away from my family at this point in my life.

My fear is that they will fire me, & I will be out of a job and insurance. 

If it’s any consolation I absolutely hate my job, but I do get paid 100k/yr. However it is 10 hour work days, some nights, some closing shifts until 11pm, and I get every other weekend off.

Hi everyone,

I’m currently feeling really lost about what career path to take and what degree to study at uni. I was originally planning on doing Architecture, but I’ve realised that job prospects in Adelaide, Australia (where I’d like to stay long-term) aren’t great in that field.

Right now I’m studying Health & Medical Sciences with the goal of getting into Physio—but honestly, I don’t think that’s what I want to do anymore.

Here’s what I *do* know about myself:

* I enjoy **design** and have lots experience with **design software**
* I’m **good with computers**
* I have a passion for **teaching** specially PE/Food or design/tech
* I’m open to doing a **master’s degree** if needed
* I like the idea of **IT work**, but not sure what specific role would suit me best

I just don’t know what career would actually align with these skills and interests, and I feel like I’ve run out of ideas.

Some careers I’ve thought about based on my interests include:

* **Teaching**
* **something in IT**
* legit nothing else

If anyone has been in a similar boat, or has advice about what degrees or careers could be a good match, I’d seriously appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.

2. In an aerospace company in India, where I build parts for landing gears and more.

1) Could I match pay based off inflation? If not, how come companies claim to adjust their prices due to inflation, but not employee prices?

2) Could I negotiate based off cost of living differences? I noticed that for the same role & experience, applicants would recieve 70k for higher COL areas and some would recieve 100k for lower COL areas (the logic seems backwards)

3) Could I negotiate based off of what their competitors highest market pay is (e.g., someone of a similar role and YOE was offered 123k for a competitor firm)

1jvic7t,What is your opinion?,"Hey everybody. I'm 52 and have been working as a licensed electrician in Europe for 26 years and in Canada for 6 years. I don't have a license but have done commercial and industrial projects. I worked for 4 years at my previous employer and left for another company about a year and a half ago.

Currently, work was slow and I just enrolled on EI (haven't received my payment yet) but my employer never told me that there wasn't going to be any work and that said, I could have gotten EI some time ago, if I had known and it was communicated with me. I have a substantial amount of money, from not working and absolutely no communication from him all this time.

 

These are my questions:

 \- I still have the company car and I'm still technically employed, as he has not fired me nor have I quit.

Should I quit or should I let him fire me and get some form of compensation, since he failed to let me know that there was no work, for the month to come? If that is an option. I think he's waiting for me to quit, since I'll have to when I get a new job.

\- I went to a interview at an electrical company last week and they told me to call them back after 1 week, which I did. I called on Monday and they never replied and I also called yesterday (Tuesday) and left a message and again, they never called me back.

Should I call them again? I mean it is really unprofessional to treat anyone disrespectfully and not communicate with a positive or negative answer. I just need to know, so I can start applying elsewhere. This is a great opportunity, since it's close to my house and company van and the pay is good.

 The most important question is that if everything fails (I can't stay unemployed for long) should I call my previous employer and see if he would take me back? I have friends working and they told me that he has a lot of work and overwhelmed, at the moment. I did leave on good terms; 2 weeks’ notice and shook hands. Some say don't go back some say it's my best option right now.

I know I'm in panic mode and slightly depressed because first of all my age and also, I have been working all my life and loving my trade and it's a weird feeling, not working at the moment. I'm excellent in my work and everything I have done is done to perfection. All I want is a job and any employer that hires me, I know will not regret it.

1jvi20q,Need advice for my Fiancé Career and our relationship,"Hey everyone — I’d really appreciate some advice from people who’ve gone through this process or have insights into the IMG/specialization journey in the US.

About me:
I’m a tech entrepreneur, currently based in the UK but planning to move to Saudi Arabia in the near future, after I get my passport (2029) for business reasons.

About my partner:
	•	She’s in her final year of MBBS in Pakistan, graduating in December 2025
	•	Will complete her house job (internship) by December 2026
	•	We’re planning to get married in January 2026
	•	After marriage, she’ll live with me in Saudi Arabia for one year
	•	Her long-term dream is to become a plastic surgeon, ideally trained in the U.S. from a top-tier institution
	•	She’s open to giving USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK while still in Pakistan or during her year in Saudi

Our plan:
We’ve researched a lot and it seems like the U.S. offers the fastest path to plastic surgery specialization — although we know it’s incredibly competitive for IMGs. Our idea is that after spending one year together in the UK, she would move to the U.S. for USMLE prep, observerships, and the Match process.

Our biggest concern:

What’s the most realistic and time-efficient way for her to enter plastic surgery residency in the U.S. as an IMG, while minimizing how long we stay apart?

We’re willing to sacrifice a bit of time apart for the sake of her career, but we don’t want to go down a dead-end or waste years on the wrong path.

Would really appreciate any insights — especially from IMGs, spouses of doctors, or people who’ve made this kind of international career/family plan work.

1jvgww9,Feeling lost and looking for some advice on career paths.,"As a recent college graduate, I've been feeling a little lost in terms of career direction. For some added context, I have a degree in math and some experience in software development via research experiences and volunteer roles, but unfortunately no internships or formal full-time positions. I am interested in tech or analytics based roles in industry but getting my foot in the door has been a little difficult to say the least.

As a result, I had applied to some graduate programs to see what opportunities I could land. I was fortunate enough to be offered admission to two, fully-funded PhD programs in mathematics, which US News Rankings ranks around the 70-90 range. Additionally, I was given an offer to a 15-month professional master's program in data science at an elite institution but with no funding, costing around, possibly, 120-140k. This situation has me a little torn.

On the one hand, a fully funded PhD would come with the obvious benefit of having no student loan debt. Though there is no short term financial stability, I know I would enjoy studying the field further and I could take elective courses to enhance my technical skillset. Contrarily, the master's program boasts a high placement rate, with an average starting pay of 110-120k. I prioritize financial security and career development in the short term, but the heavy debt and current tech market situation gives rise to trepidation. 

What is the best choice going forward for me? I appreciate any insights or advice shared!",Difficult_Fall_4311,2,1.0,1,1744233052,2025-04-09 21:10:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvgww9/feeling_lost_and_looking_for_some_advice_on/,4,2025

1jvcg5j,"As a queer person who was very interested in pursuing public policy, I am now feeling lost given our US gov’t. What’s a good major I can pivot to?","
I’ve been back in school at 27/28 the past year and a half finishing general education. I initially looked into political science but then landed on public policy and administration because it’s more versatile, lucrative, and specialized… But now given the direction the US government is going in I feel as if I need to find something more stable and clear cut for myself. It’s obvious that I will have an extremely hard time getting any policy work as a queer/trans person with the direction the government is going.

So now Im feeling extremely lost. Ive always loved history, government, politics, big picture ideas/planning/thinking, innovation, debate, speech, psychology, being creative, writing, making music…. I can’t roll the dice on creative work because I desperately want more income and stability for my future, so now I just don’t know what major I should go for given my interests and what Im good at. 

Ive heard becoming a lawyer is over-saturated and not a good idea too. So my secondary idea of doing law school instead of a master’s program also seemingly makes no sense.

So, Reddit, Im at my wit’s end here. With computer science and business majors being oversaturated as well (which I wouldn’t want to do anyways), given my interests what are some good ideas for majors that I could look into and find opportunities in?

1jvbufy,How to tell my boss why I'm quitting,"I've been at my job for a little over 3 years. Within the first 2 weeks of being here, my boss came to work with Covid and I got infected. It was a running joke that Covid was my sign-on bonus and no one really thought anything about it UNTIL I developed Long Covid.  
  
I have also developed several chronic illnesses that were triggered by Long Covid. The entire time I've been sick I have been keeping management in the loop in regards to sickness, treatments, doctor's visits, etc. Never once has he taken responsibility or apologized. In fact, he has treated me differently since I received an official diagnosis.

""Issues"" I wouldn't have if it weren't for him! My mental health can't take it anymore so as soon as I get another offer, I'm leaving. 

My question is, how would you recommend I tell him why I'm leaving? I want to be 100% honest but having trouble finding the right words.

1jvbhxp,Why can’t my boss say well done?,"
Okay, so I’m not saying I need constant praise. But I think I’m a pretty good employee and I’ve got my boss’s back and do a load to help him out. It’s always been my personality trait to make those around me look good and feel good, and I take that into my work as well. 

However, my boss is the complete opposite. He really struggles to say please, thank you and especially well done. 

Whenever we do a deal or make a sale or sign a new contract, he has me send the paperwork out to everyone and he’ll say it’s so I get the credit. However, I’ve said to him they probably think I’m just doing your admin. I don’t need credit and praise from external departments, but it wouldn’t go amiss if just once in awhile HE told me I was doing a good job. We’ve had this conversation so many times and it just falls on deaf ears.

But here’s the kicker, it isn’t like he can’t just say well done, he publicly mocks and derides me. On one such contract email today, I said that I was really proud of this deal as I’d recommended a client to this company and it had all come together perfectly. My boss instantly picked up the phone and did a sarky voice mocking me saying that I was peacocking and what did I think I was doing showing off?

Here’s the double kicker… We are super close. It was just the two of us at an independent agency before the business got acquired into a massive big company so we are tight. The problem is, he talks to me like his family (in the worst way) and I see him praise everyone else to their face, but I just cannot catch a break. he admit he treats me like family but in the way that you not have no airs and graces with yours. And I’ve said to him before, we aren’t family though, I’m your employee and sometimes I need a little bit of praise and not constant belittling throughout the day. It’s like a little brother constantly nitpicking and bullying.

We aren’t the type of company nor are we the type of people who would call in HR or suddenly go very corporate about it. I’ve tried to bring it up tactfully and in a way that says this really affects me and hurts me and then he just gets super defensive. I know the answer is to find another job but I really do love the role, but it seems like his inability to say well done or acknowledge anything that I do well is just getting worse.",Jackie_Bizzle,7,0.7099999785423279,19,1744219700,2025-04-09 17:28:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jvbhxp/why_cant_my_boss_say_well_done/,4,2025

1jvaakf,Can my poor or lack of social skills affect my work output as a writer (is writing still for me)?,"I’m a writer for a company that wants their content written in conversational tone. The most common feedback I receive is that my writing sounds forced, awkward, formal, stiff, unnatural, or like AI.

I am a socially awkward person who rarely engages in conversation. I don’t talk much and to be honest, I don’t even know how to make a conversation last because to me, it’s so draining. I’ve also never been so confident with how I respond. Talking, basically, makes me uncomfortable.

I became interested in writing so I took the career path as a writer, but I’m really starting to doubt my skills and decision now. Even the previous companies I’ve worked for weren’t really impressed by my writing skills. They always told me to write like I am talking to a friend. I don’t have any friends.

1jva4xd,Accounting and teaching experience,"Hey! 

So i need a new job as I was laid off of my teaching gig for next year. I teach business education, so all my classes are elective and I was on year 2, so I was an easy choice when the budget cuts came down.

Anyway, I'm looking for a new gig and thinking I won't do teaching again because my program is apt to get cut. This was my second teaching job. 

So, I have 4 years of teaching experience and about five years of accounting experience as a government auditor and an assistant business manager for town square media, a national radio station operator (did the branch accounting).

1jva3n3,I am being taken advantage of,"Hi!

For some background I work from home as an administrative assistant/ HR for a 3rd party company that works with automotive manufacturers to sort quality issues. I started as an inspector back in 2018. I was promoted to supervisor by 2019 and by 2020 I had pushed through the Covid lay offs and somehow managed to stay afloat at $16/hr for maybe 16hr work weeks. At the time the facility we were working with was hiring for the same rate as me to be a general line worker. So I took the opportunity with consistent hours, the same pay and way less stress and responsibility. I HATED it. In 2021 the company I worked with called me to offer me a position they ""crafted just for me"" hence the undecided made up title. I am essentially a recruiter who handles payroll and a vast majority of any HR issues. In 2022 they gave me a pay raise and put me at $20/hr. 
Through these last 4 years I had not been laid off a single time. This year however for some reason the business started to slow down. I was understanding when they laid off my assistant. I was understanding when they cut my hours. I was understanding when they refused to tell me they had no clue when I'd be returning and kept hitting me with ""were working on this maybe a week"" every. Single. Week. Monday after almost 4 months I finally returned to full time. Just in time for our other HR person to put her two week notice in. 

They offered me a promotion. Head of HR, traveling once a week (6hr round trip distance from my home). They'd compensate milage, bump me up to $23/hr and give me a few more vacation days (I have been at 5 for almost 4 years now). I told them no and was willing to compromise for once every 3 weeks, $26 - $30/hr with 10 vacation days. They told me every week is required and the pay is negotiable. I turned it down as this really isn't the work life balance I want. When I turned it down, my boss kept saying she was ""just asking because we want you in a permanent position"". Not exactly sure how my 4 year position is not permanent I guess.

 Now they changed it to requiring me to take on this workload for no extra pay as I am ""just helping with coverage temporarily"". They plan to hire someone part time to be present at the required location. Keeping in mind they laid off my assistant (who I absolutely still need) and now I'll be taking on another entire department until they find a replacement. Which essentially means I'm being paid $20/hr for a 3 person workload. 

My question is would you quit in my shoes? How would you go about changing the reality of this while keeping the job itself? I like my job as it was. They are taking advantage of me correct?

1jv8ype,How long should I wait to follow up again after my interview?,"I will be moving out of state in about a month and am therefore looking for a new job. I’ve known about this upcoming move since last summer, so I informed my current employer about 2.5 months before I planned on moving. I know most people wouldn’t recommend giving your employer such an early notice, but I was confident in my relationship with my boss and it worked out very well. They’re going to let me work remotely until I find a job, but most importantly my bosses boss connected me with a relative who is a higher up at a large firm in the area I’m moving to.

Since connecting with the relative, he has worked through the new to him process to get me a position referral which lead to an interview I had last Tuesday. To my knowledge went very well. I followed up with him shortly after the interview thanking him for getting me to this point and asked if he was aware of a time frame that I would hear back. His response was that internal discussions had already begun and they were speaking with the department head the following day.

Now, it’s been a week since then and I haven’t heard anything yet. Through this whole process he has referred to each step of getting me in their system and to an interview as “just checking boxes” and “doing things the official way.” That along with his response to my follow up has me feeling good about getting the position, but I’ll never be too optimistic until I receive something back.

All of that is to ask how long before I follow up again? I know a week is not a long time in the grand scheme of job hunting. I figured two weeks without hearing would be fair to follow up, but I don’t know realistically how long this should take.",Ndrizy,2,1.0,1,1744213484,2025-04-09 15:44:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jv8ype/how_long_should_i_wait_to_follow_up_again_after/,4,2025
1jv8p82,"Withdrawing vs dismissal from med school, and finding other career options?","For reference, I'm a second year med student who has been dismissed, currently appealing to continue.

My med school grades started off strong but over the course of two years, they've slowly gone down to the point that I've had to retake multiple classes. Had a tough first year and after the first few months I felt like I was falling behind on all the material, but squeezed by. I've utilized every resource my school offered: tutoring, academic advising, mental health counseling and haven't made any real progress, but through my second year most of my exams fell in the mid 60s. Past few months have been brutal, trying to study with the threat of dismissal on my head and seeing the same scores coming back really hit me hard. About 2 weeks ago, I was been dismissed due to my negative academic trend and I'm in the appeals process, but things aren't looking good since I don't have any score improvements that could change their minds. Advisors and staff have been nudging me towards just withdrawing.

MD has been my dream for almost my entire academic life and I'm tempted to keep fighting for it until they kick me out, but I've been advised the smarter decision is just to withdraw so I can have a chance at other programs.

\-

First, is withdrawing even going to make a difference vs being dismissed? I feel like even if I apply to other programs and say ""withdrew from med school since it wasn't a good fit"" or something like that they can just look at my transcripts and immediately know I failed out. Should I continue appealing and ask for more time/repeat a year/take leave or just withdraw?

Second, what career paths do I even go to now? I've been advised to look into nursing, PA, podiatry, nurse anesthetist etc. but a) would they even accept me into their programs? and b) I must have a problem with academics or study habits, even if I get in, is my poor academic performance just going repeat there?

I have a microbiology BS, a lot of research and paper/poster writing experience, and job experience as a scribe, medical receptionist, and behavioral technician. What are some good options for me financially and interest-wise?

1jv6sbx,How Do I Navigate This,"Hey guys. I need help figuring out my next move. So I've been working at an NGO for the past 6 months on an internship contract, which expired mid last month. I had a colleague in the same department, on the same contract. Before we left, HR put out an internal ad for our positions, and said only one was available. So we applied and went home, knowing we'll be going up against each other.

So a couple weeks later we do written and oral interviews, two days apart. We go home, awaiting feedback. My supervisor calls me a couple of days later, and says that I did well in the oral interview, but I didn't answer a couple of questions in the written one, and as such, I won't be getting the position. I refute this since I know that I answered all questions, and I even send them my submission. They say they'll check in with HR to get it sorted. 

A week goes by, and I get an email from HR saying that I wasn't chosen for the position. I reach out to my supervisor to express my disappointment, but still thank them for the opportunity regardless. They text back saying that they are still investigating what happened, and I respond by sending my submission again. They then respond by saying that they have discovered that my marks were awarded to a different candidate, and that with this correction, I now qualify for the position. I'm obviously relieved, and they say they'll update me soon. 

So here's where I'm at rn. The more I think about it, the less likely it seems that they can/will rescind the contract offer to the candidate who got it (who has already reported to work btw). It's a huge organization and they're big on integrity, especially in my niche, so I hope they can sort it out. But, what are my options in the meantime? I'm already applying for jobs elsewhere, but is there any way to ensure I land this one? Really interested to hear your opinions, especially if anyone has HR experience or has been in the same situation before.

1jv6l9q,How to ask my boss for a promotion,"Hi all. Experienced legal assistant here with some non-official paralegal experience as well. By non-official, I mean I was an executive assistant to an attorney formerly, but my title was misleading as I did a majority of the paralegal tasks (we had no paralegal, I was the paralegal and assistant). We were a two man team. 
Anyway, I’m at a new firm now. A large firm. There’s a position for anyone and anything here. I’m currently a legal assistant, but during the interviewing process, we discussed the potential to move up to a paralegal position eventually which would also come with a raise. I was advised we do a 6 month and 12 month review. The 12 month review is regular for everyone, yearly. The 6 month review is for new hires. 
I’m now 5 months in. Things are going well. I’m happy here. I like the company. I like my coworkers. I’m getting everything down that I’m taught. It’s good! 
However, I am eager for a pay increase and to move up to a paralegal position.
Why? 
Well, one, money of course. I’m at a starting wage currently and it’s tight. I expressed in my interview I’ll definitely need a raise within the first year if we’re a good fit. Which we are so far. :)
Two, I’m comfortable. I fly through my work as an assistant and I’m ready for more on my plate. I genuinely get bored during the day sometimes and need more to do. A promotion would be perfect for that. 

So how do I bring this up to my boss? WHEN do I bring this up to my boss? I’m so close to six months and the company is hiring people like crazy right now. I think I should probably strike while the irons hot. What do you think? 

Thanks. Be nice, please. I’m a hard worker, but a clinically anxious one. 🥲 I just need little guidance on how to keep the convo short and sweet as I get nervous and over explain.

1jv6jom,Should I do my PhD at Oxford or Trinity College Dublin (TCD)?,"I have an undergrad from TCD in History and a masters from Oxford in the area of History/critical theory. I have the option to do a PhD at either Oxford or TCD (both with standard graduate research funding). Oxford obviously has the advantage of being an elite institution, but TCD would allow me to save up to 25k per year for three years because I have no overheads whilst living in Dublin.

I am not dead certain about what I want to pursue after the PhD. I am most drawn to an interdisciplinary career that involves journalism, activism, and potentially academia later down the line.

Should I prioritise the prestige of Oxford over the opportunity to save 70k and realistically put down a house deposit? I don’t come from a financially secure background so money is a big factor for me. On the other hand, I wonder if I’m missing out on a big opportunity by turning down Oxford.

I’d like to make as informed a decision as possible, so any insight is appreciated. Thanks.

1jv6fwd,"How New Is ""Too New"" For An Internal Transfer?","Hey all,

I’ve been with my company since November 2023, so about a year and a half now. I actually like the job and the company itself: the benefits are great, and the work is interesting. But I’ve had a pretty rough experience with my manager since day one, and I’m starting to feel fed up.

My manager is either frequently absent or just generally disengaged. And when she is around, she pretty much ignores me. Unless I mess something up, in which case she becomes passive-aggressive or just straight-up rude. She didn’t give me much onboarding (she was actually absent from work for the first few months I got here) and she hasn’t taught me much since, which makes things difficult in a technical state government role where a lot of what we use is proprietary. For a while I kept asking for more responsibilities or guidance, but eventually I stopped because I was getting nowhere. At this point, I’ve mentally checked out of trying to engage with her, and I think the feeling is mutual. It feels like I’m stuck in career purgatory.

I’ve stuck it out for a few reasons:

* This is my first job out of college, and I didn’t want to jump ship too quickly.
* I needed to get out of a toxic home environment, so I wasn’t in a position to be unemployed.
* And, to be honest, I didn’t realize how abnormal her behavior was until I started talking to friends and loved ones about it.

Just to give a bit more context, here are a few specific interactions that stand out:

* One time, I mixed up two technical terms in an email to a customer. I caught it and corrected myself, but she still messaged me privately to say, *“If you actually knew what you were doing, you wouldn’t have gotten these terms mixed up to begin with. You’re clearly not ready for this role yet.”*
* Another time, during a casual conversation where she brought up the idea of retiring, she asked me, *“If I retired tomorrow, would you be able to handle the responsibilities of managing the system on your own without my supervision? My guess is no, you wouldn’t.”* Which was kind of funny, because I’ve *been* working without her supervision my entire time here.
* When I asked for help with something I’d never done before, she said, *“I am too busy to tell you step by step, plus I found that giving you instructions in the past is not a good solution. I suggest you continue to improve your ability to teach yourself by actually doing your job instead of asking me.”* Again, funny, because I can think of a single time she gave me step-by-step instructions for anything and I have never needed to ask her another question about that particular topic ever since.
* Once, I was late because of a major accident that I got stuck behind. Like, a car caught on fire and shut down the highway. I’d already left with my usual 30-minute buffer, but she reported me to the CTO and then reamed me out for an hour for not leaving earlier.
* Most recently (and honestly, the straw that broke the camel’s back), she chewed me out for clocking in at 8:02 instead of 8:00. I explained that my laptop had taken longer than usual to boot up, but she brought up a message from January 2024 (the only other time I’ve been late outside of the highway incident) and told me, *“Last time you said it won’t happen again. I hope this time you can actually keep good on that promise. I’m tired of hearing sorry.”*

For what it’s worth, I’m paraphrasing these conversations a bit (but not taking them out of context or misrepresenting them). English isn’t her first language, and I try to give her some grace there. I get that not everyone is going to be perfectly fluent. But even so, the tone and attitude behind what she says still come through clearly, and it makes an already frustrating situation harder when I’m struggling to even understand what little guidance I *do* get.

I’ve made a few connections here, including someone who used to report to her. He’s a kind, professional guy. Absolutely not the type to badmouth people. But even *he’s* expressed frustration with her. He told me she was promoted because her manager retired and they wanted to promote internally and judged her based on her technical ability, not because she had any actual leadership experience. According to his experience on the team, the team is disorganized, under-managed, and fine for passing the time but it's not really a place where people grow. He told me he spent seven years on the team trying to do what I tried to do my first few months here before going to the CTO and saying, “Please move me, or I’ll have to start looking elsewhere.”

I’d really like to do something similar. The only problem is, I don’t have his seniority or leverage. Especially with the possibility of a recession on the horizon. So while I may be stuck at the company for now, I really hope I’m not also stuck with this manager forever. Not that I will be, because she is old and has brought up retirement a couple times, but I don't want to be stuck with her much longer. I can hardly take another year of it unless I absolutely have to.

If anyone has advice on how to approach an internal transfer tactfully and effectively, especially when your current manager is part of the problem, I’d really appreciate it.

> I have an autoimmune condition that I can generally live with, but stress and other lifestyle factors makes it flare which cripples me into a state where I am near bedridden.

Just yesterday I received a job offer for a role I've been trying to get into for over 5 years. The pay is exceptional, starting at 120k and progressing to 250k after 4 years. It is a very high-stress and difficult job however, that requires me to be away from home a minimum of 4 days a week.

If I accepted the offer now, I worry that my poor state of health would end up forcing me to quit prematurely, or get fired for poor performance. If I don't accept it and focus on my health for a while, it's very likely that I'll never get the opportunity again. And it is a unicorn job, most jobs in my field rarely pay above 70k a year.

I have a gut feeling that I should rest and heal, but I don't want to spend my days regretting that decision. I also don't want to work being sick and depressed, either.

Essentially my previous role has come back saying that I was dismissed. This is basically true but I did not make it seem this way in my interview. In my last role I did not pass my 5 month probationary period due to ‘lack of enthusiasm.’ I would add that never in my work reviews was any of my work criticised for lack of quality or speed. I definitely lacked motivation, but that was because I never got any work. Admittedly I definitely should have done more to show my enthusiasm and my dismissal is ultimately my fault. Luckily one week after leaving my old job I got an interview for a new one.

I never outright said I was fired or that I had handed in my notice, merely talking about not the right fit etc. it was a quick turn around and I started work a couple weeks later. My background check recently came back and as I said above, it has come back saying I was dismissed. HR said not to worry but I obviously don’t believe that.

However I am now really concerned that they will think that I was lying. I regret not being more upfront in the interview about it all but I guess I am stuck with this for the time being. My main question, if it is even possible to be answered, is how worried I should be?

I’ve been a food runner for 6 years and I feel like I’m going nowhere. I don’t hate hard work, but I’m tired of doing a job with no future. I want stability, something I can grow into. But here’s the thing I struggle to speak up at work because of my Italian accent. People assume I’m stupid or don’t take me seriously (I came from Italy 7 years ago Im 23). It’s embarrassing and honestly exhausting.

I want to find a new path, something that doesn’t rely on talking all the time. I don’t have a degree and I’m not looking to go to university, but I am open to doing a course or training ideally something that gives me real experience, even if the pay sucks at first. I just want to work toward something that feels like it matters.

I’m not lazy, I just feel lost. I don’t know what I’m good at, but I’m ready to start over. I just need some guidance from people who’ve been where I am or who know about career options that actually go somewhere.

Also guys in my free time I watch porn and twitch streaming (league of legends) and I become addicted heavily. I also am drinking a lot but on a positive note I stopped smoking weed 3 months ago! 

I just use porn as a relapse in order to not to stress from the feeling of being lost in life and I watch the streams for all my free time to feel involved into someone else goals and forget about my life completely. This methods are negative but they help me avoid sadness I only feel it when I’m in the train commuting to work.

I also have a degree in IT but i forgot everything about it and I hate it and similar jobs. I would love to do a real work I watch streams for 10 hours during my day off and watch porn on my phone for 3 hours before i sleep and when i wake up so i want to stay away from screens in any way.

1jv4hee,Navigating a Full-Time Offer After Contract Roles,"Hi all,

I’m in a bit of an interesting position and trying to figure out the best way to navigate it.

I graduated last June. My first role was a 4-month contract at $27/hr, followed by a 6-month contract at $50/hr that ended in March. I’ve just received an offer for a full-time role in an area I’m really interested in, but I made the mistake of not asking about the budget upfront—so I have no idea what to expect salary-wise.

I’m scheduled to speak with them later today to go over the offer details. Any advice on how to approach negotiation if the salary comes in lower than expected? And how should I think about leveraging my contract experience when converting that to full-time salary expectations?

When I was originally asked about salary expectations, I mentioned I had interviewed for roles between 55-85k, but that’s about as specific as I got. I studied mechanical engineering but have pivoted towards product development/product line coordination.

1jv4cnv,is this job worth a 1.5-2 hour commute?,"Hi there

I currently work a very flexible job where I can choose to work remotely when I feel like, with the option to go in as I please. If I do go in, the office is only a 30 minute drive which isn't bad. they also offer free lunch every day to save on costs.

I've been feeling like I need a new challenge for growth, so I found another job that pays 24% more, seems interesting, but the commute would be very long. Close to 2 hours in the winter time.

While I care about my career, WFH is super valuable to me for good WLB. I tried negotiating remote work but the company won't budge, despite the fact that my whole team would be working in another country, **one of them is actually remote herself**, and their policy on their careers site states that while the average number of days per week they recommend is 3 days, they empower teams to make decisions that work best for them. I don't get why they won't flex.

I then tried to negotiate compensation instead, but the recruiter refuses to share the full pay band with me and said that it's not up for negotiation. I could obviously save more by commuting than renting, but taking the GO train in Toronto is expensive too - if I were to start renting, I'm actually saving less money after taxes plus renting costs.

I don’t know, I’ve always had this problem of self doubting myself. I’ve been doing an apprenticeship at a hotel and i was working in the restaurant department, i would’ve been in the housekeeping in may, had i not gotten fired. I was still in my trial period so yes, they have every right to fire me within this period and i don’t hold anything against that. I just don’t know where to go from here.

1jv2yto,"Is 1st & 2nd year of college the BEST time to build your career, startup or skills? (Need real advice!)","Hey everyone,

I'm currently in my 1st year of college (not from a top-tier college), and I've been thinking a lot lately. I feel like the early years—especially 1st and 2nd year—might actually be the best time to do something meaningful for our careers. Whether it's building a startup, learning important skills, freelancing, or even just exploring what we're passionate about.

Why do I feel this way?

Because once 3rd year hits, most students start panicking about placements, internships, coding rounds, GPAs, and suddenly, there's no breathing room to think long-term. Everyone's just trying to catch up. And after graduation? Sure, you might have time—but what about the regret of not starting earlier when we actually had more freedom?

The truth is—I’ve wasted a lot of time till now. And my exams are coming, but this feeling keeps bugging me… like if I don't start now, I might just fall into that same cycle.

So I wanted to ask:
Do you think I’m right in thinking 1st–2nd year is the best time to start?
What would YOU suggest someone like me should focus on right now? (Skills, startup ideas, side hustles, etc.)
How do I balance this with exams and college life?

Would love to hear your stories, regrets, and advice. Maybe it'll help not just me but many like me who are in the same boat.

1jv2ihm,Power systems career prospects (USA) for an international student,"Hello everyone,


I'm an international student considering a master’s in ECE in the USA with the goal of working in power systems (generation, distribution, protection...). I would like to understand the current and future job prospects in this field, especially how difficult it is to find employers, private or utility, offering reasonable starting salaries and willing to sponsor an H1B visa.

From my research, most entry-level positions either don’t sponsor or don’t mention sponsorship. Given that power systems roles often offer lower starting salaries compared to other areas of EE, I’d need a relatively high confidence of securing a job to justify the cost of a master’s and going through the H1B process.

I know a master’s isn’t strictly necessary for the field, but as a non-U.S. citizen, it's my only path to a U.S.-recognized degree and a chance at the H1B lottery (since it's virtually impossible to enter the job market with a foreign degree).

Also, I would appreciate it if you could share the typical starting salary ranges in your area of work and geographic location. I am aware that it can vary significantly between specialisation areas and locations, but I just want a rough idea to better understand the current job market (especially considering the recent announcements of manufacturing coming back to the USA).


For context, I’m European, so I may be able to get residency faster once employed, which could be a small advantage in job applications (but I’m unsure how much this actually helps), and I would like to eventually work in the South.",Far_Pair_9028,2,1.0,2,1744194585,2025-04-09 10:29:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jv2ihm/power_systems_career_prospects_usa_for_an/,4,2025

1jv1uen,I’m done with “let’s touch base” bullsh*t   [rant],"
Look,

I’ve been grinding in two different SDR roles for 19 months now. 

I’m done. Not just tired. 

Not the “ugh, Mondays suck” kind of tired. I’m burnt out. Like the toast you forgot about while staring into your coffee. 

I thought this was supposed to be a launchpad, a stepping stone to something bigger. 

Turns out, it’s just a treadmill in business casual: you’re running hard, sweating buckets, but the finish line keeps moving. 

And who’s actually winning? Not me. 

Someone else is getting fit while my knees give out.

The “dream” of climbing the ladder? It’s more cold calls, more forced smiles, more meetings that could’ve been blessed silence. More pretending to care about prospects who’d block me if they even sniffed a pitch coming their way.

The promotion everyone dreams about? They can keep it. 

I don’t even want it anymore. What’s the point? 

I want real. Real work. Real conversations. Real purpose.

Right now, I wake up and wonder if it’s Monday or Tuesday, and it doesn’t matter.

And the worst part isn’t what I do. It’s who I’m becoming doing it.

I’m tired of seeing AEs make double my salary when I have better discovery and sales skills than them.

I’m frustrated with the lack of personal touch at scale, making genuine connections feel impossible.

I’m tired of being handed garbage leads and told to “make magic happen.” 

Tired of rejection that feels personal no matter how much they tell you not to take it that way.

Tired of quotas that feel like a setup for failure and tools that barely work when you need them most.

Tired of:

“Let’s align on priorities.”
“Let’s circle back.”
“Let’s touch base.”

Touch what? A spreadsheet? My last nerve?

I didn’t sign up for this to become a calendar puppet or an CRM monkey. 

I wanted freedom, meaning, something real. 

Instead, I’m stuck in a loop of activity mistaken for progress and noise mistaken for impact.

I’m not writing this for applause. Or a “hang in there, champ.”

I’m writing this because I know I’m not the only one.

Not sure what’s next for me yet. But I know it’s not this. 

If you’ve found a way out, something that makes you feel alive again without selling your soul for a 15-minute meeting, tell me.

Because I’m not afraid of hard work. 

I’m afraid of waking up five years from now and not recognizing myself anymore.

If this resonates, share your experiences.

1jv0fh4,Interview tips that helped me stand out(verified by recruiters),"Since I started searching for internships in college and even after working full-time for a while, I’ve gone through nearly hundreds of interviews. I summarized some of the tricks I used during interviews and applied them consistently in the end. One of my recruiters even said that my performance and communication style impressed him, which proved that these methods were super useful. Here are my tricks that helped me improve my prep quality:

**Start with small talk**: It helps me relax and get into the right mindset and it leaves HR with a friendly impression. I usually start by asking where they are and how the weather is, and what I’ve been up to recently.

**Use the Q&A session to sell myself again**: I usually say something like: ""I know this is a very competitive position. I’d love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."" Based on the HR’s answer, I will summarize and highlight my strengths again to reinforce my impression. I also proactively ask about the next steps to express my strong interest in the role.

**Research HR in advance**: Before interviews, I usually search for the HR’s profile on LinkedIn to prepare targeted questions for the Q&A session and show my interest. If I notice they’ve been with the company for a long time, I’ll casually mention it: ""I noticed you’ve been with the company for quite a while, which shows great commitment. Could you share what you like most about working here?""

**Make your experience audience-friendly**: Most HR don't have tech background, so it’s important to explain my work in a way they can understand. I generally write out my example and let ChatGPT rephrase it to be friendly for non-technical audiences.

**Connect with alumni from the company as soon as you get the interview**: This is the most efficient way to quickly learn about the company. When connecting with alumni, don’t immediately jump into asking for a coffee chat, ask them about the interview process and what they like most about working at the company.

**Show your understanding of the company during the interview**:Let the HR or hiring manager know that you’ve done your homework for this interview. Prepare an example in advance that strongly connects the company’s culture, outlook, or business with your personality or experience.

**Prepare a work sample related to the company**: It’s a good chance to showcase your execution skills and capabilities. Make the HR or hiring manager feel valued and respected.

1jv01xc,"Did the company actually see my resume, or just rejected the agency because I applied directly?","Hi everyone,

I'm currently job hunting and recently ran into a situation that left me wondering how companies handle resumes from both agencies and direct applicants. Here’s what happened:

* A recruiter (agency) submitted my resume to a company on **Friday two weeks ago**.
* The same job posting on **Seek** (Australia’s job board) **expired that same day**.
* I didn’t realize I had already applied to this company before, so I **submitted my application again via the company’s official website just last night (Monday)**.
* Today, the recruiter contacted me saying the **client rejected their submission because I had already applied directly**.
* The recruiter emphasized that duplicate applications could be a red flag and that’s why they can’t represent me anymore.

Here’s what I’m really trying to figure out:

1. **Is it likely that the company has actually reviewed my resume yet, or did their system just automatically detect a duplicate submission?**
2. **Does the fact that the recruiter submitted my resume two weeks ago and I applied again myself last night mean the company just saw the ""duplicate"" but hasn't actually looked at either version?**
3. **If I applied directly via their official site, is that application now active and being considered?**
4. **Do companies usually look at agency resumes first, or direct applications first?**
5. **Will this affect my chances negatively, even though the duplicate wasn’t intentional?**

1juzmkr,What career roles should I consider that combine chemical engineering and management experience?,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some guidance and hoping to hear from folks who’ve been in a similar situation.

I graduated as a Chemical Engineer from India in 2019. After graduation, I shifted focus toward management and pursued a Master’s in International Business at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, UK (Jan 2020 intake). Unfortunately, COVID hit just as I started, and the entire program was moved online. That shift really impacted the overall experience—no proper exposure, no campus placements, and limited networking.

Despite that, I was fortunate enough to land a job in Saudi Arabia. Currently, I’m working in Riyadh as an Operations Coordinator in a food processing and manufacturing company. My role includes overseeing production, purchasing, supply chain, and supporting the business development team with market expansion and product diversification.

Lately, though, I’ve been feeling a bit disconnected from my core background in chemical engineering. I don’t want to completely let go of the technical side of my education, and I’d really like to find a role where I can apply both my chemical engineering expertise and the management/business skills I’ve gained over the past few years.

What kind of roles or career paths should I be looking into? Ideally something that blends both technical and managerial aspects. If anyone here has made a similar transition, or is working in a hybrid role, I’d love to hear your advice.

Now, I wanted to send a farewell thanks email to them to appreciate them for one last time. However, due to getting involved in some work couldn't send it. The next day when I sent the mail on Outlook (the company's official email channel), their email has already ceased to exist hence the mail didn't get sent.

1juzdr0,Role expanded significantly – how much more salary should I ask for?,"Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate your input on how to approach a salary increase discussion.

I work in IT Sales at an international company in Switzerland. Over the past months, my role has changed significantly:

I’m now fully responsible for the Swiss market (previously shared)

I’ve taken on a strategic role beyond sales – including shaping how we position Managed Services & SaaS

I was selected as an internal ambassador for these areas due to my success and expertise

I'm actively helping to drive a mindset shift within the team to align with the company's long-term vision – this requires not just execution, but influencing how others think and work

My current salary is CHF 180,000. With the added responsibility and strategic impact, I feel a raise is more than justified – but I’m unsure what’s realistic in terms of % increase.

My questions:

What kind of raise (in %) would be considered fair in this situation?

Any tips on how to best frame the value I bring in such a conversation?

1juz9sr,"I think I was fired illegally, is it worth actually doing anything about?","I was just fired from my first job out of college after only 2 weeks. The reasons were:
  -  I asked 2 of my coworkers about pay because mine seemed low (relative to market)
  - I called in sick for 2 days (genuinely sick)

My question is this: was I wrongfully terminated and if so, is it even worth the effort in fighting?

It’s worth noting that I don’t currently have these reasons for termination in writing, nor did do I have documentation of my illness, but I may be able to get both if I try (I’m still a little sick). But if I was wronged, what would legal action look like, cost, or gain for me? Did I work there long enough to actually be protected in this situation?

It was mostly out of sheer desperation. Landing a job as a recent grad these days feels harder than escaping Alcatraz.

I came across a YC company called SpurTest on the Lightcone podcast. They were working on AI-driven QA testing using natural language, and I found it fascinating.

So, I decided to build an open-source version — Neutrino. I created an AI web agent from scratch using step prompting in a Playwright browser. It simulates how a human would interact with a website to generate end-to-end tests, all driven by natural language.

It’s been a super fun project so far. This is just v1 — still rough in some areas, but fully working.

Right now, I'm experimenting with efficient step-mark prompting technique to make it smarter and faster. I'm also considering fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 VL 7B for reduced cost and better performance down the line.

1juy757,Overtime exception [WASHINGTON] state,"1. Washington state is phasing in a 2.5x state min wage for overtime exempt employees. I am a leader at the local level and my entire small team is currently overtime exempt employees. 
2. The current Overtime exempt salary is $69305. There is an exception to the rule if an employee is an outside sales person. 
3. While my employees are required to preform sales, sales calls and other outside sales duties, they are also required to be in the showroom open to close most/all days unless on appointment, merchandise and preform other showroom responsibilities. They have laptops they travel with and take home each day. They are paid 60-65k. 

Someone recently quit saying they were being paid illegally. HR says their are described as outside sales people in their job descriptions. I feel like my leader and my HR team are putting me in an unethical and wrong position continuously asking me to tell the “outside” sales people they have to move rugs, furniture and be in the showroom 8-4:30. I think outside sales people should be outside of the business 30 plus hours a week and mine are not. On weeks they do travel they work upwards of 50 hours but this is never more than once a month. 
Washington state law says in this subject that “job titles and descriptions do not determine the exempt status” and to take the job duties test, my team meets the duties test of employees that should be overtime exempt because they are preforming a hybrid list of duties between outside and professional. 

Is the only ethical thing to report my employer to L&I? they won’t hear me out and are blatantly saying my team is paid enough and not worth more. When I read the law I see holes in their logic. 

My boss told me last Monday they were going to pay it out, then he found out it goes up 10k more in Jan and freaked out, then he and HR told me the job description line. They are based on east coast and only have 10 employees here.

1juy4mj,I’ve got a recommendation for a leading position,"I am a Software developer with 2 years of experience and somehow managed to impress someone enough that he recommended me for an upcoming leading position with a small team.

Now - he asked me first if he should even do it and I said yes because I was simply stunned? I don’t know how to explain it.

But since then I’ve been thinking a lot. My main worry is my lack of experience and my health.

How will someone with 10+ years of experience even look at me?
I am Bipolar 1, will I even be able to handle the additional pressure?

Additionally - I love my current job. Yes, the pay would be significantly higher and I need that money for private reasons - less so for a more lavish lifestyle. 


Now, it’s not that it came out of nowhere and I have absolutely 0 experience with managing a project.
Since my (former, now fired) manager was incompetent I had to take unofficial control a large project before, coordinate the development. 
Appoint meetings, gather every resource that we need to finish the project. Keep track of our current progress and directly communicate with the Stakeholders. And quite frankly, keep the manager away from messing things up. 
I can’t stress enough how incompetent he was.
Managed to delay several projects at once and got a service provider to threaten us to quit if they have to work with him again. And we pay them a lot.

1juxy10,Should I pursue art business or physics?,"I will take any advice.

I would also like to know which path would get me into a better university.

1. Art selling with a degree in business:

Reasons: I am a successful artist with various commissions as a 17 year old, some even over $1000 (can provide images) and I also sell cards with my designs printed on them and receive commission with two different businesses. I am well known for this but it only extends to my small hometown and I have no scope on how reliable of a career this would be and also if it could be paired with a business or data analytics degree. I also am taking business calculus through a community college right now.

2. Physics or data science

Until recently I have always seen this as the best option for a career as even though successful now, art is an unreliable career and I am not well versed in business. I have a deep knowledge base in physics as a high schooler and have taken multiple STEM AP classes since sophomore year. I took precalculus as a sophomore and am now enrolled in Calc as a Junior. Through my community college I could pursue higher physics classes that call for grounds under an astrophysics degree. However I have not competed in olympiads and don’t have as much extracurricular work in physics but it seems like the safer career option.

1juxe7c,Switching Degrees?,"I’m in Sydney, Australia—aware things like qualifications and job markets differ by country, so I’ll include Aus context where I can. Prefer Aussie responses, but open to others too! I’m (21F) in 2nd yr of a 4 year radiography degree. Previously did a year of occupational therapy but switched as I’m pretty introverted and OT felt like a super extroverted patient oriented field (radiography is still patient oriented but I’m finding this aspect fine as it’s much briefer interactions and less about building rapport, interviews assessments etc). I find radiography okay, I don’t hate the job but I’m worried that positioning and shooting for the rest of my life will get boring. If I stick with it my end goal would be sonography as i find it more interesting and hands on (+higher pay). There’s not much info online around sonos in Aus but from what I’ve seen it’s really difficult and competitive getting a training position. Also looking at post grad dentistry as an option if I can keep my marks up/perform well in the gamsat. If not, I feel like I’d be content working as a hospital radiographer, since there’s more variety in patient presentations, trauma cases, and daily work tends to be less repetitive than in private practice. But over the past year of haphazardly looking at NSW Health (state government ) job vancancies, I’ve seen maybe one metro hospital job pop up every few months — and with 150+ sydney grads each year, I’m not confident I’d land a hospital role without going rural.  I’d find a job fairly easy going private but I feel like I’ll be bored out of my mind doing the same routine projections . Pay ceilings capped at 130kAUD (about 80KUSD)— pay is better again for hospital rads as this is exclusive of overtime and oncall which is rlly where the moneys at in radiography. I’m content with 130k cap but radiography’s also a pretty physical job, manual handling constantly and no opportunity to WFH. So I’ve been looking instead at doing a 3yr comp sci degree.  I find the problem solving aspect interesting and am going to spend some time when the semesters over to really look into coding n see if it’s something I’d enjoy doing but most ppl in my life are pretty against me changing courses for the second time. From what I’ve read around, pay ceiling in Aus is much higher than radiography (although not comparable to US salaries in tech), work like balance is fairly good depending on the company w opportunities to WFH and although job security isn’t as great as healthcare the fields growing (I know the market for compi sci grads is super saturated in the US— seems to be relatively okay in Aus). I’m just weary of having 6 years of hecs debt and just feel stressed switching when radiography definitely isn’t terrible. So I was wondering if any one in any of the fields I’ve mentioned had any guidance/experience in field and whether they enjoy what they’re doing, made a switch to corporate work after radiography, whether they think switching is worthwhile or to just stick with it etc?!!!

I’ve been applying to so many places but I just can’t seem to get a response.

1juvwcz,Need help getting ahead of a VERY difficult career decision,"Context: I'm a 28y media producer looking for work in a major U.S. city after being laid off in January. My previous role was fantastic and spoiled me (solid salary, INCREDIBLE benefits, great culture, prioritized work/life balance, hybrid working conditions etc.) I've spent a few months working on my resume, have just finished the kickoff of my small business, and got ahead on some creative projects while looking and applying for jobs. 

A few days ago, I applied for a job posting for a company of successful businesses run by someone famous in their field (like, a known person in the public consciousness and a certified celebrity in their industry). Don't feel comfy saying anything more than that unless it becomes relevant later. I did a phone interview earlier today, and before I even hung up the call the interviewer already let me know I'd be moving forward to the 2nd round (which has since been scheduled and will be taking place later this week). I learned on this call that my next interview is with that celebrity figure, and if I get the job, they'd be my boss as I'd report to them directly. 

On paper, this move seems like a no-brainer and I don't have any major red flags to report so far - but I also know when to listen to my gut, and my gut is hesitant. I'm just trying to figure out if those concerns are valid or if bad work experiences in my past are clouding my judgment. 

Here's the pros/cons I'm working through right now: 

* **Pros**
   * Role + responsibilities
      * The day-to-day of this job sounds like a grand tour of every professional skill I've liked to do in my career so far. I can do the hard challenges in my sleep (applying my media skills, working with/for a public person, being creative in this specific context)
      * I'm entering my mid-career but this job is open to entry-level applicants as well, making me think I'm as competitive as anybody in this hiring pool (VERY uncommon for media professionals these days)
      * If I could create a job where the applied work was made out of skills I'd want to do exclusively, it would look a lot like what they're describing this position as. The core fit is incredible. 
      * I like what the industry makes and was a fan of this figure and their work long before I applied. Since I was a teenager, at least.
   * Learning opportunities
      * The soft challenges of this role (building the unique kind of media solution they'd be searching for) will be grueling and time-consuming, but the exact kind of challenge I need to plug all the skills I've been learning together. 
   * Work/job stability
      * The industry isn't heavily affected by market trends and would be VERY unlikely to go under anytime soon. The liability-to-profit ratio when a company is managed well insulates it against a lot of market risk. 
      * The company is also headquartered locally and does the majority of its business in my metro, minimizing the need to travel and nearly eliminating any kind of risk I'd ever have to relocate as far as I know. I love where I live so much I bought an apartment last year with my wife. That matters more to me than it would to most. 
* **Cons**
   * Comp/benefits: 
      * This job isn't a huge step-down salary-wise from where I was at (about $10K), but when the gap in benefits is included it reduces the value of the position down by almost $25K. I have debt I have to get rid of so I don't have a ton of wiggle room to either wait too long or take a role that won't pay me enough in the long term.
      * If working as a media professional in this economy stunted any hopes I'd have to grow my salary in the short term, working as a media professional in this industry would outright destroy that chance in the long term. Nothing about this field is corporate like that and there's an expectation that you either get a promotion or a new job to grow your salary. 
   * Industry culture:
      * This industry isn't known for having stellar HR infrastructure, and bosses can be a complete nightmare to work with - especially if they own the company and you have to work with them directly. 
      * This industry is also known for being chock-full of workaholics with zero boundaries around hours/workload. That stereotype isn't associated with what I'd be doing, but I do not doubt that culture exists in most executional roles at any company in this field. 
   * Job requirements:
      * This role isn't just an in-office position (with a manageable but possibly annoying 40+ minute commute each way to worry about), it's a role with non-traditional hours: I'd have to work in-office from 11-6:30 Tuesday-Saturday and get Mondays off instead. 
      * If I have people in my inbox first thing in the morning and after I leave the office, I could see this becoming an 8AM-8PM+ job VERY easily and that worries me. 
      * Lots of the job is related to time-sensitive event-based projects, which also introduces a risk of more nights and weekends. 

I guess I'm torn because, over the last eight years I've worked, the combination of a big, central personality as the face of an independent company, the wide range of professional skills required, the unclear salary growth ladder, and the odd hours have always spelled out trouble. On the other hand, that doesn't make it not a great opportunity/resume builder, I do *need* to get a solid source of income by July, and the parts of this job that would normally challenge someone are the exact parts I can do without having to try too hard and hurting myself. 

It's the little things - like they've been super professional and responsive and eager so far, but I've heard tons of feedback that when an employer acts like that it means they see the role as difficult to fill/retain. 

To refocus this, I have a couple of questions I'd like to get some advice on: 

1. **Am I being unfair to this potential employer by lumping them in with the rest of their industry?** They haven't broken any stereotypes on that so far, but I also want to be sure I'm not filling in blanks where there aren't any. 

2. **I know this will be ""getting ahead of myself"" until I receive an offer, but is it rational for me to worry this much about this potentially being the best and only real opportunity that allows me to find work without having to leave my career? My gut is telling me the universe will punish me if I say no and take a bigger risk with my future than I already am.**

3. **I've done work much more difficult than what's written in this job description, and that took a toll on my mental and physical health. Am I projecting too much of that onto this?** 

4. **Does this all feel so challenging because of the role, or because this is the first time I've had to think about these implications in a long time?**

I am looking for advice on what to do, as I am feeling a little lost in my career. I have a Masters in robotics (4.0 gpa), 2 y.o.e in software engineering, 3 workshops, and a couple of publications. Undergrad was also 4.0 and in computer science. Currently working in research.

I wanted to be an academic in biomedical engineering, but after this year, with the labs I applied to stating no funding, I’ve begun to look elsewhere. 

I’ve recently been offered a fairly decent job in the defence sector, which would be about a 30% salary increase from my current research job - allowing me to move out and “start” my life. However, ethically I am against this move. I don’t want to develop weapons, and my hearts been set on using technology to help those in need.

1juvi65,"Feeling completely lost, need guidance","Hi everyone,

I'm looking for both general career advice as well as actionable steps, like what would you do if you were me?

I've been working as a software engineer at a financial company for almost 3 years now, right out of college. I'm in a kind of ETL role. I've felt extremely stagnant, like I haven't really grown whatsoever as a developer. I feel like I generally don't know what's going on, like I don't have my finger on the pulse.

I haven't really found mentorship or guidance in my team at work. I've signed up for some mentorship/coaching group sessions offered by my company, but they haven't been very helpful. I don't feel like my questions (generic career crisis) were on par with the specific and thoughtful things the other mentees had to ask.

One of the biggest things I worry about beyond the lack of skill development is my inability to really describe what it is I've been doing these past few years. I feel like my work has been kind of random and specific to the team I'm on, and that it's hard to describe. I especially feel this way because I don't think the work I've done has been important.

I really feel like it's time for me to leave my job. I've stayed for this long due to inertia and fear born from the reasons listed above. But I feel so frustrated and emotionally drained returning to this place where I'm not learning, growing, or having interesting experiences of any kind. I don't want to put the blame entirely on my team or my company. A large part of my lack of progress definitely stems from a lack of personal incentive or ambition, introversion, and imposter syndrome.

I'd love to quit and become a bartender or an alpaca farmer but I have student loans I need to pay off, so I definitely need a career where I can make good money. Some things about me are that I like working with people one on one and really value team culture / mentorship. I've been thinking about project management perhaps -- would anyone in this area be able to describe what it's like? I wouldn't mind staying in software, or choosing a specific domain. With the recent developments in AI, the field is changing so fast and the kinds of jobs available are bound to change, which is definitely something I have in mind. Does anyone have ideas about resilient roles/fields in tech I could try to pivot towards?

At the same time, sometimes I think that the world is my oyster and I can completely change my job and life if I set my mind to it. I just don't know where to start. I'm sorry this ended up a ramble, but if someone has tangible advice for a relatively junior developer feeling rather lost and not knowing where to go from here, I would so deeply appreciate hearing from you. Thank you so much.

Lately I'm noticing a shift in managements ability to ""manage"" properly and also noticing a shift  in the industry as well. 

The past year I've been overworked and just been taking on project after project with no real compensation. I'm getting a new supervisor in the coming weeks that I have a bad feeling about in terms of them being the proper ""fit"" for the overall company/ team culture and them being ok with the way we work.

Today I randomly logged into LinkedIn and first thing I seen was a job I'm pretty sure I would love.

It's funny, in all of my 5 years at this company I never once thought of leaving. But I don't know why but when I seen this career opportunity posted I literally had a moment of ""should I apply??""

1juu3a9,"Feeling Stuck — Looking for a Path Forward (33M, Married with Kids, Rural Area)","I’m a 33-year-old married father of three, living in a very rural area. Because of a custody agreement from a previous marriage,I can’t move more than 50 miles sp relocation isn't possible. My wife and I both work full time, each making around $20K a year. Despite working hard, we live paycheck to paycheck. We’ve already cut expenses to the bone, and we’re in one of the most affordable rentals in the area — but there’s just no breathing room.

The job market here is extremely limited. The only real options are oilfield, construction, retail, or fast food. I’ve worked in the oilfield before, but the work is unreliable — when oil prices drop, hours and positions disappear. For the past 6 years, I’ve been working at McDonald’s. I’m a department manager now, handling scheduling, interviews, hiring, and orientations. I enjoy the work and really like my coworkers, but the pay just isn’t enough to support a family or build a future. I’m also pretty introverted, so the people-facing parts of the job can be challenging, but I’ve found ways to manage and still get the job done.

I’ve dabbled in a lot of things over the years, but haven’t mastered any one skill

Lately, I’ve been thinking about a career change. I have a friend who works solo doing IT for a local nonprofit, and he seems really happy and fulfilled. That got me interested in IT or help desk work. The thing is — I have zero experience, no certifications, and no idea where to even begin. Time and money are both tight with a family to support, and I’m not sure if going back to school is even a realistic option.

I’ve also thought about getting my CDL, since there’s a lot of oilfield-related driving work nearby. But I don’t want to be gone from home for long stretches doing OTR work.

Right now, I just feel stuck — like I’m treading water with no real path forward. I’m looking for advice, realistic career paths, or even just encouragement. Has anyone been in a similar spot and found a way out? What would you do if you were in my shoes?

1jutr8b,Big career change Advice,"Try to make a long story short: 

I’ve been an occupational therapist for almost 3 years. I enjoy my career. However, I took on a lot of student debt (150k from grad school and 110k from undergrad) and my career does not pay enough to allow me to ever pay my loans off. Current pay is approx 70k.

I recently have been looking into the option of joining the Army (4 year contract) or Air Force (3 year contract) to be an occupational therapist. They offer student loan repayment that will basically cover my grad school loans. 
Pros: loan repayment, skill development as a clinician, skill development as a leader, travel
Cons: moving away from family, possible deployment

I’ll be 30 years old by the time I’d commission. I’m currently married, partner is willing to relocate and able to work remotely. We can sell our house and use the profit to pay off my undergrad loans and other debts. 

My other options are to continue flipping houses with my partner to eventually pay off my students loans (roughly 5 year plan) or try to get a job in medical sales to hopefully double my current salary in order to aggressively pay off my students loans. It will be difficult to land a medical sales job. 

Open to any thoughts/advice? I personal feel it’s a no-brainer to join the military. ",Ok_Chef8676,3,1.0,2,1744160911,2025-04-09 01:08:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jutr8b/big_career_change_advice/,4,2025

1jusz5o,Potential Career Paths,"Hello everyone,

I am currently a freshman in college and am thinking about future career paths. I originally started out as CS but after exploring some areas of software development, found that I have little interest/passion in anything regarding frontend + backend development, systems, APIs, networking, cloud computing, low-level programming, etc. I enjoy math, creative and investigative thinking, and research, which drew me to AI/ML. However, my understanding of the Machine Learning Engineer role is mostly software engineering (data processing, cleaning, creating the architecture to train and deploy models), which I don't find appealing.

I am currently exploring robotics, data science, business analyst, and operations research, which I find more intellectually stimulating. Working as a data scientist or business analyst requires statistical analysis and mathematical modelling of data, which I enjoy. I switched to Industrial Engineering with a CS minor, and plan to pursue a concurrent MS in CS. I am okay with data processing, APIs, etc if they are not the main focus on my work and more of a means towards the end, if that makes sense. For example, I think robotic engineering job postings sound interesting. I just do not see myself working in big tech in app development, internal optimization, feature debugging, database management, or generally any of the SWE new grad/intern jobs (if I am misunderstanding, please let me know). I also am interested in CS + medicine, astronomy, etc, and want to use CS as more of a tool than just programming.

I would really appreciate any career advice on other majors, jobs, grad school (if a PhD is needed), what path I can take, or similar stories.

1just7k,How to ask to have a noncompete waived?,"Location: OHIO - I recently received an offer letter that I am intending to accept in the coming days. During the interview process, they asked if I had a noncompete agreement, and if so, to send over the documentation surrounding it. I do, so I sent it over to them. Upon receiving the verbal offer, the internal HR recruiter told me I would need to get something in writing that releases me from the noncompete in my current employee agreement. 

I guess I’m just looking to know if this is standard procedure, and how I should be proceeding from here. I didn’t get any red flags from the future employer, and they said they’d help me every step of the way. For what it’s worth, the noncompete states that I cannot work for a material competitor of current employer for 12 months following my employment termination. I’ve never once seen this enforced, even when former employees go to work for a direct competitor. Future employer is not a material competitor - they are in the same industry (insurance) but operate in different sectors of the industry. 

My guess is future employer is just trying to cover their ass, but I found it strange that they’re asking me to essentially ask my current employer to amend my contract on the way out the door. 

Thoughts? Should I lawyer up to get this handled? I don’t realistically see my current employer jamming me up over this, but if they decide to, what then?

1jurfza,My colleagues accidentally saw my payslip.,"It’s been a really stressful week for our family since my dad passed away. Work has been tough too, I’m only three months in, still trying to catch up and get up to speed.

Last Monday, during a brainstorming session about an issue I found, I had to share my screen… and BOOM - I forgot to close my payslip. My colleagues saw a glimpse of my salary for a few seconds before I managed to close the PDF. They laughed about it, and I laughed along too, but deep down I can’t stop thinking about the fact that they saw it.

I really don’t want things to feel awkward between us and I mean, payslips are supposed to be confidential, right? One of the senior members even told me that back when he was my age, his salary was much lower. HAHAHAHA MY GOSH.

1jurddl,Worried new job will find out about full time offer I accepted from internship that is on resume,"Basically, I interned at company X last year and received a full time offer. I took the offer but spoke with a higher-up in the firm that I wanted to explore opportunities that were more in line with my career interests. He told me I should do exactly that, to accept their offer, and to rescind my acceptance should I find something better. I should note this is a large multinational firm.

Fast forward to now and I got an offer from company Y, conditional on me passing a background check (through the background check firm Tru View). Y’s conditional offer letter only specified a “Criminal and Misdemeanor background check” which I have no worries about but I was sent an authorization form by Tru View and in this letter it said I would be authorizing them to run a background check on everything from criminal history, education, and employment including reaching out to managers etc.

I had my internship from company X listed on my resume as I believe the name recognition helps my application, but now I’m worried company Y will find out l accepted an offer from company X that starts around the same time. I planned on informing company X that I will no longer be working there once I have a complete offer from Company Y, which is why I haven’t rescinded my acceptance yet (also you never know in this job market). I’m wondering if anyone can give me some experience with how a background check through Tru View or similar companies functions. To clarify, I didn’t include any references or supervisors from company X in my original application for company Y so I imagine they would be reaching out to HR and be referred to payroll or something just to confirm my employment and dates worked. 

In short I’m kind of in a catch-22 and am unsure where to go from here. Some people said I’m overthinking it and they will ask me about this if it comes up and I could just explain the situation,  others have said they probably won’t find out, and some have said I should just get ahead of it and let them know now.

Long story short, the pay is on the lower side, the job itself is okay, and my boss has also exhibited some toxic traits imo. Before I got this job, I was out of work for a few months. During this time, I decided to apply for a few masters of social work programs and I have heard that these programs are very hard to get into. I found out this week that I got accepted into two different programs and I couldn't believe it. When my boss initially hired me, I didn't tell her that I was applying for my masters because a) I was nervous that I wouldn't get the job and b) I didn't even think that I would have been accepted.

My contract ends in December of this year but it looks like I will have to quit beforehand. I've never quit a job before so I'm not sure what to say or when exactly I should tell my boss. I'm scared about my boss' reaction since she's not expecting me to quit less than a year in. All of the staff have been working at this nonprofit for years so this might come as a shock.

1jupnhj,Digital Marketing vs. Front-End Development – Which Is the Better Path for remote work?,"Hey everyone,

I'm at a crossroads and could really use your insights. I currently work as a mechanical engineer in the oil & gas field in a third world country with a very bad wage (relative to other countries) but less demanding workload (8.30 AM to 3.30 PM). I’m planning to start a remote side hustle after my current job with the goal of landing a remote job that I can work after my current job at night time (night time in my country is day time in USA, Canada, etc..)—ideally, earning an extra $2000–$3000 a month.

Here’s where I’m stuck: I have some technical skills (I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), a strong knack for problem solving, and a good understanding of tech. However, I do struggle a lot with memorizing as I really have a bad memory that affected my learning journey and made me stuck. I’ve been debating whether to focus on digital marketing or front-end development as the primary skill that will help me build this income stream.

I feel like I should stop trying with frontend development and focus on learning digital marketing.

I’m torn between the two routes—digital marketing feels exciting for its creative and strategic aspects that will leverage my analytical thinking and will be less memory demanding, but front-end development could capitalize on my coding background (I feel like I wasted months or maybe years with actual results by learning to code and the landing an entry-level position as frontend developer remote now with no experience is very hard).

What are your thoughts about this?

Has anyone had experience choosing one path over the other for online and remote income?

1juowxf,Don't know how to title this.,"I'm on the board of a non-profit organization that teaches salsa classes.  
We have a weekly practice day and one of the people that comes to have weekly salsa classes, let's call her Sara, has shown interest in becoming a teacher.

Sara's skill level is, without a doubt, not high enough to become the person that assists the teacher, in our organization.  
Our classes always have a teacher and besides that, we have a ""helper"" present to help out new people, in case the material being taught, is too difficult to dive into, as a beginner.   
I have with the board decided to offer to take Sara under my wing (I'm the regular ""Helper""). 

Today I did so, and asked Sara to dance with the beginners, but without helping out as a helper, and instead observe how I do the job, and I would also give out tips to Sara on how to be a helper. 

At first Sara quickly lost interest and focus on the tips I was giving her.  
A bit later she started teaching as a helper, which I had to ask her not to do. She told me she felt like I was being condescending when I asked her to observe and not teach. Later she told me she had done pole dancing for two years, and a lot of the same principles apply, and that she had been dancing salsa for two years already and knew everything.   
I told her it's dangerous to ever think you know everything.

So now I'm considering having a private talk with Sara, and in the most polite way, tell her what I've observed, and that she can try to become a teacher, but she will have to face that her level is not there yet, and that it will take work to get there. The tricky part is, Sara is immature in some areas, and some of these areas, she will need to work on, in order to become a teacher. I have a friendly relation with Sara, and I'm focused on doing my job, as a part of the organization.

Is it a good idea to have this meeting? How do I handle this situation well?",YogurtclosetApart592,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1744147191,2025-04-08 21:19:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1juowxf/dont_know_how_to_title_this/,4,2025

I have flexible working hours, the ability to work from home, my own personal office, and an incredibly understanding director who’s honestly the best manager I’ve ever had.

The new job at the crown corporation is in-office and would be a one-year contract. It’s an in scope position, with a 10% pay increase from my current role. The job would be a senior position in the same field, meaning a step up in terms of responsibility.

1junqpn,What would you do in my situation? Basically free further education.,"I'm a 24 YOM living on my own in Ottawa, Ontario. I've already gotten a university degree in communications, but found that a bachelor's is really only useful for trying to apply to government jobs. Most of my previous job experience came from working as a guide in different museums. The ""main"" experience I have on my resume is working as a paramedic dispatcher for a year. Lovely job, super engaging, but the 12hr shift work was too killer for me. I moved on to security dispatch for a hospital, as a casual worker with 8hr shifts. It's okay, but unless I apply to become full-time, it isn't a viable long term job.

Now here's the deal, my grandma (whom out of her 3 grandkids, I'm the only one who calls, talks to her, and actually cares about her) has made the shocking offer to pay for me to go back to school for anything I want.

So what do I want? No idea. I have many thoughts: dental hygienist, pursuing something further in museum studies, other medical fields, things that involve using my hands, etc. I know this could likely set the course for my short and long term future, so I want to take it seriously. I want a field that avoids shift work, pays well (hoping to start around 60 - 70k a year and move upwards), and isn't soul crushing (but it doesn't have to be crazy fun either, I know that's usually the trade off).

The issue is that I have another colleague that I trained up into my position with the same title and this colleague has more of the technical skill for this role despite me still having to do those same technical skills. I also pretty much do all the interpersonal work, cross operational work, trainings, client reporting, internal 
beginning and end of the year reporting, I’m pretty much all the other things that are out of my job description. The only reason my boss harps so hard on me about the technical skills that I don’t have as well is because I’m so good at my job in order to have the position that he’s leaving I would need to ace those skills. the thing is that I am working on it and I am getting better, but I don’t want to spend another two years trying to develop this one skill when I have an insane amount of talent and skill that I can pretty much bring value to so many teams and already do. 
I’ve gotten maybe two small raises the entire time I’ve been here. Overall, I have been making $7000 more than I did when I started. But if I were to be honest, I think that I’m worth over $30,000 more. 
My question is, does it make sense for me to tell my boss this elongated explanation of this additional work that I’ve been doing and why I feel like I would like to be acknowledged for that work and for the things that I’ve been holding me back with him to not spill over to the new manager and hopefully turn a new stone and I can work towards Developing other skills and moving up the company in a different way, or even keeping the same job title, but expanding on the duties that I do with more pay. 
My boss is leaving soon , even though he’ll still be around I kind of feel like I need to defend my work and also acknowledge that I have been holding this entire project up without the fair recognition.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to go about this without it seeming like I’m gonna end up leaving or putting him in a weird place or even the new person in a weird place, let me know.

1jums4b,Accepted an Offer at Aon but Still Unsure,"Hi all,

I’d really appreciate some advice as I’m feeling pretty conflicted.

I’m currently a Senior Business Analyst (SBA) working in the HR tech domain at a global MNC. I have around 4 years of total work experience – 2 years before and 2 years after my MBA (from a Tier-2 B-school), all in MNCs.

Recently, I accepted an offer from Aon for an SBA role in their Assessments team, and I’m supposed to join in about a month. The process was unique — I actually received the offer directly from the Director himself, which is pretty unusual (but legit!) and honestly made me super happy. The conversations were refreshing, the team felt collaborative, and the pay hike is generous.

However, I’m still feeling torn. I was aiming to pivot into a Product Owner/Product Manager role in domains like fintech, healthcare, or telecom (since I’ve already been in HR tech for a while). I’ve been applying actively, but haven’t had much luck so far — not many interview calls and nothing concrete.

I’ve also tried researching Aon’s Assessments team and looking up people on LinkedIn to get a sense of the kind of work they do and what long-term paths might look like — but I couldn’t find much that I could relate to or feel excited about. My worry is that this role might narrow my future options even more, making a pivot harder.

Would love your thoughts on:

1. Should I still go ahead and join Aon and make the best of it while applying in parallel?

1jum6gi,Aimless Ambition,"Hi

I’m about to turn 25 next month. Life has been a crazy rollercoaster during the past 18-20 months. I graduated in 2023 and landed a role as an associate trainee at a good law firm, however as fate would have my seniors messed up a big deal and the department I was working on got dissolved.

The next week, I came back home to a dead mother, that should have been a big low point, but up until that point in my life I was pretty confident in my ability to weather any storm. The “alpha” male arche type, only now I know I should’ve cried like a little boy then.

It was hard to get a job in the market at that point and i made the stupid decision to take a drop year for CAT, that decision was made purely to delay the inevitable and buy some time to breathe.

I got addicted to gambling during that time, at one point I was up 30 lakhs, I was living like a king, gifting 15-20k shoes to friends, tipping 500 rupees on a 500 rupee haircut but then what happens in every movie happened, i lost it all, lost my mind too, the thoughts to end it all did occur to me.

I was crashing out, it felt like a bubble around my head that would just not burst, I told my father everything.

Surprisingly enough, the man who would beat the shit out of me if he passed him achar instead of butter, forgave me in an instant, he could see in me, how badly fucked I was.

I gave the CAT exam, and what had to happen happened, scored 85 percentile, which is as good as 50, nothing really holds value before 95.

I did well in the Symbiosis MBA entrance exam but fell short by 2 percentile.

I have been applying to jobs for the past 4 months but since I’m not such a great prospect, I don’t really hear back from good places.

I’m joining a firm, where there is potential to grow, but my starting salary would be 25-30k.

The point behind my sob story was, I’m seeking to hear from people older than me, you maybe started working or getting their life on track later on in their lives and maybe some advice.

I feel like i’ve experienced ego death, in some ways, i cant afford to have an ego right now, any advice or anecdotes of your own.

Help a brother out, I’m ambitious and passionate to grow in life but i lack direction.

Anything to help a brother out. Thanks for reading this",Historical_Tank_2946,1,1.0,0,1744140336,2025-04-08 19:25:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jum6gi/aimless_ambition/,4,2025

1juljrq,New Job or Federal Job,"I apologize in advance for the long post, I’m really torn about this decision and am running out of time to decide. For reference I’m in my 20’s, graduated 3 years ago, but only have 1 year of experience in my current industry.

TLDR: Should I leave my federal job for a private sector job with less benefits but more stability and remote work. 

I am a current federal employee working as an engineer in the power industry. I’ve just recently hit my 1 year anniversary and passed the probationary period. The last few months have been pretty chaotic between sudden probationary employee firings, rehiring those employees back, loss of telework, threats of RIFs, being told that we’re actually exempt from future RIFs, then being told we are going through a RIF only to be told again that we aren’t. The whiplash of everything and the uncertainty of future changes has been difficult. We lost a lot of experience with the first deferred resignation program, and I have struggled to find good training and mentorship. I’ve performed well over my year here, but I think that’s largely due to my experience from the private sector and expectations being low coming in.

During the first round of firings in February I thought I would be impacted and reached out to a manager of an old internship to see if they were hiring. She immediately referred me to the hiring manager, and things moved a bit slowly, but yesterday they gave me an offer. 

It is fully remote at the exact same salary I make now. I would be going to 160hrs of pto, every other Friday off (9/9’s) and 7 paid holidays vs the 26 days of combined leave/sick pay and 11 holidays I receive now. The health benefits are better but I wouldn’t be able to carry them into retirement like I would FEHB. 

I would lose the benefit of the pension, and their 401k match is variable based on the company’s performance the prior year. 

I’m currently on a career ladder where I would automatically move up a grade and receive a 13k raise next spring, while there is no guarantee of a similar raise at this new job. That being said, the salary range listed on the job posting for this position goes significantly higher than where I could get to as a federal employee.

Finally, this new DRP closes tonight, and if I accept it, I would receive essentially 6 months of double salary which would be a huge financial benefit. 

I feel morally torn to be leaving my current role when my team has been dealing with so much staffing loss and a hiring freeze. I have just started to really get my feet under me, make connections, and feel adequate at my job. The idea of starting over again is very daunting. And I am worried about the reaction to me taking the DRP and dropping more projects that were just reassigned to me. 

My gut is saying to take the new job, hopefully get some improved training and experiences, and maybe reapply and join this agency again when things calm down or administrations change. I would lose a few years in my pension, and potentially take a salary loss for a bit, but would be fully remote during that time vs an 1-1.5hr commute every day.

I feel like I’m going to make the wrong decision either way and I’m stuck in a loop of what-ifs. I’m hoping for some outside perspective. If you were in my shoes, what would you pick?

Thank you in advance if you read all of this, I appreciate any feedback.

1jukzoj,Career change to Engineering @ 34,"Hey! So this I'm not sure if this is common question but I wanted to get some input. I'm a 34 y/o who has been laid off from the animation industry for over half a year now. I'm honestly pretty skeptical about the future of a career as an artist or atleast not stoked about the instability I've been living through. I've done really well for myself until recently but I have a lot of burn out. I know engineers face a lot of burn out stereotypically. But for me I am someone brainstorming potential career pivots.

Engineering has alot of appeal to me, I've always wanted to help use my skills to build things that are more practical and can benefit people and maybe even change lives for the better. However of course to get into engineering requires a degree which is a large investment in itself. I'm curious how you all view the future job safety as engineers (in regards to AI and general demand going into the future), and perhaps could offer some guidance to someone who is a little lost right now.

Some additional details, traditionally never been good at math (I think this was more of a mindset thing than anything else, I believe I could learn now due to building a lot of confidence in learning other difficult subject matters) highly creative at solving problems visually and spatially, loves creating solutions to practical problems with 3d printing, wants job and financial security for the foreseeable future.

1jukas7,I'm scared,"Hi Reddit!  
I’m having a tough day and need some guidance. I have a background/bachelors in Early Childhood Education and have been working in childcare for 8+ years. I’m great at what I do, but I’m starting to feel burned out. Over time, schools, parents, and kids have changed, and it's wearing me down. I made a huge mistake choosing this field at the wrong time.

Most recently, I worked in nonprofit childcare, helping children with behavioral challenges and providing family support. I was passionate about it, but it took such a toll on me. I came home crying every day, covered in bruises from my students. One day, a child sent my teeth through my lip, and a teacher screamed in my face (a misunderstanding in a toxic workplace). When I asked for assistance, admin's response was to ""just be more positive."" I ended up walking out, with no job lined up, but I left on good terms (with my building, NOT with admin/higher ups) and with 3 strong references and offers for recommendation letters.

I know walking out was irresponsible and rash, but the environment had become unbearable. I’m aware that the job market is horrific right now, and I have one month before I run out of funds.

I haven’t stayed in a full-time role longer than six months post-grad. My first job after college ended (on great terms) due to health issues, and I later worked as a temporary nanny (on amazing terms, I still help them out on weekends). I know my resume might raise red flags, but I’m really looking for a long-term position where I can grow.

Right now, I’m desperate to transition into something new. I’d love any job where I can sit at a desk and finish my coffee while it's still warm. I’ve been applying to roles like Talent Acquisition, HR, Admissions, Administrative Assistant, etc. So far, I’ve applied to 60 jobs and had three interviews, but I keep getting ghosted. I feel like it's partially because I have no clear direction, I'm just desperate for anything. 

Does anyone have advice on making a smooth transition from an education role into an administrative or service-oriented field? Or should I just settle with education and wait for the economy to turn around (if that ever happens)? Any thoughts are welcome!

Full time in office, with hybrid to follow as I learn and become dependable. 

$125k base, 15% bonus

6% employer 401k match

Full benefits package

Offer 2 (IR Associate)

Fully remote

$110k base, unclear bonus structure, but much higher ceiling and room to grow/earn more with firm success, so they say. Bonus on the low end may be around 10%

4% employer 401k match

They would cover my health insurance & cable + internet via a stipend they would add to my offer. I would self-insure & they cover the cost. 

I love the fully remote structure & long term potential of the IR associate role. It does seem like it may be more of a grind. I would likely spend some nights up late working on presentations etc, but that is the trade off for working from home. 

I am a 33 year old single male, and although I enjoy the area that I live in, working full time remote would free me up to do anything & everything I want from a lifestyle perspective.

My only fixed expenses are my home ($2700 monthly) and utilities ($300 monthly) as well as groceries etc. I have no debt, and $50k in my HYSA. I also have $225k in brokerage/retirement accounts.

1juixqj,Getting a different Bachelors?,"I am 26 y/o female. I graduated with a Bachelors 5 months ago, and I already feel a deep regret. My degree is in Secondary Education, English Teaching with a Spanish minor. I love languages, but I also don't want to be poor and working 2 jobs my whole life. My plan was always to start  with teaching abroad. Teaching in the US doesn't seem so appealing. I graduated in Dec 2024, and was very fortunate to get a job at a middle school mid-year. However, I am realizing even more that I don't want to work in the public school system. The teachers are underpaid, overworked, and underappreciated by staff and students. I knew this before, but now that I'm on the inside it seems a lot worse.

I went to college right out of high school. I was and first person in my family to go to college, so I had zero guidance when I started. I just picked something that would be easy for me to complete. Because of my lack of guidance and distance from family when I started college, my mental health really suffered, and I struggled with work and school life balance. 

This is my issue. I feel regret that I chose an English teaching degree. I was really good at math and science in high school. I wish that I had applied myself more and tried harder to earn a more lucrative degree. I just dont feel fullfilled with the degree that I got and would love to have more knowledge in STEM. 

I am still planning on teaching abroad. When I do this, I will be able to save large chunks of money and pay off a large amount of students loans. After teaching abroad I don't know what I'll do. I have considered teaching for DOD, pursuing a career as a diplomat, or trying for law school. Right now, I am thinking of going back to school for an engineering degree (or something in that area) when I finish teaching abroad, as long as I have a chunk of loans paid off and money saved up. I know I hold myself back, but if I go to school again I know I would try harder and apply myself more, but I am worried if I am smart enough. 

If I go back to school, it will be in my 30s. I would appreciate any knowledge or advice you can give!

Hope someone can help me by giving me some inputs or a direction because I feel lost.  
I'm 26 with low working experience but a very geek-tech guy oriented. I studied marketing and psychology, so performances and team management are something I'm interested in.  
   
I have 2 offers atm, and they feel like a huge sliding door for me:  
  
1. Lead generation specialists IC1 at 31-35k gross yearly in the Netherlands around 2.3k net monthly, and it would be around 35-40% saving rate based on my expenses.  
  
2. Language Localization Coordinator which includes launching the app in a country also with marketing strategies other than coordinating and managing translators, with 2.5k gross per month, around 1.7-1.9k net monthly, around 40-47% saving rate for 4 months.  
The job is for 4 months (remote) and then if the launch is successful (highly likely as they say) keep going with another contract but with the same role basically, and moving to an in-house position in London or Madrid.  
  
\- Does job number 2 sound like a managerial role after 4 months?

1juin11,Mid 20s crisis? Am I lost or becoming honest to myself?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 25, currently doing my master’s in digital media, and living abroad as an international student. I’ve been in the marketing and design field for about 5-6 years now, starting with an internship and gradually working my way through different roles. I’ve gained experience, but recently, I’ve started to feel really lost and uncertain about my path.

Here’s the thing: over the years, I’ve been doing marketing and design because I’m *good* at it, not necessarily because I’m passionate about it. Now, with everything going on in the world and what I’m learning in my master’s program about human mind, consumerism, and well-being, I’ve been reflecting a lot on my values and what is really important for me. And honestly, I’ve realized that what I’ve been doing doesn’t align with my skills or interests. It just felt like something I was capable of, not something I was genuinely passionate about.

At this point, I feel like I’ve hit a reset button. All my experience and skills seem irrelevant because I’m just not interested in the work anymore. But I’m also anxious about not being able to find a job in the field I want to move into, especially since I’m living abroad and there are a lot of logistical challenges that come with that. So, I find myself drifting back to what I know, even though the thought of doing it again makes me feel sick.

I guess my question is, is this feeling of being “lost” normal in your mid-twenties? Is this just a quarter-life crisis, or am I just being honest with myself for the first time in a long time? I’m struggling with the idea that everything I’ve done up until now might not matter, but I also feel like I need to make a change.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you navigate it? I’m just trying to figure out if this is something I can work through or if I’m just totally off-track.

Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated...

My younger brother just finished his 10th from CBSE. He's a bright kid academically  sharp during exams, manages to pull through well, but not really interested in anything in particular. He’s planning to take PCMC (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Computers) for 11th and 12th.

I’m in the tech field myself, so I explained different career options like AI engineer, data scientist, etc. but he doesn’t show much genuine interest. He just says he wants a ""tech job"" in the end. Not passionate, but wants the perks.

When I asked him about his goals, he gave a typical teenager answer wants a BMW worth ₹2cr, and to ""do business"" but has zero clue what kind or how. Doesn’t want to prep for JEE or other competitive exams seriously, and college fees are another constraint, so I suggested self-learning and online resources, but he's too lazy and unmotivated for that.

What are some blooming industries or tech-related fields in India (or globally) that are beginner-friendly, potentially lucrative, and might get a curious teen interested enough to explore further? I’m just looking for something to spark his curiosity maybe something hands-on or entrepreneurial that’s not purely academic.

1juhlh3,Feeling... pigeonholed,"
Hey friends. I'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting here but I'm struggling in my current line of work and unsure where to go next. I currently work in child welfare, specifically that three letter agency you would hate to have knock on your door. I'm 8.5yrs in. It's been a great, steady, reliable job and I'm great at it. I have however over the last three years begun to have children and my outside support system has changed drastically as has my health. These things have all combined to essentially create a trifecta for me. Ive begun struggling to maintain a work-life balance and it's not helping my health issues at all. I struggle to give any extra at work because I often don't have the time or the energy nor do I have the support needed to work late last minute because of my lack of childcare options outside normal business hours. I have a bachelor's in criminal justice and I have 5+ years of corrections experience as well. I make around 50k a year which isn't awful but with the state of things these days, my paycheck doesn't go nearly as far as it used to.
I am struggling to find anything else that will fit my needs. I need to make more money, doesn't have to be a ton more but enough to offset the rising cost of existence. I also need a better work-life balance, that one is imperative. I am unable to really be there for my kids the way I need because of the demand my current job has on my life. 
I have considered going back to school for maybe IT security but that's not a quick solution and I've got to find something in the meantime as well. Alot of the jobs in this line of work require a masters degree and an LCSW which I do not have. Looking for any productive, professional suggestions or information. I'm sure I'm missing something that I could be looking into or qualifying for. Thanks in advance.

1jugqi9,I (21) lost out on promotion to older but worse performing colleague (40s?),"Hi, I have worked at my current company for 3 years and recently interviewed for an internal promotion along with several of my colleagues. There were 2 positions available - and me and another colleague were already filling in for absent managers working on other projects and have been for several months. To be honest I had expected that the interviews were a formality and me and the colleague would be given the roles. My colleague was given one of the roles and I was not. 

After the interviews I was told that I was not successful in the role, but that everything I am doing is great, exactly what they want to see and I do a great job etc, it’s just not the right time. To be completely honest I feel that they just don’t want somebody my age in a leadership role. When I asked for feedback it wasn’t anything specific to work on, just ‘it isn’t the right time for me’ but apparently they are very keen for me to develop. There was a lot of emphasis on how much I have accomplished, compared to other employees when they were my age. 

I then found that the position had gone to a colleague who I don’t work with everyday, but I don’t hear great feedback about. I know he received a worse performance evaluation than me and has made several significant mistakes in the past. I also think it’s relevant to say that this colleague has been here longer than me, but had a leadership role and was demoted so was the same level as me.

I am just unsure as to how to proceed - I genuinely do feel valued by the company but I am just frustrated that I have been acting in the role and don’t understand why I have been passed over. I do think they will promote me - just when I hit the magic number of ‘old’ enough, whenever they think this may be.

Would it be worth it to stick it out in the company where I do genuinely feel that the end goal is what I want, or is it worth it to try and build the same somewhere else? 

Feel free to tell me I am being unreasonable, I would just like some outside perspectives.

1jugae4,Should I go with development or cybersecurity as a complete newbie?,"I’m looking for some guidance on where to go in the tech world, and I thought I’d ask here for some advice. I’m confused about the best direction to take. I’m mainly interested in cybersecurity, but I also have an eye on app development (especially mobile apps). The problem is, I’m a complete beginner with little to no coding experience. So, is cybersecurity even realistic for someone just starting out? Or should I focus on something like development for now?

A few things I’m wondering:

1. Is web development still worth learning in 2025, or is the market oversaturated? I’m not sure if it’s still a good bet.
2. Cybersecurity is my main interest, but can someone like me (who’s a total noob) actually break into it? How do I get started, and do I need a lot of coding knowledge?
3. What can I do right now to make my CV stand out? Should I focus on certifications, hands-on projects, or just learning the basics? What’s the best approach as a complete beginner?

1jufya7,How do I tell myself things will work out?,"I am having a lot of anxiety at my work lately due to things beyond my control. I feel like I could be fired any moment, but I also just don't know anything.

  
I work in higher education and have for going on 10 years. I took a role 1.5 years ago and in that time I have had 5 different bosses and our institution has fired their president and multiple cabinet members. They also announced not being able to afford to search for and hire a new president at this time. 

One of the times I ""lost"" a boss was back in November. She quit and I was one of 2 people in the office and the other was brand new. I was promoted to interim-director. I was in this role until 2 weeks ago. They made me interview for the role and then hired someone external. During the interview process I directly asked my supervisor, ""What happens if I do not get the role?"" He replied that I'd be fine. I asked about office space as well, months before this too. We have 2 offices for now 4 people (we had hired a lower level person after screwing her over and revoking the offer then re-offering it later). I was told ""We have not thought about that yet.""

Last week I was then told I did not get the director role and then they set up a table in open space and took away my office. Just like that, I went from the most senior in our office to not having a space and just being tossed aside. 

  
Students were mad for me. They told me how they'd just quit and leave if it were them and that I am being treated like shit. I don't have a backup, the job market is awful. My current boss even left my desk and monitors for the new hire and didn't give me anything. I don't have a private space even for conversations with the students I work with. 

  
My supervisor is unapproachable and definitely plays favorites. He hasn't checked in on me a single time since kicking me out. I don't actually know my job duties at this point. I was told I did not get the role because ""Even though you were doing a great job, this person had experience we wanted.""

  
Am I just being anxious for no reason? I feel as if I am being driven out in what they think is the polite manner. If they just make me hate it here I will just quit and then they don't have to pay for unemployment. I just don't have any idea how to feel.

1juekjg,Feeling Unfulfilled,"Maybe this isn’t the right subreddit for this, but I wanted to make this post in the hopes that there might be something I’m just not thinking of. I’ll go into details on how I’m feeling and do my best to provide a TL;DR at the end. I apologize if I ramble. I just am feeling lost right now.

I work a job in the accounting field, and I have been doing so for around 14 years. (8 at the specific company I currently work for) I’ve recently been struggling as I really don’t see the point in what I do. I’ve determined that really all I do this current job for is a paycheck and the pay isn’t that great. I also feel stuck because my degree is in an unrelated field. (Related to the arts)

So I’m at a crossroads of sorts but I don’t know what my next steps would be for either option. I either pursue furthering my education (either through college or certification) in a field where I think the salary would be worth just going to work for a paycheck, or I maybe do what I currently do for a company that would make me feel like I’m helping society more. (I guess like a nonprofit?)

Maybe this is something someone can’t really help with, but how do I find what options are out there? I love the work that I’ve done with creating reports with crystal reporting or excel, but that’s about all I enjoy and it’s a very small part of my job. (An example of what I found for trying to go after a higher salary is becoming an Actuary. Which seems like that will take 2+ years of studying/practice. I have no examples for trying to find a job that helps society as I have no clue what those options would look like...)

TL;DR I feel unfulfilled working in accounting, especially at the salary I’m at. I would like to pivot into something else. Either something that sets me on a career path to make significantly more money or something that I feel helps those around me.",AimlesslyThrownAway,2,1.0,2,1744121628,2025-04-08 14:13:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1juekjg/feeling_unfulfilled/,4,2025

1jue7aq,Ambitious without Direction,"Hi,

I’m about to turn 25 next month. Life has been a crazy rollercoaster during the past 18-20 months. I graduated in 2023 and landed a role as an associate trainee at a good law firm, however as fate would have my seniors messed up a big deal and the department I was working on got dissolved.

The next week, I came back home to a dead mother, that should have been a big low point, but up until that point in my life I was pretty confident in my ability to weather any storm. The “alpha” male arche type, only now I know I should’ve cried like a little boy then.

It was hard to get a job in the market at that point and i made the stupid decision to take a drop year for CAT, that decision was made purely to delay the inevitable and buy some time to breathe.

I got addicted to gambling during that time, at one point I was up 30 lakhs, I was living like a king, gifting 15-20k shoes to friends, tipping 500 rupees on a 500 rupee haircut but then what happens in every movie happened, i lost it all, lost my mind too, the thoughts to end it all did occur to me.

I was crashing out, it felt like a bubble around my head that would just not burst, I told my father everything.

Surprisingly enough, the man who would beat the shit out of me if he passed him achar instead of butter, forgave me in an instant, he could see in me, how badly fucked I was.

I gave the CAT exam, and what had to happen happened, scored 85 percentile, which is as good as 50, nothing really holds value before 95.

I did well in the Symbiosis MBA entrance exam but fell short by 2 percentile.

I have been applying to jobs for the past 4 months but since I’m not such a great prospect, I don’t really hear back from good places.

I’m joining a firm, where there is potential to grow, but my starting salary would be 25-30k.

The point behind my sob story was, I’m seeking to hear from people older than me, you maybe started working or getting their life on track later on in their lives and maybe some advice.

I feel like i’ve experienced ego death, in some ways, i cant afford to have an ego right now, any advice or anecdotes of your own.

ultimately, freelance is the goal for me. i'm currently working towards that and it's an ambition that i'm not giving up on, but i also thought it's not a bad idea to develop a career, preferably creative-adjacent, alongside it and earn a bit more money in the meantime. i look on linkedin pretty much every day and see jobs that i know i can do, or am at least willing to learn, but haven't really got any formal experience or degree to show for it, like design, printing/pre-press, admin, comms, social media, writing or marketing (i have an illustration degree which is in tandem with design, but a lot of jobs are looking for someone proficient in adobe illustrator, which i have a basic grip of but nothing i could make a portfolio with currently...) and not many places are willing to spend money on training new recruits these days as it's too much of a risk. i don't think i can financially afford to go on an internship/apprenticeship/back into full time education either.

i'm trying to upskill by doing a domestika course for adobe illustrator, not to mention (desperately) googling courses for copywriting or communications, but either being put off by the scammy 'earn ££££ in a DAY' ones or by how much time/money it will take... i also feel like i'm aged out of many of the graduate roles being advertised and just a general sentiment of running out of time and being left behind, especially when i see friends earning £30k+, buying houses and having kids while i'm living with my boyfriends parents to save money... 

i dont regret my degree, but i'm frustrated that i feel woefully unequipped for jobs that i feel i could do, maybe even enjoy - but just lack the formal skills for, while i work on my true passion in the background. so in short, i am stuck, lost and fed up. i feel like i'm just floating through life with only my illustration to keep me tethered. has anyone been in a similar situation? is there any hope for me? or am i too old & am destined to live a life of printing cheap t-shirts for the rest of my life?

if you managed to get through this read then kudos to you, and thank you in advance for providing any guidance or suggestions :)

1jubl6d,Not sure what to do,"Let me be honest to myself and to this thread here. This is mostly a rant or seeking thoughts on my situation or I don't know.. that's pretty much an introduction about this post..

I'm from India. Like many, I graduated from a two tier engineering college, spending 14+ years and counting in the tech industry. 

1. Started my career with a services organisation in a dev role after graduation. 

2. Salary was too low - couldn't compete with the market that time. Hence switched my role from dev to QA engineer. Got another job in a smaller product organisation.

3. The product was acquired by one of the leading tech product MNC. After few years as a  SDET, again transitioned to a dev role and did decently well.

4. Promoted from a senior dev to engineering manager in the organisation and managed a team of 6 engineers.

5. During the post Covid boom, after spending close to 8 years in the previous organisation, i switched jobs to a start-up with a big pay hike as an engineering manager.

6. In the start up, the demands were too high. I was not able to contribute anything technically as I was not familiar with the tech stack. With my manager's help, I was doing ok. 

7. Since I wasn't able to contribute technically and repeated instances of mismanagement (e.g : not anticipating and prepared for the worst, poor project planning etc.,) - I had this constant fear of being laid off.

8. With that fear, started preparing for interviews and got another job in a tech MNC as Engineering manager and left the startup.

9. Now this tech MNC is a brand new domain for me and I have spent a little more than an year here - but I know shit about the product and the domain and I'm shit scared of losing the job once again just like how I felt in the start up.

If I look back and introspect my career,

1. I was always liked by my team and my immediate managers - they always said I bring this calm aura and a create a healthy, trust worthy environment.

2. But I was never liked / dis-liked by the boss's bosses - because I was always this quiet, reserv ed person who do not contribute anything on meetings, do not bring any new ideas, either agr ee with whatever being said or just keep quiet, just do whatever being told.. and that's true as well. I am that kind of person who never wanted accelerater career growth or limelight or anything of that sort..

3. In a self retrospective, I think when I first switched my job from the tech MNC to a start up, I was in this Dunning-Kruger effect - where I believed I had skills and because of that I was paid well. But to be very honest, I have survived my engineering manager roles because of the support of my immediate bosses. If I hadn't had that support, I'd have lost my job at anytime.

4. Now even in my current job, I'm going through the same. I don't understand a single thing that's happening around me, I'm just managing a team of 4 junior engineers. The scope is limited here and no matter how much I try, i just don't understand anything.

I have been an engineering manager for the last 4+ years and I don't think I'll be able to survive longer in the industry. Like many, family & EMIs are behind me and I'm very outdated in technical skills, don't have good management skills to go up the ladder, always in this constant fear of being fired. I'm tired and not sure what to do..",Lonely-Hunter-4883,1,1.0,0,1744112917,2025-04-08 11:48:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jubl6d/not_sure_what_to_do/,4,2025
1jubb73,Putting the career ‘to one side’ for a short time,"TL;DR: I have developed quickly in my career until this point, but now feel a little lost and in an awkward position between opportunities, and am unsure how to navigate it. 

Hi everyone!

I (25m UK) am in a really strange career position and was just looking for some open advice, I guess, or even just an acknowledgement that I’m not alone here and all will be okay…

So in essence, I graduated from a decent (UK) university 3 years ago, have been teaching English in a few locations abroad, and developing further within my general field, but I now have about 5 months before my next, pretty huge career step abroad. As it stands, that should still take place, but isn’t necessarily guaranteed based on a similar situation last year that didn’t quite work out.

I’ve been living at home and working in the area for some time to try and save money, and prepare sufficiently for the future endeavours, but it hasn’t quite managed to happen as easily as I’d like and it feels like things keep falling through; within the small town where we live, opportunities for work within my field and the lifestyle I’ve been living thus far in my adult life are virtually non-existent, and I need to try and diversify my skill set.

I’m very concerned though that this is not something I want (nor could even remotely cope with!) for any more than a short spell, and I’m particularly worried about the possibility that if this abroad endeavour falls through again, then I might get stuck into the same rut that I’ve been feeling here endlessly and just not advance *at all* in the career that I’m seeking, which is a huge worry (having developed so much and so quickly in the last 5 years).

So I feel a little lost, and was wondering if others have had to ‘put their career path to the side’ for a short time, knowing that something big is planned for the future, and have any advice for trying to navigate/cope with that sort of precariousness and possibility (mentally, socially, financially etc.) that things might not work out as planned!

Sorry for the length here, but any ideas at all are much appreciated! Thanks! ",Unfair-Ad-9479,3,1.0,0,1744111921,2025-04-08 11:32:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jubb73/putting_the_career_to_one_side_for_a_short_time/,4,2025

1juaql5,Which route to take?,"I currently make 64k in the field that i studied in undergrad. I have an opportunity to make 81k next year in the same field. unfortunately, the work is no longer fulfilling to me. 

At the same time, i’m graduating with my masters this may… the program i’m in is not a direct pipeline to a job, so essentially all i’m adding to my resume is that i have a masters.

my current field also has me in the worst mental state i’ve ever been in from a job. i never stop thinking about it. 

i will have 25k saved up after this contract. i also have my partners 50k income, but we are hoping to get
married and have a kid relatively soon, and the assumption is that she would become a stay at home parent.

I am wanting to get out of my current job, but don’t know where to go. i’m thinking about doing one year of exploring a couple different hourly jobs, maybe also getting a smaller certification or two as well. 

is it worth dropping to what might be 35k-40k for the foreseeable future? our household bills right now are about $2000 total. my partner is not pregnant yet and will be working the 50k job until giving birth (idk maybe two years away?)

1juaklk,how do you know?,"Hey everyone. I’m graduating in a month and I’ve been feeling so lost about what to do next. I always thought I’d end up in a corporate job — I imagined it’d be simple: dress up, say hi here and there, lock in, do the work, and go home. But I’ve recently realized the corporate world isn’t for me. The politics, the unspoken rules, the constant social navigation — it’s way more than I expected.

I recently discovered I’m on the spectrum, and that’s helped explain a lot of why I’ve always felt out of place in those environments. I kept thinking it would eventually just “click” and I’d find where I fit in, but that hasn’t happened.

I even started looking into nursing, mainly because of how secure it is. I’m so sick of constantly hearing about corporate layoffs and instability — it’s exhausting. But nursing has its own fears too… the pressure, the responsibility, the possibility of messing up and losing your license. That’s a lot to carry.

I just feel stuck. Every path I look into has so many downsides. How do people choose a career and know it’s right for them? Does it ever feel like you truly belong in a job, or is it always going to feel like struggling through?

If anyone has been in a similar spot or has advice, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts. Thanks so much for reading",Mountain-Economics22,1,1.0,0,1744109224,2025-04-08 10:47:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1juaklk/how_do_you_know/,4,2025
1juakaw,I was let go on the final day on my probation period - just an hour before the Christmas party,"I was working in a boutique PR company (my first PR job out of university), and had done two internships before. I was hired at a very junior role but worked across the most amount of accounts out of anyone in the team. My salary was actually minimum wage and I usually worked 8.40-7pm with no extra compensation. I was delighted to be in such a cool agency with entirely women and wanted to work hard. As soon as I started I noticed the vibe of the office was really off, we all sat around a long table and no one spoke to each other, the boss had never asked my a question in my entire time there / looked at me and it felt both stifling and terrifying (I was once told that it was my job to get coffee for a random client who I never worked with - I was happy to but the way it was communicated was: 'just want to let you know its your job to get people tea and coffee...'). I was making quite a few mistakes my first few weeks as I didn't have proper onboarding with usually getting 200 emails a day. My line manager went away for a few days in my first couple weeks and I was picking up all of her emails, at one point I accidentally sent a press update (a screenshot of a published news article) to the wrong client. I immediately apologised and said it wouldn't happen again. The director of the company said can we have a chat next week in person about making mistakes so we did - she said I need to stop making mistakes and I agreed and said I'd be more diligent, this was on me. Months go by and its high stress and very intense, I enjoyed it but I was constantly checking emails in the night, worried I was messing up and would regularly work 12 hour days. A few weeks before Christmas I ask to schedule in a call with my line managers about my progression and if im doing okay, they basically said yes but more attention to detail. I was relieved but knew there was more room for improvement. I realised Christmas was coming up and it was the end of my probation period, and no one had said anything. It was the day of the Christmas party and I emailed my boss to say we hadn't had a conversation. My boss said the CEO would call me with the director on zoom. They did, and just said 'we're sorry to say this but we won't be keeping you on. We need someone with more experience.' I was almost in tears and in shock, but said: 'I'm very disappointed this has been relayed to me so late, even when I had a call with my line managers about my progress just a few weeks ago.' They said it wouldn't change their opinion and that I wasn't writing reports - something that had never been communicated to me (I confirmed afterwards from my boss that wasn't something I was supposed to be doing or had been told). They never hired for my role and the director went on maternity leave, hiring only senior people. They have a constant rotation of 2 unpaid interns for 3 months who basically did my role (with guidance from me). 

Long story short I am applying for new jobs but honestly feel pretty traumatised by it. I have a reference from them thats positive but a bit wishy washy - they even got my title wrong.  I am so scared about working in a similar sector and also feel as though this experience will sabotage possible future careers. I've had a lot of interviews and got the final  round for 4 jobs. Any thoughts?

1ju9zdw,If you were to use a CV Converter what would be your biggest reason?,"Curios to hear from others: would you consider a CV converter that tailors your CV content to specific job descriptions (skills, keywords, tone, etc.) but leaves the design/styling up to you. Do you think that’s still useful?

Also curious: would you prefer a tool that helps apply to jobs automatically after converting your CV, or would you rather apply manually? I know some job boards block automation, so not sure how important that feature would be.

Would love your thoughts!

1ju960x,Applying for new jobs after resigning in lieu of no-cause termination,"I have been teaching on probationary contract for two years and have received only positive reviews, but was recently given notice of ""no cause non-reelection."" My team and entire department were surprised by it. Our union site president was also surprised by it and didn't know why they made that decision, but she told me there's really nothing to be done because it was ""no cause"" and encouraged me to resign in lieu of termination. She offered to join me at a meeting with the principal later to ask ""how I can grow"" and help me read between the lines if he wasn't forthright enough.

What it comes down to is that my evaluator this year misjudged a situation she didn't actually observe and was missing important background information for. It became apparent (but not actually admitted) in the meeting that my evaluator made the mistake and I'd made the right call, but the decision for non-reelection was already made and my resignation has already been accepted. No apology is coming my way. I'm still out of a job, although technically still eligible for rehire (however unlikely) at another school in the district.

So now I'm applying to new districts with glowing recommendation letters from my department chair and the district's lead teacher coach, and there's a required question asking if I've ever resigned in lieu of dismissal or non-reelection with space for me to share the context of it. I have literally never received a poor evaluation at any job before - and still haven't! - and I have no idea how this will affect my future career. What should I say? What can I expect going forward?

1ju87jm,Need Advice: I’m 21 with No Degree or Skill – Trying to Choose the Right Path Before It’s Too Late,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a bit about myself and get some honest advice. I’m currently 21 years old, originally from Pakistan, and now living in Saudi Arabia. I dropped out of college after 12th grade during the pandemic and never went back to finish my education. At the time, it didn’t seem like a big deal, but as I’ve grown older, I’ve started to deeply regret that decision.

I only have a 10th-grade high school degree and no real skills that can get me a decent job. I don’t think going back to school is an option right now, especially with my financial situation and the fact that I’m now in a different country.

Lately, I’ve been thinking seriously about changing my life. I’ve realized that if I continue the way I am—no degree, no skill—I’m going to end up stuck in low-wage jobs for the rest of my life. That thought honestly scares me.

I’ve been considering taking a course in either digital marketing or cloud/cybersecurity. I don’t have much experience in coding, but I’m pretty tech-savvy, and I feel like if I put in the effort, I can definitely learn cybersecurity. On the other hand, digital marketing also interests me—especially because I dream of starting my own business someday, and marketing would definitely help with that.

So I’m at a crossroads and I need help figuring things out:
	•	Which path should I choose—cybersecurity or digital marketing?
	•	How can I improve myself overall so I don’t end up feeling like a failure?
	•	Are there any affordable or free resources you’d recommend to get started?

I know I’m starting late, but I really want to turn things around. Any advice, guidance, or shared experiences would mean a lot to me.

1ju84wf,Career advice for a Woman in her early 30's,"Hey everyone! Hope all is going well :) 

Could definitely use some good advice! 

I'm about to enter my thirties and am noo where near where I thought I'd be in my career. I graduated university with a bachelor's of arts degree and thought I wanted to explore working with kids but it changed quite a bit over the years as I tried different jobs. 

My last job I was at I was let go of unexpectedly due to my role being made redundant. I'v sort of always lacked confidence in myself, but when I have a job I really do put my whole heart into that job and always try to improve and learn how to further develop my skills. So when I heard this news it sort of devestated me ( it was completely unexpected with no warnings) because I put so much effort into the job and I guess I felt like I wasn't good enough to even be considered for the  new role. It sucked to say the least and it most definitely shattered my confidence. 

After that happened, I sort of let myself fall into a pretty deep depression and haven't worked the past year which only made things alot worse for me. I've always worked or worked and been in school. So not working for so long has given me some pretty severe social anxiety ( something I've always struggled with, but worsened after the loss of my job). 

I've alreadly worked on updating my resume a long time ago and worked up creating my linked in profile ( yes I'm late too joining linked in, truly not a big fan of it as I'm a pretty private person). Unfortunately, my social anxiety and depression has been rather rehabilitating and I haven't had the courage too put myself out there again. I think this is because of a conjunction of different reasons, gaining weight, anxiety, fear of not being smart enough or good enough and just feeling like people think I'm stupid. I also have so much anxiety about reaching out to my reference from the job I was let go of, because I don't know how to answer what I've been up to this whole time since I was let go of :'(. 

I'm not quite sure how to get back out there again, I started to apply too some places but I'm not even sure what I want too explore career wise which also makes it harder knowing what to apply to. Not only career wise, I've also missed out on sooo much bc my social anxiety, whether it's travelling with close friends, birthdays, parties ect.

It sucks, because I never thought I'd ever let myself go like this and I feel so ashamed and embarrassed and truly just like a complete failure, and it's no one's fault but my own for allowing myself to end up here. I do need to get back up but have been struggling to put myself out there again. 

Anyways would love some advice on anyone that's experienced something similar and maybe just some tips on how to get back out there :)!

I live in Bangalore and I don't mind doing an internship in another city, as for the job, I wish I get it in Bangalore itself, but both companies is PAN. So I have no say for the job.

1. Cognizant 
I got the Cognizant internship in Chennai, it's for 3-6 months and has pretty good domains (SAP, Pega, Oracle, EPM, Azure etc), it's paid based on performance (12k per month). 
I interviewed for the programmer analyst trainee role.
And I lowkey do wanna move to another city and have an experience because I've only been at home my entire life.

2. HCL Tech 
I'll mostly get the HCL Tech internship in Bangalore, not sure of any of the details, will probably be intimated soon. It's unpaid and for 6-9 months. But I interviewed for an embedded testing role. 

The thing is, I'm more interested in Testing but I've a lot of people telling me to choose cognizant because of these two main reasons 
1. It's a development role
2. Cognizant being a better company for starters

I'm very confused given all of these parameters so I was hoping to get some advice. Please help me

PS, I got selected in Tech Mahindra a few months ago and still haven't received the offer letter and the package is almost 1 lakh lower than both of these. So I'm not exactly considering that here.",TargetParticular6980,1,1.0,0,1744095767,2025-04-08 07:02:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ju7jit/software_career_advice_testing_vs_development/,4,2025

I have a side hustle where I flip PCs and love messing around with hardware, but I’ve never been great at math—like, really not great. I know CS involves a lot more programming and theory, but all the posts that I read about IT say that CS will help me get into that field anyway rather then a degree in IT.

For those of you who’ve gone into either (or both), what made you choose your path? What do you like or dislike about your job? And if you could go back, would you make the same choice?

Appreciate any advice or perspective—thanks

1ju4izj,Applying for the same job again - should I bring up my previous application and interview (no offer) in my cover letter?,"Hi folks,

Last year, a corporate recruiter at a small biotech reached out to me regarding an open position that they had not yet posted on their company career site/LinkedIn. I went through the usual HR phone screen, interview with hiring manager, and another round of interview with team members.

I thought the position was a good fit for what I'm looking for, and vice versa (I'm currently in QA, and they are looking for someone to join their QA team, but different modality). I thought the interview went well and was feeling pretty hopeful, but unfortunately, I did not receive an offer. I moved on and have been actively looking and applying for jobs since.

Just today, they posted the same position and I'm thinking about applying. The job title is the same, with some very minor tweaks in the job description. I'm drafting my cover letter and I'm wondering if I should bring up my previous application and interview? If so, what's the best way to go about it?

Here are some of the things I may include in my cover letter: 

- Hightlighting my current skillset and how it matches with the job description 

- Hightlighting my willingness and motivation for relocation to where the job is. I did express this, but perhaps I could have been enthusiastic about it 

- Would be open to a second discussion and address any doubts

1ju4au9,Worth holding onto a part time job  while working a full time contract?,"
Hey all. 

So I recently got a full time contract job after being out of work for almost a year. While I’ve been looking, I have been working part time at old navy just to make some extra cash.

I told old navy today that I got offered a full time job and it would be my last week, but when I mentioned it to my dad he said that I should not quit since the contract is for three months initially and I can still work weekends. I’m not sure though if I should stay at old navy because I usually work four hours a shift at most 2 days a week. Hell even without this new job, I would have only worked next week one day. My dad does have a point though since the full contract is not a permanent hire job and I would still be looking for a permanent position while working the contract.

My essential question is should I still work at old navy even though I would only be able work on the weekends?",Eraserhead36,3,1.0,4,1744083232,2025-04-08 03:33:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ju4au9/worth_holding_onto_a_part_time_job_while_working/,4,2025
1ju47lr,ISO comforting vibes & tips for tariff stress,"Questions at the bottom of post

# Context of my current state:

Laid off last November (role was eliminated, not my fault or due to performance, etc). Right before the election, too. For context, I'm in the US.

It was my first job out of college and I was there for \~1.5 years. That said, it was a rotational program so I never \*fully\* got to settle in a role and make a drop-dead difference before moving onto the next rotation in a different function. I learned a ton in a short period of time, but never felt comfortable or like an expert anywhere.

Disappointing I'm in this situation, but I know I'll be okay. I'm confident in myself and what I know I can accomplish in the future. I know the rotational experiences will all come full-circle eventually in my career; it's just a matter of when.

I'm well-connected in my industry and have had lots of convos with VPs/Directors who thoroughly enjoy chatting with me, emotionally invested in where I end up, etc. Only problem is, I just need someone to give me a chance and let me be their Analyst.

There haven't been a ton of Analyst availabilities in my industry. But I have kept a mindset that's decently okay. Going into this chapter, I was mentally prepared to job search for at least 6 months based on seeing friends' long and grueling job search journeys. I know that all I can do is work my tail off so I am prepared for when that miracle moment strikes and the timing is right.

.

# Now, with the tariff chaos today:

I am also a political nerd (refuse to work in politics, it's like my sports). I knew the talking points and what may happen. I had opinions on it from a politics and strategy standpoint, but I was able to separate it from my job search mental armor. **But today hit different. I think I'm really scared.** Waking up to the news and hearing about the day's chaos was not fun.

Obviously no one knows what's going to happen in the future. This is the case at any time, and especially now.

**I think a part of what scares me the most is not having anything to relate the situation to.** During the Great Recession, I was in elementary school. I was at an age where I knew enough to be sensitive bringing up income-adjacent subjects like birthday presents to classmates, but not old enough to understand what sub-prime loans were and the wider economy.

.

# Internet, here's what I ask of you:

— How are you handling the uncertainty?

— Advice for someone who's starting out in their career in an economic downturn?

— Advice for your first time being laid off?

— How do you keep believing yourself during the job search?

— And finally, my dearest sweet Millennials, how did you get through 2008? (Please don't sugarcoat)

I guess on one hand if they dont have students they cant get paid, but its still really shitty because of all the work I've done, and I think I am well liked and doing well too.

1ju2w9a,Civil Engineering next step,"Hello everyone,

I have a career development query for you all:

I've studied a 3 year civil engineering degree at a pretty third rate poly tech in NZ. After chilling throughout highschool and the first half of Polytech, I clicked and really applied myself for the last part of the degree, even getting top of class for a paper.

Since then I’ve worked as a site engineer and made a decent amount of money, bought a few houses even and I’m pretty happy and settled in life. At 28, with a pregnant partner I’m also keen to step away from the 60+ hour work weeks on site into something more white collar and flexible.

 For years now it’s bugged me that I didn’t apply myself and study the full 4 year engineering honours degree at one of our more prestigious universities in NZ, and ever since I got top of class I’ve lost all respect for my alma mater – it’s a much less rigorous degree and it’s embarrassing to be associated with many of the other graduates as many are obviously second rate engineers.

In order to successfully pivot from site engineering I’ll likely need to study something more than a BEngTech, the BE hons I didn’t study initially would be my gold standard as it stands out across industries as a quality marker, however I can only cross credit for the first year and I don’t think it would be worth studying 3 years to get a second more prestigious bachelors degree.

My other options would be some sort of finance degree as investing has long been an interest of mine, or a MProffEng which is a longer masters designed to bridge the gap between an engineering technician level and a full engineer, however I don’t know if this will be seen as a patched up sham on my CV as its pretty much an admission that I wasn’t successful in highschool or Uni.

I’m aware this post could be taken as arrogant and elitist but I am grateful that I have more than enough to lead a happy life as is, I am just keen to apply myself and work towards a prestige career after very definitely not peaking in highschool or uni . Keen as to hear your study and career suggestions.

I’ve been feeling directionless with what to do with my career and have come here for your help!

I’m not sure what I want to do, but here are a few things I’d want from my next job (with a rough importance/10):

* Work from home, min. 1 day, ideally 3+ (9)
* No unpaid overtime - either 40hr/week or compensated in overtime pay / time in lieu / early leave on quiet times (8.5)
* Decent pay & chance for learning and growth (8)
* More than 4 weeks annual leave (7.5)
* SOME outdoors/onsite visits, some office / computer work (7)

She then started texting me from her personal phone asking where I'm going next. I told her I wasn't sharing that info yet and that she would see it when I was comfortable sharing with my network. 

She then said that they would only pay out my (significant) q1 bonus and my 2 weeks pay if I told her where I'm going to work next. Is this allowed? Should I tell her? Wouldn't it make more sense for HR to communicate this to me?

On Reddit, i see alot of gloom and doom I see people mentioning they've been out of work for over six months, often applying to hundreds of jobs without receiving a single callback. Yet unemployment is at 4.5% which isnt horrible. 

I've also heard that companies are getting 100s of resumes for positions in the U.S.A., but only about 10% of them are from U.S.-based candidates—the majority seem to be from India or indian decent.  

From my personal experience, when I was laid off, I was fortunate to receive two job offers within a month. However, all of those opportunities came through referrals from my network, except for one possible offer I might receive tomorrow, which I haven't counted yet.  

The reason I'm asking is that I currently have a pretty secure job. I feel its very secure. Pays 40 grand less than what i was making before.  Given the environment, I’m unsure whether it would be wise to leave for something potentially riskier, especially if I might have to job hunt again if its as bad as it seems. I have a bedridden wife, so I can't afford to take unnecessary risks if the job market is as tough as I've been hearing.  

During the job hunt process as i went out to companies job sites i couldnt help but notice the majority of tech jobs were being filled in india by the majority of the companies i looked at.    Alos noticed from the premium version of linked in that there were hundreds of applicants for every job posting.
Also.   I was still getting a few recruiters contacting me where they had job openings. I have the most success with onsite or hybrid rolls.  I never hear back from fully remote roles


I’d really appreciate it if you could share your observations and experiences. Thank you for taking the time to respond!

1ju1cqq,I feel lost,"I deeply apologize for the long post, however this is the first time I’ve publicized really anything about my life on the internet.
First and foremost, I’m a 22 year old turning 23 this year and I hate my job. 
Sure, many may say that I’m just beginning; however every day I wake up I feel like it’s the end.
I work as a termite technician for one of the biggest pest control companies in the World. 
I initially got into the industry for the work truck that I can take home due to the fact that my personal vehicle is broke beyond repair.
That in itself is pretty much the only positive I soon found out. The company I work for takes advantage of me every way possible. The majority of the work I do I far from termite work.
Most days I wake up and I’m in a crawlspace that’s so low the joists underneath the home hug your back while army crawling. Other days I’m in attics not only small in size and difficult to move around in but also unimaginably hot for hours upon hours with no help. The work even follows me home after hours and off days during the weekend. 
I’ve had to crawl through human feces and dead animal remains. I’ve been stabbed by rusty nails, exposed to dangerous chemicals and fungus. I’ve fallen through attic entry ways due to heat exhaustion. Today I worked all day in the pouring rain during a tornado watch, covered head to toe in mud. 
My supervisors could not care less when I try to work through these issues and even gas light me to protect themselves and the company. 
I’ve been in this industry for 2 1/2 years but with this specific company for 1 1/2 years.
As the days pass I grow more and more dead inside. I even have nightmares about this job. 
Through it all, I’ve always maintained a positive and professional attitude while at work. 
To top it off, I only make $16.80 an hour.
I barely make enough to pay the bills and definitely not enough to pay for another vehicle.
At this point… even if I had the vehicle I wouldn’t even know what direction to go. I want a job I’m happy with. A job where I’m not physically destroyed at the end of each day and covered in foul substances. 
I have an associates degree in general studies but that’s about the sum of it. 
With me not having a vehicle, could someone help guide me to a better path? Maybe a halfway decent work from home job or a company that provides transportation?

1ju0x3h,Most embarrassing moment of my career so far,"So for context, I recently screwed up at work. Marked emails for later when I wasn’t as busy and that time just never came. My boss followed up on one email which sent me into a panic flurry of actioning all of the ones I missed. Unfortunately some of the people on those emails mentioned it to my boss and she wanted to connect and address how it wasn’t just the one incident. Usually this would be fine, however this morning my cat decided to start vomiting repeatedly, some of it bloody, and I had to rush him to the vet. I ended up taking the call with my boss in the vet’s office, not realizing I was in a full blown anxiety attack at that time. I don’t remember everything I said on the call but some of the highlights were: “please don’t fire me” “I just never want to be a burden” and when she offered to have the call tomorrow “please no my anxiety will not let me last that long, if I’m getting fired I would prefer to do it now”… I’m ready to dig a hole and die in it. How am I going to face her?

1ju0ria,My boss either wants me to quit or go insane,"I’m the admin assistant at a charter school. I am the assistant to the principal. I’ve been there since November. It’s been insane and I’ve received no training. Just kinda learning as I go. 

I know all the teachers and staff do not like our principal and wish she would leave. 

My boss had told me about a month ago that I should apply to be a teacher since I am so good w the kids. I was excited about this and applied and everything. A few weeks ago, her and I had a meeting and she said that I did not seem happy here. I was super confused and didn’t say much because I am very obviously always happy to be there and love the students and the teachers. She also said that I should think over if I want to stay or not. She then went on to say that the teaching position I had applied for would go to a different person. 
Fast forward to last week. Our VP of our PTA had some concerns about things and my boss was upset over it.  (Very respectful email, but my boss knew it was her fault so I think she felt called out) our PTA Vp is also a consistent substitute for us. I was told that day after the email that I am not allowed to ask the pta vp to sub. We had a total of 9 people out the next day and my boss refused to let me ask her. We did not have a sub for 1 class so we had to rotate out that class to make sure it was covered. Everyone and I mean everyone was asking me why we didn’t call this particular person. I tried to be vague but everyone already knew what was going on. (Apparently it has happened before) 
I was asked last week by my boss if I told anyone that she told me not to ask this sub. I told her no, but people were assuming because of the timing. 
I was told I should have said that this sub was not available and lie. She then the next day told me that from now on daily I need to cover the nurses office lunch break, and the front desk lunch break, and to just figure out a time to take my lunch. 
I was told again today that I am not a good fit for this role, but she still would say I am capable of doing it and not doing anything wrong. 
She is becoming more and more condescending and unkind daily and making my days more difficult. 

The teachers all see this and don’t want me to leave because they love me and know I can do my job. I’m just heartbroken because I love the people I work with, but my boss is making it impossible to do anything right. I know if I talk with her 1:1 I will either be lied to or gaslit. 

I have no idea what to do. Is this something that would set off flags to HR? I just have no idea. I’ve seen how she treats people who have spoken out against her and I’m not interested in that adventure…. Lol.  

I know she wants me to quit. And because of her treatment I want to. But not sure if I should collect screenshots/recordings to give to HR. 

So lost. Lol

1ju0fzc,So... Not really sure what to do.,"I'm relatively new to Reddit. Decided to make this post on a sort ""whim"", if you will. Not sure if I'm using it correctly, but I hope I am!

I (21M) am half English half Russian and live in Moscow, so please excuse my errors while writing this down. When I was a kid, my dad constantly traveled around India. He's a working class, 63 year old guy from the north of England. This kind of impacted my education negatively, so I ended up finishing school with Bs (I also received mediocre results on my finals). This all happened four years ago, so it's not really a recent occurrence. The Russian school system's ""A level"" results last for 4 years, so I'd have to retake the exam if I am to go to a university at the start of next year.

Anyway after finishing up with school, I went to go study Chinese for about 2 years, and now I'm back in Moscow, kinda floating around, studying economics, musical literature and art, history, etc.

I'd also like to add that my poor performance and little to no results can also be attributed to my crippling lack of work ethic (at least, when it comes to studying and learning about multiple things at once in a short timespan), a computer usage obsession which I am aware of and don't really know how to deal with. As well as a general need to compulsively lie.

The point of this post is that I'm a bit lost. I'm still not exactly sure what I want to do in life (though, I have narrowed it down to something either social or biological), and I have no idea how to get back into the loop of getting a proper education. No idea how to tackle the whole bad habit situation either. Maybe there are some general tips that can be shared? My options are to go study abroad (though, I'm not sure how that will work out), take another gap year, retake my finals and risk being stuck at only having a high school diploma, or apply to a lackluster university in Russia. I really don't want my life to end up with me thinking I have a bunch of ""wasted opportunities and potential"". I also don't really want to come off as privileged, so sorry if I did give you all that impression.

P.S. After reading some other posts on this thread, I realise that my problems are quite small in comparison)

1ju08x5,Level 10 Crashout,"Hi all, I’ve been working as an assistant media planner for about a year now—this is my first job out of college, and while I was excited at first to dive into the industry, I’ve been feeling increasingly burnt out and unsure if this is the right path for me.

The job itself feels high-stress for the compensation, and I haven’t had any discussions about a potential promotion despite being here for a while. It’s been disheartening to see peers advancing or thriving in roles that don’t feel like the right fit for me personally. I’ve received a lot of constructive feedback, and while I’ve made efforts to improve—using to-do lists, templates, and following internal best practices—it often feels like it’s not enough.

Recently, I was unexpectedly put in charge of planning a campaign, something I had never done before, with little guidance beyond a brief explanation. It felt overwhelming to be told, “this is all on you” without proper training or support. On one hand, I know I should be capable of rising to the challenge, but on the other, I can’t help but feel like it’s unrealistic to expect someone to succeed without direction.

I’ve considered leaving the role entirely. I used to be really interested in social media and content creation, and I’ve thought about pivoting toward that side of marketing. But since it’s been a while, I’m not sure how to re-enter that space or where to even start. I’ve also proactively looked into social media content bootcamps to build a portfolio. 

The only reason I’ve stayed this long is because of the benefits, but I’m reaching a point where I’m questioning if that’s worth the mental toll. I’m scared to make a move, even if it feels like the right one for my well-being as I’m experiencing a level 10 crash out of anxiety. 

Has anyone else been through something similar? Would appreciate any advice or insight—especially from anyone who’s switched paths in marketing or media.

I lost all hope of this becoming better. Commute was long and expensive, everyday I arrive only to shadow my busy colleagues and beg for any task. I felt like a burden everyday, I felt invisible, lost, and tired of trying.

After a month and a half, I had enough and just sent a resignation email. I wanted to this face-to-face but I knew my boss was going to ask me why am I doing this and whether I have another opportunity and tbh I don’t want to have this discussion. Yeah I don’t have another option lined up but I just want to end this bs of an internship.

I turn 29 in a few days.

I always feel pretty down around my birthday, especially since leaving university at 22. I feel behind in life and without direction. 

Started a graduate scheme at Big4 at 24. Finished graduate scheme/ACA at 27. Started another graduate scheme at 28 in another industry (something I thought I might like) and now I'm not sure. More so because the pay will be less than finance and also I'm fairly junior for my age. The work life balance is great and the people are super nice.

Go back to finance?
Stick it out and go on the journey of finding something I enjoy? 

I feel incredibly lost and so far behind my peers. Feel like I might always struggle in life if I don't make a decision soon about what I want to do.

I have considered pursing an MPA, a masters of legal studies, human resources, or maybe even library sciences.

I really enjoy the team and people I work with, because management is very flat here, and I have a lot of freedom in doing things. Pay is 85k (and bonus) and rn I have about 18 days of PTO, but it grows as I keep working. I can work remotely but I do prefer to come into the office. I am already learning new things and taking the lead on big projects that involve AI, and I am bringing a new perspective to the team, which they really like.

I actually got an offer even though my resume doesn't meet the qualification at all (a lot of transferable skills though). I would be working as a Model Governance specialist (Associate), and I will be a bridge between IT and developers. I will be creating dashboards to monitor projects using Power BI, creating reports and PPTs for the higher ups. The pay is significantly better (110k and bonus), and benefits are similar (22 days PTO, 401k, etc.), I only need to be onsite for 2 days a week.

I am not sure what to do. I like my job rn, I don't feel the need to change anything. I also know I don't want to work on the tech side of things forever, so maybe the bank will give me a better chance of being in a manager position, since my company is small.

We have a young part time employee, about a month ago since we hired her asked me the night before if she could have a mental health day due to stress from work, she needed the day off to think about things and restart. We are a busy and high volume restaurant so I understood where she came from and her struggles.

The thing is, the next day, she showed up to work just to hangout and to do her school work. I was confused as she asked for a day off for her mental health and rest. I didn’t question this, and absolutely no one talked to her the whole day as we are furious about this action. I bothered someone on their day off to cover for her and her showing up for no reason made me think about firing her. Is this enough grounds or reason to fire her? Or am I in the wrong?

1jtw4nb,"In today’s time, what would you advise someone who wants to study Graphic Design?","Hey everyone,  

I’m at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some honest feedback. I’ve been seriously considering going to school for Graphic Design, but with how fast AI tools like Canva, Adobe Firefly, and MidJourney are advancing, I’m starting to wonder—**is it even worth the time and money anymore?**

On one hand, I’ve always been drawn to creative work and I genuinely enjoy visual storytelling. But on the other hand, I’m seeing more and more companies using AI tools to generate logos, posters, even full brand kits in minutes. It makes me question how secure or in-demand a traditional graphic design career will be in the next few years.

Also, going back to school (whether a full program or online bootcamp) isn’t cheap. Between tuition, time, and lost income, I’m trying to weigh whether the return on investment is actually there—or if I’d be better off learning AI tools and design basics on my own.

So my questions are:
- Is it still worth going to school for graphic design in 2025?
- Have any of you studied graphic design recently? Was it worth the cost/time?
- How are AI tools impacting your workflow or job prospects?

I’m not afraid of hard work, I just want to make sure I’m investing in something that actually has a future.

Appreciate any insights or real-world experiences!

I’m progressing really quickly, currently the interim lead on what is our largest pharmaceutical job.

I’m 100% underpaid and absolutely overworked. I’ve been applying elsewhere and chatting to recruiters, it seems my degree background is holding me back.
But do I even want to go further in this career?

It feels like I’m pigeon holing myself, going from a broad degree to a very specialised role only really relevant for the construction industry.

I’m in two minds whether to look at further education and just make this my thing, specialise and get the money associated, but I’m also thinking - get out before you go too deep.
Construction is volatile, it’s heavily reliant on FDI here in Ireland, Trumps tariffs are on a lot of peoples minds and it’s not even that well paying of an industry compared to others out there.

There’s a lot I like about the job and probably equally as much I dislike.

1jtvm39,Should I take the job offer at this preschool?,"
Hello everyone! I’m feeling quite torn on whether or not to take this assistant teaching position for a preschool. The director seems a bit rude to me but I don’t know whether or not I’m overthinking and reading too much into her behavior. Initially, she made me do an unpaid trial shift for 3 days for 4 hours each which I thought was a bit excessive especially for an assistant position. I also am based in NJ and getting paid $19 an hour. The minimum wage here is $15.49. I have a four year degree in business, 3 years of preschool experience and am bilingual. I don’t know if I’m getting lowballed ????
But I’m doing this because I hate business and my previous job. I also want to get a masters in the education field or social work which is why I choose to apply here. However, after getting offered the job, she told me to meet her on Monday over the phone. It was a short phone call and I genuinely don’t recall her saying a time at all. I only remember her saying to come in on Friday then switching it to Monday. But that may have completely been on me and I could’ve misunderstood. However, I really disliked the way she handled it. I came in by 9 am sharp when they opened and she was not happy to see me or greeted me. She said that she asked me to come by 1pm so I immediately apologized and offered to come back. I assured her it wasn’t a hassle for me, I’m free all day and live five minutes away. She said there was no use but kept going on about the fact that I came earlier and she wanted me to come when the kids slept. She then constantly said communication is important multiple times and that this shouldn’t happen again after I apologized multiple times. To me her attitude was so visible and was off putting /uncomfortable. Then throughout the process she said I’d start on April 28th which is two weeks away yet she doesn’t have a set schedule for me. She also then hit me with a curveball that I’ll be working with 3rd graders after 3pm and will be checking their homework/tutoring them? I have no experience in this and not quite comfortable in this field because I believe im not the best fit. I felt kind of annoyed because I feel like I should be paid more for that (it’s tutoring and checking their homework) On top of that, this is not what I signed up for. This was nowhere in the job description at all. Another thing that set me off is when I told her that I would need one day off on either may 19-20 for my friend’s college graduation. I’ve always heard it’s best to disclose pre planned vacations or plans in general during the interview process and usually I’ve had people ask me during the interview. However after this statement, she was visibly upset again. She said that this shouldn’t happen and then asked what my attendance was like in my previous job. She told me that teachers should only take off on true emergencies or when they’re sick and that  I have to adhere to that when I start. She then went on a rant saying that me not being present will cause the preschool to not have enough staff compared to kids. I just thought it was unfair because this is more than a month in advance notice for just one day off (unpaid) and was pre planned before I got hired. I just feel like there’s such a lack of respect for my time and even throughout the trial days she just told me to come in and leave, switch my days to work on last minute notice. Lastly, she told me to dress formally. I’ve worn nothing but blouses and jeans or pants. She said that in one of the trial days that I wore ripped jeans which confused me because I don’t own any ripped jeans and it’s winter (around 40 degrees right now.) I figured she was talking about the frayed hem on the bottom of my jeans since my jeans don’t have a singular hole on them. She said it was unprofessional attire and that I need to dress like a teacher. I thought this was also weird and kind of an overreaction on her part because I saw two teachers wearing joggers but the frayed hem jeans aren’t allowed.

1jtuokl,"Final year student with freelancing experience feeling stuck between job, business and MBA. what to do?","
Hey guys, I am very confused between a few things. I’m Btech AI Major in my final year and know a lot of things like marketing, programming, Web3, writing, reasoning, and business at surface level. I was freelancing during my college days and was making good enough money to live the best college life in a tier 2 city. But since I was doing freelancing and project work in multiple niches, I have level 1 or level 2 knowledge of many things, but I don’t have deep knowledge or experience in any single domain. I know that if I start focusing on something, I get good at it in 6-10 months, so I’ll start making good progress.  


I stopped working on freelance projects around 3-4 months ago and thought I’d focus on one thing, but as I start focusing on one, I get FOMO about the others. Like, when I think “let’s go deep into programming and get a job,” then I realize I could build an agency or a micro SaaS (which is risky), or I think about preparing for MBA or working on something else— which obviously takes time and I got stuck in the loop.   


I know how to get clients. I had good Fiverr and Upwork profiles (they’re dead now). I know how to get a job, but I don’t think I have enough skills. I used to build bots for Discord and Telegram, landing pages, run Meta ads, do market research, Ecom, and all these things. I know Python and JavaScript. I’ve built multiple Machine Learning projects (70–80% finished) but these things doesn't giving me confidence as i see the job market.



In 2 months, my college will end. I’m having the lowest day of my life— I’m not able to sleep properly, trying to escape, while my parents keep asking, “What are you doing?”



What the hell did I do to myself, even after such a good start in college?  


Advise me on what I should do!

I applied for computer science. I wanted computer engineering but unfortunately at the universities I applied to they didnt offer that.

From my understanding computer engineering is more hardware rather than software. software engineering is software obv and then computer science is like a mix of both.

Is entering computer science really a bad decision?

I'm bad at chemistry but i'm good with maths, physics, biology, IT and languages.

I hate studying languages. Physics is okay when its calculations and forces yet boring when its nuclear, astro etc (i really hope this makes sense).

I couldve gotten into med school however i dont have the guts I have a hugeee fear of blood and injuries overall very squeamish, anxious and paranoid. 

I dont know. I love IT and maths, im good at school always have been. Recently I've been really burnt out and I'm not really passionate about anything (other than arts however in my case that is not realistic for me to pursue whatsoever which has caused my skills to become a bit rusty and overall i'd prefer if arts stayed a hobby for me rather than a career) but the only thing pushing me forward is hate. I hate my current life. I'm grateful for everything I have however I want to get away from my family and take care of my health.

My current goal is to hopefully one day live on my own and be able to afford healthcare for both my physical and mental wellbeing since asking my parents to go a doctor is like asking them to kill someone. They throw a fit everytime anyways not our main point


What careers make good money (i dont want to be a millionaire i just want to live but i dont want to be making minimum wage and living from paycheck to paycheck). I feel like my life goal is survival rather than an actual goal?

I would prefer a job where i didnt have to talk to people however i can talk to people im fine with that its not smth major for me.

1jtrgiy,Title Demotion,"My husband was promoted by his employer on 3/1 from Senior Software Engineer to Lead Engineer. He received an official promotion letter from the company which illustrated his new title and salary.

Two weeks later, he noticed his title was changed back to Senior Software Engineer on his HR portal and it’s also reflected in MS office and Teams. When he reached out to his boss and HR, they gave a vague response and said they changed the titles of some department individuals in order to properly reflect the Tech Department. Salary is still the same with the new promotion but the title was changed back to his old one. 

I know many will say “at least they didn’t change your salary” but we can’t help but feel that this was such an unacceptable decision made. My husband worked incredibly hard for 2 years at this company and when he received his promotion he was thrilled and then for the employer to take it back? 
It’s the little things in life that keep people motivated at these soul sucking jobs and for him to be given a promotion title and for it to be taken back is kind of cruel in my opinion.

It was a great job with the best team I could ever ask for, and the pay was about the same as anywhere else at the EMT level in my area with great benefits. 
All around, I'd say I was a pretty damn good employee, worked hard and was competent at skills, knowledgeable, easy to work with, great bedside manner, trained a tech that quickly rose to be one of the better techs working there. I have good references from several people that worked there, even after what happened.    
One thing I've always really struggled with is time planning and getting to work on time. It's just me having poor time planning and always thinking that I can do things to get there faster than I think I'm going to, and then get in a bad habit of waking up at a certain time that doesn't give me enough time to get there on time. I know it's a problem and it's something I'm actively trying to work on, and was getting better about it at this job towards the end.    
To that end, a good portion of my shifts started a bit before the clinic opened and the other staff arrived, so I got into the habit of getting there 10-15 minutes after my shift start time and then ""forgetting"" to clock in, and later putting in the clock ins manually online as my arriving only 5-6 minutes after so as to be within the tardy grace period. This apparently counts as another 15 minutes of paid time.      
I didn't think anyone else would notice since no one else was usually there when I got there, and there was still plenty of time left to do opening duties and get the clinic ready for the day. I guess I kind of subconsciously knew that it might be adding paid time, but that was never the motivation for it, more just worried about being marked as late, and feeling like those minutes shouldn't matter if it didn't impact patient care or clinic flow. And I felt like with the terrible pay we got (less than many retail jobs) for the hard work we did in a high patient census clinic, even if the pay was credited I deserved it. I recognize now that that was wrong, I should have just been a fuckin adult and figured out how to time plan better to get to work on time. And even if it didn't matter and the pay was bad, that doesn't give me a license to lie about the time I arrived there.        
        
The other day my manager pulled me into her office and told me that they had investigated and discovered the time theft. She said she compared the times I badged into the building with the times I was putting in the portal, and noticed the discrepancy. I confessed and apologized right there, since it didn't seem worth it to fight it and I knew what I was doing was wrong. She told me had to run it up the chain to HR and wasnt sure what it would mean, and released me back to the floor to work for a couple hours. She then pulled me back into her office and let me know that I was going to be terminated, and explained the process to me. I went home that day without saying anyrhing to my coworkers, and that's probably the last time I'll ever see many of them again. They did not press charges or anything, which I'm very grateful as that would have been well within their rights, and I will get all final pay and PTO payout without any adjustments.         
        

So this is the situation I find myself in now. I know I fucked up really bad and I feel so dumb and shortsighted for having lost such a relatively great job over something so dumb (on my part) like that. I'm also really worried about what it means for future hireability at other places.    Where I'm at right now is that I am at the very start of a 3 year long BA in Information Security, and plan to get out of healthcare (at least full time) when I finish that and go into cyber security. Was already just feeling very disillusioned with healthcare before that.   
         
I don't have a car right now, and I have about 4 months worth of savings with no current late bills, so 6-8K. I don't think I would qualify for unemployment given the reason for my firing. Don't have much of a safety net past that.     
My goal right now is just to get a job that will allow me to survive long enough to finish enough of the certs within my degree program (you get many as you go along) to start working in cybersec or even like help desk stuff. There are kind of 4 ways I can go about this right now I think: 
1. Look for and hopefully get another healthcare/EMS job. Looking at Indeed it's kind of slim pickings for my current certification level (EMT), and not having a car makes a reasonable commute difficult. Given my firing I'm also currently blacklisted from that major healthcare organization that I worked for, which cuts off many opportunities. 
2. Get a non healthcare job like retail, food service, or labor, which would likely pay the same and maybe even better. Could try applying for help desk jobs right now but don't think I would qualify for any. 
3. Go back to the EMS service I worked for before my last job. I continued to be PRN with them after I left, but hadn't picked up a shift in a while so was set to inactive (but not fired or anything). Almost sure they would welcome me back, maybe even full time, if I messaged my manager there. Pay is slightly less than my last job but there is usually way more opportunities for OT. 
4. Use ~3K of that savings to get and register a car that would be eligible for Uber driving, and drive for Uber while I look for another job. This would also give me more options for commuting, so more opportunities would make sense to commute to.     
I'm a single mid 20s dude with no other real obligations aside from school, and no financial obligations other than a reasonable rent, modest bills, and food. I have no criminal record and no other real past black marks on employment.     
         
**What do you think is best? How should I approach what happened with my last job when it comes up in interviews? Should I lie about it or be honest? Would this effect my ability to get a Secret/Top Secret clearance in the future for cybersec jobs? How do I move forward from this?**      
      

 Feeling like I kind of just fucked my whole life up and in hardcore catastrophizing mode right now. Thanks in advance for any responses and for reading this novel. Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk.

1jtr3rc,No Work Hx,"Hi there! I am reaching out in the hope of getting some solid advice for a sibling. They are early 20's wth no work history (I believe also I diagnosed autism). Currently they have been working under the table less than part time. They had an interview and personality test for a job that allegedly (can't confirm as I don't live with them and don't work there) went well but ended up not being offered the job. They did complete trade school for HVAC during COVID but never pressured that.

I do not think there is much of anything to even have a resume for and am not sure how to help them get a job that has benefits, etc. what can they do to improve their odds, should they go back to trade school or try to find an apprenticeship somewhere? What can they look into that won't be an issue for someone who struggles to carry conversations and pick up social ques? 

This is kind of a weird situation and it's not totally their fault (my parents have made this situation difficult by not wanting them to work).

1jtr2ih,Got an offer from a new company but don’t know what to do,"Hey everyone.
A quick background, I work as a Data Analyst with around 4 years of experience at a major company (annual revenue in the billions with around 60k employees). Its a very stable job with decent pay but the career progression is quite slow (about 7-10 years to get promoted to a managerial role). The work environment is not the best but it’s not bad either.\
I just got a new offer from much smaller company (7 figure annual revenue) for a Manager of AI role. Its around a 25% increase in salary but its a less stable job as the company was struggling only a couple of years ago but recently it has been recovering .
Obviously an increase in salary and a manager title are very attractive to me. But I feel like it can be a bit risky & I’m not sure what to do next. I’m 28 & unmarried with no kids. What should I do?

1jtqunw,$75K Full-Time vs. $100K Contract at Verizon — Worth the Risk as an International Student?,"Hi everyone,  
I could really use some advice from this community!

Quick background: I’m an international student (on STEM OPT) currently working full-time as a Gainsight Admin at a mid-size EdTech company. It’s a remote role, based in Texas, paying about $75K/year. The good thing about my current job is that I have a lot of free time during work hours to study and upskill. Long-term, I don’t want to stay limited to just Gainsight or a single tool — my goal is to eventually transition into something like data engineering or a broader technical role.

Now, here’s the situation:  
I recently got a contract offer from Verizon in San Diego. The contract role pays around $100K, and the recruiter/contracting company confirmed they will file for my H-1B next year.

**Pros of the Verizon offer:**

* Better pay: \~$25K increase.
* Bigger company name for my resume.
* In-person role in California (networking, experience in an office setting).
* Exposure to more tools: Customer Success + Sales-related tools (not just Gainsight).
* I've heard from someone inside Verizon that contracts like these usually last at least 2 years.

**Cons / My concerns:**

* It’s a contract role, so I’m worried about long-term stability — especially as an international student relying on visa sponsorship.
* My current field (Customer Success tools/admin) feels a bit niche, and I worry about finding another job if the contract ends unexpectedly.
* Current job market isn’t the best, so taking risks feels a bit scarier.
* In my current job, I have the luxury of time to study and work towards my long-term goal of moving into Data Engineering or more technical roles.

I’m torn because Verizon feels like a good step up for my resume, pay, and exposure to multiple tools. But I’m worried about the contract nature of it, especially as an international student in this market.

What would you do in my situation? Is this risk worth it?  
Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful!

1jtoxbg,How long do I have left?,"I don't  think my contract will get extended and I rather they kick me out than me quitting this job. I think my ego is going to take a hit, becausw I think all this is unfair. I hate rejection but I need to grow a thicker skin and just take it.

How do I prepare myself for what is coming? 

Context:
7 months ago, I  started with a start up/fintech.  I was referred by one of the MDs. 
I work for a satellite office, supporting thr local team.
Since day 1, there's been red flags. Borderline racist comments, bullying and condescending remarks. There was a restructure 3 weeks ago and my reporting line changed to HQ. 
In the beginning I was a bit of a doormat because I didn't want to rock the boat, but leading to the restructure, and post restructure, I had enough and started standing up for myself. The satellite/local office MD was surprised. I finally had enough last week when one of his fav people started with the condescending remarks again. I set up a call with the local office MD (in hindsight maybe I should've raised this with my new manager) and I was open and honest with him. I said that I've never felt welcomed into the team and that the toxic behaviour had to stop. He wasn't shocked because he's known about all these incidents from day 1, but hasn't done much about it. I then said that if things didn't improve, that I might need to reconsider continuing to support the team or even staying in the company, he ended the conversation and said I should consider my job there. Obviously he didn't like to be put on the spot or spoken to that way (I was professional in every way) but truth be told, I just had enough of him and his side kick. 

I'm now concerned that he is out to get me. I have a catch up with the MD that referred me (he's in HQ) but I honestly don't think he will do much because he is also very political. I think he will be like HR. 

Anyway, I think my days are counted. How do I prepare myself for what is to come? ",Inevitable_Knee2720,0,0.5,6,1744041936,2025-04-07 16:05:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jtoxbg/how_long_do_i_have_left/,4,2025

I’m currently working at SBC with around 3 months of real project experience, after spending my first 5.5 months on the bench. I’m now part of a project that using popular tech stack. It is genuinely interesting, and I enjoy the work I’m doing(Learnt quite new things).

That said, my probation was recently extended due to “performance concerns,” which has been pretty demotivating. The truth is:

* I haven't been allocated to a project to test my skills and eligibilities
* I completed training with good scores and feedback, but PMs ghosted me when it came to allocation even after performing really good in internal/client interviews.
* I was pushed into unrelated trainings while waiting, juggling multiple things with no direction.
* It got to a point where I started losing confidence in my own skills.
* It felt like I was being poured into multiple things at once without any real chance to show my capabilities.

Meanwhile, I’ve seen others getting confirmed status after probation despite having weaker technical skills, often due to “jugaad.”(I don't want to get into it) I’m not trying to complain — it’s just tough 🥲🥲seeing your hard work not translating into results while others seem to progress more easily without much of the obstacles.

My goal is to move into a bigger product-based company like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. Its tough and I know that.

So, I’m looking for advice from folks who’ve made a similar transition or have some insights into this:

* How realistic is it to break into a top PBC with 9–12 months of experience?
* What should I focus on beyond DSA/LeetCode, system design?
* Are there any particular skills, books, or open-source contributions that can strengthen my profile?

***

My current role: I was promoted from a Senior Analyst position to a manager position. I excel at the role, but frankly, I'm not challenged and while I know that if I stay at this role and continue to perform, I will move up in the company, where I'm well liked by management and ownership and I know that I'll have the opportunity to be a C-Suite or at least SVP leader - it'll just take a while to get there. 

The industry is also stable: We are a food manufacturer making food that's largely considered a ""belly filler."" During the pandemic we did very well - we didn't change our prices, we scaled back on promotion, and we didn't have any layoffs. We sell a product that's wholesome, well-liked, and it's not considered ""bad"" for you. 

***

Potential role: Director Level Analytics and Insights position at another food manufacturer. A wholesome product in the health and wellness space. Slightly on the trendy side, but still a brand that's been out for at least 15 years on most shelves. 

The potential role pays 60% higher than what I make now, and I'm not underpaid in my role now. I'm comfortable, I'm debt-free aside from a mortgage. This role would be a step up in every sense of the word - responsibilities, pay, etc. 

It also combines a new set of challenges with work that I've been doing most of my career PRIOR to my current role, while taking advantage of stuff I've learned in my current role. There are a number of roles like this one out there too, so I'm not just hyper-focused on this one company - this one just kind of fits pretty well. It's stuff I'm VERY good at, stuff I like doing a lot, and stuff that I've performed more leadership activities and strategic planning work in the past already than what I'm doing now. 

Oh the new role is fully remote, and my current role is 20% remote, 80% in office.

***

My main concern is simple: Is it the right time to make this switch? Here's what's swirling in my head:

- The current economic situation is less than ideal for anyone. If we do end up sliding further down and overall, disposable income drops, and benefits get cut, I don't think anyone is going to be as comfortable with their jobs as this happens as they were in the last few years. 
- As I said, I'm kind of in a recession-resilient industry and category right now. Food you get at the grocery store. When times are bad, we do okay. When times are good, we do well too because we have a foodservice division that sells to a lot of restaurants (yes - this division did poorly during the pandemic). 
- If I were to change jobs, I feel that in the event of layoffs and cuts at the future company, the whole last-in-first-out thing, even though it's director-level would be something that could potentially affect me. 
- I already left my current company when another company tapped me, did a terrible job interviewing me, led me to believe I was doing one job and then threw a completely different job at me (basically they were told they needed someone with a data engineering skillset, interviewed me asking me about analytics, then when I talked to their ERP vendor about setting up data warehouses, I learned from the vendor, that my key responsibility was building a data warehouse). I left after 9 days and rejoined my current company. While I know that they like me and my work, I don't think I'd be able to easily return again should I jump ship...again. 
- Most of all, I don't want to be left jobless in the current economic situation. 

*** 

Now, questions you may have:

- Why not try to build this director role at your current company? 

 I would, but they're not ready for a dedicated role like this, and they have a Senior-manager level person doing this role currently. This person was a mentor of mine at another company, but I actually surpassed his skillset. He's only in the role because when I left, they realized that I was doing my new job AND my old job, and they were able to backfill that part of my role with him rather quickly. 

- What are you scared of?

 The economy, for one, and two, I'll admit - I'm a bit shaken, even 2 years after the fact, of being interviewed for one position and being hired for something completely different in an epic bait-and-switch. Call it pre-imposter syndrome, I am almost terrified that something like that'll happen again. I'm also scared that like many jobs, I can be hit with the ""oh thanks for quitting your previous job, this job is no longer remote"" and I'll have to move across the country to keep my new job. 

- You're aware that it's much more lucrative and your ability to move up in ""rank"" is much better jumping jobs than staying at your current job and waiting for a promotion, correct?

Totally aware. I appreciate that, and I know that no matter how well I'm respected at the current company, or how good they treat me, I'm expendable, and they may value me, but if they need to make a change, they can and will. With that said, it's stable, I'm doing well now, and I'm paid well...just not nearly as well as I'd be paid at the new company. With the potential economic woes we may face based on the tariffs, stock market, potential crash in the private equity sector and more - I'm happy to be at a company that's private, family-owned, moves a bit slower, and views everything through a long, strategic lens without hyper-focusing on every single quarters' results.

I’m a bit confused about what I should prioritize from here:
Should I focus more on development or DSA?

Also, if I focus only on DSA for now, will the experience and training I get during my job be enough to make a switch later on?

Would love to hear what worked for others in a similar situation.

Also, my college will be over in about 15 days, so I’m planning to enjoy whatever is left of my college life to the fullest before it ends.

1jtlozi,Would it be a bad idea to ask another coworker about what the admins are doing?,"Hi there,

I work at a university and informally have a data analyst/engineer role - I create dashboards for the cabinet of executives/VPs, I analyze surveys, etc. This past semester has been a bit weird. In January I took a short vacation, and when I came back my immediate boss told me to drop everything the other cabinet members were asking for and be 100% fixated on their personal project. Which I did do for a month...and no other member of cabinet seemed to care, just be annoyed that their projects were delayed. 

After that, I had a meeting last month that actually we're not going to continue to make major movements on the visualization software that I've been building stuff out of (Tableau), because it was just deemed wholesale that Tableau is just too complicated. My boss and I might to continue to have it for ourselves, but we're going to stick to excel spreadsheets and this other software for cabinet members. And then...there has been no direction on what to do with that, or what exactly I'm building in excel or slate.

Then two weeks ago, I was co-signed by my boss onto whatever another coworker wanted to do with slate. When asked for details on what that entails exactly...I got nothing out of my boss. They don't seem to have a plan or any actual project in mind.

Then last week, a third visualization software has entered the fold. This is the third time we flirted with getting this software only to not get it in the end, and my boss and one of the cabinet members had a weird fight during the sales pitch using the open forum for questions as the battleground for it.

I'm getting the impression that no one's at the wheel right now. It's been maybe a 1.5-2 months where I've not any direction other than that we might be changing direction, but have no plan for what that is. I'm contemplating asking another cabinet what exactly is going on up there, but I don't know if I should be getting involved or not or point from my perspective I've not had much to do because of the uncertainty. Would it a bad idea to ask other cabinet members what their perspective is?",Wiggulin,2,1.0,6,1744033791,2025-04-07 13:49:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jtlozi/would_it_be_a_bad_idea_to_ask_another_coworker/,4,2025

1jtkwzj,How will I move forward?,"Our office has been short staffed for a long time. I applied to this department as an Admin Assistant, expecting that I’ll do admin work for the rest of my work life. But since we lack manpower, my bosses asked me to also be a liaison officer temporarily, which earns 3x my salary. I accepted it since I am a new hire at the time, and since I thought it was temporary.

6 months later, I am still doing 2 jobs, but leaning more on the liaison work. I gave up the admin side of my job because the liaison work requires 3/4 of my time. Again, my salary is still aligned with my admin assistant job.

When my office still hasn’t hired any LO til now, I tried to apply. I mean, I’m already doing the job for 6 months and I also want a pay raise. But the HR and my boss wasn’t supportive, since I lack 3 months more of work experience (minimum is 3 yrs). As a boss, I think he should know that I deserve that part, regardless of the work exp. requirement. He has the power to tell the HR or even hold the position if he believed in me. Everyone in the office pushed me to apply, cause they also think that it is unfair for me to do 2 roles with that kind of salary. It’s really not easy.

Fast forward, with the use of my connections, I was endorsed by the Senate President. Lo and behold, my boss knew it and got angry at me. He said he was bypassed. He said indirectly that he would never consider me in that LO position. 

I’m considering resigning now, but I still haven’t looked on any vacant positions yet. I’m really struggling.

I don’t know what to feel. I feel angry, disrespected, power tripped, sad, and frustrated at the same time. ",Wonderful_Win_8611,1,0.6600000262260437,3,1744031545,2025-04-07 13:12:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jtkwzj/how_will_i_move_forward/,4,2025

1jtjkj4,Do not EVER ask for permission,"So I always kind of knew this, but I kind of learned it on an even deeper level recently. When you want to make some change and ask for permission first, the answer is always going to be no. You’re shooting yourself in the foot. For one thing, any new idea they haven’t heard of is upsetting to most people. They will say no as a reflex. Another thing is that their aim is to make you conform around everything that they want, making everything convenient for their needs at your expense. 

What you want is the opposite, you want to position yourself as the guy everyone else revolves around and conforms to. 

But the deeper aspect to this is that not only should you not ask for permission, you shouldn’t even announce to anyone your plans. All you’re doing is giving people ammunition to shoot down your plane before it even takes off.

1jtjehc,"Feeling lost, looking to change career paths - which master's degree would benefit me?","I'm planning to pursue a master's degree but have no clear direction on which path to take.

For context, I'm a 27 years old guy living in the Middle East region. I studied animation in university out of passion but quickly lost interest after graduation. I graduated with a bachelor's degree back in 2019 and haven't worked much since, partly due to limited job opportunities and partly because of my own lack of motivation. I found it unbearable and stressful to spend so much time staring at a screen, troubleshooting rather than creating. Over time, I felt like I had lost my creativity and was unable to produce anything, making the effort I put in feel pointless without tangible results.

I’ve had some work experience in animation, both freelance and with a UN subsidiary. It paid well, but I could not continue after the toll it had on my mental health. Since then, I’ve been working in online customer service. The pay isn’t great, but I enjoy the routine of a 9-5, the office environment and labor it requires of me, without the need to rely on creativity.

Currently, I’m self-learning graphic design, since it’s a field I can pursue with my background in animation. However, I’m under pressure from my family to pursue a master’s degree, and graphic design seems like the only somewhat related option. That said, I would actually prefer a different career path, one that doesn’t rely on creativity but instead focuses on practical, labor-oriented work. I am very dedicated, practical, enjoy working hard and having my work show for it.

What career paths would suit someone with my background and interests? What job options are available for someone like me feeling stuck and behind in life? And what kind of master’s degree could help me transition into that field? While my family’s been encouraging me to pursue further studies, I’m genuinely interested in doing a master’s for my own growth as well.

Not sure if this is the right venue but I'll be quick and hopefully I make sense.

After highschool (17), my dad asked his boss to get me a position of a junior mechanical engineering drafting job despite me having absolutely no knowledge about manufacturing and engineering. Fast forward I quickly got the grasp of the job and became capable employee. As the company grew, they've offered me a position of one of their mechanical design team leader (22). Then fast forward again to now (25) - I've gained so many knowledge and skills with senior engineer's mentorship, occassional site visits which can lead to me conversing with the client and perfoming 3D scanning, and even I got my diploma (no bachelors).

  
So I've climbed up the corporate ladder pretty quickly and wasn't my intention. The pay is actually a bit above on the median of a design draftsperson makes and I get along with my colleagues pretty well. The only downside of my job is it can be pretty busy and I have to work extra hours (which I dont get paid overtime due to being on a salary). - Andddddd yea 7 years and counting on the job.

1jtfbqd,Doing more with less actually ruin your career prospects? What should I do?,"During my career, I've built a reputation for achieving big things with small teams - usually just 1-2 hires. Launching new businesses, leading big projects, all while doing the BAU. And somehow, they all go great.

Lately with AI & new tools, it becomes even more efficient. I & my employees achieve a lot more with shorter amount of time. Both in revenue generating (like research with perplexity, automating following up with CRM) and internal productivity (like streamline meeting notes with otter, searching docs, emails with saner and automation with n8n). So I feel I'm doing a great job

But doing more with less seems great until you're job hunting or aiming a promotion. Suddenly recruiters and upper management start worrying because you've never managed a team larger than a handful of people ""Sorry, but we need someone who managed at least 20 people""

Sir, I did the same project with just two people and some tools

Ok, then, when I ask my current company for more headcount to manage increasing responsibility and bigger projects, they smile and say, ""Come on, you've got this! You're a techie after all. You can find a way.""

Great. My reward for efficiency is now hurting my career

So here’s the question

Should I start pretending to struggle a bit to convince leadership that, yes, I need more employees, so that I can get that ""leadership experience"" and get to a higher position? But this sounds so ridiculous…

Has anyone else have this bizarre situation, or am I playing corporate game wrong?",FreshFo,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1744009714,2025-04-07 07:08:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jtfbqd/doing_more_with_less_actually_ruin_your_career/,4,2025
1jtewmg,Would you take a high risk high reward opportunity?,"I’m currently at a job that I love. The team is fantastic, the product I own is one I strongly believe in, and we have a great work campus with tons to do. I’ve also made some incredible relationships at this workplace. My biggest concern is that I am considered under leveled to where I should be. I make $178k all in.

I interviewed at another company that I’ve heard really good things about. I only did it because a recruiter reached out. This one has 3 days in office vs 4 (both long commutes), but with a campus that has much to be desired. The biggest question mark is the team. They are replacing the two people in my role and the hiring manager. I enjoyed the people I spoke to during my interview but they are not my direct team members. This one also is tracked to a promotion 2 year in assuming I perform well during that first year. The all in is $207k.

I really am lost as to how I should approach this. I am hugely valuable to my existing team and but I know they have a hard stance against countering offers. I, however, am scared of jumping into the great unknown. The VP of the new team seems like a great guy and he was candid about the team members leaving due to return to office and another not seeing eye to eye with the manager. 

Is there anything else I should be considering? The second opportunity seems to have much more upside but also has some risks. My existing opportunity is safe, but will take a longer time to continue to progress.

1jtb4qn,What kind of career would be right for me?,"I just graduated with an associates in community and human services, and now I’m going to get my bachelor’s in it. I haven’t decided what to get my masters in because it would be more focused and I need to figure out which direction to go in but I can’t decide on a career path. So here’s a little bit about me, I’m hoping I discover job ideas I didn’t even know existed or never considered for myself but I get inspired! 

1- I like working with women and children 

2- I don’t want to be working in addictions/corrections/cps officer and I don’t want to be a one on one counselor where I see clients and have to counsel them. I’ve worked as a part time teacher many years and it’s so draining I want a job that will not mentally and emotionally exhaust me 

3- I would prefer working in a school, library, home or clinic setting. I’d consider a hospital as well. Preferably again with part time options or flexible hours one of the two. 

4- I’ve considered working as speech therapist or occupational therapist, it’s still an idea in my mind. I have an interest in special ed too but I’m pretty nervous about it being too demanding. There’s also a women’s DV shelter that has been hiring that I’ve considered too. 

5- also, I’m not looking for a job that makes alot of money- my priorities are being flexible, enjoying what I do, not draining myself out and just helping people and it being rewarding.

1jta222,Horrible boss,"Where do I start . Ive worked at my job for over three and half years as a 1099 employee.  At first my boss treated me great we got along all was good. And always told me how great of a worker I am , and I was next to get a w2 job. After about a year my boss hired two of his friends who do next to nothing . And of course they get all w2 jobs . The three sit in the office majority of the time and just talk , but of course when groups and big company guys come down everything done and they all put up a fake front and act different. I kept working trying to stay positive and then its like my boss turned on me . Constantly yelling at me if I didnt know something or asked about something . .
  As time passed I actually became friends with my boss two friends and they started telling me how bad he talks about me , making fun of me , and never planned on giving me a w2 job.  Still I kept working and staying positive and one day I ran into THEE BOSS , my boss's boss . in just us two talking I asked about being a w2 in which he replied yes certainly go tell manager I said so . So next morning I did just that and my boss got so mad I talked to his boss  . He did give me a w2 but then gave me only three days a week instead of 5 .  With no benefits etc. but told me to do this for a month and well talk about more.

 After 3 weeks I show up to work one morning and my boss calls me into his office then says I'm fired,  in my confusion I ask why,  he replied you've been leaving work early . I rewinded the cameras back and you left almost every day either a couple minutes, to twenty minutes  early. And then said strike 3, you went to (my) his boss  and that was a low blow then said strike 2, I came in late a couple minutes one morning over two years ago!!! (Yes he said that)!! Then proceeded to say strike 1, I sprained my ankle one day at work and asked if someone could do a job for me that required climbing that i was in pain! 

Now to fill you all in more , I work on a private corporate owned estate for the government officials like a second camp david . Its only 8 employees total . For 2000 acres ... Anyhow  on me leaving early , I leave well after half the  other staff leaves every day . It has never nor have I ever been told it was a problem. And no one else gets talked too. its always been casual on the Estate and as long as the daily duties are done its never been an issue to leave 30 minutes or less. . One of my boss friends comes in an hour or more late everyday and not one word said about it.  Im just so frustrated and nothing I can do cause in my State is a ""fire at will "", State. So they dont need a reason. . So then next day my boss calls me and want me to drive down and talk then tells me im rehired and he just (went off the knee)  whatever that means. And said it was a trust issue and he will give me another chance..of course I took job back cause my bills dont stop and I need to work.. this is the only time in my life being fired , and the many many times being flipped out on or treated this way by my boss. I seriously wish there was something I can do but because my stupid state and my boss brown nosing and have the hire ups wrapped around his fingers I feel helpless.

I'm considering switching to an engineering role at a massive company, but God, I cannot for the life of me decide.

The reason I applied is that there's pretty limited mobility at my current company, and the work is getting repetitive, and it doesn't feel like my career is going anywhere or like I'm learning new skills. Although our company is growing pretty rapidly, the opportunities largely don't trickle down to me.

But at the same time... I can't imagine working at a company where I'm not excited about the product and the team. Being just a number sounds like my worst nightmare. The thought of working on such a tiny part of a huge system sounds soul-crushing.

1jt8w2p,Career Change after 30,"Just wanted to share my experience and process lately of going through the thought process and decision of making a career change at 31.
Since graduation I've been pursuing a singular career choice/focus based on my love for basketball (I chose to enter coaching). After 9,10 years of pursuing this path, I've reached a point of ""burnout"". The long hours + low pay + lifestyle associated with coaching + lack of clear growth trajectory, paired with most importantly the coaching landscape (dealing with crazy parents for example) had made me realized that coaching basketball as a career choice is very different from the joy I had initially for the sport of basketball.
After a couple months of internal conversation/struggle, I made the decision to explore a career pivot and pursue something else that fits my expectations regarding lifestyle, compensation fulfillment and work life balance. As I started applying to other jobs in education, just the last 1-2 months I've been getting interviews and opportunities a lot more often and easier than my last 10 years in coaching. It started to seem like my next career chapter is coming right around the corner and it honestly gave me a new motivation and energy that I haven't had in a long time.

1jt86v9,Burned Out in a Career I Love – Unsure if I Should Leave or Pivot,"
Hi all, I’m hoping to get some career-focused insight because I’m feeling overwhelmed and unsure of my next step.

I’m a 27F who has been in building material sales since I was 18. My role includes sales, design, and project management—things like cabinets, vanities, paint, flooring, etc. I genuinely enjoy the work and helping clients bring their projects to life. Two years ago, I moved to a new company, and up until six months ago, I was doing really well.

Lately, though, I’ve been experiencing extreme burnout. My sales numbers have dropped significantly—I even received a written warning in January—and my income has dropped from nearly $10K/month last summer to around $2,500 now. Despite that, I’m still working 6–7 days a week, often from 7 AM to 9 PM.

On top of that, my husband was laid off early last year, and we accumulated some debt before he found a new job. I’m now working a second part-time job a few days a week just to try and get us back on track financially.

Recently, two friends offered me positions waitressing or bartending. I’ve never done either, but my parents think I could make more than I do now and enjoy more flexibility. My husband is worried I’ll regret leaving a career I’ve loved, and he’s encouraging me to stick it out longer.

I also tend to be very loyal to my employers—this company is family-owned—which makes the decision even harder. But I’m starting to question whether I can keep doing this level of work for such little financial reward, especially when burnout is affecting my mental and physical health.

My main questions:
	•	Has anyone transitioned out of a career they loved due to burnout? Did you regret it or find new success?
	•	Should I leave a high-stress but specialized role for something more flexible and (hopefully) financially stable in the short term?
	•	Any advice on how to evaluate the long-term impact of a career pivot like this?

I’d truly appreciate any perspective from those who’ve been through similar transitions or who have guidance on navigating career crossroads like this.

Thank you in advance!

1jt316l,On a sinking ship and don’t know what to do,"Cross posting from r/careerguidance

This is more of a vent, but I’d appreciate any words of advice. I was promoted at the same time that a new team formed in my department. I was put on that new team which lacked structure and leadership. The manager of that new team was disorganized, unresponsive, and took no accountability. The team had several feedback sessions with HR and the team finally dissolved after almost a year. The manager is still a part of the department and has a new role while my team members and I got moved to different teams in the department. 

I felt like my time spent on that team was almost a waste because I didn’t receive proper training for my current position, and I still find myself lost and overwhelmed especially now that I’m on another newly-formed team. My current manager is great, but I’m starting to question whether I even want to do this work and if it’s worth it. My current manager also has no context on the work that I have to wrap up from my previous team. Even though my previous manager can help with these projects, she’s rolled off all but one. I’m left to take the other projects forward with a different manager who took over some of my old team’s projects. It’s honestly such a mess because I feel like I’m reporting to three people who are of little help.

I’m getting good pay and feel like I shouldn’t complain given the job market, but I’m worried that I’m pigeonholing myself because the work is really niche. I also don’t feel confident in my progress and knowledge to eventually move up. In some ways, I feel like this is ruining my resume but maybe I’m being shortsighted. I found out last week that two of my more senior colleagues are leaving for other internal opportunities. I’m even more concerned now because they’re the two main people who provided me with guidance and context on certain projects that will largely be missing since no one else in the department really knows this stuff. The department is already shorthanded and the other half of the department is not willing to take on more projects, so I’m afraid I won’t be able to learn from them since they prefer to do the bare minimum, which I get, but it’s only making this situation worse.

There’s definitely favoritism, boys club, and other dynamics at play here that make me not want to be a part of this department even more. I think the department is also starting to get a bad reputation from all this chaos. I just feel so stuck and unmotivated that idk if I’m in the right mindset to interview for a new job. I actually interviewed for other jobs during the tumultuous time with my last time and obviously didn’t get those roles. I feel so burnt out honestly. One of the colleagues leaving was told that there’s no chance of a promotion or raise anytime soon. The other one told me to give my current manager a chance to at least teach me. Maybe I should stick it out until next year?

1jt263s,Should I entertain a Business Analyst job opportunity even though I just started a new role?,"Hi everyone! I’d really appreciate some advice as I’m in a bit of a career crossroads.

I recently graduated with my bachelor’s degree and just started a new job about two months ago at ADP as a *Technical Support Analyst*. It’s a full-time role paying $25/hr with PTO, 6% 401k match, and the option to buy into their healthcare plan (which I pay for out of pocket). The job is stable, hybrid, and close to home — I took it because I needed something fast to cover rent and bills after graduating.

That said, I’ve been in tech support roles for about 5–6 years, and I’m starting to feel boxed in. At ADP, I’d likely max out around $60K–$70K if I climbed the ladder within this path.

Here’s where it gets interesting: a recruiter reached out to me (resume is on Dice) about a *contract Business Analyst role* for a large bank. It’s a one-year contract with the possibility of renewal or conversion to full-time. Pay starts at $34/hr but with **no benefits**. It's also **100% onsite**, and the commute would be around 40–45 minutes one way.

On one hand, this could be my exit out of tech support and into a more analytical and strategic role. From what I’ve seen, Business Analysts — especially in fintech — can make six figures as they grow in the field. On the other hand, leaving a stable job just two months in feels risky, and I’d lose benefits and the comfort of hybrid work.

Do you think it’s worth interviewing for this contract Business Analyst opportunity to get out of the tech support path? Would the commute + lack of benefits be worth the career pivot?

Would love to hear from others who made similar moves or who have experience in either path. Thanks in advance!",OpeningVolume2484,3,0.8100000023841858,4,1743967426,2025-04-06 19:23:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jt263s/should_i_entertain_a_business_analyst_job/,4,2025
1jt23qg,Feeling discouraged in my career choice.,"Hey everyone. I recently got my certification as paramedic after a grueling time in school. During school I ran into numerous problems and ended up finishing a long time after my fellow classmates (this involved problems with an admin at the school that targeted me). This was the first obstacle that has made me rethink my career.

Since before I started school there was an agency that I dreamed of working for. It checked all the boxes and would have furthered my career and put me in great spot for as long I wanted to work. Since then my girlfriend, as well as a friend, have worked for that agency. Their experiences there have not been the best and both are looking to leave this agency. This has devastated me because it is where my dream has been. They have both told me they believe that I would still do great the agency due to my personality being able to fit better, but I still feel deterred. 

Besides this agency there is not much else in my area that could possibly help me achieve the goals I want. There is on other agency that has potential, but I would need multiple years experience to get in.

Because of all of this, I’m at a crossroads of what all I should do. Before getting into EMS I had the plan of going to med/DO school. I fell off because I wasn’t ready for that much schooling at the time. Now that I’m older and in a better spot, I am looking into it again. Even before starting down the medical path, weather was always a major interest of mine since I was a kid. My problem there is recent job cuts and it not being exactly what I would want out of the field. I have a very specific interest in tornadoes and extreme weather. My only other interest is in becoming a pilot. I’ve always loved flying and it seems like a great career.

Overall I’m just unsure of what is the right path at this point. I constantly change my mind on what I want to do and can’t seem to pin down a true course. My parent and family have too much of a bias in one way or another and I’m looking for any third party advice. What are your thoughts?

So I started a tech course at a local college and I’ve been thinking on how to describe the people on that course but the best word I can come up with is ‘weird’ like rlly fuckin weird (if ur offended pls read the post) 

I’m not the most interested in tech but I met someone who convinced me to ho into it. Most of my mates have gone into trades (plumber, electrician, etc) or into the army. In the only one going down this route and I feel very much like a black sheep. I like the gym, getting pissed, and cars. 

Here are my problems/ annoyances: nearly every fucker in the course absolutely stinks. Like bad. We’ve had multiple talks about personal hygiene and that kinda thing but most still fucking stink. 

Some of the only things that people talk about is anime and speed runs of old Mario games. Which is fine I’m sure not everyone who likes these things are weird but I’ve seen more anime children as home screens then Ive seen anime people in my whole life. 

I told them I know abit of Japanese to try and make some sort of conversation because my gf is half Korean, half Japanese and I’ve been learning to impress her family. I should not have told them that. They got 10x weirder. One of the slimy fuckers found her Instagram, u can imagine how that went down. 

There’s only about 3 people I talk to on the whole course and that’s just about the course. No social interaction outside of that. I’m really quite worried that if I go into this industry it’s going to be more of the same and I will be overlooked for promotions etc because I don’t fit in.

I have no idea what to do! I’ve been interviewing lately because my current job sucks. I interviewed with a start up company and they offered me equity only until funding is secured by crowdfunding and venture capitalists. 

They’re protecting to have the funding in around 6 months. However I’d go unpaid until then. They offered half the pay if we got half the funding as well which means I could potentially see a check as soon as 3 months. 

I think the concept is super neat and I do believe it could be successful but as of right now they have zero funding it’s been self funded entirely. They’re currently in the process of getting the beta tests done for their app to finally show VC’s. 

My partner would support me if I took the job however finances would be very tight. With the current state of the US economy and looming tariff dread I’m worried any kind of business that deals with selling physical products would tank. I have until the end of today to accept the offer! Please help me decide. 

More useful info:
- entirely self-funded 
- owner has been working on it for 4 years 
- concept is a services app like angie’s list or door dash but for a specific industry (I can’t say which industry) 
- owner claims to have 2 venture capitalist meetings in the near future and just attended I think 4 before my interview 
- owner claims not to be worried about the tariffs affecting the prices of products sold 
- there is some competition with other businesses but no one specifically has the same business model 
- my current role is terrible I’m working over time every week under fair market value 

Please help! I can’t decide if I should put my family through the financial hardship for the potential of an incredible salary.

1jszeod,"My competitor is now my new boss, and sitting in on my interview. How do I sell myself?","I will try to make this brief. Restarting my career in a new city and am currently interviewing at a growing company starting their first team and office here. They are hiring for \~5 roles, 1 team lead and 4 member positons. I have 10+ years management experience several levels above even the junior leadership role they're offering, but was willing to 'get in on the ground floor' at this growing company even as a less senior position.

They took applications for all roles at the same time, so I was essentially applying for both roles, though I made it clear in my communications to the hiring manager (division head) that I was most interested and more than qualified for the lead role.

Come my first interview, the round 1 interviewer (HR) recaps their aim in hiring this new team, building the brand here, etc., and drops that ""we've now hired our team lead for this market"". I don't flinch or react, since I'm still interested in seeing how this whole process plays out. The interviewer does ask me further in the interview if I'm okay with joining the team as a member instead of a team lead, based on my experience, and I'm honest that based on my experience I felt I was more qualified for the team lead role, but I'm still interested in a growing company, recognize this may be temporary, etc. I pass to the second round.

I snoop this team lead on LinkedIn and find her. Honestly our experience is pretty equivalent. In some ways I've had more senior experience than her; she has more international work experience.

Now, I get my invite to round 2, with the division head (as expected) ***and now this 5-minute old team lead***. It makes sense, since she will be leading this team that's being hired...

But if I'm honest, my plan was to get 1-on-1 time with the division head and be straight with him, that I'm willing to join in the lower role but need a clear growth plan/pay bump/hiring bonus or something along those lines to make it worth it to me, after blowing him away with my CV, communication skills, etc. I know I could show him how overqualified I am but also demonstrate hunger and humility that hiring me into this junior position is still a good idea.

**How do I do that now with this person that usurped me to the lead position in the call, that I'm objectively more qualified than? Isn't this just going to make her immediately think I'm a threat, and make her want to torpedo me with him? How do I go about pitching for more money now with her on there? Maybe she got less than the advertised max for the lead role?**

I feel like this screws up my whole dynamic. Any advice on how to proceed here. Unfortunately I've dealt with managers who were formerly competition, toxic leaders and generally jealous people and office politics enough to have a gut feeling that this isn't a good thing for my 'invest in me' pitch.",Junathyst,0,0.4000000059604645,8,1743960375,2025-04-06 17:26:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jszeod/my_competitor_is_now_my_new_boss_and_sitting_in/,4,2025

I left retail back in November to start my corporate job in the field I’m trained in and have a masters in. I’ve been miserable every single day, having panic attacks and crying every day. I feel like I’ve lost who I was. I only took the job as I’ve just bought a house and borrowed money from my family for the deposit so I wanted to pay them back as quick as possible. 

I got offered a part time retail job again and also a temporary other retail job for 5 weeks. My plan is to once the temporary one finishes so find another second part time job to keep my hours up. I also make comics on the side so that sometimes brings in money. It wil never be as much as my corporate job but I know I’ll be happier in what I do.

The manager mentioned she might train me on something called **""Opex"" or ""Opec""?** I’m honestly not sure what that is — if anyone can explain what that means, that would be super helpful.

Here are my official responsibilities:

* Open, prepare, and sort incoming mail for digital imaging
* Analyze documents to assign them to the right department
* Track specific mail types
* Operate high-speed scanners and troubleshoot issues
* Monitor workflow queues and flag/document imaging issues
* Keep up with service level agreements
* Do quality control checks
* Be a point of contact between Office Services and Business Units
* Occasionally lift and move up to 20 lbs of mail/documents

The recruiting agency that placed me seems to have ghosted me now that I’ve started. I’ve tried reaching out to ask about what happens after the contract ends, but haven’t heard anything back. That said, I’m still super grateful they helped me land this opportunity. I’m trying to do my best and learn as much as I can.

**My questions:**

1. Has anyone worked in a similar Document Clerk role? What should I expect in terms of growth or future responsibilities?
2. Does anyone know what **Opex/Opec** is in this context?
3. After the 3-month contract is up, what kind of other roles could I apply to, especially if I want to continue in an office setting?

Any advice or guidance is really appreciated. I’m just trying to get my foot in the door and build something stable for myself.

1jsu6oy,What Job Titles Should I Look For?,"Hi everyone, I recently quit my remote job at a large company where I was working as a Jr. SAP Systems Engineer. There are many reasons I quit. I hated working remote. For context, I am 21 years old and graduated college around this time last year with a MIS degree. I am pretty qualified in SAP knowledge for my age and wanted my career path to go more the technical route than the business route. My job had a major organizational change, and they were going to shift me into a Product Owner role. I was going to give it a chance, but it has been very unclear where I was fitting in with the company. My bosses were not giving me any work besides sitting in testing meetings all day long, and after doing research, I’ve solidified that I *hate* the business side of my career and cannot stand meetings.

The job was making me severely depressed, anxious about what I was supposed to be doing, and unfulfilled. I realized I need an in-person or hybrid job—at my age, I’ve been isolated and made no real connections with anyone and need the structure of going into an office.

Basically, my question is: what job titles should I be searching for? And I'm curious if anyone reading this has seen themselves in a similar situation as me. It was getting so bad for my mental health that I decided to quit last week with no notice. I have enough saved that I can be fine staying unemployed for a few months if needed. I really don’t want to rush into another job like I did last year (they gave me a week to make my decision to work there a week before I graduated).",Artistic_Image_9146,1,1.0,2,1743946296,2025-04-06 13:31:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jsu6oy/what_job_titles_should_i_look_for/,4,2025

1jst6m7,"I dont ""fit in"" in any job.","Hi! 
Im 27 yo, I've been working in different jobs for the last 5 years. I have been a recepcionist, I worked in museums, I worked giving information to people at Park Güell etc. And I didn't enjoy any of these jobs, they were like "" it's okay"" at first but later I felt misareble.

The only work I enjoyed more or less, is giving information to Tourists, is more flexible and not that repetitive, I like talking to Tourists (depends of who tho) and I know quite a lot information about my city.

The problem is, I hate repetitive work, I hate administrative work, the monotonous jobs that you have to be careful of the details I feel that I wasn't made dor that. I think that, If I do these kind of jobs for too long, I will never be happy.

And the problem is that, nowadays almost all jobs look for people who can do a repetitive work and not complain, but creativity is not valued.

 I need to work because I have to sustain mysealf.
Music has always been my passion I always wanted to work in music field 
  (giving classes, singing, working inside a discography) but for that, I need more studies and to study I need money (or a bank credit)

I have done some music studies before, I know a bit of singing so I could do classes but is such an uncertain job and I don't know what to do.

I see other people and they are doing good with a normal job, but (I'm not exagerating) I think I can't do any type of job unless is creative or non-monotonous. Its so weird. 

Any advice? I will appreciate it.

Thank you💗

1jsszzo,MEDICAL CAREER EXISTENTIAL CRISIS,"I'm a 4th-year medical student from Pakistan who's always been drawn to the idea of moving to the US or UK for a better lifestyle and more freedom. However, I'm also grounded in reality. My dad owns a hospital here, and as a family, we're upper middle class, meaning I've always had my material needs met. Still, I feel limited by societal restrictions and a lifestyle that's not as open as what I see abroad.

This would likely give me a luxurious life, but I'm concerned about the lifestyle limitations. The other option is to move to the US and settle there, working a 9-to-5 job.

Is it still worth going deep into C, Rust, and OS in 2025 and beyond?

	•	She’s currently in her final year of MBBS in Pakistan, graduating in December 2025.
	•	She’ll complete her house job by December 2026.
	•	We’re considering getting married in January 2026.
	•	Her long-term goal is to become a plastic surgeon, ideally trained at a reputable institute.
	•	She’s open to giving the UKMLE while still in Pakistan.

Now here’s the situation:

I know that Saudi and Dubai don’t really offer strong education pathways for specialisation. I’m also not fully aware of the current landscape for international doctors in the UK, but I’ve heard it’s not great.

So my question is:
What’s the shortest and most realistic pathway for her to specialise (like MRCS or something else)? Ideally, we want to minimise the time we spend in a long-distance relationship.

We’re open to realistic options and suggestions – we just don’t want to waste time and energy in the wrong direction. Any help would be appreciated!

One job, which is essentially doing what my career choice is, has gone exceptionally well for me. I mean a $5 increase per hour within 6 months of starting it and the kind of place I’d be willing to work at for the foreseeable future. It is my main income, however my other job, I started about a year ago at $13 an hour. It’s nothing glorious, but helps pays the bills. I always show up 15 minutes early, usually stay 15 minutes past my scheduled shift. On occasion I have stayed 2 hours past my scheduled shift (which I was paid for) but they regularly expect closers to stay multiple hours after. I never minded much as I still got paid for my time. I’ve always felt good in the work I’ve done, and numerous times the management has commented on my work being done well. In the last 4 months they have cut my hours down from 10/week to 15/month. Hours have been cut back by upper management so I asked about our annual raises as the cost of living seems to just continue increasing in a college town and it’s hard when the hours have been cut so drastically. Today they finally asked me in to do my review for a raise. They asked me how I felt I did, and the whole time I was telling them how I felt, they immediately shot me down and told me I was barely meeting expectations. It was a bit frustrating because I have never been told by them that I needed to do better, and I have never thought I was doing a poor job. I complete all the tasks they ask me to do and up until today I thought I was going a bit above their expectations. Clearly they feel differently and I was given a 39 cent raise (3%). I have given up (almost) every weekend of my life for the last year for paychecks that hardly seem worth it anymore. To me, it felt insulting that they gave me such a low raise (in reflection of the cost of living here) and that all this time they have let me think I’ve done a good job and been a good employee, at least if I had known a few months ago where they thought I lacked, I could have been working on it and gotten a better raise. Now I have to wait another year to revisit the topic, or if I should start looking for another job.

I’m 20, about to finish my BBA from a Tier 3 college. Life’s been moving fast lately and honestly, I’m at a point where I feel super confused about where I’m headed.

I come from a small village, lower-middle-class background. My dad is a farmer, and we’re doing okay for now, but I know deep down that in a few years (maybe even sooner), I’ll need to take full responsibility for my family — my sister’s education ( mbbs ), any emergencies, and just making sure they live a better life than we have so far.

Right now, I’m working as a fleet dispatcher at a small startup in a tier 2 city. It pays ₹20K a month with a bit more through incentives. Been doing it for a year. But the work is super repetitive, and I’m not learning much. It’s not something I see myself doing long-term.

Before this, I managed a canteen contract in a cement company, and when I was 16, I even co-founded a PUBG eSports company that blew up pretty big online — all passion, no money, but it was fun and taught me a lot.

The thing is… I feel like I haven’t really achieved anything yet. I’m not from a top college, my CGPA is just average (6.5–7). I don’t have any connections or big-shot mentors. Just me trying to figure it out on my own.

Lately, I’ve been looking into Business Analytics. People on YouTube make it seem like you can just learn Excel, SQL, Power BI and get a 5–7 LPA job — even more if you stick with it. But I don’t know how much of that is hype vs actual reality. Can someone like me — no tech background, no fancy degree — really make it into that field? Or am I just setting myself up for disappointment?

I’m not scared of hard work. I’ve been hustling since I was 16. I just want to make sure I put my energy in the right place before these early 20s fly by. This feels like my golden period, and I don’t want to waste it going in circles.

So if you’ve ever been in a place where you had to juggle family pressure, career choices, and trying to break out of a simple background — I’d love to hear from you. What helped you? What would you do if you were me?

1jskwca,Unbearable Supervisor,"I should probably start by saying that my field has been hit hard by the current administration's policies and the job outlook is bleak at the moment. Though I'm strongly considering finding another job, there isn't much out there. 

My supervisor is an absolute nightmare to deal with. I've worked with her for a few years and have spent the time having to manage her, tiptoe around her feelings, fix her constant mistakes, and be her punching bag. She wasn't qualified for the position, but was hired out of desperation to fill the role. As a result, she's struggled to do her job and is extremely insecure and lashes out at others. I bear the brunt of it because I work under her. When she first started, she was super aggressive and basically told me that I had to do what she said because she was in charge now. I had to explain that we were a team and should be working together and she looked at me like I was an alien speaking another language - apparently this was a new concept for her. I've powered through the bullshit because I like what I do, get along well with the rest of my team, and have great benefits. 

Despite my frustration with her, I've tried very hard to be pleasant, get along with her, produce good work, be helpful, do all the right things that a good employee should do. There are stretches where we'll get along fine and things will be going well, but it's always short lived. 

Out of nowhere she'll go on the warpath. Her ""feedback"" will consist of personal attacks, she'll claim that my work isn't done (even though it is), and will tell me that other people on the team are upset with me for whatever reason (which I'm not sure is actually true). She's incredibly paranoid and will constantly claim that people at work are excluding her or trying to make her look bad - no one is doing that. We're all too busy doing our jobs. If anything, we're all picking up the slack when she makes mistakes or needs help. 
 
She's on a rampage again and I've had enough. I can't put up with any more of this treatment. I wish wish wish so badly that I could tell her to fuck off and go get a new job, but it doesn't look like that's a realistic option at the moment. I've been job hunting all weekend, have applied to a few that might not even be hiring anymore, plan to reach out to my network, but I worry I'm stuck for the time being (until I'm laid off I guess). 

Does anyone have any advice for navigating this situation? Leadership has been made aware of the situation previously but I worry that continuing to complain is painting me as a troublemaker. I feel like my only options at this point are stay and be miserable or quit and be homeless.

You’re trying to look impressive, the other person is silently judging your every word, and deep down, both of you would rather be anywhere else.

The only difference is that in a behavioral interview, you don’t even get a margarita.

If you’ve ever launched into a story during an interview only to realize halfway through that

* You’re rambling,
* You’ve forgotten the point, and
* You’re sweating through your shirt like a rotisserie chicken

*Congratulations. You’re doing it wrong.*

But don’t worry. You’re not alone. Most people approach behavioral interviews like they’re auditioning for a very boring soap opera. You know, *The Young and the Chronically Unprepared.* Let’s fix that.

# What Is a Behavioral Interview, and Why Is It Ruining Your Life?

Behavioral interviews are designed to assess how you’ve handled situations in the past to predict how you’ll handle situations in the future. They are sneaky little psychological scavenger hunts where the interviewer asks you open-ended questions like:

* “Tell me about a time you dealt with conflict on a team.”
* “Describe a situation where you had to meet a tight deadline.”
* “Give an example of a goal you set and how you achieved it.”

In other words: Tell me a bedtime story, but make it corporate.

Unfortunately, most people answer these questions like they’re confessing to a priest. They either overshare, underdeliver, or panic and invent a tale that sounds suspiciously like a Netflix plot summary.

# Mistake #1: Telling a Story With No Point

Here’s how bad behavioral answers usually go:

>

Did you feel that? That’s your interviewer emotionally checking out.

# Fix It: Use the STAR Method, You Glorious Disaster

The STAR method isn’t new, but let’s pretend it is so you’ll pay attention.

* **Situation:** Set the stage. Be brief. This isn’t your memoir.
* **Task:** What were *you* supposed to do?
* **Action:** What did *you* actually do? (Not what your team did. YOU. Don’t try to hide.)
* **Result:** Did it work? Was the company saved? Did you stop crying in the bathroom?

Here’s a version that doesn’t make your interviewer wish for spontaneous WiFi failure:

>

See? It’s like adult storytelling — with verbs!

# Mistake #2: Flexing Too Hard and Failing

Sometimes candidates try so hard to impress that they just… black out and start listing every buzzword they know:

>

What are you even saying? Did you just throw a LinkedIn post into a blender?

# Fix It: Talk Like a Person

If your answer sounds like an AI wrote it after eating a thesaurus, you’re doing it wrong. Behavioral interviews are about emotional intelligence, not keyword bingo.

Try this instead:

>

No jargon. No emotional whiplash. Just clear, understandable language from a functional adult.

# Mistake #3: Ignoring the Job Description Like It’s a Spam Email

Here’s a magical secret: **The behavioral questions are not random.** Interviewers are trying to check off specific competencies: teamwork, leadership, adaptability, time management, etc. You just didn’t read the job description because you were too busy color-coding your Notion page.

# Fix It: Mirror the Job Post Like a Copycat With a Dream

Read the job description. Then pick 3–5 behavioral stories that show off exactly what they’re asking for. If they want “strong communication skills,” don’t tell a story about how you sat silently in a cubicle and got a trophy for attendance.

Pro tip: You can use the *same* story for different competencies if you tailor the emphasis. We call that recycling, baby.

# Mistake #4: Sounding Like a Corporate Robot With No Soul

You’re not just a resume with legs. Interviewers want to hire people they wouldn’t dread being trapped in a Zoom call with.

If all your answers sound like you rehearsed them in front of a mirror while whispering “synergy” to yourself, you’re not winning hearts.

# Fix It: Show a Pulse

Add a touch of personality. Not your whole stand-up routine, just enough to remind them you’re a functioning human:

>

Humor is risky, but *controlled self-awareness* is gold.

# Bonus Round: Questions You’re Probably Going to Be Asked

Let me save you from Googling “top behavioral interview questions” like a panicked gremlin. Here are some hits:

1. Tell me about a time you made a mistake.
2. Describe a time you had to persuade someone.
3. Tell me about a goal you didn’t meet.
4. How do you prioritize when everything is a priority?
5. Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.

Yes, they’re trying to trick you. No, you can’t answer all of them with “one time I worked really hard and succeeded.” Get creative. Stay honest. Don’t lie — unless you’re actually good at it and it’s extremely harmless.

# Wrapping It Up Like a Sad Office Burrito

Behavioral interviews aren’t going anywhere. They’re the HR world’s way of saying, “Prove to me that hiring you won’t be a regret I cry about in a quarterly review.”

So don’t wing it. Have stories ready. Practice with a friend. Or, you know, a machine that judges you quietly and pretends not to.",ApprehensiveCar4900,8,0.6800000071525574,4,1743909211,2025-04-06 03:13:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jskrnn/why_your_behavioral_interview_answers_sound_like/,4,2025

1jskg7d,"Looking for suggestions, feeling undervalued and requiring visa sponsorship.","Hey all, I am in sort of dilemma and wanted to know what suggestions experienced people have for me
I am currently working for this company as Sofware Engineer for over 3 years now. Total YoE 4+ years. Salary wise, I had started very low and had been a consistent high performer, that led to $30k+ raise in these last 3 years. I found out the salary range for new posting for the position that is at same level I have been all along. After a ~10% raise this year, I am still a bit below higher end of that range. I have found about salary of other engineers and I am on par now with they have been paid. I had raised this with my manager about me feeling undervalued and underpaid despite all amazing reviews and being constantly praised by everyone including top performer recognitions. 

The issue with underpay couples with visa sponsorship. I am on OPT after my masters now and have 2 more years of H1B attempts left. I have had no luck so far in my past 4 attempts(2 after Bachelors OPT, one during masters, 1 now) with this company. I was told there would be green card sponsorship couple years ago but later they decided not to based on market situation and ongoing layoffs at that time. Since then I had asked if and when it would resume but been said that would be unlikely anytime soon now.

I had expressed all these to my manager and after this years review(which I had another great one) I am not sure much would happen. I feel like I am underpaid still by 7-10k, and there is no hope for green card sponsorship and will have to wait on my luck for next 2 H1B attempts.

I feel like looking for other jobs, but the current sentiment and market towards international is horrible.
From one perspectice, I feel like they know it and have been exploiting it. From other, starting out at very low salary including the market/company downturn getting more than 10% raise in a year seems impossible. 

As for work, I love the work me and the team has been doing. I am on a team with very smart and experienced engineers and having a blast working with them.

But lately, the feeling of being underpaid and possiblly being exploited has eaten me. To add to that, I have 2 more H1B attempts and I am mostly out of time.

Should I eat this up and keep doing what I have been doing or actively pursue other job, where even if I dont get H1B I would have a chance to get paid what I feel fair and maximize my income while I am here?",Sushan31,1,1.0,0,1743908115,2025-04-06 02:55:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jskg7d/looking_for_suggestions_feeling_undervalued_and/,4,2025

At the age of 10, I developed a growing passion for programming, and I recently started learning about machine learning. This is very convenient for me because I have trouble walking, so all I have to do is sit in one place and do my work. My second option is 3D design and architecture. I have loved building things since the age of 4 when I played with Lego Duplo. Since then, my enthusiasm has grown significantly. Now, I'm trying out 3D modeling using software like AutoCAD and Tinkercad. As with my first option, this is favorable due to my mobility challenges. Lastly, I am considering 3D printing and building physical objects from 3D files. This is a bit more challenging for me because I need to connect all the wires and troubleshoot problems. Again, I have to make it easier for myself due to my inability to walk. This is something relatively new that I've begun exploring, so much so that I don't even have a 3D printer yet!

1jsgxrw,My boss accused me of things I never did,"Hey, I've been having some issues with my boss recently, and I could use some advice.

This is my first real job in my field, and until recently I was very happy with everything, with the exception of low pay, though my main goal was to gain an extra year of experience. For most of this time I've had a very good professional relationship with my boss and held her in high regard, but these pasts weeks she's accused me of things I've never had any intention of doing, and I'm very worried about it.

It first started with accusations of trying to trick her to hide that I forgot to do some tasks, when it was all a communication problem, and I didn't give it much thought. The second time was more serious, since I knew it could happen a third time at this rate. Recently she's accused me of wanting to use the company's social media to promote my own political ideas, and even threatened to make a report about it. I tried to explain that it was never my intention and I was sorry she got that impression, but she cut me off after two words.

I've lost all my trust in her, and I'm sure that this problem can have severe consequences for my development at the company, so after talking with people in my environment, I've started to search for another job option. 

I'm very upset with her from what I see as an unjustified behaviour, especially after making my best effort, proposing things I thought could benefit the company, and even working when sick. It feels like she's forgotten about everything, even after she gave me a lot of positive reinforcement until very recently. I've never even talked about any politics of mine at the job.

I know that she can get easily frustrated those times that she has a lot of work on her hands, but these things got me by complete surprise. I'm worried that this can have an effect on my performance, and that I'll have to start thinking about what might provoke her next",AdventurousGuide7526,1,0.6700000166893005,12,1743896535,2025-04-05 23:42:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jsgxrw/my_boss_accused_me_of_things_i_never_did/,4,2025

1jsgdci,Absolutely stuck and getting old,"I've thought about how to post this while being vague on the details in case a coworker happens to be on Reddit and ends up in this sub, but there's no way to explain everything, so to that coworker ""Hi, here's the truth about me"".

  
I'm (46m) the IT administrator for a rural transportation contractor. 3 years ago, I was hired along with everyone else, haphazardly, when a major transportation company was awarded the contract to the county. I know I wasn't their first choice but I made the most of it, learned the position and then some.  I mention the haphazard hiring process because there were a number of people from weird backgrounds and odd personality fits. Even though I was not a manager, I was included in the management team including the General Manager, Assistant General Manager, Safety Manager, HR Manager and Call Center Manager. Of those original 6 people, only Safety, Call Center and myself remain to this day. Lots of failed direction and infighting lead to the layoffs. I had no experience in transportation but I was expected to learn existing systems and build out a transit management program that was purchased as part of the contract. This trial-by-fire required me to learn every employee, their shifts, their routes, the different departmental needs, training needs, equipment purchasing, etc. All this in addition to your normal IT guy duties. I had my eyes on every department of the location and understood the entire operation within a year and a half. This is a union location, so every union employees wage was posted on the board. Dispatchers and drivers (people I trained how to use the system) were making as much as $4/hr more than me to start. I was underpaid and knew it.

After half the original management team was fired, I had ingratiated myself pretty well with the new GM enough to ask for a ""real"" raise. He hemmed and hawed over it and told me he would ask his bosses if there was a title/pay upgrade for me. Around this time, the assistant general manager (AGM) was let go. Now, this may have been unethical of me but when asked to recover his laptop and any company files, I saw a copy of his original offer letter. This will come into play later. Nothing ever quickly came of my title upgrade though the boss said he was still working on it. One day, the AGM job was posted and I applied. I knew the business about as well as anyone but had no management background. The GM eventually interviewed me and asked if I would rather have this or the title upgrade. Knowing what the former guy was paid, I chose AGM. After a long drawn-out process, he took a chance on me and I landed the spot.

  
When it came time to sign the offer letter, the salary offer was 15k less than the other guys starting salary. The GM told me of staggered salary upgrades once I made it through probationary periods. I foolishly accepted this and signed the letter. Oh, by the way, I was going to have to perform my old job as well until my replacement was found. During this time, we were launching a new on-demand services and decommissioning a couple of old systems. This alone was a huge time commitment but fortunately, the dispatchers (the real MVPs of the office) took on a lot of the driver management. I mean, they always had done this and had never complained about it. I made sure they were recognized and had their back. During this time, the county transportation director (not my boss but the one paying the bills) was breathing down my neck on service issues and launching the new on-demand product. I can't sleep. My stress was through the roof. I'm getting alerts all night on vehicle and employee issues. The GM was unhappy with my AGM performance. The replacement for my old job is at least 8 months out. Worst of all, because I used to pull a lot of OT, my paychecks in the new role are roughly  only $250-$300 more every paycheck. This was not worth it and my mental/physical health was breaking down.



With my tail between my legs, I asked the boss for my old job back. Back to my original wage. He accepts and now I've burned not only my promotion but also my pay upgrade. Flash forward to today, they eventually hire the call center manager into the AGM role. She's a nice older lady around my mom's age but doesn't really have the operational understanding you would expect. She's great at the small details and addressing the employees better than I ever was but she's extremely reliant on the other managers for help. Worst yet, the projects she's supposed to handle are delegated to me. I know she would have no idea how to complete them and how critical the tasks are for my company to get paid by the county. 

  
So, I'm stuck. I have little motivation in my job and the boss knows it. There's no promotion on the horizon. I have no formal degree or significant certifications and live in a rural area, so moving on elsewhere is difficult to say the least. 2 years ago, I was getting call backs on job applications but it seems the well is extremely dry right now. I'm getting older, my 401k was wiped out during my divorce, I have no real career prospects. I could start at Costco and make significantly better money but I know at the end of the day, I'm likely going to have to work until I die.

  
Tl;dr I probably burned my last real career opportunity, I'm getting walked all over on and I'm too old to start over again. I live out in the country, have no degrees and the future looks bleak. I know people say it's never too late but damn if it doesn't feel like it.

1jsexdc,Advice on Double Interning This Summer?,"Hi everyone,

This is a very privileged situation but I’m considering whether to take on two full-time internships this summer and would really appreciate any advice or perspectives from those who’ve done something similar.

One role is fully remote, and the other is hybrid (in-office 3 days a week). There’s about 10 weeks of overlap between the two programs. For context, I’ve previously completed two internships at the same time (one was not part of a full-time pipeline, while the other was). I was able to successfully manage both, and the latter led to a return offer for much further in the future.

I’m confident in my time management and genuinely excited about both opportunities. That said, I want to approach this responsibly — I know the risks include burnout, performance challenges, and how this may be viewed professionally. The remote internships does have a moonlighting clause, while the hybrid one does not, which adds another factor to consider.

Has anyone here successfully navigated two internships at once? What strategies helped you, and what would you have done differently?

1jse0hf,How to Navigate Inconsistent Resume,"I got an offer from a Singaporean company. I'm a new grad. I'm also an idiot.

In my resume, after I got the offer when adding this new job to my resume I realized that in three of my undergraduate projects, I mistakenly put the date as the term after the one in which I actually completed them.

My main concern is that one of the projects I listed is also tied to a job, and on my CV, I included that project in both the project section and the job section. The issue is that the dates don’t match:the correct date is listed under the jobs section, but I accidentally put the following term in the projects section. So, for the same project, two different dates appear on my CV. I still got the offer.

It was a genuine oversight with no intention to mislead-if anything, it downplays my experience by 2 months. Still I’m worried that if someone notices, it could be perceived as a serious issue. I’m not sure how to handle it, I want to be upfront as I value honesty and feel like this could be an issue in the future, but also I feel like pulling this under the rug and fixing my CV for the future might be a smarter move at this stage.  

Any advice?",QuestioningMyLifeJa,1,1.0,1,1743888071,2025-04-05 21:21:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jse0hf/how_to_navigate_inconsistent_resume/,4,2025
1jsda8z,How do you take a path? Why is a choice so hard?,"Hi there!  
Straight to it.  
I am lost.  
Not really lost I've done more in a year than I've done in all my years before.  
Yet now I lack focus. When you know nothing everything is great.   
When you know something suddenly you start to see what you need and what you don't.  
Well I don't know what I need. Maybe what I want.

Right now I have found two paths. That I do like. And I do enjoy.   
Both as a developer and as a Data Scientist. I enjoy math. I enjoy programming and the theory behind it.  
Yet when I do one or read about one. I can't stop thinking about the other. I want to do both but I can't give my all to both. So they both feel wasted.

I know I will never know which one is the right path. We human don't get to be so lucky.  
But how do you make the choice? How do you stick to it?

Honestly, I just wanted to vent a bit and see if people found themselves in similar situations.  
I could really use some advice—career advice, if you will.

Besides the advice that I do believe I need, any resource towards reaching those goals. Both as a Data Scientist and how to become a great Software Engineer would be highly appreciated.

1jsc51k,Contract to Hire Bait and Switch vs A Call Center,"So one of my job offers is direct hire, ""permanent"" (as permanent as a job can be in at will employment) and remote working in inbound and outbound calls. I'm a little wary of the paid training period where I fear it might turn out to be involving sales although nothing has mentioned that and the roleplay during the interview itself involved providing assistance with a client calling in requesting information about the service and setting up their account, and an existing client needing help.

I have another that pays better but turned out to be contract to hire. When I asked over the phone about what the job being temporary meant I was told the employer they were recruiting for has a three month probationary period after which I would be fired if I didn't perform well. I just wanted to see how things would go so when they offered I took them up as being interested, just to see that a) the contract is with a staffing agency and b) no benefits except non employer contributed insurance with the option to buy through the marketplace and no information about how much that could decrease the actual take home compared to the remote job that normally has a lower pay rate than the contract to hire one but provides employer contributed insurance that is cheaper than the cheapest contractor insurance options ( and I have health conditions so I won't cheap out on an hdhp non-ppo plan).

The contract is one year with the staffing agency for data entry versus a remote position as a customer service representative. I figured I could advance on one of two paths going further along data path and possibly switching to data analysis or data science or the other path of remote jobs and getting into roles beyond basic call center by leveraging that and past experience working in office roles (although not as recent).

In any case what would you choose? The other job was through a recruiter but it was direct hire and half the 90 day probation is training at the same rate without any performance expectations or metrics. 

TL;DR contract to hire through a staffing agency working with (not for, not directly contracted with) a prestigious institution versus direct ""permanent"" hire with employer contributed health insurance. Staffing agency bait and switch then gaslit about it, call center job is the other option that is remote and gives better benefits. Health conditions prevent cheapo or no insurance. Which one to pick? No one else to look to for good advice TBH ",spoon_bending,1,1.0,0,1743883106,2025-04-05 19:58:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jsc51k/contract_to_hire_bait_and_switch_vs_a_call_center/,4,2025

This is my story 
I’m a teen girl who is in a dilemma of choosing career paths 
I have a never dying love for science and I’m greatly fascinated with neuroscience so I initially thought taking medical to become a doctor/ neurosurgeon. It has great pay when ur qualified. But the thing is at this point of life I don’t really see myself practising as a doctor and surgery and the medical school fee is too much and to top it all of u have to spend 10-15 years just studying and as a junior. The thing is this is frustrating for me cause if I compare it with the second line I’m so inclined toward 
That is finance cause I love problem solving and especially see myself as a corporate job type of a person. I really hope going towards private equity and investment banking. I know the long hours and all and I ready for it plus the pay is great but on the other hand the risk factor is incredibly high. There is my new found passion towards finance and corporate world that has me wondering that this is somehow better choice

1jsbbd6,is atmospheric science/meteorology worth pursuing?,"Hello everyone. Im currently a high school senior at an early college hs… so i’ve already completed 70 college credits in mostly general ed courses. I am currently on track to enter radiography school(community college) to become a rad-tech. I have all A’s in radiography pre-reqs and i’m just waiting for the acceptance letter. 
However, i’ve started to doubt to entering the radiography field because i don’t necessarily feel passionate about it and i don’t enjoy patient care (i’m very introverted). I am interested in radiography because i loved anatomy and physiology and i know the career offers great job security, salary, and benefits. I just feel that I will become burnt out quickly due to the patient care aspects and because I have pretty bad anxiety in general. 
I have always been super interested in meteorology. I was accepted to a university close to home and I will get enough financial aid to get a bachelor’s degree in atmospheric science debt free if I commute. Im starting to think a career in meteorology will be better for my mental health in the long run and it’s something I’m much more interested in and passionate about. I also feel drawn to getting a bachelors degree since I already have so many college credits and I have the opportunity to do it for free. I know I have the passion and motivation for this career, but of course I worry about what job opportunities are out there and if i will make a comfortable salary. Im also not sure what particular job I would want in this field, but im open to anything. I want to follow my true passion, but for financial reasons a lot of people have told me to just stick with radiography. 
I would love to hear from people who pursued a degree in meteorology or atmospheric science and what you have done with it. 
How long did it take to find a job after college? Did you have to get a graduate degree? How much should I expect to make right after college? 
Also, does anyone regret pursuing meteorology? What would you have done differently? 
I know I’m asking broad questions, but any advice is appreciated and would help! ",Impressive-Fix207,1,1.0,0,1743880899,2025-04-05 19:21:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jsbbd6/is_atmospheric_sciencemeteorology_worth_pursuing/,4,2025

1js9ky3,Law school or Med School?,"I am 28 years old, about to be 29, male, single, with no kids.  

I am in an extremely hard position.  Well, maybe because I am talking about myself? 

I was born and raised in Venezuela.  I studied medicine in Venezuela for 3 years, but there was a huge lack of education because of the crisis. I moved to the US in 2017. Since I got to the U.S., I wanted to become a doctor. I went to a community college and got part of my prerequisites, and I started to do everything I needed to go to medical school. I  did a class to be a medical interpreter, but to be honest I did not like it at all. Then, I did an EMT class, but my mental health completely deteriorated because, in the past two years, I had gone through an abusive relationship, so I was completely desperate and mentally tired. I just wanted a break from everything, so I did not enjoy EMT at all.  

I decided to change my major from biology to global studies. It was a hard change because I did not know that there was something else besides medicine (do not judge me: my mom is also a doctor).  

I decided to pursue global studies with the intention of practicing international law + human rights.  However, as I was studying genocide, UN, etc, I realized that international law has none to little respect. If the UN/IC says something, it does not matter because the one in charge is the president.  

I decided to explore criminal law, and I did an internship at a public defender's office, but it was extremely boring. I do not see myself being a public defender, not even private criminal law because ""it is what it is"" and that's it.

Now,  I have thought about corporate law, but I am not sure about it because it is a static job.  It is demanding and competitive.   
I applied to the Peace Corps, but the salary is extremely low and the time commitment is over 2 years.  I do not want that because I want to figure out what I want to do with my life. 

I also applied to the FBI because I thought I could gain experience/knowledge with the agency.

 In reality, I just feel I did not acquire any type of skills in my degree but know how to write, and it is still debatable.  I joined the speech and debate group and I enjoyed the debates and competitions. I also joined the photography club, and I do enjoy photography, especially in humanitarian crises.  

Now, I am doing a semester abroad in Spain (where now my family lives), and I do not have the pressure to study and work at the same time, I have had the time to think. I am not sure anymore if I want to be a lawyer.  

Now, I thought about joining the foreign service because that is what I like:  traveling, getting to know cultures, and learning new languages. However, I do not want to be at an embassy stamping visas and doing mundane jobs.  I want to impact people.  

I have always wanted to work with doctors without borders. 

I like to travel, cultures, and languages, connecting with interesting people's stories in a deep way, time-sensitive situations, and delicate and high-profile situations.  I am good under pressure, and I hate monotony.  I want to change the environment, I want to be able to change people's lives. 

These are some thoughts:  

I could be a lawyer and join the foreign service and find a path according to what I want.  

I could go to medical school (Caribbean medical school because it is faster) and become a trauma surgeon/emergency doctor which would give me the skills to work with doctors without borders, and underserved populations like the Amazon jungle, Vietnam, etc. 

I could be a journalist and work with high-profile cases, but I know it would be a hard job to find.  

I am all over the place, and I would love to have someone to read me and help me without feeling judged. I go to other forums and they only tell me I am all over the place. YES, I DO KNOW THAT. I need to figure it out.   


Thank you!

1js9hlk,How Do I Approach The Compensation Conversation?,"Hey everyone! It is performance review / merit increase time at my company. ~500 person tech company where we all work 100% remote.

When I was hired in Jan 2024, I was hired at the midpoint of the compensation band. Come May 2024, that compensation band changed pretty drastically because our company does a yearly review to make sure we pull accurate data. I was not eligible for an increase since I was only hired 4 months prior -- totally fine, wasn't worried about it. Now instead of being right at the midpoint, I am now almost at the very bottom of the band. 

Performance review conversations are around the corner. How do I go about advocating for myself to be brought back up to the new midpoint that was established last spring? My role responsibilities and job description has not changed. If I was brought on at the midpoint when hired and all my monthly checkins have been positive (even got an ""exceeds expectations"" this last February), do I have a good case? Unsure how to approach the conversation. 

For more context: only 1 other person at the company has my job title, and they currently make $15k more than me. They were only hired 7 months before me and overall, I do have 3 more years of experience in general (not sure if that matters).

1js6020,Need help. Recent college graduate making minimum wage.,"Hey everyone,

I’m in a tough situation that I could use some advice on. I recently graduated college with degrees in mathematics and computer science. On paper, I have some good credentials: high GPA, two publications, a year of paid research and a semester working as a TA, and I also have a substantial portfolio of projects I’ve worked on.

Basically what happened is I applied for probably 100+ jobs and internships in my field, and the majority ghosted or rejected my application. The very few interviews I did have were all flunked on my end. I am neurodivergent, and to make it worse, I also have a speech disorder. Because of these factors, I have poor conversational skills and people often find me weird and off-putting. 

I didn’t sweat it too much and figured I’d just find a lower paying job for now. I don’t need much money as I only spend about $1k/month. I started applying to some random office type jobs in the $40-50k/year range. Same thing — always rejected after the interview stage.

After that, I basically started applying for whatever jobs were listed in my area. Warehouses, retail, restaurants, whatever I could find. Almost all of them would reject my application. I got to the interview stage for one of them but then they told me I was overqualified for the job.

I finally got a job as a delivery driver for domino’s because they hardly asked me anything in the interview — they just wanted my car insurance and ID and I was hired on the spot. I’ve been working there a few months and honestly enjoy it and get along well with the people there. However, it is putting a financial strain on me, as I literally make the minimum wage of $7.50/hr and I don’t make that much in tips either. I also have some repairs I need done on my car now which negates most of the money I’ve made.

I’m not sure what to do now. I’m considering moving back in with my parents or living in my car next year if I can’t figure something out. Do you have any advice for how someone in my position could find a job that pays a little bit more? If I could make $17/hr or more I’d be all set.

1js5yx5,What to do with Bachelors in Biology? Seeking advice.,"
Hi everyone! 

I have graduated with my Bachelors in Biology and I’m seeking some advice. I was originally pre-veterinary, but have changed my track and looking into Forensics now. Interested in helping people and seeking justice for those who have been wronged in life. I feel forensics would be very rewarding, thinking more of the lab side of things or even autopsy tech . But, I do know forensics entry level jobs can be hard to obtain and you may need a masters degree or move states away to find a job opening. I am currently in a general diploma program for forensics and almost done with it. 

I’ve also considered maybe sonography program or MLS degree, even pharm tech... So I am still using my bio degree towards my career and can further myself into another program. I would still do something rewarding and get to help people in some sense. I am 27, so I know that I am still young, but mentally feel I’m running out of time.

 I really want to get into a career track and would like to hear some personal stories of what you did, or if you have any suggestions for me based off my current interests what my best move would be. I’m in a ton of debt from just my Bachelors and want to make smart monetary decisions going forward in life.

1js4krw,Connecting with Director after Rejection?,"It seems that I got auto rejected from a role last night. 40 minutes after the application window closed at midnight, I received the “We decided to move forward with other candidates” email. This morning, I sent the director of the team a LinkedIn connection request that they accepted. Is it crazy to send her a message about it? My immediate thought was something along the lines of, “Thanks for connecting! I saw your team was hiring for x role, and I applied! I’m really interested in the team, and would love to stay connected if future opportunities arise!” Not sure whether I should, or shouldn’t mention my rejection email….

She is also a co-founder of a networking group I follow, and holds the same degree I will be graduating with, just from a different program. I am going to a recent grad, so I haven’t quite got a hold on what is, or isn’t acceptable when it comes to “networking.” I appreciate any advice!",youngdumbclueless,3,1.0,2,1743863026,2025-04-05 14:23:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1js4krw/connecting_with_director_after_rejection/,4,2025
1js4gh1,I need your opinions as many as possible to broaden my perspective,"Hello, I’ve been overthinking what to do next so any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated!

I’m 28 f, from non-EU and non-English speaking country. I have a BS in Physics. I worked in IT as QA engineer for mobile for 2yrs and IT helpdesk for 2yrs. IT helpdesk role was in London, I worked at a famous international company. I would say this experience only highlights my CV.

Since UK set new salary bar for work visa, I could not get the visa and ended up coming back my country last year. I would like to work in abroad, preferably that will bring me a settlement eventually. Working in my home country is my last option to do.

I thought I need a skill to survive internationally.
So my plan was like this. Do boot camp for web dev -> get some experiences of dev (by either working for a company in my home country for a couple of years or doing some remote projects while doing working holiday in an English speaking country) -> land a job with sponsorship somewhere 

But I feel like it’s unlikely to come true because of loads of layoffs, AI and recessions.

What I want to do is spending as much time as possible in abroad and connect/collaborate with people. So alternative plans are as follows.

1. Freelance software engineer
pros; I can work from anywhere, anytime. Programming languages are universal, so it’s easy to work internationally.
cons; learning curve. It will take a long time.
2. Freelance Youtube editor
pros; easy to learn. 
cons; Editing preferences are different among countries so it’s kinda hard to work internationally.
3. Any suggestions or ideas if you were me?

Thank you very much!

1js40ew,I was let go yesterday. Would it be insane to ask for a follow-up meeting?,"I was let go yesterday and am in complete shock. My boss said something about the client wanting to take a new direction on the account and that my position could no longer be justified. It all happened very quickly and honestly I'm not sure if I was fired or laid off, as crazy as that sounds. They are paying me 2 weeks severance and they said they’d give me a good reference and that it had nothing to do with my work quality or my work ethic. 

Would it be absolutely insane to request a 20 minute phone call with my boss to get clarification and ask for feedback on what I could have done differently? I understand that there’s no way I’m getting my job back and I wouldn't be confrontational or argumentative. It’s just that the meeting was all of two minutes and I’m honestly very confused and I think knowing a little more might help me process it and get over it more quickly in the long run. 

I'm OK with them saying no and I'm guessing that will be what will happen but I guess I just want to know if it would reflect poorly on me for asking.

I am a 24-year-old professional from Mumbai with a Bachelor's degree in Management and two years of experience in a management role. I am currently considering a career transition to an analyst position.

To facilitate this transition, I am exploring the option of pursuing a one-year Post Graduate Diploma from an autonomous college. While my current company offers competitive compensation, I am experiencing significant internal political challenges due to which my health is being affected.

Given the current challenging job market, I would appreciate your insight on whether it would be a sound decision to resign from my current position and pursue this diploma. Just FYI, the college provides placement assistance,and has a great overall curriculum to upskill myself. but does not offer a formal placement program.

1js3hfj,Currently stuck without income until I get an interview and the whole process till I get hired could take over a month.,"I recently moved to a city in Florida and  I was already planning to get into law enforcement (police officer), in the smaller town I was living at all they needed was pretty much a clean background and citizenship. I got my citizenship very recently and went straight to the police station in the new city to apply but I had a unfortunate surprise that I'm now under qualified to work there so I'm gonna have to get at least one year of working as a dispatcher or something in those lines to be able to quality to apply for a police officer. 

They helped me apply for this said position but since it's to work for the city the hiring process is longer than just getting an average job. I don't even know if I'm actually getting hired because it says I need at least 2y with clerk experience and I just have 1y, they still encouraged me to apply so I'm hoping it works. It could take a week or two just to hear back from them for me to be called for an interview, then another week or so if they interview goes well or not.

I have been doing doordash for now but it's not a real job neither a consistent income, I desperately need a consistent income. My husband is helping me a little bit but things are going to get really bad if I don't get hired soon. I can't rush the process either. 

I previously applied for home depot and CVS and they both notified me recently they wish to proceed with the process and schedule an interview with me but the issue is law enforcement is the career I really want to get into. 

With me needing to make money now, accepting to get a random job right now and leaving whenever I hear back from the dispatcher position will make me look bad? Will I get in trouble for accepting random job offer now just to have an income? 

Because I know it will look bad on me if I take a job at home depot or CVS and leave in a week or two, or a month from now or whenever I hear back from the city job. I don't know what to do but I don't want to keep doordashing either.

1js39hr,Best European Countries for Non-EU Erasmus+ Internship in IT Networking?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a non-EU student pursuing a Master’s in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, and I’m currently looking for an Erasmus+ internship in IT networking. Since Erasmus+ helps with the visa process, the main issue for non-EU candidates like me is the work permit.

The problem is, I only have 28 days left to find an internship, so I really need to focus on just one or two countrieswhere I have the best chance of getting accepted. Since this is a graduation internship, I’d love to gain experience in a country where there’s a chance to secure a job afterward (though I know the job market is tough right now).

Does anyone have insights on which European countries are more likely to accept non-EU Erasmus+ interns, especially in tech fields? Any advice or experiences would be super helpful!

Just to add more context — I speak four languages fluently: Arabic, French, English, and Turkish. I’ve already done an Erasmus+ study exchange in Poland, so this is different.This time it would be for a graduation internship, and I’d be really happy if it could lead to a longer-term opportunity",Many-Teach3024,1,1.0,0,1743859108,2025-04-05 13:18:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1js39hr/best_european_countries_for_noneu_erasmus/,4,2025

1js2nvv,Ijp interview result,"Hello all,

I am in desperate need of an advise.

So, i work in a MNC in gurgaon as a senior associate. I applied for 2 ijp's, one for team leader for a different process in February and one for SME in my team in March. 
FYI TL role band is higher than SME role.

Now fast forward, last Thursday i had a final round for both Tl and SME. Now i believe that my manager is aware that I can become a TL and he do not want me to leave for some other process. And thats why I believe he wants me to become a Sme.

But I personally wants to become a TL coz if become SME, then after 12 months I have to fight again for TL role. My TL final round was on Thursday morning while SME final was on Thursday evening same day.

Friday night the HR asked me to share a clear picture of myself as he wants to release the result. But I don't know which IJP result it is for. I think it is not a good idea to directly reach out to the directors who took my final round.

Now last night I shared this aith with my HR that if the result that he will share is for SME role, than maybe he can wait for TL roles result first as it is my priority and I requested him to reach out to the TL role director asking the final result. He replied stating ' thank you for your message. I will share it with the leaders and get back to you'

Now, I am not sure how to proceed as I desperately wants to become a TL.

I applied for SME as well as I thought if I am not getting a TL, then maybe go for another role.

One more thing, i just shared my picture with the HR but I was thinking if I should recall it. Once he get the picture, he will release the result as his job is to finalize the IJP.

If he does not have my pictures, there can be chances that he follow up regarding the TL result.

1js2eet,"Should I Accept This Internship Offer or Keep Looking? Seeking Advice!
Help","Hii ,

I recently received an internship offer from a start up(Fintech) for a *Software Development Engineer - 1* position. They are offering a stipend of **18K per month** during my internship. After I complete my college (I'm currently in my final semester), they have verbally promised a full-time position with a package of **4 LPA (fixed) + 1.5 LPA (variable)** after one year of completion and the full time position , i will get or not depends on my performance during the internship.

Here’s the catch: The offer letter I received only mentions the internship details and stipend. The full-time job offer is just a verbal assurance from HR. They haven’t given me anything in writing about the full-time role or the 4 LPA + 1.5 LPA package.

I'm excited about the opportunity, but I'm worried about relying on verbal promises. Should I:

1. **Accept the offer and keep looking for better opportunities on the side?**
2. **Accept the offer and trust that the full-time role will come through?**
3. **Reject the offer and focus on finding something more secure?**

I saw the job description yesterday, and my jaw dropped. It was adjacent to something I’m working on in the worm stream, and part of me wonders if my being put on it was a bit of a test to see how I’d do in the new role.

The issue here is that within the last couple of weeks it has turned in to a roller coaster and I am having trouble coping, I even started looking for a new job, it got that bad.

How bad did it get? Well on my day off, a personal day too just to take care of myself (company policy to offer a personal day for everyone to take every 3 months), I was called and emailed, a minor problem that the GM could of taken care of with no problems but had to still get her assistant to contact me.
My right to disconnect has been ignored, working back late with no over time, even when I’m working from home on Fridays (office policy) and the head of the commercial department has been teaming up with his “friend” from regional operations, both ignoring pre meeting discussion points and complaining straight to the MD about how these meeting that I was running were crap.

I took this job because I was stuck in my last job for 10 years, it was a toxic workplace (became toxic post Covid), I worked 7 days a week, up to 3 months in a row, they were 12 hour days and I got no overtime. Plus I was always contacted after I had finished my “shift” and on my days off. If I didn’t respond the the MD’s email he would call me.

1jryj33,Some life and career advice needed.,"Context: I (25m) have no college degree or relative trading I have learned everything on the job and have been in the data center industry for 5 years. I’ve done everything from logistics, critical facilities, commissioning you name it. I moved out of my home town in 2023 and left all my family behind in search of career growth and better opportunities, because my home town is very small and only has basic and limited jobs. My ultimate goal was to return in 2-3 years with either experience or a good job that would allow me to be near my family. Well, there has been some developments recently and I now have that opportunity.

1 month ago I left my role with my old company (A) and took a new job (B) with more pay, benefits, and on the job training, it was win on all fronts! Well before I interviewed with job (B) I did a 3 panel interview with company (C), and didn’t hear from them for over a month. So I took the job with company (B). Well company (C) messaged me back and I got the job! Bad thing is it was 5 days before my start with company (B). I just worked half the week at job (B) and waited for job (C) to confirm all the background checks were good. Thursday morning they called and said I was good to start on 4/14. Job (C) is a 60/40 Travel-WFH job and will allow me to live near my family! It’s basically freedom of location. The pay is a little less than job (B) but still very good! 

Shortly after the call that everything was set at job (C), I called company (B) and informed them. They were slightly upset and I explained this was not my intention and felt genuinely bad about how things turned out. He said he completely understood and that he would email HR and all that. Well I wake up Friday morning to a call from a guy at Job (B). He said that he can transfer me within 90 days to a site near my family back in my home state. I was in complete disbelief that they would do this for me after what I did to them, and I expressed my gratitude! 

They said that by end of day Monday, they would have the transfers request in writing. Now on to the part I need advice for. 

Both companies seem great with job (B) having slightly (5-8k) more a year and likely better training.  It would be a 30 minute commute to work everyday which isn’t bad at all but still adds up. And the schedule would be shifts of 2-2-3 (2 days on, 2 off, 3 on, 3 off) I’ve done this schedule before and enjoyed it very much. But every 3 months they switch to nights on a 4-3 schedule. But you gain a 15% shift differential for that time. 

At job (C) I would be traveling for likely 2 maybe 3 weeks at a time, then be home for 2 weeks straight. Which sounds very nice! There would be no commute daily and would just have to goto the airport and fly to where I need to go. The shifts would be Mon-Friday 7-4 for the days I’m traveling and the same when I’m WFH. On my WFH weeks they don’t really have you do much at all, it’s mostly free time. But, my girlfriend says she has no problem with me doing that much travel but I think I would prefer to see her everyday. Job (C) would also likely be working with my buddy, who told me about the company. 

Job (B) really stuck their necks out for me even though I was new there and that really says something about them as a company. 

Job (C) gives employees a lot of time off when they’re not traveling which I like.

1jrxkan,Feeling Stuck Between Options - What’s the Most Realistic Path?,"**TL;DR:** This is a detailed post covering my experience, goals, and the options I’m currently aware of.

Any resources, ideas, questions, or other forms of help are welcome as long as they relate to my situation.

 

I’m a 24-year-old male who left college about four years ago. Since then, I’ve been improving myself and working as a freelancer specializing in video production and digital marketing.

My ultimate goal is to become a filmmaker in an English-speaking country. I was born and currently live in a developing country. This post isn’t about that goal specifically, but I need to mention it because every decision I make has to bring me one step closer to achieving it.

Right now, my primary focus is immigrating to the UK (more on why the UK specifically below). However, I don’t seem to have the type of work experience that would make companies abroad willing to sponsor me for a visa, even though I have collaborated with some major companies in the past.

After spending the last year continuously applying for jobs and improving my CV without securing a **single** interview, I’ve concluded that sponsorship is highly unlikely (at least for now). If I had at least gotten some attention, I would have doubled down on my efforts.

I know I can provide value to companies looking for video makers and social media marketers. I’m confident in my ability to market myself during interviews, but the hardest part is getting noticed. I feel invisible right now.

A few days ago, I found a recruitment agency that claims they can elevate my profile, apply for jobs on my behalf, and land me interviews. It sounded too good to be true, but I’ve decided to give them a chance.

At the same time, I’ve started looking for agencies or individuals who can help me secure high-demand, unskilled labor jobs, such as construction or caregiving. It may not be ideal, but given my situation, I’d gladly take it.

Time is extremely important to me, and as it passes, I feel increasingly anxious about my age. My short-term goal is simply to be in the UK legally. Once there, I can start networking with other filmmakers, attending industry events, and sharpening my skills. I’d prefer to be in the UK before turning 30, but I don’t know if that’s a realistic expectation.

 

**Other Options I’m Considering**

Aside from the paths mentioned above, I’m aware of these possibilities:

1. **Studying in the UK**

* Studying in the UK is significantly more expensive than in other European countries, and I’d need to save for another **2–3 years** to afford it.
* I’m not really interested in studying, but if I do, it would be solely for the purpose of staying in the UK.
* Even after graduation, a visa sponsorship isn’t guaranteed. I’ve seen many international graduates struggle to secure sponsorship.

2. **Becoming a Successful Financial Trader**

* I have an agreement with a company that will sponsor me if I become a consistently profitable trader.
* They are legitimate and have sponsored people before, but their probation challenge is extremely difficult.
* Financial trading is unlike any business I’ve tried before, and it could take me **years** to master.

3. **Launching My Own Digital Marketing & Video Production Agency**

* In theory, this seems like the best option, and I have contacts who could guide me.
* However, **logistical challenges** make it incredibly difficult:
   * Forming a UK-based company is possible, but I struggle to open a UK bank account due to my country of residence.
   * Major platforms impose restrictions on my region. Facebook, for instance, instantly restricts any new agency ad accounts created from my country’s IP address.
* Even if I overcome these barriers (which is possible), progress would be **very slow**, and reaching the self-sponsorship qualification level would take at least **five years**.

 

Right now, I feel torn between these options. I don’t know whether to go all in on one path or to keep assessing my options and alternating between them until something works.

I’m **certain** there are pathways I haven’t considered yet. I keep learning about new possibilities almost every day, which is why I’m hoping to reach people who might know something I don’t.

Any **resources, ideas, questions, or feedback** are welcome!",Practical_Candle_705,1,0.6600000262260437,0,1743836087,2025-04-05 06:54:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrxkan/feeling_stuck_between_options_whats_the_most/,4,2025

1jrx727,Need help. What should I do?,"Hi! I’m currently in my first year of optometry after doing a degree in biomedical science and am unsure if I should continue this course. 

In high school I enjoyed calculus and algebra maths but after doing biomed, I find bio and anatomy subjects a lot easier. 

 The reason why I’m so hesitant to pursue optometry is because I’ve heard over the years the profession is becoming more kpi and sales based instead of focusing on actual health care. Moreover, with more unis spurting out grads, I’ve heard the career is going to get even more saturated, meaning the salary would decrease as well.  And I don’t see myself going regional for a higher pay. 

What should I do? I’ve already wasted a lot of years doing undergrad and then trying other careers.

I feel that optom is still an easy going career with more job stability then other professions, so I’m scared of letting it go and regretting it later. 

I’ve considered careers in actuarial science, finance, engineering and data science. 

But I’m scared of leaving behind a comfortable career and going into the unknown. Ive heard it’s a lot harder to find a job for the other degrees.

1jrwqhu,Night owl adjusting to 9-5 schedule,"I've always been someone who works best in the evening and at night.

1jrucdm,Is a year in computer science a good idea? (Mech Eng),"I am a 2nd year student studying Mech Eng in the uk, at a university in the top 100 in the global ranking. 
My current course is a B.Eng with an industrial year, but after a lot of effort sending applications, and a few in person assessment centres, focusing on manufacturing and systems engineering I have been unsuccessful.
After being majorly disrupted from my studies by applications and the different assessments stages, I am currently working at a low 2:1 / high 2:2 level. I have applied for a few summer internships, but I am not confident I’ll get one and a year in industry is looking increasingly unlikely. 
I have also applied for an internal university research internship into studying plastic recycling using fluid dynamics and Modeling, and I am still not entirely sure what I want to specialise into after I have graduated, however systems engineering is still appealing to me.
My university also has a very strong computer science department, and offers a year in computer science for all courses, with an ai and software modules and coding in python.
I already have had a reasonable amount of computing education, from modules focusing on learning c, basic electrical engineering, and mechatronics (microprocessors and computer components). I also used python during GCSEs but haven’t used it since.

I have also used both Matlab and Fusion 360 as part of my course

I’m not sure I am ready to graduate next year, and I am required to maintain a 55% average to join computer science or placement next year.
I would then return afterwards to complete 3rd year of mech engineering. As this year in computing is a general option for any course, there will likely be some overlap with what I have already learnt so far.

Do you guys think me going down the computer science year path would be something worth pursuing, or would it likely be a waste of time.

The year in computing is essentially a selection of modules that are typically taken as part of a computer science conversation as part of a 1 year Msci, and will count as an additional year to my course.
If I pass the year my final degree will be:
B.Eng Mechanical Engineering With a year in Computer Science, and the CS year will not count towards my final degree classification 
But I will get a separate transcript with my year in CS marks

Sa current company ko, contractual pa rin ako. Comfortable na ako sa trabaho at sa mga ka-team ko, mabilis pagpaalam for SL/VL or even I needed to undertime, pero minsan nakaka-stress din dahil sa higher-ups at kulang talaga kami sa tao sa department. Recently, nag-apply ako for promotion, pero di ako nakuha—mas pinili nila yung external applicants. Nasabi ko na sa supervisor ko (pero hindi pa sa Manager) na nag-a-apply ako sa iba. I was also informed na nag-request sila ng salary increase for us at approved na raw ng management. Also, advices that I should think carefully because there is a possibility that I may be promoted if the president will be replaced.

Sa new company naman, panibagong environment, bagong colleagues, at may chance maging permanent. May HMO at leave credits din daw (though di pa officially discussed). Downside lang, mas mababa yung expected salary na nabanggit ko sa kanila compared sa bagong increase na matatanggap ko sa current job. Kaya ngayon, torn talaga ako—mag-stay ba ako sa comfortable pero uncertain kung mare-regular, or mag-risk sa bagong opportunity na may potential benefits and regularization?

1jrtb1e,should i ask for my old job back?,"hi, all.

i (24F) have really been struggling as of late. i started a new job two months ago at a PR agency, looking for a change from freelancing, and i’ve never been more miserable.

let me be clear: i have no issue with working hard and doing grunt work to move up in the world. i understand that you need a solid foundation in any industry before you start making big moves/an impact at all. i have no problem with that! i learned so much from my freelance experience and was excited to get to absorb from really experienced PR pros. and my managers have all been really complimentary, telling me how great i’ve been doing in such a short time. i think if i stuck around for another two years, i’d get promoted easily. i’m a people person & work really well under pressure, so the work itself, while demanding and tough at times purely because of the time suck it is, doesn’t make me feel out of my depth. 

the real problem? the workplace. 
- managers gossiping about junior staff IN THE OFFICE, OUT LOUD, to other junior staff. yelling “check what i just texted you about so and so” and then proceeding to yap out loud about the quality of their work TO OTHER JUNIOR STAFF MEMBERS. HELLO?
- really poor management from senior staff members on higher stress accounts (like, abysmal.)
- workload/bandwidth expectations that are near impossible. i’m not talking about JUST me, either. i see staff online long after our 5:30 PM EOD, sometimes up to 8PM. they’re not handling crises, either, just desperately trying to catch up with work since they’re on 6-9 accounts.
- expectations to be “on” always, though they’ll say the opposite to your face (just because they don’t want to pay you overtime, IMHO, not because they care about work life balance).
- blatantly different expectations for certain team members. the favoritism goes CRAZY, and they don’t bother to hide it, either.
- working with clients that don’t align with our workplace values (they’ve been extremely vocal about protecting LGBTQIA+ & people of color, but say zip to the clients when they start rolling back DEI protections).

for me, this job was an experiment into the communications field after working as a social media manager for a long time and wanting to test it out. i have a tentative plan of going back to school to get my masters in social work (with the hopes of becoming a therapist, like i always wanted to!) in the fall. my applications are basically in order, just working on a personal statement. i wanted to try and stick it out, but i don’t know if i can take much more of this position. i don’t see a future in this industry, and though my skills might be transferable, the toll it’s taking on me mentally, physically, and financially (did i mention i’m getting paid a lot less yet?) is starting to outweigh the growth in my experience, ESPECIALLY since i’ve decided i want to go back to school.

how insane would i be to reach back out to my former client to ask for my freelance job back and quit this job? my old boss has already agreed HAPPILY to write my recommendation for my application, and her parting words to me included, “if you hate it, come right back to me!” she’s texted me she misses my brain and we’ve stayed in close communication since we worked so closely together.

i think i’m feeling guilty — about not “trying” hard enough, about quitting something, about letting down the people that were so excited i got a new job (especially in this market, lol). but my whole plan for myself has changed, and i guess i’m just looking for advice from people who have no interest or investment in my life outside of this problem.

for additional context:
- my freelance salary was higher, i was WFH, and i currently only have a few minor bills to worry since i’m still living with my parents.

TL;DR:
my new job feels extremely toxic, wondering if i should go back to freelancing before i (hopefully) start a masters program in the fall?",Due_Boysenberry4930,1,1.0,0,1743820192,2025-04-05 02:29:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrtb1e/should_i_ask_for_my_old_job_back/,4,2025

1jrs35k,Not much to do at new job,"I got a new job six months ago and I basically have nothing to do that is related to what I got hired to do. My boss only allows me to do simple things like updating spreadsheets or taking notes during meetings. I don't mind doing those things, but I was hired to do technical work (I am a developer). I continually ask my boss for technical things to do, but he keeps telling me there will be things to do soon. So, I pretty much sit at my desk all day, pretending to do work. I have no training to complete or meetings to attend. I started doing self-study to get certifications related to my field. There is only one other person on the team and they got hired last month. They also say they have nothing to do. How long do I wait this out and what should I do? I asked my parents and they said I should stay two years. I have concerns about this because I am early in my career and I want to gain experience. I am really regretting taking this job, and I wish I stayed at my old one :(",Alarming_Customer_48,10,0.8199999928474426,28,1743816227,2025-04-05 01:23:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrs35k/not_much_to_do_at_new_job/,4,2025
1jrrw88,Switch from management to analytics role. Good or bad choice?,"I'm an economist close to being 30 and for over 7 years i've been in management roles. And I would like to **make a career transition to analytics, like data analytics or data science**. Here's some context:

Since 2019 these managment work experiences have been quite scattered, being on average less than 1 year per position. Not because of my lack of performance, but because of the low quality of the companies that evenvually went out of business. Of couse, these small companies/startups didn't need an analyst or whatsoever.

This has led me to a downwards spiral where it's more and more difficult to make a progression into a higher management role in a more stable company, and honestly i'm getting tired of dealing with internal and external stakeholders (mostly external).

So I'm thinking about making a transition to a data analyst/data science role. 

Also, these analyst roles tend to have a ceiling. So what could/should be my career progression, considering that **I have management experience + economics degree**?

**Is this the right move?** Would like to hear your thoughts from those that have gone through similar or can give piece of advice.",anothermaxi,1,1.0,0,1743815625,2025-04-05 01:13:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrrw88/switch_from_management_to_analytics_role_good_or/,4,2025
1jrrirl,What is better: a permanent work position or moving around with paid travel and food expenses?,"I have a job where I have to go from branch to branch covering for employees who are on vacation or have been let go. Because of that, I get paid a salary plus travel allowances. During my first few months, I stayed at one branch for 7 months, and then I started traveling. The manager of that branch offered me a permanent position, but that would mean no more travel allowances and more responsibilities—although it would be a more stable job. As a boss, he’s excellent, and the branch is close to my home, even though I still spend about the same on transportation.

Going from one branch to another can be exhausting sometimes, since I have to get to know new clients from scratch and deal with problematic coworkers. I can’t really argue or make a fuss, because I don’t want to build a bad reputation. I accepted his offer, but he told me to think about it. I could still message him and say I’ve changed my mind. The more I think about it, the more I realize I’d be losing half of my income and taking on more responsibilities. Still, I feel like maybe I’d grow more professionally—even if I don’t get a promotion.

In another scenario, I'd have probably accepted, but since I have leverage with the 1st offer, I want to communicate that (not necessarily directly that I have an offer unless that's actually preferred) and work with the 2nd offer's HR to reach a common ground.

1jrnzeh,What do I look for?,"Hey all, I hope this is allowed.

I'm 22 and I have been going in loops for the last year and I stillhaven't figured out what I want to do. I hyperfixate on one thing, then I move on from it the next month. At least, despite the spirals, I figured out so many of my preferences and how my brain works. Thanks to ChatGPT (and myself) I was able to configure a list of my skills and brain processes. 

So, it would be really fun to see what you guys think would suit me based on this list and my life-long (not temporary) interests. I obviously wont take this extremely seriously and drop everything, but I will listen to suggestions and advice. 

I'll start with the interests, since it's gonna be a much shorter segment. 

**Animals** \- loved them always, my whole life. I bond with every species well, I train them very well and I respect their boundaries while comfortably helping them develop. There will never not be a time I'm not excited to visit a farm with animals there for example. 

**Music Production/Composition** \- I don't remember how I got into this (I was practically a toddler), but I have been very successful a few times before I burnt out and vanished. The interest is there and lifelong, but I also burn out from it easily.

**Gaming** \- I can't explain how good my brain feels when I play games like Project Hospital (doctor mode) or Papers Please (I love multitasking.) I get bored of low intensity games very quickly, like Stardew or Minecraft. IMPORTANT TO NOTE THOUGH while I thrive on high intensity, I don't think I can handle dark themes irl, thus something like vet assistant being completely out of the picture. 



Now here's ChatGPTs summary of my skills (accurate, tailored, approved.)

  
**Big Picture Thinker** – I naturally grasp the overall vibe, concept, or direction of things. I can see how different parts fit into a larger purpose or system, even if I don’t always have the technical steps figured out. I’m drawn to foundational ideas and building from the core, whether that’s in creative work or problem-solving.Anyways, sorry this is so long, but I had a lot of fun writing this too. 

**Creative Ideation** – I’m full of original ideas and I love working from a flexible, open-ended starting point. Structure too early can feel limiting, so I prefer starting with a feeling, a concept, or a vision, then shaping it as I go.

**Analytical** – My brain automatically starts breaking things down, scanning for patterns, weighing pros and cons, and testing ideas mentally. I make big decisions fast by running through all the variables in my head. I’m sharp at diagnosing problems, thinking logically under pressure, and organizing chaos into something that makes sense. It fuels me when I get to solve cases, systems, or multitask in a way that requires real thinking.

**Core-First Problem Solver** – I like jumping into things, testing them out, and figuring it out from within. Trial and error suits me more than reading about something in theory. I’ll try different approaches until something sticks, and then I’ll refine from there.

**Highly Collaborative** – I thrive in team settings where ideas are shared openly, and everyone’s contributions are respected equally. I like environments where we can switch between group brainstorming and solo focused work. Having energy and communication in the room motivates me.

**Mentally Fast Multitasker** – When things are happening quickly and I need to juggle multiple problems at once, I come alive. Especially when it’s logical multitasking – like solving multiple cases, helping different people, or managing chaos efficiently. It engages my mind in a way that feels really good.

**Adaptive Under Pressure** – If I’m stressed, I go into problem-solving mode fast. I try to do something about it immediately — apply to jobs, look for solutions, take action. That said, it can sometimes make me act impulsively in other ways (like unnecessary spending or overcompensating with distractions).

**Preference for Equal Roles** – I like working in environments where everyone’s more or less on the same level, like a small squad. Some people can lead in some moments and support in others. I don’t like being bossed around or feeling like I’m at the bottom.

**Not Suited for Repetition or Gathering** – Tasks that are too repetitive, too passive, or focused on materials-gathering bore me. I need to interact with people, systems, or ideas – not just objects or resources.

**Decision-Making Quirks** – I’m fast with big decisions because I think in systems. But small, meaningless choices (like what to eat or what to wear) can totally trip me up. I get mentally stuck because the pros and cons feel completely balanced and there’s no “better” option.

  
Anyways, I apologize for this being so long, but things like this really interest me! Thanks for reading :D",kekekeekr,1,1.0,0,1743804114,2025-04-04 22:01:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrnzeh/what_do_i_look_for/,4,2025

1jrnf20,Really need some guidance. What should I do?,"Hi! I’m currently in my first year of optometry after doing a degree in biomedical science and am unsure if I should continue this course. 

In high school I enjoyed calculus and algebra maths but after doing biomed, I find bio and anatomy subjects a lot easier. 

 The reason why I’m so hesitant to pursue optometry is because I’ve heard over the years the profession is becoming more kpi and sales based instead of focusing on actual health care. Moreover, with more unis spurting out grads, I’ve heard the career is going to get even more saturated, meaning the salary would decrease as well.  And I don’t see myself going regional for a higher pay. 

What should I do? I’ve already wasted a lot of years doing undergrad and then trying other careers.

I feel that optom is still an easy going career with more job stability then other professions, so I’m scared of letting it go and regretting it later. 

I’ve considered careers in actuarial science, finance, engineering and data science. 

But I’m scared of leaving behind a comfortable career and going into the unknown. Ive heard it’s a lot harder to find a job for the other degrees. 

Any real, unbiased advice is welcomed.

1jrmg0w,"I’m a high performer in a ‘dream’ job, but I feel stuck. Should I tell manager, move on or suck it up?","Hi all. Straight off, I work in a creative-adjacent profession, with a niche specialisation. It’s the kind of job that, when I’m prompted to say what I do, people are like, “Oh wow! That’s a dream job!” It’s also the kind of job that people stay in for decades because there might be 8-10 positions in the country. That said, the pay isn’t particularly good - just over $100k in a very high COL city, and usually under $100k at other companies. 

I’m putting this forward as context because it’s part of the reason I feel so stuck and confused. 

I just took an extended break after I totally burned out. I didn’t realise how bad it was until afterward, but I had severe jaw and neck pain, I wasn’t sleeping more than a couple of hours a night, I had nothing left in the tank to clean or socialise, and I was meditating/exercising/motivational podcasting/getting massages etc desperately to make myself feel normal again. 

More than three years into this role and there’s a lot that’s happened over the past six months to make me question my commitment, despite the actual work itself being objectively enjoyable.

There were mass redundancies; a strike; I was part of a project I took on in addition to my normal workload that had national impact but made me feel really jaded about the work I do; my direct manager took a voluntary redundancy;  there was a major restructure of my division; another major project I had in the pipeline was killed; I repeatedly asked for more responsibilities and was consistently affirmed and promised more only to be left out from important conversations and passed over; I was given a promotion only in title, and my title now reflects a job I aspire to but am not given the opportunity to actually do; a position representing one of the very few opportunities for career growth was killed after that person retired; an external contractor known to have acted against posited company values was instead given that opportunity; my new manager has no experience managing people, is hands off, and isn’t invested in my career progression in the slightest; as the only person creating actual output regularly my workload doesn’t allow me to work on the bigger long term projects they also want me to do; I feel bored and ready for new challenges but they seem set on keeping me where I am; and … I am frustrated. 

And particularly given I live in such a high COL city, where renting means choosing to either live in a mouldy shoebox, or commute for longer than an hour each way, I feel so stuck. Living in a place where things get stolen and there’s trash on the street felt worth it when I was happy with my job. Now I have this desperate feeling like I need to get out of here.

I have my first one-on-one in over TWO YEARS next week (not for lack of trying, I can assure you). They are invested in me staying in this role (I have been having regular meagre pay rises as part of “accelerated progression” and I’ve been pulling in record numbers), and they seem to like me, so I want to know if it’s worthwhile trying to push for meaningful promotion or to express any of this frustration to them as a kind of Hail Mary before I give up on this “dream”, take a job in government and move somewhere that doesn’t feel like a scam. And I also want to know if it sounds like I’m just being dramatic and should stick it out and learn to just accept that my role will be the same for years on end, perhaps until someone quits or dies.

Sorry this is so long, thank you if you got this far.

1jrlrgu,Toxic Workplace,"So I've been with this company going on about 7 years. I've never had an issue with anybody, I've had my bosses reiterate that I'm one of the nicest employees here, I've never been written up or even yelled at for that matter. But yesterday I was driven to the point of almost catching an assault charge and losing my job.

Basically, there's a guy here who is highly volatile and likes to try and start altercations with multiple employees. First he texted one of my coworkers a threat that everyone over our work feed could see, but nothing was done about it. Then he put his hands on another one of my coworkers in the break room, again nothing was done about it. And yesterday he threatened to slap me after starting an altercation with me. It drove me to the point that I invited him outside to try me so I could stomp him out in the parking lot, but he backed down when he realized that I was really about it.

Now here's the frustration. My bosses all tell me I was in the right, and that I did nothing wrong. But instead of firing him or even writing him up, they just want us to talk it out. To quote one of my bosses, I need to ""be the bigger man and learn how to work with him, even if he's impossible to work with"". So 3 very serious altercations that have happened with 0 repercussions and this guy is the common denominator in every situation. I can't afford to switch jobs or lose my job if something escalates again. Is there anything that can actually be done about this? Or what exactly should I say to my superiors? Almost every employee here wants him gone, but for whatever reason my bosses refuse to let this guy walk. I just don't know what to do.

1jrlb41,I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place of my making and not sure what to do,"I am a tech lead software engineer at a small cyber security company. My company is great and I feel like I have been really successful in the 2 years that I have been there and have been told I'm a ""rising star"" at the company. This is probably the first time in my career that I can confidently say that I love my job and things are going great.

All that being said, I feel like I've gotten myself into a pickle and I'm not sure what to do. For context, my company is mostly remote, though they do have offices in a few HCOL cities around the country. This past fall, I went out to one of those cities for a work trip and had a really good time working in the office. TBH, I really don't like working from home at all, I miss having an office to go to and that trip really made me realize how much more productive I am in an office setting. Don't get me wrong, I can do my job totally fine at home, I just like the separation of space and feel like I have better work life balance. My wife and I have talked about moving a lot over the past couple years, so shortly after that trip, I had a talk with my wife and we decided we want to move to that city so I can work in the office and we try something new. I told my team and the VP that I report too that I was planing to move and start coming into the office, for context they are all remote except for my VP who comes into the office that I would be working out of. When I told the VP that I report too, he was over the moon, really really excited at the idea and everything felt good. Additionally, I have some really close friends in that city that I would love to live close too. 

Here's were things start to fall apart. Shortly after telling my team, I asked if the company provided any moving assistance since I was going from remote work to moving coming into the office. They told me ""we are a remote first company, so no"". No problem, my wife and I have a lot of savings and with our timeline we would be able to save and plan for the moving expenses. Secondly, I was up for a promotion and got told by my boss and VP I was definitely going to get it and that because I was moving they were going to also swing for a cost of living adjustment on top of my raise since I was going to be moving to a much more expensive city. Well, I got the promotion but the raise was abysmal. It was literally a 10k raise that came with the promotion to a principal engineer. I was really banking on that coming through to make this move make sense financially. When I asked why the raise was so modest, I got told ""I already get paid a lot"". Which felt weird. Its not untrue, but cost of living no matter where you live now a days is insane and I definitely know their are people of my seniority that make more than I do. We could definitely afford to live in this HCOL city, but the city we live in now allows us to save a ton of money and take really nice vacations every year, I'm not sure that will be the case once we move.

Lastly, with this tariff thing going on and the cost of goods about to sky rocket and the market probably about to tank, I am honestly just re-thinking this entire thing. I feel like I'm making a big mistake and just imposing more expenses on me and my wife for no clear benefit other than I can work in the office?? It honestly just doesn't feel worth it but I am really scared to go back on this for fear that my VP will be really disappointed and view me as unreliable or flaky. I feel like I jumped into this thing without really thinking it through but also, I didn't anticipate the modest raise and all this chaos with the economy.

Hi , I just started training as lab assistant with American red cross and I don’t like it seeing all that bags with blood. It’s blood manufacturing technician. Every time I leave the work I feel so drained. I wish could be something else and not blood. I just applied to this job because I needed a job and have applied other places and not luck to get accepted. I have just an associate degree in Natural Science. All the people there are so nice and supportive. The schedule is perfect 6 am -2 pm. Starts $21 a hour and weekends $24 a hour. Just my mindset that seeing too much blood 😒. I don’t know what to do should I keep going with training or just leave it if I don’t like it. I’m feeling very lost because I was excited at the beginning for finding a job and now I don’t like it .

1jritiv,Changing career at 41,"I started working odd jobs and landed in property management (operations) at age 25. For the next 10 years I was able to do well but the job itself wasn't very fulfilling. At age 35 l opened a restaurant franchise. Couple of year later got shares in couple more. Fast forward 6 years I am doing pretty well...
Here is my dilemma: Restaurant margins keep going lower and I am taking care of operations (remotely- managers in store take care of individual restaurants) but it is only a 5-10 hour a week job. I have some hobbies but I have lots of time on my hand.
I feel like I should be upgrading my skills as I don't see myself in this business for more than 5 years (mostly because of the overall trend in this industry). I just don't know what to do... I don't want to go back to property management, I have no degree (only some college) and I am kinda all over the place with my interests... I am a bit of an introvert and do enjoy bookkeeping of my business and my accountant is always telling me I am good with this... Is a 4 year degree too much to invest into it ?
Has anyone faced a similar situation and how did you get some help for it? I am open to some paid consulting sessions but there are so many negative reviews online.

1jrinec,Some interview tips that are easily overlooked.,"Some details are frequently neglected, yet they might earn you extra points during an interview.
1. Learn more about the company's background: research the company's history, culture, business model and industry dynamics to ensure that you have a full understanding of the company.
2. Improve your self-introduction by crafting a succinct statement that enables the interviewer to rapidly grasp your main advantages. Both hard and soft skills.
3. Make sure you can explain every experience and talent on your CV in full, with no knowledge gaps.
4. Use the STAR method/SMART rule: prepare specific cases for common problems in advance.
5. Practice nonverbal communication: pay attention to body language, smiles, and other nonverbal cues to show confidence and a pleasant attitude. (Body language is really important; please modify your poor behaviors and habits. This will alter the interviewer's impression of you.
6. Dress appropriately: Choose appropriate clothing according to the culture of the company you are interviewing with, and give a professional and neat first impression.
7. Prepare for interviews in advance by practicing your responses to questions on tape or during simulated interviews. You may also use interview assistants or consult interview cheat sheets to get feedback and make improvements.Asking your friends to assist you with the practice interview is an option. You can also use Beyz if the time and location are not ideal.
8. Ask questions actively: Prepare a few in-depth questions to ask the recruiter to show your interest in the company and your thirst for knowledge.
9. Stay calm and positive: When faced with difficult questions, stay calm, answer honestly, and show your problem-solving skills. It is risky to tell lies that you are unable to conceal.
10. Post-interview follow-up: If you truly desire this job, you can send a thank-you note shortly after the interview to convey your excitement for the role and your appreciation for the interview opportunity.

1jri8wv,How do I quit my job as an Accounting Assistant?,"I've worked as an accounting assistant (private accounting) for the past 6 months. I got an offer for a new position somewhere else. How do I quit my current job? 

For some context, I don't have a great relationship with my direct supervisor. His office is in a separate building, but when I do see him he constantly talks down on me and is part of the reason why I'm looking to leave. However I love the co-workers in my office. The other accountants and admin/HR staff are great. I don't want to leave here on a bad note. 

Additionally, I know in the accounting/finance world employers will often ask you to leave immediately and not finish out the length of your notice. BUT I can't afford to not be paid for 2-3 weeks. 

Any advice? I feel like it's the right thing to give them notice, but is it worth the risk if they ask me to leave right away?

1jrhttm,Should I quit,"I used to like my job I was over worked but my team had my back, at least I thought they did, but then the managers left and I was in limbo and now they have hired a new manager and he has decided that everything wrong with the company is my fault. I’m extremely over worked working most evenings and weekends just to stay caught up he has decided that I’m not over worked I’m just bad at managing my time , told me that to my face. I’m not purposely making myself work 24/7 I’d much rather be able to leave work at work and spend time with my family at home but I get over 100 emails a day all things I need to deal with and that’s on top of the actual work I do every day. He wants to move me out of the office I have always  worked in into basically a receiving area where there are constantly massive trucks literally driving through the area where I’d be working, I said I didn’t see a benefit to me moving down there since I had always been in my office and he told me to watch my mouth and that he was going to pretend he didn’t hear that because if he had heard it he would of fired me on the spot…… he called me an idiot this morning said I have no idea how to do my job and so I will need to be retrained in every single task I do all day. But he is still adding more work he wants me to do and if I say I don’t have time he tells me to manage my time better. I though my team had my back they were telling him I need help that it’s to much work for one person but they have just started sending him every tiny mistake I make and I know I shouldn’t be making mistakes but I’m running on fumes and I feel like I’m constantly being watched so I know I’m messing up more than usual which I guess just proves his point that I’m an idiot. I’ve started to look for a new job and have had a few interviews but I am filled with dread every time I come in to work I cried the whole way this morning and was literally shaking waking into the building. My mom keeps saying I need to suck it up and keep looking and I can leave once I find something else but I feel myself fading I honestly don’t know if I’ll last much longer I can force myself into this building.

1jrhmrr,Got taken off the schedule without explanation,"I was hired as a server for an upscale restaurant that had just opened a few months back. Working there was fine, it took a little getting used to since I came from a casual restaurant, though the guests liked me, I was always tipped 20%-25%, was often told I did a wonderful job.

 I had worked there a total of 3 days without training, I was working my first Saturday night alone, I got busy with something and did not realize one of my tables had not been greeted for 9 minutes. My bad, though I was new, and the host also forgot to mention to me that I had been sat.

 At the end of my shift my manager sat me down, looked me dead in the eyes and said ""this isn't working out"" I thought I was getting fired, we talked the incident over, she also believed I was not chatty enough to the guests, which while I can be quiet at times, I know how to speak to quests, I'm just not going to have long drawn out conversations with every guest. I had watched other servers there pull up chairs to chat with guests that were strangers, nothing wrong with that, but that is not my personality, I didn't think it would possibly cost me my job though. I've been a quiet leaning server at other restaurants and never felt it was an issue. The talk with my manager ended well though, and everything seemed fine. 

I worked my next shift and everything was good, talked to my manager again and she seemed happy with me. I had asked to be moved to a different location a few days prior, because it was closer to where I lived, that night she agreed to get me to the other location and said she'd train me over there. 

Next thing I know I'm no longer scheduled, I messaged her to ask why I wasn't on the schedule but received no response. At first I thought maybe it was because she was moving me to the other location, but I never heard back. 

Does anyone have any feedback on this? Am I in the wrong somehow? Or does this sound like bad management?

1jrh830,Lose the Broccoli Cut when Interviewing,"Just general advice to the Gen Z boys that have this ridiculous haircut. It is going to hurt you when interviewing. Point blank. When you join a zoom meeting with the broccoli cut, it immediately sends a message to the interviewer that you are a kid not an adult. These are not just my views, but many of my peers in the business world that I’ve spoken to share this view. It makes a really, really bad first impression. 

This is totally different than having long hair, tattooes, piercings, colored hair, etc. It’s 2025 and people should feel comfortable being themselves in interviews and presenting themselves as they truly are. However, this specific broccoli cut kids insist on wearing just really rubs adults the wrong way, almost irrationally so.

However, my part-time job offered me a full-time position starting in June. I like that job, and they provide good training, but their health care insurance isn't great. If I choose to go full-time, they said I can't have another job. I prefer having multiple jobs because I use one for bills and extra expenses, and the second to build my savings. Unless they offer me a substantial raise, I wouldn't want to rely on just the one job.

I have a part-time job offer for a job starting in May/June, and I'm considering accepting it without informing the other job if I decide to go full-time there. My only concern is that this position doesn't have a set schedule, and they expect me to be available whenever they need me, though they guarantee 16 hours a week.

I also received an offer from a company with poor online ratings from both employees and patients, and it's far from where I live, so I don't want to deal with the commute.

1jrfv5g,Feeling Stuck Between Options - What’s the Most Realistic Path?,"**TL;DR:** This is a detailed post covering my experience, goals, and the options I’m currently aware of. This is extremely personal and valuable to me, so I want to attract people who are willing to take the time to give me comprehensive advice.

Any resources, ideas, questions, or other forms of help are welcome as long as they relate to my situation.

I’m a 24-year-old male who left college about four years ago. Since then, I’ve been improving myself and working as a freelancer specializing in video production and digital marketing.

My ultimate goal is to become a filmmaker in an English-speaking country. I was born and currently live in a developing country. This post isn’t about that goal specifically, but I need to mention it because every decision I make has to bring me one step closer to achieving it.

Right now, my primary focus is immigrating to the UK (more on why the UK specifically below). However, I don’t seem to have the type of work experience that would make companies abroad willing to sponsor me for a visa, even though I have collaborated with some major companies in the past.

After spending the last year continuously applying for jobs and improving my CV without securing a **single** interview, I’ve concluded that sponsorship is highly unlikely (at least for now). If I had at least gotten some attention, I would have doubled down on my efforts.

I know I can provide value to companies looking for video makers and social media marketers. I’m confident in my ability to market myself during interviews, but the hardest part is getting noticed. I feel invisible right now.

A few days ago, I found a recruitment agency that claims they can elevate my profile, apply for jobs on my behalf, and land me interviews. It sounded too good to be true, but I’ve decided to give them a chance.

At the same time, I’ve started looking for agencies or individuals who can help me secure high-demand, unskilled labor jobs, such as construction or caregiving. It may not be ideal, but given my situation, I’d gladly take it.

Time is extremely important to me, and as it passes, I feel increasingly anxious about my age. My short-term goal is simply to be in the UK legally. Once there, I can start networking with other filmmakers, attending industry events, and sharpening my skills. I’d prefer to be in the UK before turning 30, but I don’t know if that’s a realistic expectation.

 

**Other Options I’m Considering**

Aside from the paths mentioned above, I’m aware of these possibilities:

1. **Studying in the UK**

* Studying in the UK is significantly more expensive than in other European countries, and I’d need to save for another **2–3 years** to afford it.
* I’m not really interested in studying, but if I do, it would be solely for the purpose of staying in the UK.
* Even after graduation, a visa sponsorship isn’t guaranteed. I’ve seen many international graduates struggle to secure sponsorship.

2. **Becoming a Successful Financial Trader**

* I have an agreement with a company that will sponsor me if I become a consistently profitable trader.
* They are legitimate and have sponsored people before, but their probation challenge is extremely difficult.
* Financial trading is unlike any business I’ve tried before, and it could take me **years** to master.

3. **Launching My Own Digital Marketing & Video Production Agency**

* In theory, this seems like the best option, and I have contacts who could guide me.
* However, **logistical challenges** make it incredibly difficult:
   * Forming a UK-based company is possible, but I struggle to open a UK bank account due to my country of residence.
   * Major platforms impose restrictions on my region. Facebook, for instance, instantly restricts any new agency ad accounts created from my country’s IP address.
* Even if I overcome these barriers (which is possible), progress would be **very slow**, and reaching the self-sponsorship qualification level would take at least **five years**.

 

Right now, I feel torn between these options. I don’t know whether to go all in on one path or to keep assessing my options and alternating between them until something works.

I’m **certain** there are pathways I haven’t considered yet. I keep learning about new possibilities almost every day, which is why I’m hoping to reach people who might know something I don’t.

Any **resources, ideas, questions, or feedback** are welcome!",Practical_Candle_705,2,1.0,0,1743783490,2025-04-04 16:18:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrfv5g/feeling_stuck_between_options_whats_the_most/,4,2025
1jrf6d3,Talent Acquisition/Talent Manager,"Talent Aquisition/Talent Manager

Hello everyone,

My question is mainly for anybody in HR/Talent acquisition/Talent Management. I’m a M29 and it’s taken me years to figure out what I wanted to go to school for. I tried it right out of high school and just didn’t like the program I was in. So I hustled and worked my ass off so once I figured out what I wanted to go back for I’d have the money to do so. I originally wanted to go for animation/creative writing but I’m not super artistic at least with drawing and stuff along those lines. So I was doing some research and talking to a buddy and he suggested looking into talent management or acquisition. I’d mainly want to work in the gaming space, finding new ways to push sponsorships or maybe acting as a manager for talent for an organization. I have a couple questions I’d love answered by someone in the field. 

1. Do you love your job?
2. What does a normal day look like for you?
3. Is there a high pay ceiling? Room for advancement? Does it depend on who you’re working for?
4. What’s your favorite part and least favorite part about the job?
5. Any advice you could give me to help set me in the right direction. 

I’m very outgoing and I don’t have a hurtful bone in my body. But my buddy suggested this because he thinks my personality will be a perfect fit for a job like that. I’m talkative, organized and just overall love people and helping them achieve their goals. So anybody that could offer me any insight I would absolutely love it! Thank you!

1jrezhk,Bachelor in Computer science or Finance ?,"Hello!

I’ll be studying abroad in EU (Romania) and currently deciding between a Bachelor’s in Computer Science or Finance. I’m not especially passionate about either field — my main priorities are job stability, ease of finding employment, and a decent work-life balance after graduation.

I understand both have potential, but from what I’ve gathered:
	•	CS offers strong job prospects, flexibility (including remote work), and solid salaries, but it requires a technical mindset and a few challenging years of study and some say the job market is shit at the moment.
	•	Finance seems more business-oriented and traditional, but possibly more saturated and slower to lead to high-paying or flexible roles unless you’re climbing the ladder.

For someone aiming for a comfortable, low-stress career path with room to earn decently and live well in the EU or even work remotely. Which path makes more sense long-term?

Also open to hearing about alternative fields I might be overlooking.
Thanks in advance.

1jrdpmj,"Need Guidance on Career Path and Internship Opportunities (Second Year BTech CSE, Tier 3 College, India)","Hello everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I’m in my second year of BTech in Computer Science from a Tier 3 college in India, and I need some advice about what to do next in terms of learning and career planning.

I’ve learned core Java and am now moving onto MySQL. Before Java, I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I ended up dropping JavaScript halfway through. I spent more time on HTML and CSS, but eventually realized that most companies are looking for full-stack developers who know things like React, Node.js, and other modern technologies. Because of that, I felt like focusing just on HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript wouldn’t really help me stand out much in the job market.

Right now, I’m really unsure about what to focus on next. I want to get an internship within the next 6 months to get more hands-on experience, but I’m not sure how to go about it or what skills I should learn to make myself more competitive.

If anyone has advice or can share what worked for them, I’d really appreciate it. My main questions are:

1. What skills or technologies should I focus on next?
2. How do I find internships, especially since I’m from a Tier 3 college in India?
3. What steps should I take to land a good job after my BTech?

Thanks so much for your help! I really appreciate any tips or guidance you can share.",Useful-Obligation-10,1,1.0,0,1743778127,2025-04-04 14:48:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jrdpmj/need_guidance_on_career_path_and_internship/,4,2025

1jrdfui,How do deal with my manager?,"Hello All! I am in the process of trying to find a new job, but in the meantime, I'm employed and my manager has “opportunities for improvement”. I work in supply chain and the company has updated the title for all associate level supply chain employees to a general title so they could basically put us where they please in the organization. This has lead to a lot of confusion regarding who's responsible for what, where does each person responsibilities start and the other end. For example, under the supply chain umbrella, there is order management. Order management “team”(who are still under the general supply chain title) occasionally gets tasked with taking on the more logistic/warehouse type work such as route improvements or improving the pick / pack window for warehouse workers. Other times the order management team is asked to take on procurement or production planning.

These are all things I would be happy to learn about and do, but Im confused when it comes to actually whats my responsibility. For example, I bought up an improvement opportunity in regards to production planning and I was told to “stay in my lane”. Where is my lane? There are many more examples, but it’s too much to type out. 

When I ask what I should be focused on, I get examples of what sounds like another teams responsibilities. I've asked my manager multiple times to provide clarity and they cannot.  Honestly most of the time their response make things even more confusing.

Because of this I have stopped bringing improvement opportunities to the table. I do my tasks and I go home. The other day my boss mentioned that I don't “bring new ideas and try things” at work. I then went through multiple examples of me trying and me being told to “stay in my lane” or it being shot down with no explanation. I don't expect them to agree to everything or anything I suggest, but feedback regarding why this wont work for the organization is critical so I can better understand the companies wants or needs.

We are being forced to submit SMART goals. I've asked my manager what she wants my goals to be and she has nothing. I've asked her what her goals are, she has nothing, I asked what the VPs goals are and I got a “I will look into it” (that was 4 days ago). We have to set our goals by April 7th and I have not a clue what to set as a goal. My team is currently exceeding every KPI we have and the other KPIs the company tracks are technically related to other teams (such as on time delivery or product availability). 

I'm at a point where I'm tired of this circus and I'm focusing on getting a few certificates and looking for my next employment opportunity. In the mean time, I'm still here and it's getting harder by the day to not say fuck everything. How do I cope with my manager and come up with goals in the meantime?

1jrbu0h,I accidentally wore too many hats at a hotel/restaurant/pub job and now I have no idea what to do next - advice?,"
I started a hospitality job a few years back while I was at uni and somehow ended up wearing every hat imaginable. Now I’m at this weird crossroads where I have a ton of random skills but no clear career path. I’m hoping someone out there has been through something similar or has any advice because I’m ready for a change and don’t know where to start? 

Weddings and events from start to finish including sales, planning meetings, creating run sheets and prep sheets, managing FOH and kitchen, rostering, staffing, the whole sha bang. I created all our event packages from scratch m including pricing, costing, and visuals. 

Set up systems like Calendly and Microsoft Bookings, built out CRMs, and basically created all the tools to make our meetings run smoother.

Built and updated pages on WordPress using Elementor. Took care of social media, instagram, Facebook, TikTok including reels, content creation, scheduling, Facebook events, Eventbrite, ads, etc.
Zapier automations, Google Analytics, and all those back-end tools no one talks about in hospitality. 

Organised a few big market days with stallholders tracked payments, built automations, handled logistics. Covered every part of the accommodation side too  bookings, customer service, check-ins, the lot.

Oh, and I have a Fine Arts degree (photography + silversmithing), so I’ve been the in-house photographer/content creator on top of everything else.

I’ve learned a lot and I know I’m good at problem-solving and making things run smoother… but now I’m not sure what this all adds up to. I don’t really want to stay in hospitality long-term, and I want to get paid properly for the value I bring — but I don’t know what roles to even look for. Ops? Marketing? Events? Tech-adjacent stuff?

Have any of you made the jump from a chaotic all-rounder role into something more defined (and better paid)? I’d love to hear your story or get some guidance. What would you do with this kind of experience?

1jrb2gm,Would it be a bad idea to quit my job to get a masters degree (engineering)?,"I am currently living abroad, and I have a very well paying job, honestly much higher than I thought It'd be at this point in my life. I'm turning 25 in June. It's really hard to find a job as foreigner over here and honestly I'm pretty lucky to even have this job. However, I am already looking for another job because I'm not very happy at my current company. I have been here for around 2 years, but I don't really want to stay much longer.


I have started applying for a masters program. I haven't yet decided where or what university I want to do it at, I'm applying at multiple places. I just feel like if I don't do it within the next year or 2, I'll probably never do it. I have asked many people at work, older than me, and they seem to all share the same sentiment, that if you're going to get a masters degree, get it as soon as possible otherwise it'll be a lot more difficult once you're older. 


My main concern is whether or not I'll be able to find a good job opportunity later on. It's already hard to find a job, and I don't know if 2 years of experience + masters degree would be enough to find another good job. I don't want to regret leaving my job, which is honestly a very good job. I don't actually have many complaints, although I do kinda feel like there's not much more that I'll learn here 


My employer won't allow me to work while pursuing a masters degree, unless I only have to attend university once a week, which is not possible at the top universities over here. I'm also open to getting a degree abroad if I find a good program, but again, I would have to quit my job.

1jrayhy,Career Pivot Advice — Feeling Stuck and Looking for a New Direction,"Hey everyone,

I’m 35, have an associate’s degree, and have been a federal employee for the last 13 years. The job has been demanding and comes with a lot of responsibility, along with a tough rotating schedule. While the pay and benefits have made it worthwhile up to this point, with inflation impacting my take-home value and some uncertainty about the future direction of the agency, I’m starting to question whether this career still makes sense long term.

I’ve also started thinking more about personal growth and the kind of work-life balance I want moving forward—especially with how the schedule has made it harder to be fully present with my wife and kids.

The tricky part is that I don’t feel like I have a lot of marketable skills outside of my current niche. I landed this role over a decade ago and have built up a lot of experience in a highly structured, specialized environment. While that doesn’t always translate neatly into the private sector, I’ve also taken on leadership roles within my union and have been part of collaborative projects representing employees, so I do have experience with teamwork, problem-solving, and communication in a professional setting.

I’ve been considering going back to school to finish my bachelor’s degree, but I’d like to have a solid plan in place before committing. I want to make sure I’m investing in the right direction. I’ve always been interested in tech, finance, and the legal world, but I’m not sure which path would be the most realistic or rewarding.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:
	•	Career fields that might align with my background and interests
	•	Whether a degree is necessary or if certifications could be a smarter move
	•	How to better position myself for a pivot after working in the federal sector for so long

Thanks for taking the time to read—I’d be grateful for any thoughts or guidance!

1jras6u,Career Change?,"I need a bit of an advice.

I had a major break down mid-february and decided to take some time off work, and I am currently on sick leave (2nd month in).

During this time off I finally took the decision to quit: I don't want to go back to that workplace, I just want to find a different job. One of the main reasons is that I moved to a certain city/country just for the job and for the full 4 years living there I hated it and just never managed to have a real proper life here. After 4 years I still feel I am basically there just for work, which is mentally very tough.

On top, I have been in the company for 4 years and half, never had a promotion or raise (I am still a junior with entry level salary - almost minimum wage), which also started to be tough cause the job is quite demanding: a lot of long days, travelling 2/3 times x month, and more and more responsibilities. I tried multiple times to move internally, to ask for raise or promotion, or even only a relocation to an office in another country but the answer was always no. I have a master's degree, I always had positive feedbacks and end of year reviews at my job, so I feel a bit undervalued.

After the last no I had a bit of a breakdown. I couldn't wake up in the morning and work anymore, even if I forced myself everything seemed too silly and meaningless. I could not bear to even just speak with my coworkers. I think I felt treated like a fool and unfairly, which lead to the ""extreme"" decision to take some time off.

Now I really do not wanna go back there, but I am also super scared cause the job market is shit. I have started to send my CV last week and got 0 interviews.

My idea is to find another corporate job in a city/country I like - meaning where I already have some kind of support systems or connections - and build skills to work for myself one day.

Just wanted to know if any of you felt stuck in life, or had a similar situation, what did you do and how did you cope even with everyday life? Any advice or personal experience is very welcome at the moment. Thanks a lot!

Business Analytics
Database Design and Development
Programming and Scripting
Statistics for Business Analytics
Applied Systems Analysis
Post Relational Databases
Decision Theory and Data Visualisation
Information Systems Development
Business Intelligence
Cloud Infrastructure and Enterprise Services

Then I have the option to do a flexible route as an accounts technician, which takes two years.  Then it takes a further 2 years to do the exams and fully qualify as a chartered accountant.

I’ve been trying to work out everyday to build muscle for the job and plan to go to community college to get my Certificate of Compliance for Firefighter (I live in florida) and other requirements.

I have my questions though regarding during high school and after high school. Should I graduate early or should I do my senior year and are there other classes that I should take that help with firefighting? Right after high school should I immediately go to college to fulfill the requirements for the job, or should I wait it out? Should I do community college, due to it being cheaper or should I go to a university? 

There are many questions I have and Im just looking for any advice that can help steer me in the right direction. Im scared about being on my own after high school and just feel overwhelmed with everything. Anyone that can help or any firefighters that can help it would be super appreciated!

1jr7xxp,I was micromanaged for 20 years and questioning how to recover.,"I worked for the same boss for 20 years and he is an admitted micromanager. I was a manager myself so I know how to lead and make decisions and do all the great things a leader needs to be but wasn’t allowed to do anything without prior approval. During those 20 years I did leave for a year and was able to be my own leader and I crushed it but they called me back with a 40% raise so I went back. 
Finally had enough and am now getting ready to start a new position at the same level that I was but in a completely different culture (I hope). I have 3 weeks off before I start the new job and am full of self doubts. I already suffer from anxiety and stress and now I lay awake and worry all day if I can unlearn the trained behavior of asking permission and be the leader I know I can be. 
Anyone else had this? I’m sure I’ll be okay once I start and I get in and work my magic but right now I have so much self doubt.

1jr6kxf,CV Feedback & Thoughts Please! Entrepreneur Transitioning to Management Accounting Role,"Hey!

I would love any thoughts around this CV: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V4OFzVa3J7mAeXLTiK9QdbVxp4zjnNJ9PdbwaMeNaNg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V4OFzVa3J7mAeXLTiK9QdbVxp4zjnNJ9PdbwaMeNaNg/edit?usp=sharing)

I am targeting a management accountant role in London. I am very open to a role where I can learn and get qualified during the role as I left my degree towards the end of the second year and I am far from fully qualified. I would love CIMA qualifications. I am open to industries. I feel that a large professional services firm will give me the best footing to move forward from. However I am open to working in a specific industry, particularly if it is somewhere that aims at making a positive impact in the world.

I am located in the North West of England ad I am looking to relocate as part of finding a job in London.

I left University to focus on a business I started and I ended up running 2 businesses for several years before selling both, meaning since September 2023 I have not been working/running a business. During this period I focused on self-growth and seeing what's next for me. I realised that making money isn't everything and the businesses weren't fulfilling me.

I am very early in the job hunt. I have been reaching out to my network, tweaking LinkedIn, seeing job ads, and updating my CV using various guides and advice.

I am seeking help because I feel a little lost. Using guides and ChatGPT has resulted in what I have... but I'm not sure it best expresses me. I get ultimately I need to make the final decision in what I include, and I also realise that others have far more experience in ""what works"" when it comes to hiring/recruitment etc

Related to the above... I have included my very initial attempt at modifying/updating my CV and then the latest version which is largely based on finding a bunch of job ads, feeding this to ChatGPT and using it to provide suggestions which I've then reviewed and used to tweak my CV. 

So it's really a general initial outreach to help give me guidance before I start applying to jobs, which I'd like to do as soon as possible. I'm not in a rush, but I also don't want to wait for no reason :)

I did chemical engineering in college and process engineering now. Pay is great and there is no pressure at work. But the culture has eroded due to shifting business priorities. The company used to be known as “we hire to retire” signifying a lot of people spend their entire career’s here. 

But now a lot are quitting and going to other industries, consulting, or higher studies. I can potentially save well for my retirement if i continue here.  But i lack the attachment to work i used to enjoy back in my college research lab. I feel like I’m just pushing papers. 

My partner is preparing for government exams and she wants to do administrative work. Pay won’t be as great but I’m sure we’ll be able to afford a living. We’ve always liked cooking at home, walking to places and using public transport.  I know she will support me in my adventures, but I’ve been giving her a lifestyle that she has gotten used to with my good pay (that I’m grateful to God for) which cannot continue if i quit. However i want to experience the intellectual stimulation i enjoyed when doing some basic research in a lab back in college with a professor.

1jr53ij,Job Change Advice - Stay or Go?,"Hey everyone,
I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love some honest advice.

I’ve been working as a Medical Practice Manager at the same specialist clinic for 7 years, originally with just 1 surgeon and now managing 3. I earn $49/hr, and with 5–10 hours of overtime each fortnight, I take home around $100k/year.

The catch?
I currently commute 1.5 hours a day, but I’m about to move even further out, which will make it a 2.5 hour daily commute. My boss (who’s honestly like a second dad) has never been keen on working from home, even just one day a week.

He’s been very supportive over the years, gifts for birthdays and Christmas, genuinely cares when I’m unwell. In the past 7 years I took my first 3 week holiday, the longest I ever have had off last year…I also work through most Christmases/new years, which is just the expectation while he goes skiing overseas. Last Xmas eve, no patients, just me sitting in an office alone while all surgeons on leave, could I have at least done it from home?🤔

Now here’s the dilemma:

One of the surgeons I currently work for is opening her own clinic just 15 minutes from my new home. She’s offered me:
	•	The same salary ($100k)
	•	Set hours
	•	Work from home, only going in when clinics are on (1–2 days a week)
	•	Way less stress and more flexibility

I’m torn. I feel so loyal to my current boss, but I also feel like I’m sacrificing my time, freedom, and potential to grow other areas of my life. If he found out I was planning to leave, he would be devastated and would offer more money, he’s also never had someone stay longer than 1.5/2 years in the job.

Job 1: Stay
	•	$100k
	•	2.5hr commute daily
	•	No WFH
	•	Late finishes on clinic nights
	•	Loyal boss, emotionally supportive

Job 2: Leave
	•	$100k
	•	30 min total commute daily
	•	WFH available
	•	Set hours
	•	Agrees on holiday closures

1jr487r,Needed advice,"Here some backstory. 
Last year, my manager was telling me I have problems and he had asked hr on how to help me. The HR provided him a PIP thing, and tell me to discuss with my supervisor on what to write inside. 
Then, while we were discussing, I talk to him about the problems I had faced and he tell me what problem I had. I tried to tell him my thoughts and why this had happen. But he don't care about it and just say to do it. I asked my colleague on my problems and should I even go through the PIP. All of the problem was because of us doing scrum method. However our scrum Is a modification that had ignored the principles of agile. 
Our team have to always go meet clients and meetings during the sprint. Then , what happen after the meeting, they only talk to thr supervisor directly and no one else knows what's happening with their meeting. Even when the meeting is unrelated to the sprint. We been told we had to go for client meetings and do maintenance work, because it is part of the job. 
Our scrum master that is rotate between each team members. And each time during daily stand up, each individual report the 3 questions directly to the scrum master, and no one else is focusing or even listening. They just focus on their work. So only the scrum master knows everything. We even allocate 2 hours each day just to only do the things scrum master needed to do. 
We been told that our work hours is 8 hours, so each of us must work exactly of 8 hours daily and have to record what we did in a website. And each sprint have at least 3 projects. Which we need to multi-task and just do it. So most of the time I just see what is currently available in the task list, and do it whenever I can. 
I had comment and tell him we need to fix the problem of things being too restrictive and we should not even go for meetings or do anything outside of sprint task. But each time I speak up, always get told that it is the job and we cannot decline it.
Also our sprint is done continuously and each time is  exactly 2 weeks. Our sprint planning is just whatever we feel like should add after our sprint review. Even when their is a new project, we did not plan what we need to do for it, it's the product backlog just add whatever he feel like needed for the product backlog and just tell us to think for to create the sub tasks for it directly. Most of our project are just prototype or research only also, never a real product. 

So my supervisor told me that I have a problem with not knowing what is happening with the project these days. And I need to fix it myself. 
The second problem he said was me not being proactive and speak up any thoughts during review or retrospective. 
The third was saying I did not show prove that I understand anything about the work. And he told me I needed to spent study hours outside the work hours. 

So this is last year, I decided to not go through with the PIP because we did not have any real conversation that actually helps, so I told them I will look for another role in another department within the same company. 

So I am on holiday right now. 
And my supervisor was contacting me, and tell me to review the job role in the company again. We got a website to show all the job roles there. 
This is the 3rd time this year, and I said the same thing everytime, which is the role listed is not suitable for me and it is the exact same thing each month. The job roles listed there is exactly the same each month, but he still keep telling me to see the same exact thing. 

I needed advice...

1jr3mss,Applied without notifying my manager,"Hey guys, so I don't have much experience in corporate environments and could really use your advice here.

I'm an intern at a large company, but the department I'm in is very small. I'm very close to graduating, and assumed there would be no chance of me staying in my current department, so I reached out to my main HR contact (the one that helps with everything intern related) and asked if he knew of any entry-level roles I could apply to. He said he had seen no listings for my current department, but mentioned a far larger department that had a few roles available.

I looked throught the listings and found one that looked pretty good. I showed it to him and he encouraged me to apply. I did, and a few days after the fact, I informed my manager. He was very upset about it, and told me he and his superiors had been trying for months to get approval for a new role in their department for me, but since it wasn't set in stone yet, they hadn't been able to inform me.

Now, I know I messed up and should have asked sooner, or at least notified him directly before applying to the other position, but I honestly didn't think they would want me stay there even if they did have a spot I could apply to.

During my time as an intern, I was often excluded from meetings/conversations that were relevant to me or projects they had me working on, so I was in the dark about a lot of things and had to rely on my coworkers to relay everything to me, which sucked because I wasn't really assigned many tasks to begin with. My manager rarely communicated directly to me, and in our rare one-on-ones, he would always rush through it. This and other factors led me to not really enjoy working there. Maybe I read too much into it, but I was genuinely under the impression that they didn't like me very much and were unsatisfied with my work.

I now know my actions weren't professional though, and that by company policy I was obligated to have informed my manager about any job applications first.

I guess my question here is, how badly did I mess up?",Typical-Ad4817,1,1.0,17,1743741587,2025-04-04 04:39:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jr3mss/applied_without_notifying_my_manager/,4,2025

1jr3bfz,Career advice needed - Feeling Stuck between Technical Writing and Developer Roles.,"Hi all,

I’m making this post to hopefully get some honest advice (and maybe some encouragement too 🤷‍♂️)

I’ve worked at several SaaS companies as a technical writer, and along the way, I realized I wanted to pivot into software development. I’ve always loved coding, and the dev team would give me some interesting backend coding tasks to work on occasionally. After some time (about 2 years ago), I decided I wanted to be a dev so I left my last tech writing role to finish my Computer Science degree full time (I had about 2 years of credits already completed prior so I only had 2 years remaining), and now I’m just a few weeks away from graduating.

But, as we are all aware, the job market is a devastating mess. I’ve been applying to software dev roles for the last two months (over 100 applications), and I haven’t gotten a single interview (I even got LinkedIn premium to try and message hiring managers, but that didn’t help much). Meanwhile, on days I’m feeling demotivated and apply to technical writing roles, I do get some responses from recruiters.

I feel like I’ve put so much into this transition — going back to school, grinding through projects, learning to code, hours of leetcode, not to mention student loans— and I’m worried I might end up right back where I started. Don’t get me wrong, I’m grateful I have experience with a skillset that has employability prospects (for now), but it’s depressing to think I might have to go back to tech writing not by choice, but out of necessity.

So here’s my dilemma:
Should I take a tech writing job just so I’m not unemployed, and keep applying to dev roles on the side? Or will that make it even harder to switch into software development later? Is there anything else I could or should be doing right now to improve my chances?

I’d really appreciate any insights on this, especially if you’ve been through a similar transition.

Thanks

Now that I'm back, I've been asked to send daily reports detailing all of my activities to my boss and the CEO. They're saying this is something they are doing with many employees, but when I asked around I found they are only doing this with the most junior people.

1jr326f,My career dilemma,"Listened to your previous advice I went to a therapist and he advised me to go for mathematics research.
So, I gave entrance exams and went to one of the most prestigious institute of my country totally dedicated for mathematics research. But when I came here, I was already detached with mathematics for more than two years and was never privileged to learn extra mathematics like analysis or group theory before. And moreover I was still recovering from my past illness. The course itself is heavily rigorous and deeply rooted in pure mathematics. I tried to do my best but after these two years, I am still not very good or passionate at any specific subject nor I have a good grade ( 1st semester: 70%, 2nd semester: 67%, 3rd semester: 59.2%, 4th semester: maybe 55% to 60%), whereas I had very good grades in my computer science engineering degree (9.21 cgpa in three semesters).

So when I interviewed for this position I made up that I have college in the morning, which wasn’t completely the truth, I do take classes in the morning but it’s with a pro fight team, as I’ve been training for 3+ years now, I said I had open availability on weekends, which I absolutely would if the most important class (wrestling) wasn’t on Sundays

So now I’m missing a crucial element of mma because of work and I have a lot of fights coming up that I’ll need as much wrestling is possible, but my schedule is already so curated I’m afraid my boss wouldn’t like that, job security is super important to me, gym fees, travel cost, medical exams are all very expensive

This isn’t a question of should I pursue mma, I decided that was the path I would take for my life in middle school, the question is how do I ask my boss for Sundays off or is their any trade offs I can do for Sundays off that doesn’t require me missing weekday classes? Any advice would be appreciated.

1jr2lkn,"Fired from Last Job, How to Proceed in Prospective Interviews","Hi everyone :)

I lost my job in October, due to a “rule violation,” regardless of the fact that I had never been disciplined for anything behavior or performance-wise in my 7 years there. 
I was one of my team’s top performers, was who co-workers would reach out to for help, I received hundreds of co-worker submitted compliments over the years (that were directly emailed to my manager), always had glowing yearly performance reviews, received the highest raise percentage, & received additional merit raises.
For reasons unbeknownst to me, my manager never liked me, & loved playing that hard@$$ manager role. He was a disgusting misogynist & chauvinist, speaking poorly about his wife & other women for the entire office to hear. My field is primarily male-dominated, & my department in particular was a huge “good ol’ boys club.)
Anywho, I’m a depression/anxiety girl, & my job was on the fast-paced & stressful side. No big deal normally, bc I was used to the issues within my job & resolved them fairly easily & quickly. However, my team of 6 people had gone down to 5, due to one of our guys getting a job on another team within our department & decided not to fill the position. 
Still no biggie. However, of my 4 remaining co-workers, one was eternally dead & dying like Mr. Glass, one was new & not very adept at anything/never at his desk, & another was just kinda in limbo, leaving me with 1 good, solid co-worker. The primary means of assisting my customers (internal co-workers) was by taking their phone calls. Due to my co-workers being all over the place & rarely available to take phone calls, as we were supposed to take too priority in, I was getting super stressed out. I would be the only person available in our call queue, with calls waiting in line, & me being the only one to answer them back-to-back as soon as one call finished. 
It got to a point where I needed to get myself off the phone for a few minutes before I ugly cried at my desk & had a panic attack. Since the issue with no co-workers not being very available was becoming a more regular thing, I began placing outbound calls on my work phone, just to give myself a few minutes to breathe. I would call an 800 number that would play a song for you & then disconnect once it was over. I did this maybe once a week for a couple months. 
The next thing I knew, my boss came over to my desk & asked me to come into the conference room with him. My director & the HR director were already waiting for us. They fired me right then & there for a “policy violation” of call avoidance (which is even in our employee handbook as typically a write-up, not termination.)
So, here I am. The market feels disgusting right now, as I’ve only had a few interviews over these past months.
TLDR - What am I supposed to say if a prospective interviewer asks me why I left my last job. I’m afraid that if I’m not honest, they’ll call my former employer & my manager will spill everything, due to his feelings for me.  At the same time, I’m afraid if I tell them why, they won’t want me to either.
My apologies for the novel - I appreciate you guys xoxo",Kawaii_Till_I_Die,4,0.8399999737739563,3,1743738050,2025-04-04 03:40:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jr2lkn/fired_from_last_job_how_to_proceed_in_prospective/,4,2025

1jr1abd,After years of teaching abroad I'm not sure what to do...,"Hi\~ Hoping there's a few people here who have gone through the same, or at least a career change and can offer some good advice.

I've been back in the states for a month after teaching English abroad for \~5 years. I chose an interesting time to come back...but I'm here now so I'm trying to make the best of it. I'm 27 and I'm realizing how unprepared I am for job searching, and I also have no idea what I want to do long term but I'm trying my best to figure it out. I've been ghosted or rejected from every job I've applied to so far, so now I'm just trying to take a step back and figure out what direction I want to take.

After university I only worked for a year in the states (as a Retail Banker) before moving abroad, and I knew that I never wanted to do that again but I did well in my coursework as a business major. I fell in love with teaching abroad, but it's so different being a teacher in the states that I've basically ruled it out. I'm leaning towards the business route again, but there's so many specific fields out there that I feel completely overwhelmed with the direction I could take. I'm also experiencing a lot of reverse culture shock, which hasn't helped my transition at all and I'm starting to feel like I'm maybe pressuring myself too much concerning career planning. 

Now I'm constantly asking myself questions like, ""Should I get an MBA? Should I get certificates instead and self study? Should I consider other fields like healthcare? Should I just get a job doing anything for now and hope I find what I want to do later?"". The people I know personally that experienced teaching overseas and moved back had plans and jobs to come back to, and without that I'm feeling super lost.

1jr0ryl,Afraid of getting laid off for accepting new job.,"I work as a full time float teller currently, I am worried about getting laid off if I choose to accept a new position at the bank. Leaving it vague for anonymity reasons but if I accepted the new job which I have already interviewed for and been offered I am worried that the bank may turn around and eliminate the position especially with the recent economic downturn. I interviewed for the position and got it which is part time (working less hours would help me in school and I would be doing what I wanted to in banking) but I am worried about turnovers and layoffs. My idea right now is to either decline the offer which I have already interviewed for / expressed interest in or to try to see if I can continue working as a float teller while still doing the part time job at least for the short term. Any thoughts guidance or questions would be very much appreciated. The bank I work for isn’t a huge one and I brought up the issue of job security in the initial interview - the interviewer assured me that it wouldn’t happen at “this bank” and that she couldn’t see herself continuing for another couple years/ sees me as her replacement should I decide to stay in the position.

1jqzv3u,LinkedIn hacks that improved my job search efficiency,"As an old LinkedIn user since my freshman year, it’s the website that accompanied me from internship searching to landing a full-time job. During recruiting season, I checked it as frequently as Reddit. But there's a big problem with jobs posted on LinkedIn: they’re highly competitive, sometimes there are over 200 applicants within 24 hours! Here are my tricks to improve efficiency with every LinkedIn job application.

1. Find jobs posted on LinkedIn in the past 1 or 2 hours instead of 24 hours

Search for your desired job and filter by “Past 24 hours”

In the URL, change from 86400 to 3600 or 7200 — 86400 represents 24 hours, 3600 is 1 hour, and 7200 is 2 hours.

It effectively increases the chances of my resume being seen, without any extra effort!

2. Find jobs that aren't posted on LinkedIn but are hiring

Type-in a search query using this template: “Keyword” + “Role” or “Location”, keywords can be Hiring, Seeking, Looking, Opening, Recruiting...Examples: Hiring Data Scientist New York City

Click posts and filter to show results from the last 24 hours.

Check if the post is from the hiring manager or recruiter, and send them a connection request with a short note.

After they accept, send a quick DM: introduce yourself, highlight one key accomplishment, and explain why you’re reaching out....Ask if they’d be open to a quick chat to discuss the role.

If they don’t accept, I still follow them to look for future opportunities. It’s completely normal for people to ignore your connection requests, don’t feel embarrassed!

3. Maximize free Chrome Extension on LinkedIn

My principle is to use free resources on the internet to save both money and time, neither should be wasted... Here are two completely free extensions that saved me a lot of time:

Simplify: One click to predict interview questions for any LinkedIn job posting.

AMA: Automate filling out application forms, even after uploading your resume

This way, I don’t need to subscribe to paid memberships just to access interview questions, and I can use the time saved to get more sleep and recharge, so I have more energy to apply for more jobs.

1jqz044,Should I get a masters degree in order to start a career?,"


Unsure how to use my music degree

Hi all, I’m 26 M and graduated with a piano performance degree around 2020. I planned on doing music and seeing where it would take me, but I ended up moving in with my mom after graduating, and she had a stroke and lost her house. After that, I lived with my dad in a rural area of a different state for 3 years while I saved up money. 

There were no jobs around me that did music, and in fact the only thing that I could get hired for at the time was low paying wage work. So now I was able to move back to my home town, but now I’m trapped in doing this kind of work that is kind of a back up. During the time I lived in another state, I lost pretty much all motivation to play from financial instability, and I’m pretty sure that another outlet for a career.

1jqytyw,I quit my job and now my boss is retaliating,"I put in my two week notice to my toxic job this week because it made me absolutely miserable.

They countered with a promotion and higher compensation but I declined because no money or title was worth the job anymore. They then asked me to consider extending my notice period, which I also declined. My manager proceeded to threaten me that this would impact my ability to return to the company if I wanted to and if I wanted to use them as a reference. A few hours later, I receive an email from my manager that beginning next Monday, I need to start my days hours earlier and have multiple daily calls with various teams in different time zones to “get them up to speed” and send her daily written updates on what was accomplished. It was exactly this kind of overbearing, micromanaging that made me feel suffocated and now I feel they’ve amped it up tenfold. It all feels incredibly retaliatory and disgusting, especially because they used to boast about how much we, as a “team”, care for each other. It was their poor management that led to this key risk person issue and they are now trying to punish me for it. I honestly just want to quit ASAP before my notice period is over. I would never work for this company again or use them as references anyways. Could anyone offer me some advice or perspective?

1jqyqnf,How I survived the job market as an international student,"I landed a full-time job and got 2 internships before graduating in May. That’s the result of 2,300+ applications for both internship and full-time positions. As an international student I can't tell how many rejections were because of sponsorship or my qualifications. I want to share my experience as a reference for other international students. I was extremely anxious and goal-less, but finally, I made it. I just want you to know, the journey is long and tough. If you decide not to give up, just hang in there and keep going, you’re not alone.

I started looking for an internship during the summer holiday of my senior year. There was only one year left before graduation, and I had no internship experience, only two projects with professors and an average GPA. I also had no idea about the job market situation. I didn’t even have a LinkedIn account. I had to Google where to apply for internships and full-time jobs. I didn’t know interviews usually have 3 or 4 rounds. Worst of all, I had no idea what my future career path would be (at that point, I started reflecting on what I had been doing in college 😅).

In the first several months, my resume was a complete mess. I didn’t know I needed to tailor my resume to the job roles I was applying for. My resume had no keywords, wasn’t written in STAR format, and included both related and unrelated experiences for the positions. I used these shitty resumes to apply for about 200 jobs on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), then started using [Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) as well. I applied to about 600 jobs in total, but the result was clear: 0 replies, not even one rejection letter.

In the following 3 months, I realized my problems. I built 3 versions of my resume targeted at 3 different areas using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). I started receiving interview invitations, but I could barely pass the phone screen or the second round. I used AMA Interview to help me predict interview questions and practice mock interviews based on the different interview stages. I gradually realized that different job roles have different focuses. I started making 6 versions of my resume for the 6 roles I was focusing on and also began preparing structured answers for phone screens and behavioral questions. During this period, I landed my first internship through Handshake. I finally had some work experience I could put on my resume.

The first one is always the hardest. It took me almost 6 months. From there, my internship search became smoother. I received my second internship while still doing my first one. I got several referrals from alumni and even final round interview invitations, but I was rejected by all. There was nothing I could do but accept the reality that students who require sponsorship are always the last candidates they consider. Still, these 2 internships gave me valuable working experience of real-world problems. I continued practicing mock interviews and felt more confident in the process. When I was stuck in job searching and anxious about the future, I received a full-time return offer from my second internships.

The full-time job took me over 2300 applications, hundreds of sleepless nights, and a bit of luck. I truly cherish this opportunity and hope to see a better version of myself in the future. To the millions of international students out there, please don’t give up.

1jqyp09,"26 y/o, should I become a Grade 7-12 Biology Teacher or a Public Health Inspector?","Hey everyone, I have some interviews coming up and I'd like some feedback. In 2023 I graduated with a Bachelors in Biology. I originally wanted to do environmental engineering because I cared about the environment but all my life people told me ""you're so smart you should be a doctor"" so I listened to them.

In the end, my grades weren't good enough for medical/nursing/PA school. I earned about 2 years of experience working as a medical scribe in an emergency department and didn't like the healthcare environment either. So I applied to lab technician school, I like the behind scenes aspect of it, but they rejected me.

Then I spent the next 1.5 years taking Computer Science classes because I always wanted to learn how to code until I realized the job market for it is fucked.

So now it's 2025, I've been applying for jobs for the last 4 months, and I've managed to get 2 interviews for next week: 

-An alternative teaching program that pays for my masters degree and gets me a teaching certification, so I can be teaching in a real classroom by August. 68k starting salary, goes up to 80k after I get my masters. After 8 years I can make 100k+. Summers and holidays are nice. But I have to deal with kids... and I still feel like a kid myself. I'd have to go to grad school while teaching for like 2 years which would be really hard. And I'm not the most social person. But it seems rewarding and a good way to challenge myself. I just don't know if I'm capable of it anymore. I struggle with depression and anxiety. When I was younger, I never imagined myself as a teacher, I was good at teaching my friends, but I applied to it just to see what would happen. 

-Public health inspector with the city, 50k starting and 70k after 2 years. Not as much room for salary growth. I'd have to spend a lot of time travelling around the city and going through checklists inspecting restaurants, pools, clubs, etc. It's probably the less stressful option, but seems a bit boring. 

I just don't know what to do with my life, I've been floating, coasting, but still feel like I've been studying so hard and earning nothing for it. I can't believe I'm this old already, I really want to start working, but thinking about either of these jobs makes me tense and freeze up. I'm surprised they even invited me to the interviews after seeing my rather unimpressive resume and transcript. Is it a good sign? Am I just being too hard on myself?

I was given some scam jobs recently because my data was probably leaked, so I’m a bit distrustful, so I searched anything about the person contacting me as they used a @synergisticit email, but the searches only came up with their profile on LinkedIn and it showed that she was “actively looking for jobs”.

Is there anyone who has experienced being contacted by Synergestic IT before (truly contacted and maybe even worked for them) and can tell me if this is legit or not?

1jqyi00,New Job Offer vs. Security—What Would You Do?,"I just got a job offer at a pediatric home services company as a Supply Chain Project Specialist/Manager. The company has been around for 34 years (which I think matters). I just graduated in December with my BBA in MIS, but I’ve been working since I was 15!




Right now, I work at the biggest cancer center in the U.S. and have been here for 4.5 years while finishing school. My current role is very entry-level, but the work-life balance is unreal, the pension is great, and they constantly increase pay to match inflation. I also get yearly bonuses and merit increases.



The downside? I’ve been waiting on a promotion for a while now with no luck. I’ve applied internally since February, taken extra training, and even volunteered to cross-collaborate with other departments just to gain more visibility. No dice.



Now, this new job pays $12,000 more and offers the same benefits. On top of that, I’ll have a company card, phone, and more perks. The catch? Their supply chain system is a mess, and I’m being brought in to clean up fulfillment, real estate, and fleet operations—a great learning experience, but also a big challenge.




Meanwhile, my current job is stable, comfortable, and secure, but I’d be stuck waiting for another internal opportunity (which may never come). My department is fine, but I’m not passionate about sourcing and contracts forever.



So, would you take the higher pay + new experience (with some unknowns), or stick with security + work-life balance and hope for something better later?

Before picking my major, I genuinely didn’t even really know what finance was when I picked my major, I just knew it had a broad range of career options and potential for a high paying jobs (stupid, I know). Since the school is so big, I’m getting kind of lost in the crowd, and thought I’d at least be able to get some help or an idea of what I want to do with my career, but I’ve found the resources and career advisors at my school to be completely incompetent and unhelpful despite the schools decent ranking. I hate the idea of going into standard corporate finance, the only areas of finance that actually interest me are on the international side of finance, maybe something like being a frontier market analyst. I just genuinely have no idea how I get into this field and don’t know who to ask or even what to ask, so if anyone here does anything in international finance or can just give me some advice on what to do it would be greatly appreciated. I do have entrepreneurial aspirations and would eventually want to start something on my own after working for a bit out of college. I did up until recently run an online business that helped small businesses owners automate and integrate AI into their work (I don’t know if this has any relevance in financial jobs).

1jqvz17,Finish compsci degree or go trades?,"Hello everybody. I'm 21, and currently halfway through a computer science bachelor's degree. I will be getting my associate's degree this May, and am set to transfer to Rutgers Newark to complete it (couldn't get into brunswick ;-;). To be honest, I don't care for computer science. Coding is somewhat fun but I'm not great at it. I've heard that the CS job outlook will only favor those who are truly passionate about it. I personally only pursued it to make enough money to focus on my passions and things I enjoy, and I haven't done well in every CS class (hence why I didn't get into new brunswick).

I applied to another opportunity as a telecommunications electrician apprentice at my local IBEW. This overall seems quite stable and I'd be able to make money if I get in to the program. My mother seems very insistent that I finish my computer science degree, but personally I am tired of school and just want to get out of it. My plan right now is to accept the Rutgers offer, but if I get into the apprenticeship, I'll deny Rutgers and do IBEW instead. I am willing to do physical labor, my end goal is to just get a decent job that isn't mainly customer service because I've worked enough of that.

Hello all,

Just a little context, I'm 27m been with a beverage company for about 5 years. I started in an entry level position with the company as a merchandiser and got promoted into sales rep after 1 year, I've moved around and now I've been a district manager for 2 years making around 70k.

Overall, I'm very career driven and impatient, I'm trying to move up into a regional position as that is my next goal. Although, I'm not experienced enough as I have interviewed multiple times.

I really like this company as they have taken care of me and given me multiple opportunities, I would like to stay loyal and be with this company.

I hate the town I live in and really want to move but it looks like it's hard to stay internal.

What would you recommend? Should I look elsewhere with a new company possibly a higher position that pays more or should I stay patient and stay here?

Any advice would be appreciated.

1jquuxc,Your dream job won’t save you if you don’t know who you are,"I used to obsess over finding the “right” career  
I took all the tests  
Read all the books  
Asked all the mentors

But no matter what path I chased  
That same feeling followed me

Restless  
Unfulfilled  
Like I was meant for more but couldn’t name it

Eventually I realized  
It wasn’t a job problem  
It was a self-awareness problem

I didn’t know what I valued  
I didn’t know what energized me vs what drained me  
I didn’t know what kind of pain I was *willing* to suffer for

So I kept chasing titles  
Hoping one of them would finally fix the emptiness

Here’s the truth I wish someone told me earlier:

Clarity comes *before* strategy  
Identity comes *before* optimization  
Until you know who you are, no path will feel like home

Start there  
Not with the resume, not with the algorithm, not with the market trends  
Start by getting painfully honest about what you want your life to *feel* like

1jqulne,Switch to finance(maybe CFP) or stay in cybersecurity?,"Hi all,

Just to give some background... I'm currently 30 years old and work as a SOC analyst for an MSSP. Currently make around 70k a year and have been doing it for a little over 2 years. No degree, did a cyber bootcamp and got a job out of it. To be honest, I can't stand the job, I'm completely miserable. Before the SOC job, I did D2D sales for a pest control company and while I hated knocking doors for 12 hours a day in Texas heat during the summer, I actually did pretty well. I was a top performer on my team. Where I'm going with this is that I'm okay at sales/talking to people. Before that I was active duty Air Force for 6 years.

As the title implies, I am thinking of switching over to finance... maybe become a financial planner?   
It's hard to say what my hobbies are in life besides working out or playing video games lmao but I really do enjoy talking to people and managing my own finances and investments (still a novice). In my downtime, I'm usually reading books about business or finance, so I guess I could count it as a hobby.

  
Basically, I'm in analysis paralysis currently and would love some guidance. I continue to read the endless posts from people who say financial planning is dead and all that, and at the same time I THINK I would enjoy that career more than what I'm currently doing. The other half of me feels likes I'm an idiot for giving up a career in cybersecurity. 

End goal in life is to obviously make a bunch of money, just like all of us right? lol

Also just fyi, would need to get finance degree which would take about a year and a half from where I'm currently at. Have associates in criminal justice that I got while I was in the air force.

Thanks in advance!

1jqu5a2,I reached my career goal and now it's over,"I got a big break in 2021, and it happened - I finally hit the career height I wanted. It's been a tough 4 years and there has been some gut-clenchingly stressful times, but I work fully remotely and I had the ear of the MD/business owner - I became one of the ""trusted circle"". I am well paid, my husband has been able to semi-retire at 54 and we have a nice house and a happy life. I felt so lucky. 

But the business owner looked at the books ""properly"" recently for the first time in years (he owns a range of different businesses worldwide, probably 15 separate enterprises and leaves most of that stuff to the accountants), and had an absolute shit fit because the margin was below 50% (wtf?). Went crazy making cuts, laying off staff when we're down to a skeleton crew already, asked me to take a pay cut (I refused). He's had a ""tone"" with me for 4 weeks now, and things that I ran for him (which, I might add, he was delighted with at first and then barely looked at any of it) he has abruptly taken off me saying ""I can't rely on anyone else to do it, I'll do it myself"". Things he previously left to me (things to do with ops and planning which were never my remit, but there was no one else to do it but me) he suddenly wants to deal with himself, or hand over to a bot in Mumbai or something. 

I asked him outright if my job was at risk, he said no (because my specific role - the actual one I was appointed for - he cannot do). I asked him outright if he was going to sell the business, and he said no...then today he said he'd been out to get a valuation and there was plenty of interested buyers. But he might grow it a bit first to get a better sale price later on. 

I feel shocked that this is how it ends, after everything. The blood sweat and tears I've put into this role, being all things to all people because he's never available and won't recruit, the 8 months of hell I went through saving his arse and his firm when we had a year of audit. All of it worthless. I feel worthless, like I've failed. I'm horrified at the thought of the hellish interview processes I now have to face to get even close to what I'm earning now. I don't know if I can do it, there's not many jobs in my sector at this level and competition is fierce. 

The end isn't imminent, it might be a year or more away. But I'll have to start looking now. I haven't had a proper interview for years, I'm petrified.

1jqtpge,Feeling lost with one year left in an undergrad degree,"Hi all,

I’d like to apologize in advance for what might end up being a long, rambling post. I’m a Junior at UCF pursuing a B.A. in Digital Media (Web and Social Track), with only two semesters left (just two classes each semester). I’ve maintained perfect grades, but I’m starting to feel pretty lost and burnt out.

I enjoy most aspects of my major, but programming makes me miserable. On the flip side, I love tasks like prototyping in Figma and organizing teams for group projects, making sure everything runs smoothly.

For context, here’s a breakdown of what my degree covers:

* Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, WordPress, responsive design.
* UI/UX & Design: User-centered design, wireframing, prototyping, accessibility, and graphic design.
* Digital Marketing: Social media strategy, SEO, analytics, branding, content creation.
* Other: Digital storytelling, project management, multimedia integration.

Alongside school, I work two part-time jobs (about 10 hours per week each, $13/hour). One is as a Graphic Design Assistant for the marketing department, making posters, flyers, and Instagram stories. The other involves web content management, adding/editing university webpages and making documents accessible. While I don’t mind the design job, it feels very monotonous. The other job doesn’t feel fulfilling either, and the poor pay is starting to make me resent these roles.

The reality is, despite perfect grades and a decent resume, finding these two jobs was a struggle. I’m genuinely worried that after I finish my degree, I’ll either end up in a poorly paying job I hate, or no job at all.

Before I chose this path, I was gearing up to apply for engineering. I enjoyed chemistry and calculus, and even worked as a college academic tutor in those subjects. I also did CAD certifications in high school, which I really enjoyed. My problem is, I like so many things. I’m a jack of all trades, but I struggle to pick one path. I considered everything from engineering to med school to graphic design, or even opening a pastry shop because I love baking and am really good at it.

Eventually, I wanted to try something that aligned more with my love for art and creativity, which led me to my current degree. While my scholarships and grants cover most of my undergraduate tuition, grad school would not be free, but it’s an option I’m open to if it helps me find a fulfilling career.

I’m willing to put in the work, whether it’s for a second major, a minor, or grad school, if it means avoiding a dead-end job with low pay. I’m looking for advice on how to combine my interests, or suggestions for career paths that might lead to a fun, stable, and fairly paying career. Any advice or suggestions would be really appreciated!

I’m happy to answer any questions or provide more context if needed. Thanks in advance and I apologize if I posted this in the wrong community!",Jungle32123,1,1.0,5,1743713077,2025-04-03 20:44:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jqtpge/feeling_lost_with_one_year_left_in_an_undergrad/,4,2025
1jqt3h8,Most Jobs Are Bullshit and So Is the Life I Thought I Had to Want,"Self-comparison is such a scam. It’s just a story you tell yourself about how you should be—usually to impress people who don’t even care about you. And I don’t mean that bitterly, just truthfully.

Do you know how much energy I’ve wasted trying to look successful, interesting, or “on track” just so I could feel like I mattered in other people’s eyes? It’s exhausting.

I don’t care about fancy cars or having a perfect aesthetic or climbing some imaginary ladder. I care about experiences. About real connection. About laughing so hard you can’t breathe. That’s the good stuff. That’s the only stuff that feels real to me.

Sure, there are careers that matter—healthcare, infrastructure, people who keep society running. But let’s be honest: most jobs are bullshit. Most of us are stuck doing soul-sucking tasks to survive, just to appear “productive” in a system that doesn’t care if we’re happy or even okay.

I took a pay cut of a couple grand because I liked the company and the job sounded interesting enough. Now that I’ve been here a year, I figured I was hoping gain back the salary I lost with a raise.

1jqs79u,Advice Needed - Not Enjoying My Insurance Data Role Thinking of Switching to Underwriting or Another Industry,"Hi,

I’ve been working in data & analytics for just over two months, my first job in insurance. I have a degree in Computer Science and have worked before as a Digital Analyst 2yrs, and Cybersecurity Analyst 4 months. 

I’m really not enjoying it. I don’t find the work that interesting, and my team is much older and more senior than me. I also expected more collaboration, but I mostly work alone.

I’ve been trying my hardest to connect with people in other teams who are closer to my age which has helped a little bit, but it’s tough. I know I might be impatient, but I feel so isolated right now. And I know I need to stick it out for a while longer before making a decision especially since I was only in my last job for 4 months.

I’m considering a shift to an internal role like underwriting, after some time, which seems more social and team-based but then I would be stuck in the insurance industry.

1jqrrn9,Advice please!!,"

So I'm currently a first year student on term break for bachelors of psychology and wanted to become a therapist however this requires grad school and extensive training that I can no longer afford. Also should mention. I am almost 24 and live at home and just had my first baby almost 4 weeks ago...i am at a loss with what to do but have narrowed down my options to a trade (most interested in pipefiting or welding) or cosmetology school to become a hairstylist. My local community college offers both programs that I could attend pretty much free with grants and fafsa. My partner is a driver so I'm pretty much a single parent most of the time so figuring out what to do is a struggle since his schedule is always different.im willing to do whatever it takes to create stability for my baby and looking forward to hearing some advice.

1jqqkgh,"Don't like the hiring manager, but love the job/company","I recently interviewed for a job that would be close to my dream job. I've been working my entire career to get to a role like this. However, I was less than impressed with the hiring manager, who I would report to. They did not let me get a word in during the first interview, and talked repeatedly about how his framework works, he's made a lot of money, talked a bit of politics (which don't align with mine, but that's fine, I'm an adult and can work with anyone.) and basically railroaded the entire discussion. No humor, no real interest in me.   
  
They reminded me of multiple people I've worked for in the past that made my life miserable. I need to talk to some of his other directs to get a better picture, but the vibes are bad. How much should this counter the other aspects of the role I want? It's a 30% increase in my current salary, company has great potential, and I can see the long term benefits.

1jqq1yw,CV-to-JOB Optimizer,"Hi friends

For everyone who is looking for a job and working hard on adapting resumes to positions in order to pass the automatic filtering systems, there's a cute little one-click tool that rewrites the resume according to the job description, maintains the format, only replacing it with the right words that are looking for. That will make it easy to work with filtering.

Instead of breaking your head to understand what the job wants and starting to rewrite the right words in the right places every time. Fabulous!

1jqq0a0,Thinking about schooling/certification,"So I did some college years ago but never finished. 

I currently work as a paralegal/legal assistant kind of role. I got here by working my way up through the system fairly quickly. I was looking into getting a paralegal degree but when I look at the salary range I am only about 8,000 away from the high end of a paralegal salary in my state. I didn’t think that the cost of 2 years of school would be worth it just for that.

I do like my job, but I am looking to make more money and I do NOT want to be a lawyer or go to law school. 

I was looking into getting certified in some tech things like A+ or something, and trying to get more into a computer/tech job, but I don’t think the certifications would even be worth anything if my work experience is all admin. 

Basically, I am looking for a way to make more money at work, but my financial situation is such that I wouldn’t be able to go back to school, I was looking for certifications or something that would be less time/money. 

(The only reason I would have considered going back for a paralegal degree is because my employer will cover part of tuition if it’s relevant to the job. I would still have to pay a good chunk out of pocket though and the amount doesn’t seem worth it. Plus I would feel guilty if they helped pay for school and I used it to get a job with someone else)

Okay, so I know I can’t be the only person that is in this boat, or has been in this boat before. I want to go to a school that has the structure of SNHU (deadlines, 8-weeks or something similar, and real grades) while i have the flexibility of WGU, more classes or as much as you can take at once, more transferability opportunities from different colleges and from S0phia or Study. 

I’m asking this because i’ve seen that i love the structure of SNHU, but i feel like the 2 classes every 8 wks - you might as well sign up for the regular brick & mortar 14-16 wk semester-no difference. I love how WGU’s terms allow you to take as much as you can, with ppl finishing degrees within months of starting, however after much digging, I’ve learned you have to have a lot of discipline for that. Can someone help me out on what other schools out there that could check the box (they don’t have to check every box but at least the ability to take more classes than just 2 for an 8 week or 4 for 16 weeks)?

I literally can't do anything and I'm a contracted employee so I don't have regular employee rights. When I bring it up to my boss the response is always just ""I'm sorry last minute changes happen and there's nothing I can do about it.""

I really need advice because I’m feeling completely overwhelmed. Two months ago, I transferred internally to what is truly my dream job. Now, I just found out I’m pregnant. While I’m incredibly happy about the baby, I also feel so guilty—like, gut-wrenching, panic-inducing guilt. I’m terrified my colleagues and boss will be disappointed, frustrated, or even resent me. I also worry that this could hurt my career in the long run.

By the time I go on maternity leave, I will have been in this position for only eight months. I also still have some vacation days that I need to use before then. If I had known this would happen, I honestly would have waited to apply for this role after parental leave.

I’m about to finish my first trimester in a few weeks, so I want to tell my team as soon as possible to give them enough time to plan. Maternity leave will likely be around six months, and realistically, I’ll probably need to come back part-time at first because, well, someone has to take care of the baby.

I don’t want to let my team down. How can I minimize the impact on them so they don’t feel abandoned? I just want to handle this in the best way possible.

Any advice would be so appreciated.

1jqp143,Extreme anxiety about leaving my job,"Just need someone to talk me off a ledge here. I was recently offered a new position at a dream company and am waiting for the offer letter to come in so I can sign it and officially leave my current job. However, instead of feeling the joy and excitement I thought I was going to feel, I am riddled with anxiety. 

Where I am at now is my first job out of college; my boss is one of the kindest people I have ever met and has gone out of her way to help me start my professional journey. It’s a very small company, with no room for growth, and in a field I didn’t go to school for/originally had no interest in. This new position is exactly what I want to be doing, or at least a major step to it. 

Unfortunately, this offer comes at a really busy time for my current job and I will be leaving my team at a time where they could really use me.

I want to pause here and say, while I’m feeling extreme guilt for this, my boss has waited over a year to replace an employee that had to be terminated; my intentions were to leave earlier but the downsizing of our team halted my plans and now I have waited a year and feel like I can’t wait any longer. So I feel like her being down three team members is kind of her fault? We were already swimming in work with a full staff, and she still didn’t look to replace the role after the former employee left.

I talked to HR at my new organization and explained to them I would like to delay my start date to tie up my loose ends at my current job to hopefully smooth the transition and just be a good person, but they gave me a strict start date in two weeks. I get it, it’s business, but it was worth a shot. 

Now I am just spiraling with anxiety and guilt even though I know this is the right thing for me and my career, and my boss is the owner of her business and these things happen and it’s her job to take care of it. We are such a close knit team and they knew it was going to come one day, but the timing is just not great.

Does anyone have advice on how to tell my boss? My plan was to call her tomorrow after I sign the offer (I work remotely or I would tell her in person). Also any advice on dealing with this mess of emotions I’m feeling right now?",Historical-Zone4397,1,1.0,4,1743702383,2025-04-03 17:46:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jqp143/extreme_anxiety_about_leaving_my_job/,4,2025
1jqp0rw,How to handle insane comment from boss?,"
Hi! Looking for advice on how to handle this situation in a way that preserves both my morals and my job, if possible. 


Long story short: I am a department head at a hotel/conference center. We hosted a conference that involved religious sermons where the group was loudly shouting homophobic and misogynistic content including slurs that were able to be heard throughout the building. Many employees were very upset. This is a company that preaches inclusivity and many employees are LGBT+ including those working the event. They went to their supervisor and also to me as I was the highest level of management in the building the night it happened, however I am not at all involved with that side of the business so I empathized with them but could not provide an immediate solution. 


I sent a quick email to my bosses letting them know employees were offended and upset and asking how they would like me to address it with them. 


The email was ignored so I brought it up in my next meeting with them. It was two other department heads, myself, and two of our bosses. I simply asked what verbiage to use with employees as they had continued to ask questions. 


Well my boss absolutely flipped. He told me that he didn’t care what they said, the employees are too sensitive, and, I quote “I don’t care if it’s the damn Hitler Youth in there, as long as they’re paying us they can say whatever they want.”


I am, frankly, disgusted. I will always advocate for my employees and even if I can’t fix it (I know they don’t want this group to come back but that is unrealistic given it’s a business and it’s $$$) I still want them to know that their management cares about their concerns and is trying to help in some way (perhaps allowing employees who felt impacted by it to opt out of working their events, etc). 


The Hitler comment was absolutely appalling. It does not feel like something I can let go, but I’m not sure there’s anything I can do. I fear retaliation if I say anything to HR, there weren’t enough people in the meeting for him to not be able to guess it was me who said something. I am not in a position to lose my job and be okay for a while. 


Do I just do nothing here? ",Odd-Artist4613,1,1.0,5,1743702363,2025-04-03 17:46:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jqp0rw/how_to_handle_insane_comment_from_boss/,4,2025

I work in marketing and it’s the type of role that has been a dream role for me. The type of role I know would skyrocket my experience and reputation in the industry and finally give me a chance to flex what I can do. 

The only downside is, it’s a role that is replacing someone currently occupying that role who’s been there for at least 4-5 years. On an empathetic level, I feel so bad for that person. It feels crappy to know someone is losing for my gain. But my biggest concern is how this is going to be received by the team that is still there. I feel like there will inevitably be allegiances and preconceived notions of me for taking this role and replacing this person who has internal company relationships. I’m really nervous for the culture of it all and how people may treat me to take it out on them losing someone they’ve known for awhile.

1jqopwr,Career Growth,"Hey everyone,

I’m a recent grad (UCLA – Psychology major) currently living in Los Angeles. I just accepted a $60K offer from my current employer, where I’ve been working as a Sales Coordinator. It’s not a dream job, but it’s a solid stepping stone, and I plan to make the most of it.

I’ve want to pursue an online MBA while working full-time. My goal is to gain real business, analytical, finance, and strategy skills to maximize my earning potential over the next 2–5 years. Long-term, I’d like to work in either business intelligence, corporate finance, or even data analytics (still exploring options). I want to get into roles that will make me 6 figures.

Here’s where I’m at:
	•	22 y/o, based in LA
	•	~$60K salary
	•	Bachelor’s in Psych from UCLA
	•	Accepting that I’m early in my career, but want to build toward $100K+ roles
	•	Considering online MBA programs like LSUS, UIUC (iMBA), West Texas A&M, or SNHU—programs that don’t require 3–7 years of work experience

What I’m wondering:
	•	Has anyone else successfully pivoted from a general business support role into finance or analytics with an MBA?
	•	How do you make the most of your early years to fast-track your growth?
	•	Any MBA programs you’d personally recommend (or avoid) if you’re balancing work + school?
	•	Is Business Analytics a better bet than Finance for someone with a psych/data mindset?

I’m on a strict budget, so I’m trying to make smart, informed moves. Appreciate any feedback, stories, or advice!

I've been with my company for over 6 years and I know I need a change. Bad boss, Bad company vibes, etc. But I want to always protect myself so over the years I've been documenting everything that has happened to me. 

I manage a sales team of 100+ sales reps at my company. In the summer of 2022, my boss told me during our monthly one on one, word for word, that I should consider hiring a more traditional team of sales reps, because the ones that I recently hired (African Americans) were going to upset the white people on my team. And when I questioned her about this, she mentioned a time in her career where she got push back from her white team members when she started to hire a more diverse group of sales reps. She told me that she was only telling me these things because she didn't want to see me make the same mistake that she made. 

Then, the following year, her counterpart on our leadership team said to me at our awards ceremony that ""my office was getting a little too dark"", laughed, and patted me on the back. When I pushed back on him, he immediately said he was just joking, but he said he did notice that my team is the ""darkest out of all of them"". 

I documented all of this, in writing, after both of these situations happened. And honestly, this has impacted my numbers a little bit over the years because I kept thinking to myself ""should I hire this person, etc"" and it has caused me a lot of anxiety. And if I do hire these new reps, who are black, am I going to suffer the consequences or be treated different by my superiors. 

I'm doing well. My team has been consistently in the top 5 in our company rankings out of 25+ sales teams, so my job is protected. But if they ever tried to fire me or terminate my employment, what advice does this group have for me that can protect myself in the future? Do I reveal this to them and tell them I'd go public with it? Or just go straight to an attorney to do all of that for me? 

Both of these employees that said these things to me are still in leadership positions at my company. 

And for the record, I'd go in front of a judge and swear that everything in this story is true. In addition, I'd take a lie detector test to prove it as well.

Company A presents about a $22k advantage, and provides familiarity/network stability. Company B provides a new experience, both in work and personal life.

1jqmn3a,Hired as a network marketing coordinator but doing the job of 3 people for 1 salary,"Pretty much the title. I started this job almost a month ago. I was really excited to start, the role was a perfect fit for me. I have background in sales and team management, took marketing in high school but didn’t pursue higher education, I know how to talk to people and network, and I’m great with social media marketing. I knew it was a great fit, and even though on paper I didn’t have too many qualifications, the franchise owner took a chance on me.

I’ve been exceeding expectations, I have the social media and email marketing locked down to the point where I have things scheduled weeks ahead of time. I’ve gone to a couple different chamber of commerce events and have networked with people from different companies, following up with them and setting up partnerships. I’m setting up seminars for me to host (as well as marketing the events) and partnering with local businesses. I’m at home shows on the weekends. I’ve been using my own gas and mileage to travel to job sites and take photos for social media content. I wear a lot of different hats at this job, and ensuring I’m getting my 40 hours in.

Here’s where I run into an issue. I got my first paycheck about a week ago, paid biweekly. I’m getting paid way less than what I was getting at my previous furniture sales job. I work in Rhode Island and I looked up the average salary of someone in my position and it said $50k. When we discussed compensation during the interview process, the franchise owner said they’d do $40-45k with a 60-day probationary period and after that trial period we would further discuss compensation. I was generally okay with this at first, but when I got my check and it was significantly lower than what I expected after taxes, I grew more and more concerned. Not only am I not being reimbursed for gas or mileage on my car, but I’m expected to do the work of at least 3 people for 1 salary. I don’t think I can live on this amount of money, but I love this job and it’s a great fit for me. I want to watch the company grow and be part of that growth, but at the same time I’m concerned about paying my bills and the wear and tear on my vehicle.

What should I do? Do I have a meeting with these people and ask what the deal is? After I calculated it, it’s looking like before taxes I’m making about $19/hour. Is this because I don’t have college experience and they assume that they can pay me less than a shift lead at Taco Bell? Because if I wanted to get paid $19/hour I would’ve done just that. (No hate to Taco Bell employees, I’ve worked my fair share of fast food in high school and it’s not for the weak-hearted.)

For context: I’m 21 years old, no higher education, 3 years of sales/customer service experience, marketing program education in high school.

1jqm564,"What to do next- deciding between Law School, Urban Planning MS, or something else (USA)","Hi everyone!

I am thinking about my future and I am struggling to see what would be the best path for me. I went to undergrad for geography at a big state school, and I currently work as an urban planner in a large city (usa), a job Ive had since basically straight out of school. I like my job but I definitely want to return to school in the fall of 2026. I am struggling to commit to what to do however, as I have a couple paths that I all would like to explore.

My first idea is law school and then some kind of public interest law, but I am hesitant because I don't want to be stuck as a lawyer if i don't enjoy it. I interned at a PI law firm during undergrad and I had a really positive experience but its a massive commitment in terms of studying and applying that I don't feel very prepared for yet. That is also how I feel about doing an Urban Planning MS, I don't necessarily think I want to continue in my exact career path, but aspects of my job (helping people, planning for the future, shaping how the city looks) are really rewarding.

I also have a really strong interest in Political Science and Philosophy/Critical Theory and I am pretty active in local political activist circles, and it would be nice to explore that further and get a job doing research or with a community org that suits my values. Ultimately I feel that I have a lot of good choices but I am unsure what to do and I was hoping to glean some insights if anyone else has had to make a similar choice.

I also feel bored by like office life and I want to travel and go on some more adventures before I fully commit to school next fall.

1jqlgod,Wondering if my new job is the right fit?,"I’ve been working in marketing for the past three years since graduating from college. So back in February (on the 27th to be exact) I was laid off from my marketing role at a pool product manufacturing company. I immediately started sending out job applications and received a job offer literally a month later, on March 27th.

This new position also came with a 10k a year pay increase from my previous job. I took this job cause I was curious in a new industry. This new job is in the farming, hospitality, and restaurant industry—and is with a relatively small business (about 5 million a year in revenue) run by an older couple. The work culture is very different from what I’m used to, it really feels like more of a mom and pop shop type of business.

While I’m still early in my career, I’m wondering if this is the right next step. I believe the experience I will gain from this new job and industry will be valuable. The food and hospitality definitely is more interesting to me than manufacturing.

If I stay at this job for 1-2 years, would the skills I develop here be transferable to a marketing position at a larger, more corporate company? Would it be harder to land a marketing role at bigger company coming from a small business?

We have yet to decide a start date but I'll probably start this coming Monday or next week sometime (I expect them to reach out to me about it today or tomorrow). In a month, I have to take off 1 day (grad ceremony) and then a week off (grad trip) in May. 

This is a very small workplace — four people including me and the manager. One of them will also be going on maternity leave I think but I'm not sure when. People are telling me to let my manager know about the days off when I go into work after a day or two. I feel like I should tell them beforehand though, probably while we decode a start date. I get no PTO to start with, it has to accrue. Because it's such a small staff, do you think its best to tell them before I go in? Of course, if they don't want me anymore then that would suck but I shouldn't work there anyway. I just worry they have something important that week and will be very shortstaffed.

1jqir8k,HELP me decide between two jobs,"Hi everyone! I’d love some advice on a big career decision.

I’m a 25-year-old female looking for an event planning job since November 2024. I recently got an offer for a new position and need help deciding whether to stay at my current job or make the switch.

# My Situation:

I don’t have strong ties anywhere, so I can move freely. My long-term goal is to travel in the next four years and eventually relocate to a warmer climate. I plan to stay in whichever role I choose for 2-3 years.

# Current Job ('A') – Small Wedding Venue (Startup)

* **$28/hr** (but with 5% income tax, so $26.40/hr)
* **Opportunity for OT** (especially during wedding season)
* **Small team** (4 people, including me)
* **No benefits**
* **I start running weddings on my own in May**
* **More flexibility** for travel
* **Located in a more developed area** (higher cost of living)
* **Growing startup** (Currently booking \~70 events this year)

# New Offer ('O') – Large, Established Venue

* **$22/hr** (no income tax)
* **Full-time with OT available**
* **Large team** (7+ on the events team, 200+ total employees)
* **Benefits available** (not sure how much they cover)
* **Would take longer to lead my own weddings**
* **Less flexibility** for travel
* **Located in the mountains** (lower cost of living, but more isolated)
* **A lot of events booked. More elaborate events** (minimum 160 events this year) 

I love the hands-on experience I’m getting at 'A,' but 'O' offers stability, benefits, and the chance to work at a prestigious venue. Since I only plan to stay 2-3 years before relocating, I’m torn on which option is better for my long-term career.

1jqhfne,I don’t know what to do with my life and its making me depressed.,"Hey y’all, so i’m 27, female, I graduated highschool in 2016, and Ive primarily worked at warehouses & factories since then, because of the stable hours & pay. Ive NEVER had a career passion. I always say, I don’t really care what exactly i’m doing at work, all I care about is my work/life balance. What hours i’m working, how much im making, benefits, thats pretty much it.

The problem with warehouses and factories is that you’re so easily replaceable, and you get treated as such everyday. You’re not treated like a human, but a number. Everything you do is wrong down to the way you push a broom. Even if you’re doing a really good job it doesn’t matter. Turnover rates is terrible everywhere. Because good is never good enough. 

So basically, I just want to be respected at work, and Ive realized I will never be respected or valued at a warehouse or factory. 

SO I decided I need to go back to school, but the question now is.. for what? My goal is to find a job where I could work preferably dayshift, parttime, no weekends. The biggest thing is I NEED to be part-time. I get really severe migraines and the #1 trigger is stress and working parttime helps tremendously as I get overwhelmed & stressed very easily. 

Ive been learning how to weld at home and even enrolled in a machine operator course but decided to un-enroll because every job ive seen for both machining & welding are not only fulltime, but require alot of overtime. Which I just cannot do. I definitely prefer something hands on like that, but like I said, im not picky.

1jqh2k1,Getting offered a full time position.. without getting info regarding pay.,"Hey everyone,

I'm close to finishing my bachelor's in IT and am currently employed as a Chargeback/Fraud analyst in a Fintech start-up. The company is great, I believe in the product but as I'm nearing the end of my studies (last semester, currently) obviously I have been thinking about moving on and getting something that's more on my field. I asked around the company if they have something more IT oriented for a junior like me but they don't.

Yesterday, my boss approached me and said he's looking for someone to take a full time position, do what he does but in a smaller scale and specifically do BI, Data analysis (I currently do some of it but more geared towards fraud trends), KPIs, talk with our B2B clients, work with PSPs, etc..

I was thinking about going into something more technical, maybe getting some certs as well, but that position is listed as ""3+ years of experience"" and I feel like letting it go might be a mistake even though it might not be my favorable direction.

I didn't get any info regarding comp, only told that options might be on the table, and that definitely didn't help with my decision, as I think they might lowball me.

My boss looks for someone to do this position for the long-run, at least 2 years, I don't wanna pull a fast one in that regard either, as he is a great boss.

Do you think I should see what's out there for me, or just settle and hopefully I could in the future leverage this experience in a more technical/product oritneted role?

1jqg81y,Transitioning from Graphic Design to UX/UI + Coding—Where Could This Lead?,"Hey everyone! I’ll try to keep this brief, and apologies in advance for any mistakes—English isn’t my first language.

I’m a graphic designer/art director with 9 years of experience, mostly working as an in-house generalist in marketing departments. Recently, I decided to pivot into digital product design (UX/UI). I’ve been studying and building a portfolio to break into the field. While I’m not entirely new to UX/UI, I lack formal training, though I believe my graphic design background gives me a unique edge. (And honestly, I’m hoping tech roles will be better than marketing ones!)

Here’s the twist: I’ve also started learning programming. I’m taking an intro to computer science, which will cover Python, followed by a second course on JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS—enough to eventually build my own designs. Surprisingly, I’m loving coding! It’s exciting to bring ideas to life independently.

But career-wise, I’m unsure where this hybrid path could lead. I don’t want to abandon design for full-time development, but I also don’t know of roles that blend both skills beyond just being a ""designer who codes."" Are there positions (like a ""creative director for products"" or similar) that value this combination? Or is this more of a niche advantage?

So I’m on round 3 of interviews, and I’ve made a few mistakes along the way. My first mistake was being late to the meeting, I accidentally joined my next interview with that same company scheduled at a different time. I was about two minutes late to the interview. Additionally, at the end of the interview the director asks me “so where do you see you self in the next few years,” and I said I plan on being a senior or director role, and some how I brought up I wanted to work for the Disney company down the line. My final mistake was, I was so eager to send the hiring manager a thank you note, that I forgot to add a subject line. I then sent a separate email with a subject line, and apologized. 

How f’d am I? I have my final round of interviews today, but I’m feeling quite discouraged. ",Far-Ad-3398,0,0.4000000059604645,13,1743680287,2025-04-03 11:38:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jqg3wc/bombed_my_interview/,4,2025

1jqf80n,Should I change jobs again or am I just moaning for moaning's sake?,"Hi all, need some advice and different perspectives on my situation.

Background - UK, qualified accountant, 10yrs experience in various Finance teams and functions (accounts, budgets, forecast etc). I have changed a few jobs, stayin 2-3 years at each on average. For the past two years, I have specialised into finance system maintenance i.e. ensuring the finance controls are up to date on the system side and implementing new financial funtionalities on the system. 

Current situation - 7 months into a new job. Good company, wfh, great pay and benefits. Problem is my manager is a bottleneck for literally every little thing I do (""protecting the team from auditors"") - she has access to most stuff and the team don't and we end up preparing said stuff and documentation and waiting for weeks for her to do it to ""tick it off my list"". In addition, I now manage a problematic person - literal daily babysitting even though she gets paid enough to be independent. I also wasn't aware that the company would ""strongly insist"" on me going abroad for a few days once or twice a year to scope future projects. I know this sounds great for someone (going abroad and work paying for it) but I don't want to do it as I'd prefer to pay for my own holiday and actually enjoy it rather than travel 5-6 hours to sit in a different office. And finally, the job is not something I love - as I said I end up investigating problems from a year or two ago that everyone has left for someone else, or I just end up following a rigid corporate process because it is on the roadmap or whatever.

Problem - in every job I've had, I've reached a point when I am not happy and fed up with the company/colleagues/procedures. I have reached this point now, even though I am only 7months in. Do I try finding something else or do I suck it up? If I try to find something else (similar wfh conditions and pay), shall stick to my niche finance system sepcialisation or go back to finance, where I have more options locally? My only problem with trying to find something else is that I was planning on trying for a baby soon-ish and do not now what will happen and when in terms of maternity etc.

Any perspective is much appreciated! Thanks.

1jqf29u,Automation and Robotics Engineering or Computer Engineering?,"Hi everyone,

I am an Italian-British student who recently completed a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.
I am currently considering enrolling in a master's program in Robotics and Automation Engineering, with the goal of moving to London after graduation to work in this field.

However, after researching on various forums, I’ve noticed that the automation and robotics sector in London may not offer as many opportunities as other fields. Additionally, if I were to switch to more traditional IT roles, a degree in Robotics and Automation might not be as credible as a degree in Computer Engineering.
I would like to ask those who have experience or work in the robotics field in London whether my perception is correct.

Alternatively, I am considering a master's degree in Computer Engineering, which would allow me to access more traditional IT roles, such as software engineer or machine learning engineer.

In your opinion, which would be the better choice for me? Is it worth pursuing robotics (which I enjoy more), or would it be more strategic to opt for Computer Engineering to have better job opportunities?

Thanks, everyone!

1jqd88r,What to do after pursuing after Law except law?,"Hi, I’m 23 (f), I have just finished my law degree. I’ve never had any interest in law but due to some circumstances I had to pursue law (BA-LLB). Now finally I’m done with it after pushing myself for 5 years. Since most of my dreams and career choices were crushed I don’t have a very strong ambition still I’m very hardworking. 
My senior who pursued law a year earlier did some BDA internships and landed a good job. After seeing her, I have two agendas on my list 1. Get self sustainable and stable income (I have no desire that I want this specific number of CTC or anything) 2. Hopefully work from home. 
My communication, leadership skills and creative skills are great. So if I want to pursue sales or Business development (if u have any other spaces I can explore, suggestions is what I’m here for) how do I go about it? If there are any courses I should try or any internships I should go for? 
Some might say law is good career option etc but I have given Law a fair chance but the people, environment and overall that option is not for me. 

TLDR- I’ve wasted 5 years of my life pursuing what I don’t like and don’t want as a lifetime career choice. I am open for all the suggestions and criticisms that come my way.

1. Social anxiety. Getting yelled at is not great for me.
2. I spend a lot of time on my computer so I know how that works a good bit.
3. Due to some health issues I get tired pretty easily, so it would be easiest for me.

1jqbbtw,Career Vs Relationship,"I'm (25F)  from Eastern Europe, a fresh medical graduate, and my boyfriend- soon to be fiance (30M) and I met at university when I was in my third year and he was in his fifth. Originally, we planned to move to the UK together since we both speak English fluently. However, given the struggles with the NHS, long wait times for jobs, and the uncertainty of training opportunities, we decided to pivot last year and consider Scandinavia (where hes from)  as a more stable option.

I’ve been working hard on the language and have reached a B1 level. But recently, I’ve started to look toward the United States, where the salaries for physicians are far higher than what we could earn in Scandinavia. I've brought this up with my boyfriend, but he seems content with the quality of life and salary in his home country and seems totally against the idea. To be honest, it frustrates me. I’ve sacrificed so much to get into medicine, and I come from a low-income background. The disparity in potential earnings between the US and Scandinavia feels discouraging (after residency US salaries are 5-10x higher) While my boyfriend’s salary is good now, I worry about the future. Will it be enough when we’re ready to buy a house and start a family? Will it be fair compensation for all our years of hard work?

In Scandinavia, there seems to be a certain satisfaction with mediocrity, where the expectations aren’t as high, and people are content with a comfortable but unambitious life. That’s not the mindset I’ve been used to, especially coming from a low income background. I was always pushed to be a high achiever, I want more than just “enough.” I want to challenge myself and see the rewards of that effort.

A few of my friends from older years have successfully made the leap to the US, and I can’t help but imagine myself later in life, watching them enjoy the fruits of their hard work while I’m here, pinching pennies. I don’t want to regret not taking that leap, or worse, resent my boyfriend for holding me back.

On the flip side, pursuing a career in the US would mean I’d have to dedicate at least two years to completing the USMLEs, doing research, and gaining US clinical experience. Then, there’s the three-year residency, during which we’ll likely hardly see each other. We’d also be delaying any plans for having children, so it could be another five years before we’re in a position to settle down.

Another complication is that I feel I’m slightly ahead of my boyfriend in terms of clinical and academic abilities. While I don’t mind that he brings other strengths to our relationship, I know that when it comes to the competitive match process, this could work against us.

I’m at a crossroads. I love him deeply, but pursuing this dream means leaving behind my family, my culture, and the language I’ve grown up with. I would be practicing medicine in a foreign language, which is a big change. But at the end of it, I want a well-paying job that reflects the immense sacrifices I’ve made. I don’t know if it’s even realistic for us to go down this path if I can convince him to join me in this challenge. Is it worth risking our relationship over? What if we invest all that time, money, and energy and still don’t match into a program?

 Being a woman i feel a bigger pressure to not focus on my career since the biological clock is ticking. Currently tbh im scared, Im overwhelmed and I wish i had family members in the field to guide me in the right direction but i dont so im hoping you guys would offer perspective.  
What would you do?

I work at a hotel, wont mention the brand to keep this post private. I’m a catering sales manager and we must achieve a certain quota to make our bonus. Each catering manager plus the director has different goals and market segments. I have the weddings, socials, and sports. My colleague has small corporate and socials like retirements. My Director pretty much does the large events like government, hospitals, some weddings 250+…..

So I started the company mid quarter 3 so my numbers didn’t really matter. Quarter 4 I fell short $7k….bummer! If I or the other manager don’t meet quota then my Director doesn’t get her bonus. Starting 2025, it was ridiculously slow. Seemed like a lot of hotels were hurting and my numbers were falling behind.


My Director met with me to discuss her concerns and she told me they were going to drop my quota to $100k so I could meet it! I wasn’t given a PIP just a talk but still felt like a failure! My self esteem dropped and was scared…. 
Well I met my quota and went 20% over.


She called me in to a private room to talk. First she congratulated then she hit me with the “the general manager and owners are questioning you…you’re on the radar” 

I was confused as I did meet my quota but she said my market like the weddings was hurting. She said the months of October November and December are immensely hurting! Lots of weekends on empty on the system. She asked me if I’m struggling. I told her the wedding market is dead and that’s the only market I have permission to touch. She then brought up the previous managers numbers who worked at the company 2 years ago and she said she always met her numbers and they were double mine. She then said she made 3x more the revenue I made. Well duh she’s a director and gets to take the big leads. The leads go through her and she always hands out the leftovers to us. I felt pretty bummed! I’ve done this job before and never struggled this much. I told her my market is so tough right now and everyone is on a budget. I told her I am trying but people don’t like the hotel or choose another place. She said I’m still on the radar despite meeting my quota because I’m
Not booking wedding for 2025! This convo felt like a comparison to the previous manager who by the she talked shit about her saying they always clashed. Who cares ? She’s not with us anymore…

1jq7eh6,Why did I get put on a PIP over a supposedly minor issue?,"My company has been struggling financially and of course they blame the marketing department. Over the last few months or so my boss has become EXTREMELY nitpicky to the point that she has been buying putting notebooks on my desk for me to attempt to take more notes (I do take notes already on my computer but she doesn’t seem to care or notice) I had my review in February and passed with an okay score, most areas were good. My lowest scoring area was worth 5% of my overall score. I received a 2.5/5. I was told that my notetaking skills were subpar and I was suggested to make improvements. Ok. So I started writing things down more. I had one instance where an event was missed because the importance was ever made clear and it was only brought up a single time. Plus the organizer made no effort to remind anyone. One week after this incident I get a PIP announcement with no HR present on the first day of the second quarter. Boss claims that it’s because I have poor notetaking and time management skills.  I did send a message to both my boss and HR trying to figure out how within one month of a favorable review except in one area that was only worth 10% of my employment is now a potentially (well, we all know what happens so pretty much confirmed) fireable offense. No where was it ever stated in writing that this was so important. I feel like my manager failed tbh. I did mess up a few times but I was always told “it’s okay. Nothing will happen” and now this??? Then she tells me in the same meeting that my company is about to introduce part time high school internships that can turn into “entry level positions” (which is what I was initially hired for 2 1/2 years ago)  

I was thinking of leaving anyways because the company was getting more and more toxic as the sales revenue went down. and luckily I have a few references of former employees and vendors. But seriously. What the heck went so wrong in one month that my 10% went to 100%? Something isn’t lining up unless you all can see something I’m not.

1jq6w14,Advice on Quitting,"I am needing some advice on leaving my job. I’ve never felt so stuck before. Backstory, I have worked remotely at this small family company for about 4 years now. It started out as helping here and there and wound up becoming more and more. I receive competitive pay, which is nice because I work hard. Here’s the problem…. It’s a family business like I said, the husband and wife are my bosses. I am long time friends with the husband, this is how I ended up doing this. They’ve always seemed to have constant disagreements and it does bleed into the work environment a lot. When they argue, they’re both in bad moods and treat me like I’m 5 years old, they are rude and very, very snippy. I would describe them both as unpredictable. The workload relies on me quite heavily, as it’s just us and contractors. Due to this workload, is why I’m really worried about me wanting to leave this position soon. 

A year ago, this would be something I would be able to talk to him about and say look, I’m wanting a change of pace and maybe get out of the remote work. This is not the case now. I thought of two options 
1) tell him that I’m feeling like it’s time for a change. I’ve been thinking about this for months and am pretty burnt out doing this work and in need for a change, so I wanted to let you know as a friend, so you can start looking for a replacement while I job search (this is what my brother suggested, I do not like this option)
2) wait until I have a confirmed position and give my notice. Con with this: they are going to freak out. My workload will be burdening them, and I can try to give a bit of a more extensive notice, but also I feel like it’s not my personal problem and this is needing to be dealt with as a professional business, even though they don’t treat things as professional. 

We are supposed to have a meeting about my workload in the next 1-2 weeks and I thought if I was going to say #1, it would be a good time to bring it up, however considering I got yelled at on the phone and hung up on yesterday, if that’s how I’m treated now before my notice, imagine how it’ll be once I give it to them. Also, I wanted to avoid #1 because I’m worried it might take me a while to find a job that is what I’m looking for and I will have to work in a passive aggressive environment for an extended period of time. 

Things between our friendship and work has always been very clear cut and kept separate but the way I keep being spoken to is so beyond unprofessional as an employer and disrespectful as a friend. The problem is, neither of them are self aware to how they speak, then they call everyone else a “baby”. I’m so anxious lately, the work aspect isn’t why I’m leaving but I feel so guilty dropping a bomb and I do NOT want to confront them in regards to their behavior. They are not in a position to reflect, it’s only deflect and defend in their minds, hence why I’m looking for a new job. 

Please help me, my mental health has been suffering at no one’s fault but my own for being a wussy and dealing with this far too long, then now it’s even harder to leave. I also don’t get benefits so that would be what I’m searching for in a new job too. What would you do in this situation? I don’t want to completely ruin the connection between us, but him and his wife both are going to feel cut to the core with betrayal. Thank you so much to each person that helps, I appreciate the input. If you couldn’t tell I am an introvert that is very non confrontational ",Ok_Willingness_8142,1,1.0,2,1743647045,2025-04-03 02:24:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jq6w14/advice_on_quitting/,4,2025
1jq6mr2,"Given my situation, trade school or college?","I’m 22M and currently finishing my first year of trade school as an electrical apprentice. I don’t mind it at all and quite enjoy it at times, but it wasn’t until recently when I began questioning if a degree could make more sense for me.

For a little background, I graduated from a college prep high school in 2021 with good grades and an even better SAT score. My dad has always been willing to pay for my college, but the idea of earning money and diving into a full time job out of high school seemed to intrigue me more as an 18 year old. Now given my very fortunate situation in which I wouldn’t have to pay my own tuition, as well as my relative academic success in HS, I feel somewhat of an obligation to earn a degree at some point.

While I know the electrical field can be lucrative and there are many things to like about it (especially in my state), I know that getting a degree can only help your case in just about any field. It just seems with everyone I ask, my friends in college say they wish they joined a trade, and my coworkers say they wish they went to college. Any thoughts from trade school grads and/or college grads? Especially looking to hear some pros and cons (obviously aside from the financial burden of 4-year college).

1jq66x2,Too exhausted from current job to make progress on job search,"I’m 25 and have been working at an agency for a bit over a year and a half. I’ve gotten pretty unlucky in that I’ve had four different directors during this time when nearly all of my peers from my hiring class are only on their second (more junior employees switch director teams once a year). Including when I started, this has meant I’ve had to become familiar with around 80 clients in such a short amount of time at this company. On top of this my latest director is a lateral hire and frankly not very competent and resists adjusting to the way that everyone else at this company does things. While I don’t personally care how he likes to do things, it makes a big difference to me because other teams don’t like working with him, and thus me as I’m the only one on his team, as a result.

The work-life balance at this place is also horrendous! It’s not very challenging but the hours can be quite demanding. It’s very normal to have to be working on something or at least responsive to emails and slack after 10PM or on weekends. I’m on call for special weekend projects once every 8 weeks and for two major holidays each year (I was on call for thanksgiving and MLK weekend). The job pays pretty well, so it’s to some degree what you sign up for.

Every day I feel defeated. I was extremely depressed by my dissatisfaction for a while but at least felt determined to get through it. Ever since I’ve decided that I need to try to leave I just don’t give a shit about anything though. I feel like I can barely drag myself out of bed everyday and am struggling to work a full week  in a row for the past month (I’ve taken vacation days and a sick day for no reason other than to avoid work), I can never bring myself to cook meals so I’m wasting a ton of money on ordering food, I have to pretend being ok constantly so that I’m not always a bummer for my girlfriend and friends, I just want to spend all of my time alone. I feel like all I want is for someone to tell me it’s ok to just say fuck it and quit out of nowhere, even though I know it’s not good advice.

I’ve been looking for jobs for around a month but Im having a hard time making progress when I’m so exhausted all the time and have so little time to myself to enjoy. Looking for any words of wisdom or out of the box ideas to help me get through this.

I’ve been working with other business units and supporting them while trying to wrangle various team members to stick to a process. 

I reached out to my boss and provided him with all the proof points of things that I’ve been doing. He asked me what my number was. I said I’d like to take the weekend to do my own research. He agreed to that. 

Then he called me later that day to push it again. I I reiterated that I’d like to take the weekend to discuss. 

He agreed moved onto another topic then mid conversation, he *not so casually* brought up how some of the members on our team purchased wedding gifts for me when I got married last year.

For background I purposely left my personal life separate from my work life in an effort to prevent something like this from happening. Someone on my team asked what my last name was going to be so I gave it to them and they found my registry online and shared it with multiple coworkers.)

1jq520q,Am I self sabotaging or am I settling?,"I was very lucky following my graduation and landed a job in a large bank in their compliance department and have been working this position for 2 years now. 

I am very unfulfilled and feel like I’m losing my spark. I’m inherently a creative person - I’ve always been curious, artistic, enjoyed reading, writing, etc and would have never envisioned myself in this sort of career. 

The problem is, I feel absolutely paralyzed in what my next move should be. I would love to leave my job for a more stimulating industry, but I did not grow up with money and the thought of losing what I have is terrifying.  Throughout high school and college, I found myself in some really financially tough situations that may have resulted in some trauma. My current salary (80k with a 10k bonus) leaves me very comfortable and honestly, sometimes I just cry out of disbelief because I can’t believe I have this sort of stability. I’ve already been promoted twice, and upon gaining an additional certification in the next year I will be promoted again. 

I should be happy and proud of myself, but I’m so disappointed with myself every time I think back to my younger self and the things that truly give me joy. I would say I have the passing thought to leave my job every other day at this rate. Sometimes, it’s daydreaming to go into journalism or broadcast reporting. I’ve even considered law school to be a prosecutor or investigator - some of my coworkers have encouraged me to consider this. 

Everything that potentially interests me either is incredibly hard to get into, pays very little, or both. Or, required hundreds and thousands of dollars of student loans. I can’t get past the idea that I’m being ungrateful for the amazing opportunity I landed in my current job but at the same time, I feel like I’m driving myself crazy and borderline depressed.  

Has anyone found themselves in a similar position where they’re asking themselves if leaving their current job is self sabotage, while staying feels like you’re settling and letting yourself down?

1jq4s9r,I stopped chasing the “perfect” job and everything changed,"For 5 years, I was stuck in career paralysis.  
Scrolling LinkedIn like it was Tinder.  
Applying, ghosted, quitting, starting over.  
Every job felt wrong. Nothing ever felt “me.”

Here’s what I finally realized:

I wasn’t looking for a job.  
I was looking for an identity.

Some fantasy version of myself where the title would validate me, the company would impress people, and the day-to-day would never be boring. I wanted my work to save me from the deeper questions I was avoiding:

* What do I actually value?
* What am I willing to suck at before I get good?
* Can I handle boredom, repetition, and ego death?

The answer, back then, was no.

I kept thinking clarity would come *before* action.  
But it came *after* I got real.

I chose a direction that was “good enough” and aligned with what I *actually* wanted long-term (freedom, impact, mastery).  
I treated the job like training, not salvation.  
I stopped expecting fulfillment from the work and started generating meaning from how I showed up.

Now I’m in a better role. Still not perfect. But my head’s clear. My confidence isn’t tied to my job title. And I’m finally building momentum instead of spiraling in analysis.

**If you’re stuck: stop trying to find the “right” job. Find the version of you who’s willing to commit.** That changes everything.

1jq4gc4,Salary Bait & Switch,"I've been with a company for several years and have been working really hard to move up. It's common knowledge that I am interested in a certain position, and every time this particular position has become available, I have been passed over by an external hire. Part of this is because I am extremely good in my current role and hard to replace, and part of this is because upper management doesn't like that I think for myself and ask questions. This is the case despite all of my peers asking why I'm not already in said position because I would be a great fit. 

Knowing all of this, my supervisor told me that there is going to be an opening for this kind of position and putting me in this position would benefit them. This is because  I am their best and most convenient option for it, and they know I've been looking for an opportunity at advancement.

This *particular* opportunity comes with some big catches. It has less attainable goals and less help, so this means higher than average work hours for me, and it's a much longer commute. That said, in order to get me to agree, my supervisor offered me a higher than average salary if I were interested. I later got scheduled with an official interview with upper management that didn't wind up going over the salary. After the interview, I was told that I got the job, and I said I was ready for it. After all of this, when the compensation conversation came back up, the amount that they were talking was *considerably* less than what I was originally offered prior to the interview. 

Based on my supervisor's history of overpromising and underdelivering, I should have totally expected something like this. I believe that this salary offer was completely disingenuous, and I'm afraid that if I make a stink about it now, or back out of the position, that it's going to make me look bad. 
It may even soil any future chances of promotions in the future.

1jq46t3,How I made 4 internships during College,"I started searching in my junior year, and I also landed my full-time job before graduating in 2025 May. I know how tough the full-time job & intern market is: many of my friends are still struggling to find jobs. We have similar BG, but I’m the only one who received the offers! I know I’m lucky, but I also know it’s because I prepared smarter and worked harder, I was still revising my resume during the winter holidays.I focused on maximizing the efficiency of three key steps in the job search process: resume, job search & apply, and interview prep.

Intern Searching & Applications:

Indeed & Linked In job postings are too competitive. A job posted just 1 day ago may already have 50+ applicants. Even after uploading your resume, many platforms still require manual input (I'm talking about you, Workday! How does this company still exist?) Diversified job application websites, I prefer Handshake over Indeed because it corporated with Universities, and many companies are directly linked to their official websites. ""Easy Apply"" on LinkedIn or Indeed might not be seen by recruiters. A more effective way to apply is by submitting your resume directly through the company’s website. You can google the company’s name and go to their careers page to find the position. I also consider the latest job postings from startups, which are generally more welcoming to new graduates (and often don’t post jobs on LinkedIn or Indeed). I followed many startup founders on LinkedIn, most of them like to post job openings directly on their pages.

Interview Preparation:

As a student who has student loan I couldn’t afford any career coaches. Mocking with college peers wasn’t helpful. They couldn’t provide valuable feedback, I need useful advice from industry professionals. Also, finding real interview questions was frustrating. I was tired of manually collecting them from Google.I checked past candidates' reviews on Glassdoor and combined them with AMA Interview's real interview question banks and predicted questions. This helped me better understand the interview process and potential questions for my target roles, allowing me to prepare a solid interview cheat sheet. After going through multiple interviews, I realized that many of the questions are quite similar, not only phone screens, behavior questions, but also technical stages and case study. I fully utilize their real time feedback to identify issues only face-to-face mock can detect, such as lack of eye contact, which can make me look less confident: something should be avoided in interviews.

Resume & Cover Letter:

ChatGPT is useful when I provide my resume and JDs and ask it to tailor my resume to the position. But I don’t know how well it’s actually revised. Still, where can I get feedback? Where can I get a cover letter that doesn’t sound overly AI but more human? I listed my relevant internship experience (company name, title, and what I had done, shown in STAR format), and gave ChatGPT the resume draft along with the job role, asking it to tailor the resume for the position. Then I gave the revised version to ChatGPT, asked for feedback on my resume’s suitability for the role, and revised it again and again… until it got the highest score. (Change the general role to a specific position if you want to tailor it for a specific company’s role.)

But still, remember, tools only improve your efficiency: they don’t replace real knowledge and hands-on experience!For students still in school, try to work on as many projects as possible in your area of interest and gain as many internships as you can. Real work experience will set you apart from other candidates! Hope everyone can make it through the internship & full-time job market successfully!",PiggyTheFloyd,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1743639274,2025-04-03 00:14:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jq46t3/how_i_made_4_internships_during_college/,4,2025

However, I am starting to feel as though I am overqualified, a little disinterested in my field, and about to pay way too much money to make almost nothing back (75k a year). I wanted to be a medical speech-language pathologist because it was the closest thing to honoring a past dream I had of becoming a doctor/PA.

1jq3khy,Did I commit workplace suicide?,"Team Setup.

Myself and 2 other coworkers are all on the same level (A,B,C - A being myself) and we have a supervisor. We added a lead which I'll introduce in a minute. All of us are remote. C barely being in the picture, only during weekly meetings. B and I had gotten close, not on a personal level but on a work level.

Back story:

The 4 of us were doing great, all had mutual respect and would teams one another all the time. Myself and B really had the blunt of the work for a while before we hired a lead. Constantly calling on teams, going over things, etc... B and I used to complain about work and how busy we were, typical water cooler chat. Super and I would joke around when on a call but nothing you wouldn't say to a cashier or a waiter or something. Very appropriate things.

Enter the Lead:

The lead starts and has contact with B a lot. I had never had a meeting with the new lead until this week (2 weeks after he started). B would give away that they (Super, Lead and B) would talk about me in teams calls. He wouldn't directly say they were but things he said made it more than obvious I was the topic of discussion. I quickly notice a little clique forming between the 3 and B starts acting way different towards me. Talking down to me, giving me praise in a condescending way and other ways of making me seem inferior to him.

Incident:

Since I noticed the change in tone towards me amongst the 3 I pretty much kept to myself. Today in our meeting, The super takes time out of the meeting to ask me about my personal life, and then made a joke about me using the bathroom all over myself. There is no history or story behind this comment, but C was curious and asked if there was. B started snickering which really pissed me off. Super, Lead, and B all laughed and thought this was funny, I was embarrassed and C was totally lost. I kept silent the rest of the meeting, and when we rapped up, Lead asked if I had anything to add or If I was still using the bathroom all over myself. Mind you, I had only had 1 or 2 short prior conversations with Lead before this meeting.

Kill shot:

I was so embarrassed by this that it was all I thought about while working - I was very distracted from work. I took my lunch break and came back and sent my boss a teams saying I didn't like what he said, I knew he meant no harm, but being made fun of by a supervisor in front of peers doesn't feel good. He immediately called me and apologized and I said I wasn't offended by the joke, but the fact that it was made to the group. If this joke was made in a 1 on 1 meeting I wouldn't have thought twice about it.

Aftermath:

Not long after this call, Lead calls me about some work to go over. He adds super to the call and we get this thing sorted out, then they start showering me with praise and are overly nice to me telling me how good of a job I'm doing etc... I was afraid this was going to happen but I think it's a natural byproduct of the incident.

Going Forward:

I really don't want to be known as the guy you have to walk on egg shells around. I wanted to let my supervisor know how his comment made me feel, and for that to be the last time this is ever brought up. I'm hoping by the beginning of next week this is all water under the bridge and everyone forgets about it. I do however want my supervisor to know I'm not someone who tolerates disrespect or being made a fool of. It felt like the jocks picking on the nerd type of situation. I really like the guy and truly don't think his intentions were to hurt my feelings, I just think they were to make Lead and B laugh which is my problem here.. All these guys are 20+ years older than me, so I understand giving me shit, but the nature of the joke is where I have a problem.

Am I wrong for any of this? I've never stuck up for myself before in an environment like this. How do I carry myself from here on out? I plan to mind my business and keep things work related or extremely light. I don't want to quit because I like the job, Super is a good guy, pay is good, etc..

Therefore i have ""open to work"" badge on my LinkedIn profile picture

And today, there's this profile, sending me connection request with a note, basically a job offer for entry level admin role

But the thing is, i can't really verify if it's legit or not

My concerns :

-She has verification badge, but offering a job through linkedin message for the job which is posted on indeed (see the picture)

-And is it common for a recruiter to ask for phone number to communicate instead of email?

1jq18lo,Moving cities early in career?,"Hi all, I (24M) am originally from the NY/NJ area and now live in Boston. I currently work a role in MEP engineering consulting and for the most part enjoy my job, just as much as I’d expect any young person to feel. 

When I first moved out here after my graduation in 2023, I had a few friends and a partner that all lived nearby and I would see them all a good amount. Over the last 2 years since I moved here, I have ended that relationship and every single one of my close friends has moved away to New York City. Now every single person that I am very close with lives there.

I’ll be honest, I have struggled quite a bit since the last of my friends moved away. The good thing is that my brother still lives in the area and I’ll get together with him from time to time, but he’s really the only person I hangout with. Recently I’ve been met with this extreme emptiness that is starting to eat away at me. I feel extremely introverted now and I don’t want to be. It’s not the type of person I am.

I really do enjoy my work and the people I work with and sometimes I even look forward to going. I’ve learned an insane amount about my field and am becoming extremely confident in my role. This is honestly a job that I don’t want to lose. And part of me feels like it’s too soon to jump ship. Especially for engineering. Hopefully someone reading this can understand that.

In my head, the way I see it is I want to stay here for a little while longer to get the full experience of seeing some projects all the way through their construction. That would mean 1-2 more years here at least. I would then like to move to NYC and be closer to my friends/home. But recently I’ve been having a hard time with this knowing I’ll continue this lonely life.

Right now my life consists of going to work, going to the gym after, coming home to make dinner and shower, and then I’ll usually play video games with my friends or watch a show. And that only happens when I’m not working overtime. If that’s the case then I go to bed right when I get home. On the weekends I’ll try to do one “big” thing whether that’s going out with my brother and his friends, seeing family close by, or sometimes I’ll try to do something for myself. Recently I decided to sign up for a half marathon and have been training for that, so that’s also taken up a good amount of time during the week/weekends.

Maybe I’m just young and this is a normal thing that a lot of people deal with. I honestly feel so lost in life right now. I get that I’m young and I know that one day I’ll figure it out, but I need to let my emotions out somewhere. I don’t want to put myself out there and try to meet a new partner because I don’t want to stay here long term. That’s the same with trying to meet new friends. I don’t know what to do and feel like I’m hitting a wall.

Does anyone have any advice? Should I just move as soon as I can? I’m worried I could be messing up my career as I feel like I’m in a really good place with that right now.

1jq16ts,"Permanent Job, or Temp that pays better?","Straightforward question.

I got a job that pays less than the other but may be better for my mental health. However, I think I  don't consider that worth the extent to which it pays less than another job I was offered.

The other job pays about $10,000 more a year but is a job that requires that I be selected as a permanent employee within a time frame of a year. It has a better job title in terms of spinning to move forward in my overall career trajectory, too.

I'm sorry if I seem dumb. But honestly I feel torn between these two because (maybe it's my personality) having something that is reliable matters to me and being dependable is a heavily weighted factor in choices I make in all aspects of my life. So some part of me feels I should choose a permanent role to be safe and then get another permanent position that's like the temp job (a forward career step with a year worth of either becoming permanent or using the experience to move somewhere else starting at around the 6 months mark).

I am on the beginning of my career trajectory honestly so I'm not sure if the experience of 6 months or 1 year would open up anything just by showing a background in a particular field or a similar position or one that easily leads to the next step of a particular trajectory. I basically want to have sane people evaluate whether I'm ""tripping"" or whether they'd choose the permanent job. I'm leaning no but I don't trust the idea of temp to hire because I haven't worked this way before and have always been a direct permanent employee.

1jq06nf,Stay or change career (feedback please)?,"Hi everyone, I would love some feedback. To start with i'm in the plastics industry under a company within PFA(Plastic Family Americas) as inside sales rep. i've been with them for 3 years on 4/4. Here is my dilema/s.

I haven't gotten a raise the entire time i've been here. I technically received a 3% cost of living raise about a year and a half ago, however inflation and other factories have made that 3% irrelevant, so i wouldn't consider that a raise tbh. Without going into specifics i make the bottom of the pay scale based off Glassdoor numbers. Also, my commute is far as hell, 1hr both ways. That's assuming there is no traffic and i drive the speed limit.

I've pulled my boss aside and explained to him how I believe there is no growth within the company and that I want to grow, he was quick to say there is growth within the company, and his demeanor and voice seemed to change, maybe he thought i was considering leaving?

Supposedly, he spoke to our regional boss about more training. That was 6+ months ago and nothing more came of that talk, i doubt he did.

On top of that we hired another body. Which i believe was COMPLETELY unnecessary, I could do what the new body does in half the time, and he has no sales experience, guess who is training him, me... which in the plastic industry it's by far harder to sell/learn plastic than the admin duties.

Before hiring this new person we were short handed, I kept nagging my boss to teach me to do further in-depth training in admin so I can take some stress off of him (I already know how to do basics of our admin side). He kept making the excuse that we need another body in here and for whatever reason I guess that justified not teaching me anything new to help him.

I want to be more of an asset here. However, based on my 3 years of experience, I honestly feel somewhat taken advantage of. During this time, i've been really inclined to move towards the finance industry. Both of my in-laws are in the finance world and said I should pursue it, they both think I would be cut out for it.

One of my in-laws wants me to join his credit union as a relationship officer, and the other wants me to join his investment team at JPMorgan

I'm really thinking about the relationship officer position due to the employer package & location. Everything is just better than what I currently am offered. However nothing is guaranteed, these jobs are just hypotheticals if I decided to pursue the career change.

I'd own the roadmap and prioritize what to work on in each area. The company is privately owned and a bit dated, and the team is looking for a tech transformation and adoption.

My dilemma is that, is it worth changing my job and moving to a new city based on this income, I am currently living in Atlanta, GA making $136300 and new job offer is in Houston, TX is offering $159000. It is for a similar role that I am currently working so my day to day tasks won't change much and both companies have a fairly similar career growth. The company in Houston is willing to cover all moving costs. My wife has a job in Atlanta and if I make the move she will have to find something in Houston, she is an Aerospace Engineer which we have been told that there are tons of opportunities for that in Houston area.

1jpy7nu,Should I find a new remote job?,"Current situation

27M working for a small recruiting company as the only IT support for our internal employees. I am expecting my first child in July. Unfortunately, I’m not passionate about IT, but its the only thing I can do that I’m familiar with, makes good money, and supports my expected work/life balance lifestyle.

Current job

Pros: 
-incredibly easy work/life balance
-very low stress
-very flexible
-everyone is really nice in the office
-a wage that pays fairly for the work expected of me (50k)
-there is a high chance i can move to remote work once my child is born

Cons:
-i dont expect any sort of pay increase, nor would I feel comfortable with asking for one, as I think the wage is fair.
-there’s no moving up in the company.
-the job is extremely boring (20 tickets or less a month) I spend most of my time trying to figure out what to do, which ends up being nothing. 
-to add on to the point above, I have done a lot for them, including a complete rehaul of their employee onboarding, with documents/videos/automation created. I have saved myself and our payroll departments thousands of hours of work. Since completing this in early February, this job has been a slog and so boring. Time moves so slow.
- I’m forced to be in office at the moment. It has its pros and cons, but right now, I don’t care to be in an office, nor will it help with my child being born later.

Being remote with this place is possible. I’ve mentioned it before and they said to bring it up again when the time gets closer. The issue then lies with money. 

I fear that a new remote IT job would require way too much attention but would pay me probably 20-25k more at least. I know the daily workload with my current place to confidently say that I can take care of my child and work at the same time. It really is that slow.

My partner is a grade school teacher so you know she doesn’t make a whole lot either. I just want us to be comfortable both financially and mentally. 

What would you do in this scenario? I feel stuck on this decision. I would hate to lose this very nice and comfy place, but I know it’s not helping me grow.",Own-Piano6984,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1743623976,2025-04-02 19:59:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jpy7nu/should_i_find_a_new_remote_job/,4,2025
1jpx802,Independent contract wording re: termination?,"I probably made a mistake with this, but at the time of signing this independent consulting contract I wasn’t expecting to receive any job offers in the near future.

My contract work officially “started” yesterday (but still haven’t been set up in their system to do the work), and I had signed the agreement over a week ago. On Monday I received a full time offer for a job I’m interested in, and due to potential conflict of interest I will be unable to overlap with the contract and full time job.

My contract SOW states 2 months or 250 hours in aggregate, and with the 2 month time frame my earliest start date for the full time job would be June 2nd, vs the April 21/early May start date they’re targeting.

The termination section in my agreement says that either party can terminate given that the other party has breached the obligations under the agreement and/or SOW, with 15 days written notice. The company can also terminate with or without cause with 15 day written notice, but there’s nothing stating that I am allowed to terminate the agreement.

Am I just out of luck with trying to get out early? If so, does anyone have any advice and/or think it would be possible for me to ask to frontload the hours to try to reach that 250 hours cap early? I initially said I didn’t want to work more than 30 hours a week, but now that I have this full time offer I don’t mind >=40 hours just to end this early.

It’s only 2 months which I understand is short, but I would love to start at this full time job sooner than later, as I’m worried they could rescind my offer or get upset with this delay.

This is my first time doing independent consulting (26F, this work is specifically related to my former employment), so there’s a good chance this is my fault for not thinking about that in the agreement wording. I’d prefer to not burn any bridges, they’re really desperate and are paying me a lot more than I expected to do this contract work.

I scored low in CAT, mainly due to lack of time and strategy, and then shifted my focus to MBA CET.

While preparing, my consistency broke down, and doubts started creeping in. The competition is intense—getting into a top college like JBIMS requires 99+ percentile, and realistically, I know my chances are slim. Tomorrow (April 3rd) is my MBA CET exam, and though I already have an idea of how it might go, I’m feeling completely lost about what to do next.

I don’t want to go into litigation, but as a law graduate, should I still do court internships to build basic legal experience or intrest or explore whether I like it or not ? Or should I try to enter the corporate sector directly? 

If you’ve been in a similar situation—especially as a first-gen law grad—I’d love to hear your advice. Should I try for a legal internship, corporate job, or explore something entirely different?

I had an interview with a company I’ve worked with a number of years ago (didn’t leave on bad terms), and in my interview with the GM, they told me they were offering me a position as a server, proceeded to ask me when I could start, and when i initially said I only wanted part time hours, they offered me full time if I was to give my notice at my other job- to which I complied. 
She proceeded to tell me that she was still doing interviews and would probably be holding a group orientation so we could all learn together, which makes sense. Before I left, the GM gave me her card, and told me to email with any questions I may have. 

3 days later I sent an email letting them know I was surprised with a 3 day trip out of town for my bday- but stated if that were to interfere with any training I will make arrangements as the job takes priority, while also expressing how excited I was to join the team.

I didn’t hear back.

A few days later (5 days after interview) I called the restaurant and spoke with the AGM who told me that the GM was still doing interviews and not to fret yet but he’ll let them know I called.

Hello!! Im an 18yo daycare worker and i have issues processing certain food items without getting a migraine. Because of this, i regularly buy food in bulk and share some with my coworkers because i buy so many. These items are grapes, oranges, and yogurt. 

I bought a bag of cotton candy grapes (my favorite) to share with my team and give some sweet support whole were down a staff member. For my lunches, ill usually have a few grapes, an orange, or a yogurt. Today my boss' mil came in and was just checking around, doing her due diligence to help the owner while shes out. I said hi, said theres some food in the break room she can take a few of, and went to go back to my work. A few minutes later i look up to tell her goodbye and i see the same bag in her hand. My first thought was ""oh cool, she likes the same grapes as i do."" And didnt think anything of it till my lunch time. I like to keep the yogurt and oranges for last as they last longer, so i went to grab some grapes for lunch and saw they were gone. The entire bag was gone and i checked the freezer,  our other fridge, the trash, everywhere and couldnt find them. So im assuming she took the bag as i had some an hour before she came in and no one else touched it.

Im not too upset thinking its a huge loss, i just feel kind of disrespected and like our items are now at a constant threat of being taken without word. This also means ill have to make another purchase for my lunch when i couldve gone another week with lunches each day. I want to bring it up to my boss and ask for either compensation or that she bring the bag back but, being 18 and my first time in a managerial position, i dont know how to professionally approach it.

Any help is useful, im just feeling kind of icky and very ""wtf"" about it. If she had asked, i wouldve said she can take a vine of the grapes, but the entire bag? Thats just weird.

1jpt55f,Should I reach out to a former work mentor who I ghosted during a really low point in my mental health?,"Two years ago, I chose to leave a job because of a really toxic boss and work environment. However, during that job, I made a connection with someone who, after I left, ended up becoming a huge work mentor and a very supportive figure in my life. She gave me some contract work, taught me a lot about the industry we were working in, and was just an incredibly steady, kind presence. She had also gone through some heavy mental health struggles herself, so there was a lot of empathy and understanding between us.

Unfortunately, while working with her, I ended up having what was essentially a nervous breakdown. A lot of really difficult things were going on in my personal life, and instead of communicating, I sort of just... disappeared. It wasn’t intentional or malicious — I just hit a wall and didn’t have the tools to handle it properly, plus, I was really embarrassed. I know she would have extended the same compassion she always had, especially knowing what she’d been through herself. But I didn’t say anything. And now, two years later, I still feel a lot of guilt and shame over how I handled it.

I think about her often. Not just because I regret ghosting her, but because I’m genuinely grateful. She made such a difference during a really turbulent time in my life. She inspired me professionally, and I truly admired the way she carried herself and supported others.

Lately, I’ve been feeling a strong urge to reach out — to say thank you, to apologize, and to take responsibility for how things ended. But part of me worries it’s selfish, like I’m just doing it to relieve my own guilt. I don’t even know if it’s appropriate, or if it would mean anything after so much time has passed.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Would you want to hear from someone who ghosted you under these circumstances? Or is it better to leave it in the past?

1jpqqyu,Private sector career w middle eastern studies background in UK,"I chose to study middle eastern history and Arabic and politics from BA to MSc. 
Then I learned at uni about post colonial studies and that my role as a white person in this field is structurally exploitative and racist.

I worked at an embassy in the Middle East as an Arabic speaking local staff member and was frustrated by how the diplomats who only spoke 2-3 European languages and had no knowledge of the history of the place were arrogant.
Through friends I was offered a job in an NGO in Europe doing finances for a project in the Middle East. It required knowledge of Arabic and the region to do comprehensive due diligence required for work in a sanctioned region. 
As it was an NGO with little funding I had no support to learn accounting and just winged it for a while.

I went to work in an NGO finance role without regional focus and now I lost the Middle East component (which I loved) and am stuck doing finances which I’m still not really qualified for.

I’m trying to apply for finance graduate roles to properly learn accounting and also leave the NGO sector that feels cursed and like it’s going to tank soon given the funding cuts to it around the world.

I wonder if there is another private sector job in the UK that has chances of better pay, where I could use Arabic, maybe travel to the region sometimes.

Or if I should requalify? But in what?

I’d love “smth creative” or UX design but that feels like the most common misconception of office workers I think, that they’d be suited for ux design because they like aesthetic stuff.

“This initiative aims to bring greater clarity and alignment to our roles, ensuring that job titles and job descriptions accurately reflect both internal and external perspectives. The project will drive improvements in career paths, performance management, and other talent management initiatives.

These changes align with externally common job titles and the scope of your current work. Leaders and employees will continue to have discretionary decisions on the use of business card titles.

My United Kingdom civil engineering company is closing in two months and I have to find a new job. I am currently a CAD technician / Trainee Engineer and qualified to HND / 2nd year of university level and I will be topping up to a BEng in the next few years.

There are a few options for me including:

* GIS Technician - £6000 payrise
* Trainee Site Engineer (Contractor) Salary unknown
* CAD Technician (Consultant) Salary not known but likely similar

If I took the GIS technician role for the higher pay would I still be able to transfer back to being a Civil Engineer/Structural Engineer in the future or would this put me down the route of surveying?",Munchboii,1,1.0,0,1743604573,2025-04-02 14:36:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jpq4z4/civil_engineering_which_job_to_take/,4,2025

1jpncdv,"Should I resign or not? This is my first job, and I haven’t even been with the company for two months.","I, F 21 years old and employed at one of the well-known car dealerships here in the Philippines. This is my first job, and I’ve been working here for about a month now. Lately, I’ve been thinking of resigning because it has been affecting my mental health. It has gotten worse to the point where I don’t feel alive anymore.

For context, I interned at this company for almost six months. Eventually, I was absorbed and accepted the job offer. I was initially compensated at minimum wage. I actually like my job and what I do. I take pride in my work and put a lot of effort into producing quality output. However, the reason I’m conflicted about staying is the work environment.

My officemate, who is in the same department as me, constantly complains about her job, repeatedly saying that she’s the only one doing all the work. Her daily rants have started to affect me to the point that I second-guess myself, wondering if I’m really contributing to the team. I often go home feeling like I didn’t do enough, which eventually affects the quality of my work.

On top of that, she constantly takes credit for my work. Since I was an intern, she has always insisted that I give her my output so she can get it approved. As a result, people in our office think she’s the one doing the work, and she never corrects them.
I try not to let her words and actions get under my skin, but the constant rants and how she excludes me from everything—as if I don’t exist in the office—really upset me. Now, I’m torn between resigning, even though I’m still new, or enduring the situation.

1jpit5j,Should I ask for a raise given my condition?,"TLDR: Working as a software engineer with a speech impediment so I only communicate by writing. I ger praise for my work but have been getting fewer projects as of late due to my communication. Been stuck at the same position and pay for close to 2 years and not sure if i should ask for a raise. 

I'm a Senior software engineer working for a company in Dubai. I've been here for over 4 years now and got 2 promotions within the first 3 years. 

- SDE1 -> SDE2 in 1.5 years with a 20% raise
- SDE2 -> SDE3 (senior) in around 14 months with a 25% raise. 

Both times i didn't ask for it but got the promotion anyways since my manager rooted for my work. I got the 2nd promotion earlier than some of the people hired around the same time as me due to some of the major projects I worked on before that.
Since then it's been almost 2 years now with no raise or promotion. My salary is around 100k$ Tax free which is a pretty good number for this country, but with the increasing rents and cost of everything, i feel like I'm making less and less every year.

The thing is, i have a severe speech impediment (stammer) which makes it v hard for me to communicate verbally or on calls. It also made it really hard for me to find a job but eventually the TL here gave me a chance. I mostly communicate through messages, even on calls, and write extensive documents for any new feature or system I'm working on. We work in a hybrid setting so most communication is already on channels so it works fine enough.

For the first 2-3 years, i contributed to a few different projects and even led some solo core internal projects which led to my promotions. I have a v good understanding of our product and its monolith codebase, But the expectation at this level (SDE3) is to have a squad/product of your own and to be leading some junior devs. Due to my impediment, I'm still working solo on most stuff, while others in my position, or even juniors are leading their own squads. 

I also dont usually get newer or bigger projects anymore since we're a big company directly interacting with customers and a lot of stakeholders, so planning and system designs etc require a lot of meetings so things just don't get assigned to me. I can see that some PMs also hesitate to work with me. Whatever does get assigned gets completed from my side pretty effortlessly and i always get praise for my work. But I can see that I'm mostly just getting smaller and smaller features of support issues now compared to some of the other colleages who're leading their own projects and teams. 

I see that I don't provide as much value as others in my position anymore due to my condition. My WLB is also really great here and sometimes i work less than 10-15 hours a week when the load is low. I'm also making a good salary where I'm saving almost 50% every month. So I'm not sure if I should be asking for a raise now, but at the same time it feels like I'm making less due to no increments over 2 years. It's also really hard for me to find a new job as I'm understandably not very great at interviews and I can't afford to lose this job because of responsibilitoes. Should I talk to my leads about it when i have less accomplishments under my belt than some of my colleagues, Or just continue like it is going now?

1jphrut,Disappointed,"So, I work for a multinational firm that is practically owned by a single family (they own about 80% of the stocks) and they kinda operate as a massive (10k+ employees) family business.

Now, there aren't too many opportunities in my field in my country and I wanted to try things out here one more time (I was abroad 2018-2022) so they were pretty much my only shot. I started working in their R&D and then transitioned over to an industry role.

That role ended up being significantly bigger than what was advertised to me, includes a lot of international travel, long hours and significant responsibilities - basically a complete role-salary mismatch by a long shot. However, I like it because of how amazing my supervisor is. He's extremely supportive, insanely intelligent with a business sense I've never encountered before - I feel pride and joy in working for him.

Now, the central reason why I was hired would be to manage a multimillion investment, literally building it from the ground up. That investment was my supervisor's idea and vision. He'd put a lot of work in to make this real for almost 8 years now, both from a technical and business standpoint. Ever since I started this role we did a tremendous amount of work, highlighting the true moneymaking potential of this investment and managed to persuade the board to proceed (we are talking tens of millions in profit per year). We completed all the technoeconomical studies, feasibilities, suppliers, you name it. During this time my supervisor has engrained his vision in me, explaining to me the why's and how's to the point where today I have pretty much substituted him in all meetings and he only has to worry about the steering committee.

And here comes the bomb.

I was informed that now that the study is complete, they are transferring running the business unit to another department, they are also moving me to that department and my supervisor is getting kicked out of this project entirely. They also completely disregarded our location assessment and decided to make the investment in the worst possible location just to ""please friends"", losing millions due to increased OPEX (still quite profitable though).

When I started here I felt great pride in the company and the work we did. Now I feel pure disgust. They literally took my supervisor's vision away from him, gave it to a completely unrelated department and basically had him train me so that he'd no longer be needed n the future. I feel completely disheartened and lost all trust in the organisation.

While this move opens me up for a promotion the entire thing goes completely against my code of conduct and ethos. I no longer want to work for these people while they may very well also do the same thing to me. But, I've not even been a year in and I worry it'll look bad in my CV if I job hop again. At the same time the company's paid for a bootcamp for me which is not only useful to the role but also makes me extremely employable to open new markets. But if I leave in the next two years I'll need to pay them all the money back.

Personally I want to say f it and leave the moment I complete a year in (which is quite soon) but I wanted to hear your thoughts on this.

I recently received a job offer for a bank teller position. I haven't signed the contract yet. I graduated last year, but I already have work experience while studying in another industry (BPO) for one year as a Customer Service Representative and another year as a Team Lead. 

The HR representative confirmed in my initial interview if I was okay with the starting salary (₱16,000). I don’t know what came over me, but I just said yes, thinking it wasn’t possible to negotiate since my previous job wasn’t in banking. Their entry-level pay is much lower than my previous basic as a CSR and as a Team Lead. I really wanted this job since it will be my stepping stone to start a banking career and given that they offer a lot of benefits. 

However, since I haven’t signed the contract yet, just wondering is it still possible for me to negotiate? I’m really unsure if I can, considering my previous experience isn’t in banking.

I had other opportunities that were lined up, but they never panned through. I'm trying again with another company that I applied to, Northrop Grumman. I have a referral from a friend within the company and I was able to contact a recruiter who afterward reached out to me wanting me to fill out a questionnaire. I'm looking to find a job that has more stability and not having to trade a lot of my life to my current role. This startup job os not for me. And with how demanding the job is, it's just not a great fit. What should I do? If I get the interview, how do I explain my reason to wanting to leave?

1jpfzq6,How to get started?,"Hi, this is going to be a little bit of a ramble.

I’m 25 and have never worked a full time job, not for lack of trying, just from living at home and paying minimal rent. I’ve been working 25-30 hours a week at my current job. I’m highly motivated and a good worker and proud of it. 

I’m trying to burst into an industry right now and have been actively applying, calling, emailing people for a year and a half to get a gig to no avail. 2 jobs have gotten back to me in that time. I feel like the only way you can get a job right now is to have someone on the inside. 

I have done some college, but no degree, and I have a background and experience in communications, social media management, copywriting, graphic design and character art and I’m trying to figure out my next step. Everyone keeps point me towards freelance but I’m terrified of trying to pay the bills while I’m getting started.

My biggest fear is never making more than 30k. 

I’ve been networking, greasing palms, meeting people as much as I can, but everyone just says “nice to meet you, I have no work for you” 

Any advice? I’ll take anything. Currently just trying to find any full time retail work until I can actually get my foot in the door. ",CandidConversation71,1,1.0,0,1743566985,2025-04-02 04:09:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jpfzq6/how_to_get_started/,4,2025
1jperid,I have terrible habits that are affecting my work performance.,"Hi everyone,

I work in sales and I have an extremely bad habit of cancelling and rescheduling meetings. 

I know there are no excuses for this, ESPECIALLY if my career involves prospecting and gaining clients. I also know that this is unprofessional, rude and straight-up NOT A GOOD LOOK. 

I struggle with mental illness that leaves me feeling exhausted and so afraid of failure. This gives me so much anxiety that I often feel scared to get out there and make connections. 

I've decided to crush this pattern of flakiness and improve so I can meet expectations and be more reliable, but I feel so guilty for being this type of person in the first place. I'm grateful that I still have my job and I'm currently working on a list of ways I can overcome these habits. But I'm curious if anyone here has tips.

How do you suck it up and do better?",Vivid_Instruction_68,30,0.7699999809265137,27,1743562983,2025-04-02 03:03:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jperid/i_have_terrible_habits_that_are_affecting_my_work/,4,2025
1jpe7m2,What jobs can I get with experience building a successful YouTube channel?,"I graduated from college a couple years back with a bachelors in Computer Science. I decided to not go into my field of study as after a couple internships, I didn’t quite enjoy the work, and had a YouTube channel that was growing well. I’ve been building it for 4 years, and learned a lot of skills, such as content ideation, video editing, working with sponsors, etc.

I’ve gotten hundreds of thousands of subscribers with 50+ million views, so I have a good resume to show for it. 

Despite this, I’ve had many stressful months through the years, and I’d rather have a steady job with a guaranteed pay, although I don’t know which type of jobs I’d have a good shot of getting with this experience.

I've got an engineering degree (mechanical) and an MBA, plus a bunch of technical certifications. I've had some inquiries from recruiters about Program Manager positions, Head of Quality Engineering type jobs in commercial aviation/space flight, but I'm not sure what other titles I should be looking at.

1jpcyw0,provincial job gone bizarre?,"I interviewed and applied for a job for my provinces local hospital. The very next day I was called and asked for 2 references. I sent them in a document by email (2 current co workers used) the next day i got a call and was told one had to be a current workplace reference I wasn’t told this prior, and was the first I heard) I expressed my concerns over my worry of it causing a hostile work environment, but said if it was mandatory I’d provide the information. 

I provided my office managers information after disclosing the need for this current workplace reference asked that this could be kept confidential and that this hiring manager would be contacting them. She agreed to keep it confidential and that she understood that this could potentially be a better position for me and that everyone needs to do what’s best for them. 

The hiring manager contacted my current office manager March 20th towards the end of the day and missed the call, I was told the hiring manager left a VM. Monday the 24th or march rolls around and my office manager asks if i’m available to talk via phone as i have the day off. I take the call right away and she advises me she isn’t able to keep this confidential anymore as she has now received the phone call and is required to tell my boss (the owner of the pratice) about the need for current workplace reference. I tell her I understand and to go ahead if she must. I also speak with my boss (the owner) this day. I get a text later this day from my office manager saying we need to talk again after she has spoken with my boss. She isn’t available till Tuesday the 25th after work.. 

She tells me during this call that she has spoken to the hiring manager and has asked for clarification on who needs to give me the current workplace reference and was advised that it can be my actual boss. She explains now she isn’t comfortable giving me a current workplace reference cause in her 30 years of being an office manager she hasn’t ever given a reference for someone currently employed and feels like it’s a conflict of interest (even though my boss now fully knows) she advises me I need to ask my boss. 

I call the hiring manager right away, who then tells me my office manager was very upset during their call and she was still trying to obtain a current workplace reference.. 

I try and get a hold of my boss immediately..shortly after on the same day, the 25th of March he informs all my co workers in a group chat he won’t be in Wednesday the 26th due to issue with his wife’s health and dogs health. He is unreachable this evening because of this. 



It’s now wednesday the 26th.. I send him a message stating I hope things are ok ect ect and advise him in the text if he could spare a minute to call the hiring manager the issue is time sensitive and she is trying to obtain a current workplace reference. He tells me a few hours later he will call right away. He has now spoken to the hiring manager on the 26th.

Thursday the 27th I follow up and am told that my application is with HR and I should hear something Friday March 28th or Monday March 31.

I don’t hear anything and follow up via email today April 1st. I get an email back shortly after saying “I am writing to inform you,  an alternate applicant has been selected and accepted this position.”

Now, I’m super caught off guard. Prior to her calling my current workplace reference she called me and wanted to tell me how great my interview went, she told me i blew the interview out of the water and stood out against all other candidates and wanted to give me a job offer ASAP.. she wanted me to know this and was calling to make sure I was considering the position highly prior to her calling my current workpalce reference because she didn’t want to create any issues if it wasn’t something I wanted to continue with for sure. I should also mention she contacted my co worker reference right after this call and got a great reference. 

I’m so caught off guard. This position is with a provincial health authority. I was told by multiple people when they call your current workplace reference it’s basically a done deal. I’ve put myself (and they clearly know it as they acknowledged if i was for sure wanting them to call prior) in a very awkward position with my current workplace hoping that it would definitely turn into a job offer for it to completely somehow backfire and then for them to tell me they gave the job to someone else! Zero explanation, I honestly feel so lead on,  gas lit.. and confused as to where my application went wrong. 

Does this time line seem long? I realize there was a bit of a delay from her initial call to my office manager on the 21st of March till the hiring manager was actually able to get a real current workplace reference on the 26th but she clearly heard how difficult my workplace was being when my current office manager gave her such a hard time and refused to give the reference herself when she called her back to check to see if it was required of her or if my boss could do it.. The hiring manager did ar one point tell me HR was wanting her to wrap this up, but I wasn’t at any point told they were considering other candidates because of this or that someone else was now being considered ect. Maybe they didn’t need to tell me that info, i’m sure they didn’t.. but why was i lead on to believe i was top candidate, they wanted to give me an offer asap ect.. then told they gave it to someone else after I’ve done everything they’ve asked including putting myself out there with my current work in order to get the current workplace reference. Now i’ve burned a bridge with my current workplace.. with not even the option this current position. 

Does anyone have any advice? I was SHOCKED and extremely caught off guard based on how they expressed their interest in me. I’d also like to state i’ve worked at my job for my entire career, 10 years.. there isn’t anything bad they could have said for the current workplace reference as I thought of that too. I’ve never had any issues with my job. 

Someone offer advice. I’m super upset and don’t know where to go from here. It seems like no matter what I do now, they have offered the position to someone else and they’ve accepted.

Is this normal? If anyone knows how I should handle this i’d appreciate it. 

Please be nice, I took a leap of faith here as this position would have offered me benefits my current office could never such as a pension and union. 

If there is a better spot to post for advice please to let me know. ",Anonymous1990287,2,1.0,0,1743558164,2025-04-02 01:42:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jpcyw0/provincial_job_gone_bizarre/,4,2025

1jpckzr,How I survived the toughest job market as an international student,"I landed a full-time job and got 2 internships before graduating in May. That’s the result of 2,300+ applications for both internship and full-time positions. As an international student I can't tell how many rejections were because of sponsorship or my qualifications. I want to share my experience as a reference for other international students. I was extremely anxious and goal-less, but finally, I made it. I just want you to know, the journey is long and tough. If you decide not to give up, just hang in there and keep going, you’re not alone.

I started looking for an internship during the summer holiday of my senior year. There was only one year left before graduation, and I had no internship experience, only two projects with professors and an average GPA. I also had no idea about the job market situation. I didn’t even have a LinkedIn account. I had to Google where to apply for internships and full-time jobs. I didn’t know interviews usually have 3 or 4 rounds. Worst of all, I had no idea what my future career path would be (at that point, I started reflecting on what I had been doing in college 😅).

In the first several months, my resume was a complete mess. I didn’t know I needed to tailor my resume to the job roles I was applying for. My resume had no keywords, wasn’t written in STAR format, and included both related and unrelated experiences for the positions. I used these shitty resumes to apply for about 200 jobs on Indeed, then started using Handshake as well. I applied to about 600 jobs in total, but the result was clear: 0 replies, not even one rejection letter.

In the following 3 months, I realized my problems. I built 3 versions of my resume targeted at 3 different areas using ChatGPT. I started receiving interview invitations, but I could barely pass the phone screen or the second round. I began using AMA Interview to help me predict interview questions and practice mock interviews based on the different interview stages. I gradually realized that different job roles have different focuses. I started making 6 versions of my resume for the 6 roles I was focusing on and also began preparing structured answers for phone screens and behavioral questions. During this period, I landed my first internship through Handshake. I finally had some work experience I could put on my resume.  
The first one is always the hardest. It took me almost 6 months. From there, my internship search became smoother. I received my second internship while still doing my first one. I got several referrals from alumni and even final round interview invitations, but I was rejected by all. There was nothing I could do but accept the reality that students who require sponsorship are always the last candidates they consider. Still, these 2 internships gave me valuable working experience of real-world problems. I continued practicing mock interviews and felt more confident in the process. When I was stuck in job searching and anxious about the future, I received a full-time return offer from my second internships.

The full-time job took me over 2300 applications, hundreds of sleepless nights, and a bit of luck. I truly cherish this opportunity and hope to see a better version of myself in the future. To the millions of international students out there, please don’t give up.

1jpc1zi,Transitioning from Brokerage to Corporate Real Estate – Cold Messaging on LinkedIn?,"Howdy – I’m a 27M currently in the middle of a career pivot and wanted to get some insight from folks already in the corporate/commercial real estate world.

I started in re brokerage back in 2019, and I’ve been working full-time as an agent since then. In January 2024, I decided to go back to school to finish my degree and I’m on track to graduate in May 2026 with a focus on real estate.

I’ve been trying to break into the corporate side of the industry – ideally roles like acquisitions, asset management, valuation, or anything on the finance/analyst side. I’ve been targeting about major real estate/ investment firms and messaging professionals who accept my LinkedIn connection requests to ask for informational interviews or quick coffee chats.

One thing I’m wondering: for those of you already in these roles – is it weird when someone who cold-messaged you on LinkedIn ends up getting hired and you run into them at the office? Did they say anything or was it awkward? Did they bring up the fact that you didn't respond?

Also still trying to get an internship for this summer so if you have any advice on that or any tips for making cold LinkedIn messages more effective, I’m all ears. lol 

Appreciate any advice or stories. Trying to be thoughtful about how I’m networking and breaking into the space.

1jpbap6,Looking for a new job but feel stuck.. feel as though I’m very limited with my graphic design degree,"I’m currently looking for a new job, and we all know how difficult that is in the current U.S. job market. With competition being higher than ever, it’s way less likely to be hired, of course. Because of this, employers are taking less risks on individuals with no to little experience and would rather hire someone who already has years of experience to show.

With that being said, it’s extremely difficult for me to land any sort of job right now. I’m looking for graphic design because that’s what I have my degree in and that’s what I truly love to do. However, any ‘artsy’ career is the most difficult to break into right now. As I’m desperate to leave my current role as an admin assistant, I’m trying not to limit myself just to graphic design. But I don’t know what else to apply for/what else I’m qualified for?

I’m looking at marketing, merchandising, planning, and buying positions, but a lot of these jobs are also oversaturated and are looking for experience. I clearly don’t have experience which makes me feel hopeless that I will have a chance at any of these jobs. But I genuinely have no interest in other industries, plus I am pretty limited with my degree being in just graphic design (well, I also have a minor in business administration if that counts for anything). 

My question is, will an employer really give me a chance without experience? Unless anyone can give me some other ideas of what to apply to, I’m pretty set on applying to the above types of roles. I just don’t know what the odds are of actually getting in :/

TLDR: I’d like to get a new job ideally in graphic design (as that’s what i studied), but my fallbacks are marketing, merchandising, buying, planning, etc. What are my chances of getting one of those jobs without any experience? Am I completely screwed? 🥲",Fabulous-Barbie-6153,1,1.0,1,1743553216,2025-04-02 00:20:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jpbap6/looking_for_a_new_job_but_feel_stuck_feel_as/,4,2025

1jpay0r,Should I rush into a ‘real’ career.,"I (22M) graduated University nearly a year ago with a BA Hons Graphic Design. I currently work for a well renowned hospitality company. I enjoy my job for the most part and have been there for nearly 3.4 years, gradually progressing into management.

I don’t quite know what I want to do for a ‘proper’ job. I’m not necessarily set on becoming a graphic designer and I think there’s only so much more I can take of the working hours within the hospitality industry.

I’ve never been quite so unsure of what I want and I’m faced with so many options that I feel pressured to rush into choosing one immediately.

1jpaco4,Leaving a job where you're comfortable for one that pays better but don't vibe as well with?,"Hi all, I come seeking reddit's wisdom. I recently (as in, last week) started a new job. $20 an hour and the commute is about 50 minutes one way. I really enjoy the environment, the workload isn't terribly heavy, there are ample opportunities for advancement, and the other people in my office (of which there are only 2 - soon to be 3) are very easy going, are around my age, and I get along really well with them. They're people I feel like I could be friends with outside of work. After my last job this has been great, because in my previous role I just generally felt awkward and micromanaged by my supervisor and there was no personal connection with the folks I worked with.

The problem I'm facing is that I just got offered another job on Monday for a company that's a 5 minute commute, pays $2 more an hour, and has slightly better benefits. The only problem is when I went in for the in-person interview I just felt like I didn't really vibe with them. The people I met, both for the interview and during the office tour, were much older, very quiet and reserved, and I just generally felt a little awkward. The workload at that job would be a bit higher as well, which I'm not opposed to, but after getting ground down at my last job to the point of burnout I'm really liking the workload of the job I just started at because it allows me some room to breathe.

But I feel like I'm in a bind - do I take the higher paying job that's closer to home at the expense of my comfort? Or do I keep the job where I feel comfortable but get paid a little less and have to travel further?

My fiance thinks I should take the job that's closer to home, 1) because it pays more, and 2) because it's in our town and would allow me to help him get to and from work (we're a 1 car family currently and with me working so far away he's had to start trekking 40 minutes each way on foot to get to and from his job). But I would hate to leave a job I like and am comfy at for something where I might end up feeling tense and awkward all day long - I dealt with that enough at my last job and don't want to return to that kind of environment. I am really stuck on this decision and only have until tomorrow to decide.

Anyone found themselves in a similar situation? What did you decide to do? How did you justify your decision to stay or leave? Did it work out for you in the end (as in, did you end up feeling comfortable and enjoying your work, or did you regret leaving the job you felt more comfortable in?) Any anecdotes are appreciated.

1jp8cm9,My boss is having me interview my close friend’s replacement before he fires him. Is this normal?,"Hi all, I need some advice.

I work on a small five person team at a company of 100 people. My boss (who I will call “Hugo”)—is very intense— but he considers me to be the top performer on my team of 7. Go me I guess.

Hugo also knows I am close work friends with Joe, a team member he considers to be “average.” We get lunch every day and Hugo always comments how Joe and I are such good friends.

Today Hugo pulled me into his office saying he wants to replace Joe with someone and wants me to interview the leading candidate tomorrow . I asked if Joe was a bad employee and Hugo said “no he’s average and improving, but I want to fire him and replace him with someone better.” I also was told not to tell Joe or anyone else that we are interviewing someone behind his back because our team is small and all pretty good friends at work.

I feel really awful doing this behind Joe’s back, especially since he just moved to a new house and had moved across the country for this job 2 years ago. 

Is this a typical thing that happens? I feel like this is very toxic and manipulative but I can’t decide if I am overreacting.

1jp827e,Should i resign from my position?,"Hello. In June my company is conducting RTO. I am not planning on cooperating with this, as I am on the other side of the country. This company is failing, constant layoffs and losing headcount. I was also told that under no circumstances is my company going to offer unemployment or any benefits as a result of failing to comply with RTO. They are taking it as “a resignation.”

To be honest, I am done working here. I am done dealing with the people, the constant toxicity of my coworkers, the work. It all means nothing to me. To be honest i don’t even do work anymore, I just kinda apply to new jobs. I am mentally burned out, my job makes me hate my life, and frankly I am ready to move on. 

My girlfriend’s parents are letting us live at their place rent free, and in 2 months I will no longer have this lease. My landlord is letting me upfront the 2 months rent and leave early. I have a decent savings account ($14-15k), so without rent I can live a bit without a paycheck. Absolutely worse case, if it take me a year longer to find a job, I’ll just work part time to pay my credit card/student loan bills.

I’m wondering if I should just resign and move on from this company? I will get paid on April and May 15th, and honestly I am okay sacrificing my May paycheck. Again, June 2nd they are letting me go and acting as if I resigned to not give me unemployment. It happened with managers when their RTO happened back in February.

Is this a sound decision?

1jp7q0u,"I built mission-critical software for my family’s company, but they severely underpay me. Not sure what to do next.","Hey everyone,
I’d really appreciate some perspective on this, especially from people who’ve been in similar shoes or can offer real, experience-based advice. Not just “talk to them”—I’ve done that.

I’m a self-taught software developer with a strong background in building AI-powered tools. I specialize in developing full-stack software quickly using tools like Bolt, Lovable, Cursor, etc. About a year ago, I tried to launch a startup in the construction tech space. It went well in some ways—I got into an incubator, built the product, got some validation—but it hasn’t fully taken off yet.

Due to financial strain, my fiancée and I moved back in with my parents. My dad runs a small construction company, and as we started talking more about his business, I realized how broken and paper-heavy their processes were. Most construction software is expensive and doesn’t fit the very fragmented nature of the industry unless you overhaul your entire workflow. So I stepped in and started building them a custom software solution.

Since then, I’ve made a ton of progress:
-Took the company 50% paperless in just a few months
-Built internal tools that are now mission-critical
-The team uses my software daily, and they constantly tell me how much it’s improved their workflow

But here’s the problem: I’m barely getting paid. Like, embarrassingly low. It’s not even close to market value for a dev, let alone someone who’s built core business infrastructure. I’ve told my dad I can’t keep doing this forever without fair compensation, especially with marriage, housing, and future family plans coming up. But nothing changes. I feel stuck. I live under their roof. It’s awkward to push too hard, but it’s also unsustainable to keep going like this.

What makes this more frustrating is that everyone else at the company sees the value. My dad just doesn’t. Or maybe he does and chooses to ignore it. I’m trying not to assume the worst, but I’m reaching a breaking point.

I’m not looking for people to just say, “Talk to your dad.” I want deeper advice. First-principles thinking. Experience. Strategy. What would you do if you were in my shoes? How do I navigate this without blowing up the relationship or living situation but still stand up for myself?

Thanks in advance.

1jp7jqk,Cancer vs productivity metrics,"I’ve found myself in the worst possible situation imaginable. I have an advanced type of cancer that has now spread throughout my body. This process has been going on for a year and a half and my job is aware of this. 

With the doctors appts, feeling incredibly sick, going through radiation, a recent trip to the ER due to extenuating symptoms, and being exhausted, my productivity at work has suffered. They use a power BI tool that measures your productivity and they expect 100% every single month. I’m currently at 71% for the year. Our year starts in February, where I was at 60% because I was so dizzy and felt so sick I could barely work. This month I did better but I also found it had spread this month and have been working on getting a second opinion from a better doctor. 

My boss has now sent 2 emails highlighting how poor my numbers are and I can tell I’m reaching the end of their patience with me. They are putting on strong pressure for me to fix my productivity even though I’m 270% to goal. They don’t care about anything other than my number being 100%. I’m scared I’ll lose my job. I have no PTO left due to multiple surgeries last year and all of the doctors visits. I support myself (no spouse, no kids) and cannot afford to take short term leave as it’s only 60% of my pay which will not cover my bills. The insurance at this company is better than most large corporations and I really need to keep it. 

Can anyone please suggest ways to protect my position, things I might say to my bosses or HR, tools you use to make it easier to get activities into your CRM, better handling a calendar, or anything else you can think of that might help me save my job?

1jp785f,Commit to the grind vs relaxing in life,"Hi all, 26M living in NYC and I find myself at a crossroads in life. Up to this point I have done fairly well in tech as a software engineer and have enjoyed the relax and remote culture of my job, but have recently found myself bored and know I need either a career and/or lifestyle change.

The crossroads I am at is I can either 1) commit to the grind by going after the high paying, in-person jobs in the city, most likely working 60+ hours a week, but in 5 years will have set myself up well. Or 2) continue with the more relaxed lifestyle by finding a new remote job and likely leave the city for a warmer destination (Florida or California)

If I go with the corporate chase I could foresee myself regretting never leaving the city and missing out on experiences in my youth, while if I go with a lifestyle change, I can foresee myself regretting it years down the road by not working harder when I had the free time.

Some more background on myself; I do really enjoy traveling and the warm weather, however, most of my social life is currently here in NYC 

Has anyone ran into this crossroads in life? If so, any advice you would like to give? Thank you!

1jp6d6c,Where do I go from here?,"I know that others have it worse and I at least have a job, but I want to be moving forward into something more stable for me. I have a Master's degree, but I also live in an area where there are not a lot of jobs right now. 

I started my job over 1 year ago and in that time I have had 5 different bosses and 5 offices, none of which were my doing. I was lied to initially by the first boss and then forced to work 2 night time shifts that I did not agree upon, nor were mentioned in interviewing. I work at a university in academic success. I had already signed the agreement and told my employer I was leaving, and the new boss told me ""too bad, either work nights or don't take the job"". That all passed and then my direct supervisor decided to quit without a 2 week notice. Just left.

This was in October. They decided to post the role and make me interim-director. I exceled in the role and stepped up to the challenge. In November the university fired the president and multiple cabinet members overnight. This meant yet another new boss. Then the university announced we could not afford a new president and suspended all search teams, including the director role. My office was scrambling as we on-boarded someone new right before the freeze, so we made 2 people share the office and I moved over.

Then my boss took a promotion. So, a new boss comes over and wants to change everything again. All the while, I don't truly know what my job even is at this point. Turnover galore, people being fired. I am doing my best. Then my new boss tells me I have the opportunity to interview for the director role, which I am already doing. I go through the entire process (3 interviews) and get told I did not get the role. I am fine still, just stings.

Yesterday, I get told the new person starts next Monday and they get my office. On top of that, I now will not have an office because we have no money and I can just sit out in the open space. I have been here longer than our entire department, was interim-director, have my master's degree (which nobody else does) and now I don't even have a physical office? I asked about confidential meetings and was told I could just walk with students. I am being thrown into a corner without care and losing money by being technically demoted back to my old role. I am beyond frustrated because I have to take it with a smile. I have no say or fight. I don't have financial security to just quit. I just am tired of not being respected.

1jp5ww4,Should I take this 1099 role - currently a W2 employee,"Hi there,

I've been working for the same company for about 8 years now, I'm mostly happy but it's very large and there's a lot of internal bureaucracy and progression is pretty non existent after my last promotion two years ago. I've been half looking for a new job for a few months.

It looks like I will be offered a new role at an interesting company, very aligned to what I want to do. Much smaller, but it is part of a bigger group of well known companies that I have friends who work for and they like it. However, this new firm only hires people 1099 contractors with a potential option in future to become W2 if they still like you. I told the recruiter than I wasn't that interested in contract roles, but he managed to get them to agree to a lot more cash which makes it tempting.

**Current W2 role (NYC)**

Salary: $156k

Bonus the last two years ($30k)

Vacation: 20 days

3 days week in the office, very chill team know the culture and firm very well

**Potential 1099 role (NYC)**

Hourly rate: $160 (which seems to map to about $300k gross, obviously there's more taxes and insurance).

2-3 days in the office, said they are chill

More interesting work potentially - more scope to make an impact at least.

Does it make sense to move to the 1099 role, I can probably go on my partner's Health insurance so that shouldn't be a massive factor. I'm 30, rent, have no kids and have about $40k cash, $200k investments and $300k in 401(k)/retirement funds.",Humble_Ad_5063,1,1.0,6,1743539227,2025-04-01 20:27:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jp5ww4/should_i_take_this_1099_role_currently_a_w2/,4,2025

I don't make good money and I work a part-time job as well (not as bad as it sounds). My hours at my current job are SO good and lenient, I get around 3 weeks PTO plus 2 weeks for winter break that I don't need to use PTO for plus all holidays off. Cons are I can't really grow in this position, it's not sustainable as I work two jobs and live with roommates, and I don't want to live in the city I'm in for the long run. However, my work life balance is REALLY good. I just got a job offer at a non-profit that's back home that would pay me more, and I'd be living at home without having to pay rent. However, the hours are really bad and the work life balance would be REALLY bad I'm anticipating because they literally directly told me this in the interview. However, this job would be using my skills I went to college for, would build my resume, and would probably advance my career in the long run. I'd be working a lot of overtime so I'd make good money and it's in my hometown which is where I've been trying to move back to to save money. However, I'd only get one week off after 6 months and no holidays, only 4 floating holidays. The busy season for events is September to April so my PTO probably wouldnt even be approved then. Im so conflicted on if I should just stay here for comfort or push myself and accept this job. I just am really struggling to get past the hours and work/life balance (Im sure its not as bad as they said). I don't know if im being stupid because Im comfortable here, or if I should keep this job for the time being. Any advice helps.

1jp4i0c,Should I quit?,"So long story short - I’ve been off work since Nov last year due to LC. 
I’ve had to return to work and have been doing a few hours each day to see how I go. Today is my 3rd day back. 
I am fully prepared to quit if I can’t manage health-wise as I am far from completely recovered and still have symptoms after 6 months. 


I have always loved my job a lot the past few years I’ve been there. The people are the biggest part of that to me (the work is more so repetitive but I like it too). I assumed when I returned everything would be the same again. 

Anyway, ever since I’ve been back these past few days it’s all weird. The dynamic seems to have changed entirely and I feel like I’m on the outside and don’t belong anymore. I understand I was away for a good few months but I didn’t choose to be. People I was really close to before barely talk to me now or acknowledge me, nor do they care how I am.

1jp46fj,How to explain career departure and industry shift in interviews?,"Hi all,

I hope everyone's day is going well. I'm looking for some genuine advice as I feel completely lost after abruptly leaving my job a couple of months ago. I worked in PR for one of the top film/TV production companies (if not, one of the top 3) for about 5 years. Please note, I'm choosing not to disclose the name for privacy reasons since its a very small industry, but everyone has heard of it. Prior to that, I worked at a talent agency for roughly 2.5 years. I’ve had no gaps in between jobs and worked my way up the corporate ladder to mid-level positions.

I’ll try to keep it short as possible, but my departure was prompted by a change in reporting structure that had me working for a micromanager. I tried my best to build a level of trust in our time working together, but my attempts were futile. It started affecting my mental health drastically and I felt there was no work life balance. I always enjoyed what I considered my dream job and had great rapport with almost all my colleagues. I’ve worked with some difficult personalities, but always did my best to handle with the utmost grace and did well with not taking things personal. With that said, I knew there were red flags with my new reporting structure when it started to negatively impact my performance. I would be reprimanded on a daily basis and found myself second guessing everything I did out of fear that it wouldn’t live up to his standards. If I tried picking his brain, I’d hear feedback that would imply I should figure it out for myself (which I knew whatever choice I made, it would be criticized later). He watched my every move. I was expected to answer emails even if I wasn’t on the clock, because it’s our “due diligence.” I couldn’t sleep properly. I had no appetite. All I thought about was work and the impending doom that awaits me in our meetings.

I know it’s not ideal to have nothing lined up when resigning from a job, but I needed to walk away for the sake of my sanity. I just woke up one day telling myself ""enough is enough"" and wrote up a resignation letter to hand in the next day. My therapist suggested I could be struggling with chronic burnout so I knew I made the right decision to walk away. 

I also wasn’t completely honest when resigning. I told my manager, along with my team, that I’ve accepted another job elsewhere within the industry and that I hope I can work with my colleagues again in the near future. They asked where I was going but I did not disclose. I‘ve always been super honest with all my employers in the past (even while interviewing). With that said, I lied for fear of burning any bridges. He’s been in the biz for a long time and the industry is so small so I didn’t want to take the risk should he ever get a call from a prospective employer (which is very likely to happen).

I’m currently employed with my family’s accounting business for financial security while I explore my options. I plan to apply to related jobs within the entertainment industry, but how do I approach the following for prospective job opportunities:

\- Why I left my PR job after 5 years at a prominent company without bad-mouthing?

\- Why I went from a PR job to an administrative job in finance/accounting?

\- Would the jarring shift on my resume between these two jobs negatively impact me? I read that it's not a good look to disclose you're working for a family-owned business, but not sure how I'd go about lying on applications. Is there a way to finesse this situation to my advantage?

1jp2msg,"35,000 INR salary after 17 years of experience !!","I recently came across a post about a techie in Bengaluru who worked for 9 years and was earning ₹35,000 per month. Sounds shocking, right? But this isn’t an isolated case.

Let me share a real example from my own life. My father dedicated 17+ years to one of the largest service-based companies, where thousands of people are still working. His salary? ₹35,000 per month. Even today, many of his colleagues, with 20+ years of experience, earn between ₹35,000-₹40,000.

And then, after 17 years of loyalty, he was laid off.

Despite all his experience, he was jobless for 6 months. Why? Because most companies rejected his profile for being ‘overqualified.’ If he had switched jobs earlier, he could have been a Director or VP by now. But years of stability came at the cost of career stagnation.

This is the reality many professionals are facing today, and unfortunately, the only way to break free from this cycle is by switching jobs at the right time.

That being said, I don’t advise switching jobs every year, as it can negatively impact your career. But you should switch when you feel it’s the right time, when growth opportunities stall, when your skills are undervalued, or when you know you deserve better.

During those 6 months, I kept applying to job openings on his behalf. One day, he finally got a call. A company recognized his struggle they saw his 17 years of dedication and knew he deserved better. A Director interviewed him and was so impressed that he was offered a Managerial role at that organization. (He still works there and he is so happy with that work environment and hike)

When I spoke to my father about this, he shared a powerful lesson with me:

""Learn, grow, and achieve by your 30s. After that, career growth often takes a backseat to family responsibilities.""

This isn't to say growth isn't possible after 30, but for many, priorities shift. The freedom to take risks, upskill aggressively, or change paths becomes limited.

So, if you're in your 20s: Take risks. Upskill. Negotiate. Explore opportunities.
Your future self will thank you for it.

For those who might find this hard to believe, I'm have attached my father's previous organization's payslip on linkedin with his permission.

1jp2mg1,Accountants! Do you like your job?,"I’m (22f) considering going to college to become an accountant, but I’m still feeling a bit unsure and want to hear from people who have experience. My reasons for choosing that career are because I have health conditions which cause me to be unable to leave the house fairly often and I’m unable to do much manual labor anymore so I need to get a job where I can work from home and still make good (enough) money, I was in college a couple of years ago getting a business degree and I took a few accounting classes that I really enjoyed. So I guess my questions are, do you enjoy what you do? How’s your work/life balance? Do you make enough money to be comfortable? Would I be able to work from home fairly easily or do I need to at least start out in an office? I would also like to have kids someday and be a stay at home mom, but would like the option of working again while still staying home with them, are there any moms here who are able to do that?

This just made me realise how i'm not certain in what i want to to at all.

I don't just want to work for money yk do something that actually matters, not be stuck behind a desk, i've always wanted to have an impact? or just do something that's meaningful and fulfilling?? but again money is still important at the end of the day, i dont know what to do anymore. I thought i wanted to go into psychology, but im not sure anymore. Then again im super into theatre but i dont think i should pursue that but rather have that as a passion and a hobby but i enjoy acting, then again i like history but i can't take IB history if i am to take psychology. There's so many things i like and such little time.

I have no idea what to do i dont even know who i am yet how am i supposed to decide my entire future in my teenage years? what if i make the wrong choices? what if im stuck doing something i regret when im old and its too late? i have no idea, as per the way the worId is progresslng taking something 'realistic' with 'easy money' is being pushed on us but what if i dont know what to pick still?what even is a realistic and easy career?

im so terrified of growing up and making a mistake in the decisions i make now. everyday i find new passions and discover new hobbies i enjoy, im still learning and finding who i am, im so so so afriad i just dont know what to do. well anyways, this was sort of a rant too i guess, thank u for reading",rixrixie,1,1.0,1,1743530774,2025-04-01 18:06:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jp2d0u/i_have_no_idea_what_i_want_to_do_and_im_terrified/,4,2025
1jp29zz,My parents subtle expectations for my future job prospects are draining me and i don't know what to do.,"I come from a family of defence officers. Currently, my dad serves in the forces and I am his eldest daughter (21F). I am an Engineering student in my final semester, and this is where the situation arises. Up to a week ago, I had no job offers, despite applying to multiple companies. On the advice of my father, I filled out the forms to join the selection process of the armed forces. I received a confirmation that I have to report for my interview in mid-April and I went basic training alongside it as well.

But here's the thing, I was never that keen to join the forces. True that they have their perks as well and also a lot of facilities, and I enjoy them as an officer's daughter, but I was always more academically inclined than being a sportsman. My parents never pressured me for anything, but deep down, I knew they wanted me to have something like this as a job. When I took STEM subjects in high school, they asked me if I would like to join the forces. I declined, saying that I wanted to do Economics, and they let go of the topic. But then, Covid happened, and I had to shift my decision to do Computer Science instead. At the same time, they opened up the first ever selection of women candidatures for the armed forces, and my father asked, hopefully, to give it a try. I gave the exam but didn't pass. Eventually, I settled into my engineering degree, and I had no regrets about pursuing it.

Coming back to the topic, I recently got an offer letter from a company with an exceptional CTC. I was thrilled, as I felt that I could finally have an achievement marked on my 4 years of relentless studying. I told my parents, and they were ecstatic, of course, as they knew how much I struggled to secure a job role. But then yesterday, my dad asked me if I would now like to go for the armed forces interview. To which I said, ""But I already have an offer in hand, so why try again?"" They exchanged glances but didn't say anything.

Later, my mom told me subtly about the perks of being an officer, to which I again replied that apart from the fact that I am more academically inclined, I have a phobia of heights, and I am not physically fit enough ( I do workouts enough not to make me gain extra weight). My dad then said that for an officer, it's the confidence one needs to survive the tasks, to which I said, ""But one also needs to be mentally prepared as well"". Plus, I had to travel all alone, something I have never done, to another state to report for the interview. Nothing was further said but I could feel that it's not over yet.

I feel like my achievement of achieving a job offer is less significant than this interview, and makes me wonder if my parents are truly happy with me. With the interview coming closer, I feel the pressure of actually attending the interview. I know that financially, an armed forces role is better for the long term, but at the same time, I wonder if I want to do it or if I am simply doing it because of my parents' expectations.

1jp1n8u,Which job offer should I pick?,"Throwaway for privacy

Hi all!

I am graduating from university in the southeast US this summer with a bachelors of science in Mechatronics Engineering. I have three job offers and have been struggling with which one to accept.

First offer: Software Engineer Asc @ Lockheed Martin. 87,800 salary, 97,800 TC. 4x10 schedule. Interned here last summer. Pretty boring, a lot of downtime, only talked to my manager's manager like once. This may be due to my security clearanc not coming through until after the internship, though.

Second offer: Controls Engineer @ Small Industrial Integrator. 75,000 salary, guaranteed 15-20 hours of overtime per week at minimum of 1.5x pay. 3x per year profit sharing, 100% travel 10 days on 4 days off. Travel points galore. TC with overtime would be roughly 120,000.

Third Offer: Sales Engineer @ Ciena. 75,000 base salary with 50% commission. 2.5 year training program, 30% commission is earned during this time for completing goals in training, being top of the class, etc.

My Career goals: I want to work hard and grow as quickly as possible in my first 3-7 years of career. I don't mind travel at all, and I am very extroverted and friendly by personality. My ideal job would have me recognized for working extra hours and being paid / promoted for it.

1jp13xq,Growth opportunity or managing at another company,"Dear reader,

I have worked hard all my life and find myself in a great position to start making my way up the management line. 

However, it seems that such opportunities always come with downsides.

At this moment I am a policy maker and my boss doesn’t want me to go. Not particularly wanting me to leave for a management development role because it means my position doesn’t open for someone else.

It gives me some stress and to be honest not a lot of commitment in my current role since she is very unsupportive and actually said she will do whatever in her power to stop my advance.

Now I also got another opportunity where I would become a manager of 11 people and do project management besides that. It’s a smaller company but it seems very interesting. My biggest concerns are that the role is new and I can imagine the other managers trying to unload all the projects they don’t want to do on me. Since it’s a new position and there hasn’t been slot of clarity how the role will be handled I am unsure whether this is the right choice.

So my plan for now;

Keep on the management development train in my current company and see whether it gets me something. But given all politics will this make me happy.

Contact the person I spoke during my interview with the other company and ask for a clear picture of how the role will be filled in since it is not clear to me now.

Do you have any other advice or suggestions for me?

Thank you! ",Lussypicker1969,1,1.0,2,1743527787,2025-04-01 17:16:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jp13xq/growth_opportunity_or_managing_at_another_company/,4,2025

my fork road is our data warehouse is not connected to us (long story), so we still need to go pull the raw data ourselves rather than some voodoo api. I can tell my boss “here’s how to put the raw data and hit refresh” so he can get the reports daily and spend my time toward something else and level up, or do i continue to pretend I didn’t automate anything?

1jozvqe,Frustrated recent college graduate,"I feel like I'm stuck in the mud. I don't know where I should even begin with this. 

I graduated back in December with my bachelor's degree in Industrial Technology (similar to Manufacturing Engineering). Early on before I even graduated, I actually had a job lined up as a Safety Engineer at a printing company. It looked like an ideal position as I had an internship in Safety. I have a pretty good starting salary (70k/year with benefits) and things look pretty good on paper. But the reality is that things suck right now. Since starting my job, I have had no training, I am left to complete vague safety tasks that I don't know how to even handle or manage. And most of the time, the people who assign me these tasks forget about them and then never say anything about it again. Most days I show up and I do nothing all day. Literally. I'll just sit in my crummy office they provided for me that is on the production floor (its loud sometimes). I know many people would love to have a job where they do nothing all day, but now it's soo mind numbing. I don't have anyone to interact with and all the people who work here are 30 or more years older than me. They have provided no training whatsoever since starting in January, even though they keep talking and talking about signing me up for training-nothing happens. They say I can ask higher ups for some help or guidance, but when that happens, they usually say ""oh, just look it up online, the internet is a great resource."" On top of this, my boss just retired. I don't think it helped that he retired shortly after I started, but still. He didn't even work in the same building as me and he would rarely check in with me. My new boss who starts tomorrow will not be working in the same building as me, so I'll probably won't be interacting with him much either. 

I've been looking for another job, preferably not in safety and is either hybrid or remote where I won't have to commute 45-50 minutes each day one way. Too bad the job market sucks now and I can't freaking find anything entry level. 

I can't stand showing up anymore. I just want to quit on the spot but that isn't a good choice either. I just have a feeling there's going to be a day where I'll snap. Maybe I chose the wrong path. Maybe I'm not cut out for any of this or maybe I'm not cut out for working in general. I literally can't stand working 8 hours a day and at most I'll stay for 6.5-7 hours and just go home early. Even in my internship, I struggled just to get to 6-7 hours a day. I don't have motivation to do anything else except on the days I don't work. 

This fucking reeks.

1jozizy,Do I stay at my current job and go remote or do I take my chances? (so much drama),"This is a long story so I’m sorry in advance but I really need some third-party guidance. 
I work as an administrative assistant for a construction company. I’ve been here for two years. My sister is the office manager and my other coworker has become one of my best friends. My bestie just had her first baby so she’s on maternity leave right now. 
During my employment I have gotten an associate degree and I plan to get my bachelors degree by the end of the summer. I do school (online) and work full time — it’s exhausting, but I’m passionate about my education. 
I was originally going to finish my degree in December, but I had some complications with my financial aid. After deliberating for what felt like forever, I decided to bite the bullet and pack my summer with classes. My classes are in 8-week courses and I’ll have a two week overlap in the summer (all 4 classes at once) that might be the death of me but I think I can do it. 
When I told my sister about it, she said that maybe I could put together an offer to work part time remotely to present my employer. It would be just for the summer months and to help the company transition after my bestie comes back from maternity leave. So I put together all the info and presented it to him and he said no — a little crushing after all the effort, but it was fine. He said it was about the budget (except that response was bogus because I know for a fact he doesn’t actually know what his budget is). But everything was fine because it was the kick in the pants I needed to start applying for jobs. 
Here’s the kicker. 
My bestie is not coming back from maternity leave. She’s blossoming in motherhood and I couldn’t be happier for her. 
So my boss just offered to me the remote position yesterday on my way out of the door at the end of the day. I told him I’d think about it but I have to give an answer today. 
Here’s my dilemma:
My boss is kind of a jerk—as most are—but lately he’s been extra jerky to me because his feelings are hurt that I’m leaving. So I’m not feeling charitable to him, but i am worried about my sister who will now have 0 office support (it’s a small business). 
My pay is the lowest in the office by $4/hr (despite my increased education) which leaves me pretty tight on my bills but I’ve made it work. 
I don’t have any job offers. I’ve applied to at least two a day and lowered my standards significantly with no luck so far. 
I want to keep applying for jobs and keep my options open, but my boss is not a fan of the idea for me to keep applying if I agree to three months of remote work. My boyfriend says who cares about what my boss wants because after the last several months of treatment I’ve received from him, I don’t owe him anything. But I feel like if I agree to something I need to be straightforward about what my plans are. 
Also don’t know if I’ll hear back from any of the dozens of places I’ve applied. 

And there’s so much more I’m conflicted on but I can’t put my thoughts together on it anymore without exploding from options. 
I can’t go to my sister like I usually do because she’s too involved professionally and personally.

1joze9u,Need a solid excuse to quit after 4 months..strict NP & tricky CEO,"Currently at my hometown for family commitments (had informed the team earlier), planning to go back later but can’t leave before that. NP policy at my current place seems strict as per the policy: no leaves, mandatory WFO, and HRBP & manager deciding LWD, which they can extend beyond 60 days if they feel like it (In India we have a standard 60 days notice period for most organisations)

To make things worse, the CEO can be an ass at times and a bit too egoistic. He was the keenest on hiring me, fast-tracked the whole process after my round, and everyone knows it.

New place is already whining about the 60 day NP, but I’ve convinced them it can’t be helped. I cannot afford an extension under any condition.

What reason can I give my manager for a smooth resignation and Notice period without them extending it under any circumstances?

1jozcm2,Pay cut while looking for employment? Help,"

For context! I was working as a Knowledge Operations Specialists at a Fortune 500 company. I was contracted through a recruiting/staffing agency. Making $27.50 an hour. I was taking home $1700 every two weeks. Now I worked they for a year before they decided not to renew my contact as they workload just wasn’t there to keep my employment. (There were days where I had no work coming to my desk) I have been on the job search for 4 weeks with 0 interviews. The first interview I received led to a job offer at a Voice services Company that offer IT services. My military background has given me “SOME” IT experience that I want to pursue. Now I will be taking a $9.50 pay cut.. I asked for $20 as the position is tier 1 and listed at $16-$24 and hour. They said they could do $18 as I have limited experience but they I have room for growth with their tiered advancements. I’m sure I could get to $20 in 6 months to a year. 
What advice can you give me, I’m looking at other ways to supplement my income to help alleviate the difference.

1joyyey,[Career Advice Needed] Balancing Short-Term Income vs. Long-Term Alignment,"
Hey everyone, I’d love some feedback on a career crossroad I’m at. I’m in medtech (currently in a clinical support role) and trying to balance short-term income + freedom with long-term alignment and growth—especially considering my relationship and future family goals.

⸻

Current Setup:
	•	Job A: Full-time medtech role, base $120K, with bonus (OTE ~$150K, but realistically ~80% to plan = $144K)
	•	Job B: Considering picking up a contractor position —flexible hours, 2 days/week. Est. $50–60K/year side income.

Combined income (A + B): ~$195K–$205K
Schedule: Highly flexible. I control my time, get 24 PTO days/year, and could work remotely or regionally.

⸻

Opportunities on the Table:

Job C – Sales Role (Title Growth):
	•	Base $100K, OTE $180K
	•	Would be a title bump, quota-carrying, and a chance to scale quickly
	•	Less PTO and less time flexibility
	•	Risk: If I don’t hit plan, I could earn less than I do now and be more stressed

Job D – Clinical Role (Skill-Building):
	•	~$95k starting base
	•	Steep learning curve, but would gain niche EP skills and path to RCES certification, eventual Mapper with higher base
	•	Long-term opens doors to remote clinical education, lab roles, or marketing
	•	Aligns with my partner’s future—she’s a nurse and will likely become a travel nurse in ~2-3 years

⸻

Personal Context / Priorities:
	•	Girlfriend wants to be a travel nurse in 2–3 years.
	•	I want the ability to travel with her on short-term assignments (3–6 months)
	•	Eventually want to be a present, involved father and not be dependent on a high-pressure job to support my family
	•	My long-term dream is financial freedom: own a few properties, earn enough for my future wife to work per diem as a nurse when kids arrive

⸻

My Internal Debate:

Job A + B Pros:
	•	High income now, max flexibility
	•	Great for investing in real estate or building passive income
	•	Supports my current lifestyle and lets me be present for my relationship
	•	I could quietly stack cash and opt into something else later

Job A + B Cons:
	•	Not growing new skills or getting title momentum
	•	Might feel stagnant professionally over time
	•	Relying on myself to build future freedom, not a traditional career ladder

⸻

Job C Pros:
	•	Bigger title and more traditional career growth
	•	Good pay if I hit plan
	•	Could be a stepping stone to future director/strategic roles

Job C Cons:
	•	Less flexibility, more pressure
	•	Not aligned with traveling alongside my future wife

⸻

Job D Pros:
	•	Aligns almost perfectly with my partner’s travel lifestyle long-term
	•	Opens doors to remote clinical education, marketing, or lab-based roles
	•	I could even become a traveling ep tech once I’m certified
	•	Purpose-driven, more meaningful work

Job D Cons:
	•	Immediate pay cut from my current income
	•	Would still rely on a job for income long-term unless I invest aggressively
	•	Requires a grind year or two before the payoff

⸻

Key Questions I’m Sitting With:
	1.	Is it smarter to maximize income now (Job A + B) so I can exit the rat race early?
	2.	Or should I invest in skill growth (Job D) that aligns with my partner’s future and gives us long-term joint flexibility?
	3.	Can I trust myself to keep growing if I don’t chase a title?
	4.	Is short-term sacrifice (pay cut + stress) worth long-term lifestyle alignment?

Would love to hear from others in medtech, healthcare, or who’ve navigated similar decisions.
What would you prioritize? What do you wish you’d done earlier?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice!",dr_lam,1,1.0,0,1743522615,2025-04-01 15:50:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1joyyey/career_advice_needed_balancing_shortterm_income/,4,2025
1joytn4,A Year into my “9-5”,"Hello all,

Backstory: 2023 Management Information Systems graduate with a focus on Technology and Management. Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Countless applications sent and a handful of job interviews that didn’t go well I was losing my mind until I somehow landed a project management job starting at 75k in May of 2024, which was a little over a year since I had graduated.

Fast forward to now, next month will mark a year at my first ‘big boy’ job and I am happy to say that everything has gone super well. I walked into this job with absolutely no skills in the field/industry and have grown into a respectable employee. I can’t say I look forward to coming into work because work is work, but I do enjoy it and the time flies. Lots of positives about the job including a work from home day, great boss, great coworkers, and good benefits. I have no plans of leaving anytime in the near future and can see myself being here atleast a few more years, but I do feel as though I am gaining more leverage in the market with experience under my belt.

With that being said, does anyone actively try to look for a better opportunity even though  they are happy with their current position? Obviously everyone wants to get paid more, but at what point in my career do I try to get promoted, or look elsewhere? I do think my pay is fair since I am still relatively very new and they took a chance on hiring me because they saw potential, but the more time that goes by I seem to be picking up more responsibilities which should translate to higher pay. (Think a small raise is coming at my 1 year mark)

Anyways I just wanted to give a little update/rant since I haven’t posted in a while. Hope everyone is doing well in their career and goodluck to all still searching!",Zckary,2,1.0,0,1743522298,2025-04-01 15:44:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1joytn4/a_year_into_my_95/,4,2025
1joyn3b,PIP by my awful company,"Hi,

I got put on a PIP by my company today and I'm trying to figure out what to do. I hate this company, it does not align with me politically, my boss has made several misogynistic comments towards me as the only woman on the team, and it's severely underpaid. It's my first really technical job in a new industry (which they know) and I receive very little guidance or support when I ask questions. No one has any documents or regulations or instructions on how to do the tasks they assign me. I took this job because the market is so bad and I wasn't sure when I'd have an opportunity to a better one. 

  
Additionally, I suffer from chronic pain and am scheduled to undergo spinal surgery due to its severity. I've told my boss this and that I've been having increased issues with it lately to no real response. Last week I had a bad respiratory infection and told my boss this several times, only to receive little acknowledgement and get sent more tasks, which took longer than anticipated and were not as detail oriented because I was sick. Today I was given a PIP because of this performance from last week. I'm not even sure I want to adjust my performance. I really want to quit. I have interviews for better jobs already, but am worried about quitting and not getting them and then having on my resume that I only held this job for a few months. I'm also worried about keeping this job and not being able to study for my other interviews or dedicate the time to opportunities that I'm much more interested in. 

I guess I'm just ranting sorry ",AwarenessDense9232,16,0.8999999761581421,26,1743521871,2025-04-01 15:37:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1joyn3b/pip_by_my_awful_company/,4,2025

Fast forward to three weeks ago, I received a message from an employer saying they’d like to talk to me. We had the conversation two weeks ago, and it went well. However, every time they asked about my job, I said I was still working at that company.

When the interview ended, they said they’d get in touch with me.

I know it’s almost impossible for them to reach out to someone at my company to confirm this, because they’re not organized at all.

1joy3st,Move on or hold out?,"Been with my employer for 3 years. Came in via a unicorn job that I knew I could do but didn’t want to do forever, at the top level of the job family and near the top of the pay grade. After interviewing for a job I wanted and then getting no offer and/or feedback and many conversations with my manager and no path forward I started to entertain external opportunities last summer. I applied internally for the same position I had interviewed for months prior and shortly thereafter had was negotiating an offer for an external opportunity.

My manager and leadership from another department convinced me to stay for a new (to the organization) role, in a different department. I had shared my desire for the move to be more methodical and that they figure out my backfill before moving me because I knew I was leaving a big hole and it was coming up on my busiest time of year, but they moved me two weeks later.

Fast forward to now, I’ve been straddling both roles for 8+ months. I was promised a new job family/title, which hasn’t happened. After a lot of effort on my part to expose the vast array of work and necessary skills for my old role, they’ve just now decided that they do need to backfill for the role - with two people across two departments. They are looking at hiring a person with no industry or work experience for at least one of the backfills, meaning I’ll be training this person from the bottom up while still figuring out and helping to build my new role. I know I’m expected to at least train the other backfill as well.

Not only did I get no pay raise when I moved to the new role, but after getting an exceeds on my review my merit increase was limited to less than last year due to where I am at in my pay grade. I’ve experienced enough of my new domain to know that I don’t want to do this for the long haul, and I have a lot to learn just to continue to perform satisfactorily in this role. I recently talked to HR about getting to a role more similar to what I had applied to twice and interviewed for once. Was told I interviewed strong but that because of the level they would have had to put me at for a latter move it would have caused inequity in the particular department. Was also told to expect to take a pay cut, despite being well qualified for the lateral move and that job family having two more levels/pay grades beyond my current job family. And I can’t move until I’ve been in this role for 12 months.

A LOT of people (in the context of the company) started their career at and retired from this company. Turn over is low in comparison to peer companies. It’s a financially sound and stable company. It’s a culture of people doing what they say they’ll do, on a work delivery basis. I have decent benefits. I make a decent wage but I definitely still have a fair amount of earnings potential in front of me in the job family I want to get into, and once worked in at a peer company. Do I hold out for however long it may be before I can get to the job family I want, eat it, and take a pay cut? Or do I, at least, explore other opportunities again? I’m a bit jaded after enough experiences in horrible cultures so a part of me wants to stay for the culture. I’m feeling very frustrated right now but trying not to make a decision based on feelings.

1joxwa4,Grinding through your 20s or Travelling & Experience life?,"Conflicted between spending the next few years putting my head down and climbing the corporate ladder or taking a year off to move abroad and live. I have some momentum with my career in my home town. My industry (law) is competitive and getting a few years of experience under my belt will better position me to move abroad and make a decent living. 

In contrast, moving abroad now would mean sacrificing current momentum in my career and there’s no certainty that I will be able to get it back. I currently don’t have enough experience or the competitive grades to move abroad and work in my field.

For further context, I am in my mid 20s at the moment and I don’t feel like I’m truly living or experiencing life in my home town. All I do is work and constantly dream about getting my experience to leave. This decision can change the whole trajectory of my life so it’s pretty significant.

1jowqh6,When to take the plunge and quit FT for freelance?,"I currently work as a department manager for a resort. I’ve been in this position for 3.5 years now and I truly appreciate what I’ve learned while being here. That being said, I have been thinking about quitting this summer and recently the flames have ramped up making me consider leaving sooner. 

In early February my boss (our director) was fired for bad metrics and getting a bad score on our front line employee satisfaction survey. My manager score was ok but the department was down across the board. 

Since I returned from a maternity leave in January my department customer satisfaction has been down -11 points from prior year. A lot of that is on my former director for mismanaging the operations in my absence. Early March I provided an explanation and plan of action to our corporate team for improving our scores. My response was appreciated by the corporate team and they said to enact it in phases so I don’t throw to much at the team all at once. Totally doable. However, our scores started improving and then plummeted another 3 points down this week and I truly cannot identify why. 

We also recently had our annual appraisals. I landed at Met Expectations and was given my annual 2.5% salary increase. However during that review a few things upset me. One, I received a “did not meet” expectations on customer metrics goal. According the list of expectations such as “participate and bring ideas to CX Meetings”, “have a deep understanding of line of business”, “manage operating supply budget” ect, I absolutely met, if not exceeded. And my NPS had a .5 increased from prior year, I just didn’t have a large increase. The next is that they warned me to stop being so outspoken when it comes to concerns about new standards, ect. I keep it professional but clearly they don’t want anyone asking questions or giving real feedback at this point. 

Now my original goal was to quit in June and go back to freelancing. The plan was to get work lined up for the summer and go from there. Then with everything going on in the US government I got nervous and decided to wait until Fall to save a little more and see what’s going on. With all of these things at my job happening in the last few weeks I’ve started to really panic about getting out before being terminated myself. I don’t want to loose this job as something to put on my resume because it was a big step in my career. 

I recently got signed on to do PT work at a concert venue and I previously signed up to be on the call sheet for the local union in my line of business. This morning I got a work request from the union and couldn’t take it due to my FT job. I also have 2 interviews lined up for FT options if the offer is good enough.

However, I had an unexpected opportunity come my way recently that resulted in a new job opportunity with a 40% pay raise, better benefits, and a hybrid office schedule. Tbh, as someone who just moved to a new city I’m not too bummed about the office and the office culture seems fun (it’s a tech company)

But today (Tuesday) I’m feeling like I should have stayed at my current job. Is this just because I’m comfortable here? Am I just nervous for the unknown? Is my anxiety taking over? Did I make the right decision? 

Ughh I’m just going through all the feelings. ",Usual_Connection4306,8,0.8299999833106995,14,1743515877,2025-04-01 13:57:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jow8d9/am_i_nervous_or_did_i_make_a_mistake/,4,2025
1jovpzx,Someone higher up won’t provide me with info for me to do my job,"i work for a large company and i love it, my role is important, but not anyone’s priority. i’m at the bottom of the totem pole and everyone is busy.

simply put, my job is creative, in order to do it, i need information and approvals. it’s really not that hard. i work for 2 people.

for one of them, the team lead said “she will not be doing anything for my project.” but it’s her job. i told my manager who will tell his manager but it does not change. he also does not want us to do anything for her, because it’s her job to provide it.

how i tried to fix it:
1. if you’re not interested in this, is there something else we can work on together?
2. tried to explain timelines, and that it’s a low effort project (in a nice way)
3. if there’s anything we can do to support her team
4. if we can meet and have a creative meeting, talk ideas, explain anything that causes confusion.
5. talking to managers or managers to get to her.

nothing has helped. the only thing i haven’t said is this is literally my job on the line, if i have nothing to do i’ll lose my job. 

i’ve tried to talk rational and dumb it down as much as possible. all i need is her to share some guides and information and eventually take 5 minutes to scroll and approve. the entire team is incredibly rude.

1jouzoo,Hate my job,"I’m writing this sitting at my work desk. I (21M) work a desk job doing referrals for a health care facility in a pretty tiny office with 7 other people. We don’t have pods, we have desks lined up side to side with clear plastic dividers between them. My job entails sitting on a computer for 8 hours a day, looking over medical records, scheduling patient appointments and calling patients to tell them the appointment date.  The person who sits behind me I’ll call her Mandy, is so fucking annoying and drains any bit of enjoyment from this job that is already unenjoyable. 

Mandy has to make noise all day, she’s always whistling to shitty corporate music that has to be played during the day in our enclosed office. When she’s talking to someone on the phone she says the stupidest shit, always making up slang for simple words. Ex: instead of saying diagnoses she says diag.. what the fuck is a diag no one even says this. And apart from that she’s the type of person to say lengthy words to make themselves sound smarter but in turn sounds dumb because they over complicate simple things. 

My job wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t feel like a fucking rat tied down to my desk all day. Be forced to listen to the local radio station who plays the same songs every hour. And have a co worker who is so obnoxious that sits not even 6 feet behind me. I think I’m losing my fucking mind, and I dread working here. But I can’t leave right now, I need to have a financial cushion to sit on.

1jotpbo,"Left a job I loved for an objectively better opportunity, but still regret it (blue collar)","(23 years old) I recently left a job I absolutely loved as a terminal operator in a tank farm. It was very labor intensive and was shift work, but I knew it like the back of my hand, involved thinking along with the physical part, and I got along with EVERYONE, I actually enjoyed going into work, even on the worst night. This new job is essentially as an instrument technician on a pipeline. INVALUABLE skills to be learned, a great combination of hands on and computer skills. There are significant perks to the job as well, including more vacation, annual bonus, ESOPS, take home truck, less physical work, and great contacts in the industry. So far, I absolutely can't stand this new job. I am pretty underqualified which I made abundantly known in the interview, but they liked me anyway and took a chance. I'm facing the challenge of understanding nothing that is being shown to me (which I know in time I would) but I can't stand the feeling of not understanding and contributing to a job. When I was leaving my last job, I was told by almost everyone I would be welcome back any time, and even to apply to the recently open and coveted maintenance position which is basically my dream job. No shift work and will still be learning valuable knowledge, but not nearly as in depth or varied as my new job. To note, if I went with maintenance at my old job, I'd be making $40/hr with annual raises bound by a contract. I'm currently making $33/hr, but with the ability to top out significantly hire in the $60/hr range, but that will be years and years, and I have no problem with delayed gratification. The reason I included ""blue collar"" in my title is because it's not like there is a 30k salary bump or huge bonuses or work from home options to consider between these two jobs like there may be in say an engineering job or marketing or something, these jobs I'm stuck between are fairly comparable. That was very long winded, but basically my question is, and I know it is subjective, what would you say is worth leaving a job that you actually look forward to going to, for a job that actually feels like a job again. Do I tough it out and suck it up for a potentially better future, or do I stick with what I like and what I know and what I actually enjoy that still provides a very comfortable living. Have you ever left a job for a better opportunity that you may not have liked as much but is a better opportunity, and what has been your experience?

1josn2o,I left a dear job and pulled a crucial employee to quit. Now I feel like crap,"Long story short - We were a team of nine people. Great community, genuinely nice people, it's been one of the best places I will ever work. The business was simultaneously hit by the current job crysis and  the unexpectedly poor menagement skills by the two older co-owners in the previous months, which led to them them terminating a third of the staff. One of which is a soon-to-be father.

The employee in question and I were shareholders of this business, and soon we began talking as this decision didn't sit quite right with either of us. He kept mentioning his pay, and how he had money issues, and I blatantly asked him how much was his salery. This led us to conclude that he was severely underpayed, rather shameful as he had been with the company for 10 years, so double my time spent there.

He began expressing his wish to leave, and in my own frustration with the newfound turn of events I suggested he calls my husband, as the company he works at is employing. He explored many other options in the followimg weeks and called friends and ex-coworkers searching for jobs, but he did contact my partner as well.

I left the company, sold my share, and lo and behold, my coworker goes through with the interview, finishes training, passes the test and is about to begin working with my husbands company.

On one side I am happy to have been a solution to what was undoubtedly a very stressful and uncertain time in his life. On the other side, the people we worked for have been so good to me. My pay was solid, what I had learned was useful and they had genuinely been friends to me, not bosses - I had an injury that lasted over a year, they had payed me in full even though I could barely work, or for months not at all (they didn't touch my holidays at all), they were there in support of whatever I needed, even offered medical financial support. And they were a rare type of employer you don't find often.

I just feel like utter shit now that my head has cooled down from the frustration I felt in those past few months. Even though I kinda knew my  colleague would have left the company, just knowing that he left to work where my husband works feels lika a betrayal on my part, as they have met and even brought my husband on a company holiday with them.

And to top it off, our business is a niche, they won't be able to replace this guy. They will have to train someone from the ground up again. Which they should have tought of before and raised his pay, but still.

The toll of all of this is catching up. I feel like I've let a bunch of close people down.

1jorn2p,Need Help Deciding: Imperial MSc Statistics (Data Science) vs. UvA MSc AI for Data Science & Football Analytics Career,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some advice on choosing between two Master’s programs:

1. MSc in Statistics (Data Science track) at **Imperial College London**
2. MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Amsterdam (UvA)**

# My Background & Career Goals

I'm currently finishing my **BSc in Business Analytics at the University of Amsterdam**. My long-term goal is to become a **Data Scientist**, ideally at a FAANG company. Eventually, I’d love to transition into **football analytics**, focusing on **predictive modeling, AI-driven insights, and advanced analytics for teams**, rather than just making visualizations.

# My Key Questions

1. **Which program aligns better with my goals?** Given my background and aspirations, would an MSc in AI or an MSc in Statistics (Data Science) set me up better for FAANG and football analytics?
2. **Is Imperial’s MSc worth the investment?** It’s a big financial commitment as an international student. Does it offer strong **ROI in terms of job prospects and salary outcomes**, or is it more of a money grab?
3. **How valuable is an Imperial degree for finding a job, especially as an EU citizen needing a visa?** Would the Imperial name help me secure a work visa/job in the UK, or is its reputation mainly UK-centric? How well-regarded is it **outside the UK** for data science roles?
4. **Course flexibility & overlap**: I really like Imperial’s modules, but at UvA, I can **choose electives that cover similar statistics topics** (like simulations, stochastic processes, etc.). Would this make up for the difference between the programs?
5. **How respected is UvA’s MSc AI in the data science job market?** I’ve struggled to find **employment data** for it. Does anyone have insights into job placements for graduates?

I’d really appreciate any insights from people in **data science, AI, or football analytics**, or anyone familiar with these programs.

1jordxb,Feeling stuck in my marketing career - struggling to grow & change jobs - any advice?,"
Hi all,

I'm (26F) struggling with my career growth and could really use some advice.

I moved to a different country due to my boyfriend’s job relocation but was able to keep my job and now work fully remote. I’ve been with my company for three years as a Growth Marketer, reporting to the CMO. This is my first job after university, not including internships and administrative student jobs I’ve had.

Initially, I really enjoyed working here, it’s a scale-up, and when I joined, I was the only marketer besides my manager. I had the opportunity to try different marketing areas and immerse myself in the full marketing-sales lifecycle. While I’ve learned a lot, I feel stuck. I’ve been a marketing generalist for the past three years, but there’s no clear career progression.

I expected that as the company and team grew, I would take on a more senior role, moving beyond pure execution. But that hasn’t happened. Instead, I feel like I’m primarily given execution-heavy tasks, while strategic projects go elsewhere. Sometimes, it feels like my contributions aren’t as valued as others’ work.

I’ve expressed to my manager that I want to transition into a Product Marketing role, as my current work already overlaps with some aspects of it, and I’m particularly interested in research and understanding customers. We came up with a development plan that includes me taking PMM courses, with the goal of transitioning in 12 months. While I see the value in upskilling, I don’t think courses alone will prepare me for the role. The best preparation would be actively taking on more relevant projects now so that in 12 months, I already have hands-on experience.

At the same time, I know that as long as I report to the same manager, I will continue feeling stuck. There’s a recurring pattern where I’m not given more ownership or opportunities to grow, which makes me doubt that even transitioning into a more focused role will change how I feel about working here.

I’ve been wanting to change jobs for a year now, but since relocating a few months ago, it has been incredibly difficult. I don’t speak the local language, which seems to be a major barrier in applications. I apply every day but rarely hear back.

This situation is really frustrating, I feel stuck in a job that no longer makes me happy, yet I’m struggling to find something else.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated ",Haunting_Picture7262,3,1.0,2,1743499409,2025-04-01 09:23:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jordxb/feeling_stuck_in_my_marketing_career_struggling/,4,2025

1jor0ic,What should I do as an 18 year old high school graduate,"Hi, I M 18 and just finished high school. Now, I am starting to think about my career.

**To give you some background.**

I did some research on the fields I enjoy the most, and since I was the nerd type all my life, I came to find that I enjoy cybersecurity and writing the most, so I decided to work on these two skills.

But recently, I joined the r/cybersecurity sub and there, almost everyone is ranting about bad job market and layoffs in the field because of AI, they are also saying that salaries have been stagnant for a while without any major increase, which is quite concerning for me as a student who looked forward to joining the field.

I admit that one of the criteria I set was a good income when choosing the career I wanted to pursue, and cybersecurity was also able to make the cut. 

I am currently a student in an introduction to cybersecurity short course and am also watching a bug bounty hunting course on youtube.

As for writing, I became interested in it through my interest in reading fantasy novels, and I have written 2 novels so far, one of which I dropped after chapter 40 because I made too many mistakes that were impossible to fix.

Currently I am posting my second novel on Webnovel and RoyalRoad, and am hoping to make some side income while I am still studying.

**Now this leads to my main question**.

Which career should I choose as my main feild? should I go with cybersecurity and keep writing on the side? should i presure writing as a full time career?

I do want to highlight that I live in Pakistan and an income of 1-2k $ is enough to live a comfortable life, not too lavish and not too bad, just comfortable.

Please help me with this, as my parents are pushing me to choose a career that I want to presure and I asked them to give me till the end of june for a definitive answer.",BearBoy_BB,1,1.0,0,1743497759,2025-04-01 08:55:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jor0ic/what_should_i_do_as_an_18_year_old_high_school/,4,2025
1joqx6l,How do I justify a year off + not finishing my degree in a CV and in interviews?,"Guys I know the title sounds awful but I’ll very quickly explain. Also, please don’t hate on me for my choices. This post is not for you to judge me. Anyhow, some quick background on my situation:

I started a technical formation in September 2023 (like my country’s equivalent of an apprenteship) in web development. Didn’t work out and left in September 2024. That qualification lasts 2 years so theoretically I should have graduated this year but I had to redo most of my Year 1 credits (so I wouod have graduated in 2026) but ANYWAY that is not the point. 

Ever since September 2024 I have been getting my driver’s license. I am not American and in my country there are big waiting lists to get exam dates for theory and practical exams. Failed my theory exam twice and I passed in December 2024, and then now I am doing practical lessons and I will not be able to examine myself until June 2025. I live in a small town of 1000 people aprox and I need a car to get a job, that is why I am only doing driving lessons. My parents are fine with it. 

Obviously the idea is that at the slight chance that I get to work (so basically have my driver’s license) I will work. The thing is that in my country summer jobs are getting recruiting now, so I have to apply now so that when I get my license in the summertime I’ll have a job straight up. 

Now, how do I justify this or even place this on my CV? Because at the moment my CV would look like

Qualifications:

- High school diploma (2019-2023)

Work experience:

(A bunch of volunteering I did back in high school before 2023)

Like I cannot give out any real stats on things that have happened after 2024 because I can’t put on my CV “I am getting my driver’s license” which even by the way I can’t even put I have on my CV but theorically I’ll have it by summertime but I cannot 1000% guarantee because… it is a practical exam which you can fail. I have barely no working experience and the one I have is very short lived, but more importantly OLD. 

Anyways, how do I justify this gap and make it now sound awful? Because to me this gap is justified as I know my circumstances but HR won’t know and at first in sounds like I just don’t wanna work but there is more to that. 

By the way, I don’t think I even need to say this but obviously I am applying for entry level basic jobs you can do just by having your HS diploma. The issue is trying to justify the time being unemployed.

1joptdw,Career Advice - IT procurement,"hello everyone and hope you are well. i (30M) am currently working in a mid to large scale (3000+ employees) military/government hospital environment handling mainly IT requests where the role basically includes receiving IT request from various end users across the hospital, acknowledged, verified and forwarded to us by the hospital IT department for which we create RFQs/LPOs based on the requirement. this includes product/price reviewing, understanding and negotiation etc. i am placed in one of the smaller islands in the middle east and am looking forward to some guidance if i can find better opportunities outside with a much better pay scale. i come from a background of reasonably good understanding of all IT and electronic product knowledge, went into some initial IT support roles for configuration of email clients, have certifications of MCP/MCSA windows server 2012 etc. however i am in the current role of procurement coordinator at my existing workplace for 8 years now and my salary is about $1500 a month. its midrange for an average general salary scale here but now that im responsible for my family, i definitely need to earn more and start saving up for the future. keeping this in mind, i am currently doing OTHM UK level 7 diploma in logistics and supply chain management after which i will transfer my credits to an MBA for the same specialization with procurement. i would like to ask, once im done with my degree and along with my years of experience, what can i expect in terms of better job positions and pay. thank you and much appreciated on any sort of advice and insight",youredditagain,1,1.0,0,1743492311,2025-04-01 07:25:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1joptdw/career_advice_it_procurement/,4,2025

1jopcqm,Got a job right away through just sending an email,"
TLDR: Apollo.io sort by company keywords, use hunter.io chrome extension to find email, validate email, send a concise email with resume + credentials showing value, get in contact with the right people.

Fresh college grad applied to probably over 1k jobs. Very bad luck.

- very few interviews 
- no offers

After getting the same advice over and over again which was always some form of:

“Just keep applying it’ll eventually work!” 
Or
“Leverage your network, maybe something will turn up”

For 1.) after about the 20th time of changing the resume and throwing it through ats trackers to ensure its keyword friendly, and having it reviewed by multiple sources at my university, I gave up here

For 2.) this one is said by people all the time who are already well established in their career. I’m fine having a convo and if something happens naturally then great, but betting on your random neighbor to hook you up with a gig seems like a shot in the dark.

So I basically just did a bunch of independent research used Apollo.io to sort through a list of companies and people in the companies that are in management positions, or positions of some influence.

Then from there I’d go to the company domain and use hunter.io the chrome extension to get their emails or at least see the email structure.

From there I send a concise email where I show specific direct interest, why I think I can contribute, and asking if there’s anyone I can talk to about potentially building a career with their company.

I did this for literally 1 week, sent about 50ish - 75 emails total, got some interviews, got some polite declines, and a job offer.

Basically don’t understate your value. If you feel you are a strong candidate let it be known, don’t rely on a lucky break.

1jooqfu,Can I get a job with just certs? I have my google cybersecurity cert and working on my security+ and planning on cysa+ cert with no prior experience. Is this realistic?,"

I don't have any experience in IT at all, my last job was serving tables at restaurants 6 years ago and ive been an entrepreneur ever since and now getting into cybersecurity. I currently live in San Diego but I plan on moving out of state with my wife and 4 month old baby and we are open to moving basically to any other state (which will open up job prospect to not just being local or remote) Also I don't have any formal education past high school so no bachelor's degree in computer science

I currently have my google cybersecurity cert and working on getting my security+ in a few days and was planning on cysa+ immediately after that but looking for some recommendations or encouragement on this current path. I have full time attention ( 8 hours a day including weekends) to the goal of finding a 50k-60k entry level first time job out of the gate in virtually any state (hopefully texas) with these 3 certs (or/and others) by the end of Summer at the latest ( like September and its currently April). Planning on narrowing in on an entry level 1 SOC analyst job but I'll take any entry level job that pays that salary range (including IT support or help desk if needed). Given this current path I plan on being able to start applying to jobs June 1st-mid June (with these 3 certs under my belt). Once I start applying to jobs, it will be my full time job to apply to these jobs (at least 30-50 per day)

Are my expectations realistic? Should I focus on other certs instead? Given those certs should I be focusing on any specific jobs instead of SOC analyst?

I’m an incoming **MS in Data Science student at the University of Maryland (UMD)** and have also been admitted to **MS CS at the University of Rochester**, while waiting on decisions from RPI, UCR, and UCSC. My main interest lies in **machine learning and AI roles**, but I’ve noticed that software engineering internships seem more common and easier to secure compared to ML/AI internships. From what I’ve seen, many professionals start as software engineers and later transition into data science and ML roles. Given this, I’m wondering if it’s a smarter move to first get a **software engineering internship** and then pivot to ML/AI later, or if I should focus on landing an ML/AI internship directly. For those who have made this transition, what strategies or skills were most helpful? Are there specific ways to improve my chances of breaking into ML/AI right away?

All interviews were conversational and somewhat informative, but I don’t know how they would gauge my ability to be successful given they didn’t really dig for information.

This process was never mentioned on the job description, and not one person asked about my related experience.

1jooejp,I watched Interstellar today and had a quarter-life crisis...,"TL,DR: I am about to do military service in cyber, and I feel a pull to motorsports...

First time caller, long time listener...

Let's go back to 2018...

My mom told me one thing when I graduated high school. She told me, ""Either you can go to college, you can go to the military, or you can go get you a job at the steel mill... you choose."" I chose college.

I started college in August of 2018, going into a CIS degree... To make a long story short, I graduated in December 2024, and I changed degrees five times. I changed from CIS to BSN, from BSN to Digital Media, from Digital Media to Graphic Design, from Graphic Design back to Nursing, and finally (after not passing the test to move on to clinicals) BACK TO CIS.

I was taught almost NOTHING in my CIS cyber courses all because it was such a new program that the university offered, and it was SO NEW that they used a third party to handle the online courses... It didn't help that it was SUCH A BREEZE TOO. I felt as if I learned nothing, because all I did was go through each lesson, step by step; I even came out last semester with a 3.4 GPA.

I got finished with college looking for job opportunities in Cyber, and while there are some, the entry levels around me want 5-7 years of experience and a ton of certs... none of which I have. It got me looking into military service, and I go to MEPS next week. I also am applying for a cyber position, in writing. I planned on doing my 20 years, but I also have been thinking about being 45 when I finish...

This brings me to my issue... I watched Interstellar for the first time today, and like the title states, I had a quarter-life crisis. I started to do some research about my passion that I have always had ever since I was young, which is the Motorsports industry... I have grown up around racecars of various forms and fashions, and I have spent my time in college also building a drift car with my dad... I stumbled upon a technical college that works with a couple local racetracks near it, and I even sent in info requests and an application packet just now.

I just don't know what I need to do now, and I need some guidance, so ask me anything... Get my mind moving, because I cannot do it in my own self... I overthink a lot as it is.",VeryRustyPotato,0,0.28999999165534973,5,1743486242,2025-04-01 05:44:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jooejp/i_watched_interstellar_today_and_had_a/,4,2025

(Concerned with my future)","I'm 15, only a freshman in high school nearing the end of my 1st year. I know I can't guarantee anything, but I believe I have the mental aptitude in order to study difficult subjects when I get into college. Currently I average a 4.0 with advanced classes in math, english, and science, and I juggle football on top of that. I'm in California right now so the main thing I'm worried about when thinking about my future is my salary. A lot of things that I've seen are overpriced here and the paths that I do want to pursue in the future have me thinking hard about picking and choosing due to the money potential and lifestyle. I gravitate toward marine studies, mainly marine biology but I've researched around a bit and a lot of people have said that it's not known for its high salaries. Marine engineering is also on the table, but I'm also concerned about lifestyle. I don't know if I'd like to have a job where most people say you spend a lot of your time out at sea, where you can't settle down with a partner or a family. I've also heard that a lot of times your degree won't even lead to anything in the maritime industry, a lot of people with marine engineering degrees seemingly get hired by power plants, hospitals, etc. Aerospace engineering and astronomy were also thoughts. My main concern is that I don't know what amount of money that I can live comfortably on with my education. I've tried to research how much money people make and live off of, but I've gotten varying answers and due to my location it seems like every job will have me wasting away for years trying to pay things off or other monetary concerns.",Ok_Context8397,1,1.0,0,1743485094,2025-04-01 05:24:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1joo49h/i_cant_decide_what_i_want_to_do_as_i_move_forward/,4,2025

1jonj9z,Promotion Advice,"Recently I had a conversation with our company manager about a promotion, and I was guaranteed the position. 

This particular company I work for is, highly dysfunctional and the turnover is high. 

I am a top-performer, the numbers do not lie. I have always taken the initiative, whether it is coming in on my days off, training, boosting team morale or employing my problem-solving skills. 

This past year we had increased our profits from last year by over 200%, with my personal performance attributing to over 40% of that in a team of 10. 

However, recently a promotion was passed over me for another, newer, candidate with less experience, which left me upset and losing faith in the company's ability to assess industry talent. 

Now I am being referred for a promotion at a different workplace, with a new team. 

I am considering the promotion, however, this recent incident has damaged how far I would have been willing to go for this company. 

Job market isn't too good right now for my career of choice, and I wonder if I should take the promotion. However it will be mentally difficult to perform and represent the company as I did before.

1jonayi,Job suggestion for any higher paying career; what do you do for work that you’ve enjoyed and pays well? Seeking chill jobs,"Are there high paying jobs with friendly coworkers or comradery? It seems like most high paying jobs are filled with superficial “we are not friends” ppl everywhere.

My job experience is mostly customer service, mostly food service, with some hospitality. During college I was in event management organizations and that was fun, but I haven’t been able to land any job except really tough (physically) work that pays little. (Ex: kitchen jobs, waitering, senior caretaking, warehouse truck unloading…) My most physically easier jobs was grocery stores and cashiering for them, coffee barista, and music teacher. I’ve also worked front desk night auditing at hotels, but I was traumatized from the yelling, verbal abuse from guests, and 6hr shifts that became “can you stay longer 12hr shifts and made you stand for hours in business shoes (actually broke my foot and limped after I quit for a year and a half).

I also gave a bachelor’s in linguistics but I found it’s a very useless degree… and originally I used to be a near professional classical musician…but that’s also not very useful atm. 

This year I moved out of small town Indiana and moved to Chicago , only to find out that service industry jobs here shut down stores quickly, lay you off by withdrawing hours from you if they don’t see you work good enough, also might have higher standards for working than what I know. 

I landed my first corporate job for a call center but got T-boned in a car accident and couldn’t commute 3hours by train anymore so I quit. The people there seemed alarmed when I was too friendly or talked to bond with them and I also realized corporate culture sadly might be alienating for me.

In short, I’m physically and mentally exhausted of these entry level jobs and want to work something more higher paying. But I don’t have enough social battery for sales in general, I don’t do well with rejection so door-to-door sales was really hard and depressing, but I get too lonely and unmotivated in superficial work relationships. I don’t like yelling or things thrown at me like hotel hospitality and McDonald’s where my manager got choked and dragged over the counter. I don’t do well with drunk people (they smashed our pizza store’s window), and all in all I’m only 4’9 tall and so I can’t do bodyguarding or bouncer jobs… 

I’m really stuck trying to apply to anything I can and seeing what jobs will take me but I’d like career advice if possible.

1jolbd0,Should I proceed with a technical interview at Spotify even if I feel unprepared?,"Hey all,

I’ve made it to the final interview round for a backend-related internship at Spotify, and honestly, I didn’t think I’d get this far. Impostor syndrome is real :sweat_smile:.

The next step is a technical interview split into two 1-hour sessions—one with the hiring manager, and one with engineers. It’ll include LeetCode-style questions, domain knowledge, and discussions about past projects. And here’s the kicker—I’m kind of spiraling now that I know how in-depth it might be.

I got their ""how we hire"" guide, but it didn’t make it clear that the technical interview would include actual coding challenges and potentially system design or backend-specific questions. I thought it would be more conversational and learning-focused, but I’ve now seen examples like:

- What’s the difference between TCP and UDP?

- What happens if an API you’re using is slow?

- And of course… LC mediums :grimacing:

The thing is, my past projects are all school-based, and I didn’t contribute anything super impressive. I also listed Java, SQL, and Python in my cover letter, and now I’m freaking out they’ll think I lied if I can’t demonstrate “proficiency” under pressure. I'm a TA for Java, sure, but it's an intro course and even I forget basic things sometimes.

I’ve now been crash-coursing Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and doing LeetCode problems all at once this week, but the interviews are this Friday and Monday, so time is short.

So my question is:

Should I still go through with the interviews knowing I might totally flop—just for the experience? Or is it fair to ask the recruiter if I could back out gracefully (without perhaps being blacklisted)?

I’m open to learning and know this would be great practice, but I’m also scared of wasting their time (or mine) if I’m just going to fumble through both interviews, and for 95% of the questions just answering that I'm not sure.

1jolaik,Hate my job. Feeling stuck.,"I’m in my mid 30s and only recently graduate with a degree in civil engineering. So far, I’ve realised it’s not for me. Long hours, dirty job sites and mostly difficult workers.

I feel like I’m stuck - I’m not a spring chicken and I need to get my finances sorted, but I also know I can’t last in this industry.

Hoping to hear from some late bloomers who ended up finding a job they didn’t hate and made a comfortable living off it. ",Disastrous_Good_5530,15,1.0,15,1743475152,2025-04-01 02:39:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jolaik/hate_my_job_feeling_stuck/,4,2025

1jojyy6,Feeling confident in deciding on a job.,"Hi everyone. I just recently posted about taking a day off a week after staring, but I actually have a bigger problem

I am about to sign onto my first ever full time job at an entertainment media company.  It is an incredible opportunity, at a start up owned by the company I interned with the last summer. I graduated college a little early, so I am already ahead of the curve. And I acknowledge it’s a lucky thing on my part. 

But I am scared. For a multitude of reasons. I am currently interviewing for another company, for basically the same exact job, just a different department (sports) . The problem I’m having is, this department at the job I am interviewing for is one I would much prefer to work at. At least, I think. I don’t really know that, but I’m saying it based off of my preference of what that department is. 

This other job is only on the second round and there will be 2 more after. I already have a job offer and a contract sent to me with this company I already know. But I am scared that if I take the job with the offer, I’ll never be able to make it into my dream field which is sports. 

If I deny the offer even though I verbally agreed already, I could be banking on the fact that I may not even get the job at the other company, and the fact that I applied to both these jobs with referrals the same day and already have an offer form one, and the other were only on the second round with probably another month of waiting to go. 

Tomorrow morning I am most likely going to sign the contract with the company. I acknowledge it’s too great to put down. 

I feel very naive and I have no idea what to do or how to feel or where to find comfort. I realize how insanely lucky I am to be in this position because I’m only 21 and struggling between jobs. If anyone has any sort of advice on how to feel better, please let me know.

1joji10,Should I Be Honest About Job Hunting or Bluff for a Full-Time Offer?,"Long story short I am a business major with a focus in information systems that works at company A not utilizing my degree doing work that I am not really interested in or see myself doing long term. Given the tough job market how do I go about a meeting I have with my manager about my future with the company. Should I be upfront that I am looking for new positions that align better with my major and what I want to do. Or should I bluff so that I can get a full time offer and then leave when I have something lined up? For reference this is a small company with 10-15 employees, they don't pay the greatest about 50k compared to what some of my classmates are getting 80-85k starting salary in jobs in my major. I am positive that even if I tell them that I am looking for work elsewhere they won't fire me or let me go because I play a decent part in easing the workload for other team members, and they would have to re train someone for a couple of months to be up to pace with me. But telling them how I truly feel may result in me possibly working at the same wage I am right now which is fine I guess. Any advice? I can elaborate more if there are questions.",Foundwr,2,1.0,2,1743469706,2025-04-01 01:08:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1joji10/should_i_be_honest_about_job_hunting_or_bluff_for/,4,2025
1jojdh7,Lessons from my 2300+ rejection letters,"I went through my entire internship and full-time job search journey during my school years. It’s not a success story, actually it’s full of failures. Just a typical journey of an average international student who didn’t give up.  
I received over 400 rejection letters for internships and more than 1,900 for full-time roles. But every effort finally paid off: I still landed 2 internships and 1 full-time offer in the toughest job markets. It took me countless days of failing, falling, and learning how to stand back up. I’ve collected the tips I summarized throughout my job search, and I hope they help anyone going through a tough time.

**Job Application**

Use different websites for different roles and companies. Always apply to the latest job postings.

[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/):

1. Apply only to roles posted within 24 hours to 2 weeks. Otherwise, it’s a waste of time. If a job has thousands of applicants, companies usually review the earliest ones first (confirmed by my HR friend). Applying early increases your chances of being seen.
2. Best for mid-sized and small companies, but avoid those with only 1 or 2 reviews or an employer rating below 2.5, skip and move on.
3. DM the company after applying. Introduce yourself briefly and explain how your experience aligns with the position.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/):

1. Apply only to roles posted within 24 hours to 2 weeks (same reason as Indeed).
2. Better for mid to large-sized companies, but beware of fake job postings.
3. Connect with alumni from your school and ask if they can provide a referral. Your resume could go directly to the hiring manager.
4. Follow recruiters, DM or cold email them. Introduce yourself and express your interest in their job openings.

[Handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/):

1. Apply only to roles posted within 24 hours to 2 weeks.
2. The best platform for students looking for internships (I landed my first internship here), though some roles may be unpaid.
3. Since Handshake is partnered with universities, your school is already a target school for the listed companies. This gives you a better chance compared to Indeed and LinkedIn, and job postings tend to be more reliable.

**Interview Preparation**

Keep practicing and refining answers. Set up your own cheat sheet for phone screens and behavioral questions.

[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/):

1. I checked company reviews and feedback from former employees, skipped those who have low ratings and negative reviews.
2. Great for seeking career advice from professionals in various industries.
3. Provides job market insights and useful articles to follow with the market trend.

**Resume Refinement**

Tailor your resume for specific roles: A data scientist resume for data scientist roles, a business analyst resume for business analyst roles.

Include only the most relevant experience and projects: Investment banking experience is irrelevant to a digital marketing role, even if it's from a top finance firm.

Relevant work experience matters more than your degree and major.

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/):

1. For company-specific resumes: Provide the job description along with your work experience and ask it to tailor your experience to align with the job requirements.
2. For general role resumes: Provide the role title, your experience, and projects, and ask it to align your experience with the required skills for that role.
3. My commonly used prompt: Based on \[JD or role\], revise \[experience\] to highlight \[required skills\] and align with the role's requirements.

Stay positive and keep pushing forward! I hope you don’t make the same mistakes I did: wish you apply fewer but more targeted applications and land your dream internships/job faster!

1joja3x,Did you have a positive resignation experience?,"I just got an official offer today for the job I was really hoping for. I’m super excited, but currently kinda dreading telling my current bosses. Just looking for some encouraging words from anyone who’s been in a similar situation with leaving a job for a new one on positive terms and the news being received well by your employers. Would like to try to ease my worried thoughts! 

We are a small business, I’ve been with them for almost 4 yrs since graduating college, and I really was a part of helping them grow financially and help shape their overall office organization. I know they’re going to be pretty bummed and shocked to see me go. They’ve treated me like family and it’ll be tough to break the news. I haven’t told them I’ve been casually looking/applying for jobs. It was one of those situations where I couldn’t really give them a heads up because I wasn’t applying to just any job, and I wouldn’t have been able to give a time frame of when I’d be leaving. 

This was about the 5th job I’ve applied for since December, and I got selected out of 100+ applicants so I’m really happy and proud of myself. It’s a bit of a career pivot, but something that aligns with my passion and values more than where I am now. I’m 28 and ready to grow professionally. 

I’ll be telling them all of these things, and I just hope they receive it well. Appreciate any thoughts, input, advice, or reality checks in the event that this could be received poorly and I might be miserable for the next 3 weeks if they’re mad lol.

1joiub9,Masters Degree Options,"I had a couple of general career questions. I am currently a second-semester Junior, graduating next year. I intend to hopefully work in Corporate Real Estate, Workplace Strategy, or workplace Services. By the time I graduate, I will have had two summers of internship experience in the field, and I have enjoyed working in such a field and felt like I have been able to try and make a positive impact on workplaces. 

I'm trying to see if there might be any good master's degrees that might be helpful to attain career-wise. That correlates with such a profession, if anyone has ideas or thoughts on whether or not I should pursue a master's as well I'd appreciate any feedback. I have had all positive experiences at my internships and commonly a question I have asked many employees across companies is ""Do you think a master degree is worth it"" and also ""If so do you think I should wait and go back to school later or try and enroll in masters programs right out of undergrad"".

1joitzk,"I'm disabled, and don't have a highschool diploma/GED. What are my options?","Hello, everyone. I'm in a tough situation right now. I got pulled out of school as a kid, and never made it to highschool, or had any real education. I also have pretty severe back problems, which severely limits my ability to do physical labor, as a first career option.

I moved out at 18, and have never had a job before, aside from some cheap babysitting on the side.   
I'm 20 now, and live in Colorado. Making matters worse, I don't own a car, and certainly can't afford one, so I'm doubly incentivized to work from home.  
  
I don't need to be able to support myself on this income, thankfully. Any money is better than no money, so I'm just looking to enter the work force and do what I can.   
I have no idea what I'm doing, or where I should even start. I feel woefully unprepared, and unsure of whether there are even career options for someone in my position.  
  
Any advice or information resources are greatly appreciated. I'm not looking to fish for pity, just giving as much context as I can. I've considered some sort of customer service job, where I can just get yelled at for a living, which I'd be fine with. I'm just truly unsure of where to start, or how to begin.

1joit43,Unsure of my next career steps after being in hospitality so long,"
Okay so I’m 22, I’ve been working in hospitality pretty much since I was 14. I am incredibly tired of it.

For reference, I live in Glasgow, financially independent, I got pretty good grades in my A levels in England and I’m a uni drop out. I rent, so a significant amount of my wages are gone at the end of the month. Meaning I can’t take a significant pay cut by becoming an apprentice etc. 

I dropped out 3 years ago, and since I’ve kind of just been stuck in full time hospitality work. I’ve been with the same company, the pay is shit, I’ve “progressed up the ladder” into lower management and I hate that lol. I just needed the money to make ends meet. 

I just feel like I’m going to be stuck in hospitality forever if I don’t move on soon, and it depresses me so much. Even if I’m at uni at the same time at least I could cut back my hours. 

I dropped out of uni because of mental health reasons and also the course I was doing was not really going to get me a secure job (English lit and history joint hons). 

I want change, desperately. I want to stop feeling like I’m not going anywhere. 

There’s a lot of career options of course but I’m not even sure what I would want to do.
I’ve thought about going into IT or law through uni. I have background to get into law with my a levels, I’m not sure about IT. But I have a decent amount of personal knowledge etc.

I’d love to do art work professionally, particularly tattoo work, but I’m more than aware how hard it is to break into, and I need something stable so I could even begin to think about something like that as a career. Or any of the craft stuff I love to do. A few people have suggested I go to art school but I’m not overly interested to be honest. I have a small business of commissionable art, I do some work for local bands and events, but I couldn’t really see that taking off full time, especially not with the mass rise of AI.

I don’t know if there is a decent career with a nice amount of creativity in it? I’d love to have a solid path to go down, or something that someone would be like “hey you should look into becoming xyz!” Just any guidance whatsoever, what jobs are out there. What paths to go down. 

I mainly just want something stable, that will pay the bills and give me time outside of work (work life balance shit) or to at least have a solid path to work down to reach those goals.

Idk, any advice is very much appreciated 

Tldr;
Career path advice for creative person who just wants a stable income and good work/life balance!

1joiija,"Waiting on update after final interview, what should I do?","I live on the East Coast and found a job on the West Coast in a very niche industry that I also currently work in, this job is for the top company in this industry. Back in December I was browsing jobs and went on LinkedIn and found out that a former classmate of mine who I’ve done a couple projects with works for one of the companies I was looking at and is coincidentally hiring for one of the top jobs on my list to apply for. It’s an entry/mid-level position within the company testing their tech and would be fantastic experience for me, so I reached out to this classmate of mine (site manager) and asked him about the position and he encouraged me to apply. 

He said he was initially hiring for contractors on a 6-month contract, but would consider me for a full time position if I met all the requirements (no guarantees), especially since one of my concerns was the money and effort it would take to relocate there, and he said that they provide relocation expenses, which would make me feel more comfortable with this big move. I applied, interviewed with him, had a good convo, and then he set me up for a gauntlet of 5 back-to-back interviews with many questions and “thought exercises” to see how I’d respond to certain scenarios. I felt like I did a fantastic job on these, gave them all the answers they were looking for, and then they decided to fly me out to the west coast to tour the site and get to know everyone there for an entire shift. That was an amazing experience, talked to a lot of really cool folks and all in all felt like I left a great impression. It legitimately felt like I already had the job there and people were making recommendations for places to move. I asked this site manager towards the end of the visit what the next steps would be and he said that the hiring manager who organized all of these interviews and the visit will reach out to me with an update and would be the one to draft up a job offer and send it to me. I felt like I was gonna receive an offer within a week with how well things have went.

This all happened at the end of February and it is currently the end of March. 2 weeks after the visit I sent an email to both the site and hiring manager checking in for an update and the site manager responded telling me he is still making a decision and will get back to me as soon as he does. It’s been over two weeks since then, and I called the hiring manager last Friday in the morning and left a voicemail asking him to call me back as I had a couple of questions and things to mention. It’s currently Monday EOD and I’m still waiting for a call back from him. 

There’s a couple of considerations for me though. For one, my lease expires in 2 weeks, and I want to know whether I need to renew my lease or not. I reached out to them last week and stopped by their office pleaing for an extension of my lease, and fortunately they offered me to pay month-to-month at a slightly increased rate or do a 6 month renewal for the same rate. Regardless, they would like an answer soon. Secondly, my father would help me with the move if I do accept the offer, and he would need to take off work to do so and is putting pressure on me to email the site manager telling him to call me so that I can ask about an update. 

I’m kinda torn because I already reached out twice and they still haven’t gave me an update, but would like one soon since it’s been over a month. Initially I was ecstatic about the opportunity of moving there and working this job, as the experience, compensation, and benefits would be a big upgrade despite the move. I also tried to lined
 this up so that I would hopefully have accepted a job offer and began the moving process before I have to renew my lease. But at this point I’m almost 50/50 on it and am honestly okay with the outcome of this not working out, although unfortunately it will be much harder for me to find another job where I live with my experience in this industry, and I’m starting to hate my current job. 

Anyways, what should I do? Should I email them and ask them to call me and continue bothering me? Or should I just be patient and continue to wait it out with the anxiety of not knowing what my future is gonna look like? It’s a big decision to make, and if the job offer is good enough, then I would make the move, but honestly it might be better for me to just stay here.
