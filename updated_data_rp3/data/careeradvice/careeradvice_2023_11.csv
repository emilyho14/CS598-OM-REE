187wvt0,Does this sound like a good thank you letter?,"I was recently interviewed for a job as a Cabin Keeper for a cabin resort. I had drafted a thank you email following the interview. Please proof read it. I have replaced the name of the interviewer with (insert name here) and replaced the name of the resort where I would work with (Insert name of resort here).

Hello Ms. (insert name here).

I would like to thank you for taking time out of your day to interview me yesterday. I enjoyed our conversation about my potential job as Cabin Keeper for (Insert name of resort here). You suggested that I stay at one of the company’s locations at some point, that way I might come back with some helpful suggestions as to what can be improved. That tells me that the company is run by people who pride themselves on self improvement. I too prioritise self improvement.

I did an internship in college. During that internship, I had to work with other interns. This often required me to collaborate and coordinate with these students. That is what I would need to do with my fellow Cabin Keepers in this occupation.

When I worked at Dunkin Donuts, one of my responsibilities was cleaning. That is what I would need to do in this job.

I look forward to further discussion about this opportunity. Contact me if you have any other questions.

187wkl8,Advice Needed: Potentially Traveling Out of State for Training,"About an hour ago I received a verbal offer for a procurement buyer position in the Midwest with a $55k salary after being unemployed for almost 2 months. The HR rep I spoke with told me that I would receive an email likely tomorrow containing the official offer. I'm happy since I'd like to have healthcare insurance and an income... However I'm asking for advice on what I think is a tricky situation involving what training would look like. The HR rep mentioned that my manager and her boss don't really know what training is going to look like for me, whether I stay in the state I'm in currently or travel to another state over (still in the Midwest, 2.5 hours away from where I live) for training, then come back home once I'm done. They also don't know how I'm going to get my equipment for my hybrid work arrangement yet either. 

Would it be too much to ask if they'll pay for travel accommodations (hotel, food, gas) for the time I'd need to be out of state for training before I sign an official offer? My parents think it would be, thinking I should just be happy getting an offer and just handle whatever comes up money wise on my own if the employer doesn't offer anything and treat this as 'an adventure'. I really want the clarification in writing before I sign anything either in an email or in my offer letter, but I'm afraid of asking because the last thing I want is to get my offer rescinded for merely asking for financial assistance for this.",esche10,1,1.0,0,1701386854,2023-11-30 23:27:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187wkl8/advice_needed_potentially_traveling_out_of_state/,11,2023

187uiok,Turning down a job offer without closing doors. Is it possible? What are things you've said?,"First of all, I've worked for my current org for several years. It's a pretty solid job, I make good money, and I'm good at what I do, although not currently super jazzed about it.   

Second, I had a baby this year, so that's a new life factor. I'm a bit tired all the time, but we're making it work.   

I guess I started applying for jobs because I figured it would take three months to get a new job. But actually I applied for a few, got an interview, got a second interview, now headed toward the next round. They're asking for my salary requirements and...I've realized I don't know that I have the energy to do that all right now. It makes me tired to think about negotiating. I'm not even sure what I was thinking, other than I've typically been a pretty driven person, so my brain was like, ""hey, you should start thinking about your next career step, now that the baby is sleeping through the night."" I don't know, I'm having a bit of a realization that staying in a steady role is actually ideal vs jumping into a new thing. My spouse is supportive of whatever I choose and we're financially stable either way.

I think I could be great at this role (it's very similar to what I do, but I'd be able to move into leadership easier and I do want that...but not now, I think).

187u96n,Should I get a HR Certification,"Hi All!
I am a Talent Acquisition professional with 9+ years of experience in tech recruiting. And I have slowly reached the point where I don’t really see recruitment as a career path for myself, I am on the “path” to be a talent manager in my company for 2024-25 and nothing scares me more lol (I see how shitty my boss’ weeks can be depending on the hiring season and I don’t really think I’m cut out for it) 

I have given some thought to pivoting into other areas and exploring other roles and something that interests me is being HR partner, working on employee development etc. 

I wanted to ask what would be your suggestions for a HR certification (SHRM, CHRP etc)? Would you recommend pursuing one? And if you have one yourself - how did you choose which one you wanted to do? All the information out there on certifications is quite mixed. I truly believe it’s time for me to invest in upskilling myself and consider other routes. 
I am open to all your suggestions and course recommendations that you believe would be helpful.

187u45w,Nervous nervous me! How do I stop being so nervous when speaking to higher ups in my firm?,"
Looking for some serious advice here. Note that I did post this in r/careerguidance but I am just so discouraged and that post has picked up little steam. 

For some background I am a very nervous and anxious person in general. Always have had social anxiety and it’s always exacerbated when I speak with higher ups (I am in a relatively entry level role myself— senior associate at my firm). My mom has always said I have an inferiority complex which is true. 

I just had my mid-year career conversation with my team lead. I have otherwise been working very hard and have been receiving great feedback on my work. 

I thought my conversation was going well. I was nervous of course but I thought I was getting some good points across. However, turns out that I was wrong. My boyfriend (who also works in a corporate role, albeit in a much higher level) listened in from the other room. As soon as my call ended, I went into the room feeling okay. He just gave me a look of disapproval and proceeded to point out all the filler words (um, like, etc) that I used. He said I sounded almost childish, way too friendly, and not serious enough. That’s my default when I get nervous — a friendly voice that was (apparently) not appropriate in the context. 

For some more context, I am hoping to get to a manager role in the coming year. My boyfriend pointed out that if I cannot even speak eloquently to my team lead (a managing director), then how can he take me seriously as a confident and capable worker, worthy of a promotion?

Please help me out, I struggle so much with this. And now I just feel crappy about myself especially because I thought the discussion went okay but my boyfriend seems to disagree.",freakinovernada,21,1.0,15,1701380725,2023-11-30 21:45:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187u45w/nervous_nervous_me_how_do_i_stop_being_so_nervous/,11,2023

187t99r,Interviewing Within a Niche Industry,"Background:

I'm an engineer, working in a fairly niche field for the last 2 years. My team works exclusively on projects for a single client (one of the largest in the industry) who has their own unique requirements, and there's less than a dozen firms in the country that contract with this client to work on the same types of projects that I work on. All this to say I dwell in this subspecialty where everyone knows everyone, even if they're on the other side of the country.

My industry has been turned upside down by recent regulatory requirements, and my current employer is at the forefront of adapting to these changes. The senior members of my team have been working with the client to standardize new procedures and implement new technologies over the past year, and these changes were distributed to the other firms a few weeks ago as the SOP for all projects moving forward, so all the other firms are panicking (they weren't given any advance warning, and the changes are substantially technically different).

Situation: 

I've had a couple of these competing firms reach out to me through LinkedIn, trying to poach me. I don't have any desire to change employers, but I'd still like to see what they're offering, and at the very least practice my interviewing skills. But I'm also afraid of it getting back to my current employer, since whoever I interview with will most likely know my boss on a first name basis.

Question:

Does anyone have advice on how to approach this situation? I'm also fairly young in my career, only 3 years out of university.",Balagin,1,1.0,0,1701378666,2023-11-30 21:11:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187t99r/interviewing_within_a_niche_industry/,11,2023

187s7js,Are there any effective strategies for dealing with a micromanager other than over-communicating?,"Over-communicating with a micromanager was the worst advice I ever got. It just increased the expectation of more communication. Backstory is I worked with an extreme micromanager for more years than I care to admit. I was a top performer in at the company (small start up, micromanager was the owner) but after several years of stellar performance, turning revenue around from negative to consistent growth, he still couldn't let go. I tried to have conversations about it with him but that didn't work.  
I started working with a career coach who gave me advice to over-communicate, start sending weekly updates - once at the beginning of the week outlining everything that my team and I were going to work on that week, and once at the end of the week recapping progress. I followed this advice and the micromanager loved it so much he asked for daily updates. Then he asked for separate updates for each person on my team. Every. Day. The more I over-communicated, the more he demanded. At that point I could not even keep up with my work I was too busy tracking what everyone was doing and sending progress reports. It was horrible and I ended up leaving because it got so bad.  
I now have a client who is a micromanager and I want to try a different approach before I make the call that it isn't a good fit. I don't want to set the expectation that I'm going to communicate beyond what is reasonable (not going to drop everything and jump at every message or try to anticipate what they'll be anxious about so I can be proactive/get ahead of it, that wasn't good for my mental health in the past). I've heard suggestions of overwhelming them with every little decision, but that honestly sounds exhausting to me and I don't know that it will really fix the issue.

187s0gt,Internship - Postponed Graduation Date,"Not sure how to navigate this situation. Any advice would be appreciated!

My graduation date has always been the spring of 2025. I interned at a large company in the summer of 2023, and loved it! Really want to work for this place full-time. I did great in the internship, and was told that I'd have a full-time offer if I graduated tomorrow.

I'm returning to this company again for the summer of 2024. This time to their HQ (told them I was interested in exploring new locations, and they got me an interview with HQ!). 

However, I failed a class this semester and my new graduation date is December of 2025. When I accepted the return internship, my graduation date was still spring of 2025.

Do I tell them about my change in graduation date? Or is this a lose-lose? I REALLY don't want them to rescind my internship offer for this summer, but I also don't want this it to be awkward when I tell my manager my graduation date is December and she was expecting May. What do y'all think?

187qmye,Job Transition after Acquisition,"Hi all!

Seeking some advice on what to do as a recent Master's recipient trying to transition out of sales. 

I started at my current company as a Sales Development Representative about a year and a half ago. It was incredibly flexible, WFH, unlimited PTO, great benefits, and great company culture. The company was acquired not long before I got there, but the parent company was pretty hands-off, and things were smooth sailing until this past summer. I achieved a Master's Degree in Digital Marketing in and Data Analytics in August and made it clear to my boss I wanted to transition to the marketing team, and she was very supportive and began to talk to upper management who could make that possible. After a few weeks, red tape kept coming up from the higher ups at the parent company. Now, it's been six months and I still have the same title and pay and am being told to ""wait it out until they figure it out"".

On top of that, the new company is beginning to roll out new contracts. Because of this, my unlimited PTO is going down to 16 days a year. They will also become more strict about coming into the office twice a week (for context, I work from home except for major meetings or events that occur a couple times a month). The flexible work/life balance I chose when I applied for the inital company is now going away, so now I'm thinking about looking elsewhere (for this reason as well as a diminishing work culture and lack of fulfilment in the industry I'm in).

Finding a new job is going to be tough now, however. When looking at my resume, you will see Sales Development, but I want to transition to marketing. And even entry-level marketing jobs require a lot of experience that this job has not given me. So I'm debating on ""waiting it out"" until I can get a title change to be more marketing-focused or just starting from scratch somewhere else. 

Thanks for reading, I'm happy to clarify any questions and to read any advice from someone who's been through something similar.

187owo3,Confused at boss becoming distant?,"Hi,

I have been in my job for a few years and have had the same boss throughout that time. My boss is of a similar age to me.
I initially thought that I had a good working relationship with my boss. I thought we were in a somewhat cordial and friendly position work wise. We would talk somewhat frequently and had some casual conversations in work.

Our wider team also used to go out for meals at lunch sometimes. (Out as in to a cafe or restaurant. ) Admittedly this wasn’t frequent but frequent that it was somewhat regular. 

The team also used to coordinate days that we would be in work together.

About a year ago this all stopped. The team meals, everything.

My boss has become increasingly distant over the past couple of months. My boss avoids coming to work on the same days as me, and frequently changes the days they come in. I know this because I have changed the days that I come in on a few occasions and rarely see my boss.

If we are in on the same days (now rare), my boss will not sit next to me and is essentially very curt and work based. To contrast this on these same days, my boss will sit with other colleagues and have a normal, casual/jokey conversation.

We don’t typically have casual conversations anymore, if a casual conversation does occur it’s very surface based and lasts no more than a few minutes.

I raised all of this with my boss, as I am concerned. My boss pretended not to know what I was talking about and implied that the meals we had gone on only occurred on a few occasions. ( this is not the case, we went out about 10+ times, I looked back in my bank statements because I thought I was going mentally insane and imagining the meals by my bosses response.)

My boss at this point is supportive in a work capacity but no longer communicates with me in a social manner and does not tell me what is going on in their life. I now overhear what’s going on in their life from other colleagues, instead of from them directly (as I used to).

They behave in a hot and cold manner, sometimes being quite cordial, and even casual, other times just very distant and ignoring me.

I feel somewhat taken a back from this and am confused. I don’t understand what I have done to elicit this behaviour. I feel a very cold vibe and a lack of empathy towards the situation.

I don’t believe the change is anything to do with my employment status, as I have received frequent praise.

I just sort of feel a tad used/manipulated. In that we had this cordial/friendly relationship and they’ve turned that off with no explanation.

What is likely to have happened here and what should I do?",GooseEasy7709,1,1.0,2,1701367599,2023-11-30 18:06:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187owo3/confused_at_boss_becoming_distant/,11,2023
187njj9,New job offer advice,"Currently at $90k/yr, great benefits, hybrid schedule. I go into office 3 days a week. 
This is a large global company. Very stable, billions in revenue. Been around 30 years. Have been there 3 years. Just got a promotion and raise. They treat me fairly well. Employee owned and I get shares in company every year. It is a company you can retire from if you stick it out.  

My bosses boss left company and went to another. He called and gave me job offer for $105k, I asked for more and they bumped it to $110k. This job is fully remote, similar benefits. Smaller team but works on a platform I'm more familiar with. Smaller company too, around $100 million in revenue, but has been around 35 years. They do quarterly profit sharing, if the company is profitable. For what they make, it's the best you can get and industry standard for many use cases. 

Is the pay raise enough/worth it? The remote is a nice aspect, but I am semi remote already. But I really don't like being in the office. It's a satellite office and I don't interact with anyone there, because we don't have a reason to.

187mela,CPA to commercial pilot?,"Hello all, 

  
I'm at a crossroads in my life. I have been an accountant (CPA) for nearly a decade. I worked at a big 4 for about 5 years and am now in industry. My job is going away soon (merger) and it feels like I'm making a clean break and maybe could do a career change. 

  
I don't hate being an accountant and currently I make around $115k base, which is fine, but with the cost of living I'm not sure if I can afford to buy a house. I also can't say that I love accounting or have a passion for it. 

  
Recently I've been considering going to flight school and becoming a commercial pilot. My hastily put together plan would be to try to do training in Canada (I'm Canadian) and eventually transfer to the USA. I've been on and off again interested in flying since I was a teenager, so while I'd say the money is probably my first consideration, it's not without genuine interest.  

  
So redditers, give me advice. Being a commercial pilot could be very lucrative in the future, but it's not like I have a bad career or career progression right now.

187lr1f,Should I accept a job offer as backup and continue interviewing?,"I have started interviewing for a new role recently and some companies take ages in the hiring process due to many interviews and some are pretty fast. 
I am not sure if this is something that is ethical or legal to do but would it be possible to accept an offer I got and continue interviewing? I have great companies lined up and would at least like to know if I would have a chance to work with them and this one was honestly not in my top 3. 
I also do not want to end up without a job just because I declined this one and tried for the more interesting ones. This is still a great offer and the people were kind and took a lot of effort to set everything up so I do not want to disrespect them as well. 

I obviously need to write them that I will need time to decide but I cannot let them wait for a month or so until I am done interviewing the other ones. A week is not enough time to get to the offer stage of the other companies.

187lkig,I’m working on a project with my dishonest boss and I discovered he fudged data to work in his favor,"I’ve written about my boss before. He’s a very dishonest person. I’ve been working with his manager and HR to resolve issues, but honestly nothing has really changed. Him and I working on a project to recap some business information over the last quarter. I noticed the portion he did he fudged data that would work in his favor. For example, he pitched a client for us to work with that leadership did not like and their results were very poor. Since he knows leadership wasn’t pleased with the client, he fudged the data to make it seem like the results were way better than what they were. I also noticed that a former employee pitched a client who did amazing and he fudged her results to look way worse and she’s obviously not here anymore to defend herself. He also still is determined to work with this client despite leadership not liking them which is why I think he’s also fudging the data. Also to be clear the data is off tremendously. It’s not like he rounded a few numbers. 

I don’t want to be a tattle tell, but this is a project and report that will go to the president of the company. I also have worked on it. Some of the information can easily be figured out is false. What do I do? Should I mention this to his boss or should I mention this to HR? My HR partner has been quite supportive and said my manager making the team look poorly in front of cross functional partners is unacceptable and I feel if this information is found out to be false, that obviously won’t make the team look good. 

He will rip my head off for even looking into this or honestly come up with some explanation that makes zero sense how he got those numbers so I feel approaching my manger about it is a waste of time. I did think about asking him if those were typos but he’s so defensive of anything I say since I’ve reported him.

187krmu,Should I add this work experience in my CV?,"I didn’t pass my work probation. I knew this was coming and should have resigned earlier but it’s too late. However, I’m glad it’s over!

The major reason why I wanted to quit was because my team mates are super toxic, rude and unhelpful at times. I tried super hard to put up with their rude and toxic behaviour! I really miss my ex managers & colleagues, they were way more open, friendly, welcoming and nice! I totally don’t feel belong here and I feel I’m in danger. 

I feel like they didn’t pass my probation because they didn’t like me or feel threatened by me. Because only in a short period of 3 months, I was able to solve many difficult issues and revamped a new process. I even had a good feedback from people outside of my team. I feel everything is so biased! But whatever, IDGAF anymore!

I know my manager dislikes me because she has been super rude and manipulative towards me. Not only my manager but EVERYONE! It’s just weird.. I can work well with others just not my team members. I feel my manager hates me because she said I didn’t ask for help from own team mates.. I did asked but they shoot me down, were BUSY and unsure. They basically like to put me down and make me look stupid when I ask a genuinely curious questions. The way they replied to my questions at times is equivalent to NOT REPLYING AT ALL! 

I want to put this work experience in my CV as it is a higher level position compared to my previous role but I’m afraid my next employer would ask why was my time there so short and they might ended up digging deeper? I know for sure that it’s not my issue and that I am capable, just that all of them are creating roadblocks to my work and just wanna outcast me! Anyway, it’s ending soon!

187kf7x,Withdrawing Application if I Think I May Fail Technical Assessment,"I recently have been applying for some roles to test the waters and recently have moved onto the final technical assessment. Location is out of state and requires 100% in person. Seeing I’ve been mainly passively looking, the interview isn’t something I’ve been stressing/preparing too much for. 

Currently I’m in a stable entry level position making ~90k and comfortable with my situation. Location is great, family and friends close by and quality of life and WLB is good. 

Currently on the fence on whether or not to continue with the interviewing process. To be completely honest, if I do get through and get an offer at the current stage I’m in, I would probably decline simply because of the location and family/friends situation. However, in the future if my situation changes, this company would still be a place I would be interested to work at and the state isn’t one that I would be opposed to living in (similar cost of living). The position would have a slightly lesser WLB and Glassdoor says estimated TC for position is ~120k. It is also a smaller company. 

Would declining the interview and reapplying in the future (when I would be more seriously looking) be a better idea for future consideration? Or would it be worth it to take the interview for experience / potentially eliminating myself from future consideration. I’m assuming failing the assessment and trying again would be a bit of a bad look for the future if I’m more serious in applying.

In the old job, I was capable and one of the best people of my department. I quit without burning bridges behind but it would be a little hit on my pride if I come back.

Should I still bother?","I applied for a government job I really want quite a while back and over the course of a few months underwent an interview process and had been advised that I'd be getting onboarded ""soon"".

I applied to job A at the end of October. I got called to do an interview with the person I’d be working for around when I was getting recruited for another company, job B. The interview went really well, but I didn’t hear back in the few days they gave me to expect an answer. I got an offer for job B, so sent an email to job A to let them know for transparency, I got an offer but they’re my priority and is there a way to expedite the interview process. 

The internal recruiter called me within the same day to set up the next round and let me know it’s between me and one other person, so they also have to plan the interview with the other person after. 

I did the long final interview, and I nailed it. I connected with everyone I met, we had really fantastic conversations and it went really well. Sent a thank you email to the recruiter and she immediately got back and said she was happy it went so well. This was on the 16th. 

On Monday the 20th, I emailed thanking her again and asking when I could expect to hear back on a decision. She said they’re aiming to make a decision that week. Thanksgiving came so it cut the week off short. 

I know the company is doing a lot of hires so HR is under a lot of pressure and slow. I’m getting nervous though. I feel really good about this job and feel like Im an amazing match, but now it’s taking a while.

187bhab,23 y/o with school paid for— change my master’s degree?,"Hi everyone, I (23F), have landed the deal of a lifetime and am working for my university— they pay me and they pay for my degree. It’s wonderful.

But I am wondering if it’s sustainable.

 I work full time and then I’m in full time graduate school on top of it, so I’m pulling 70 hour weeks between work and studying at this point. The format of the grad program will take me at least 2.5 more years to complete, I’m coming up on the end of my second quarter now. Its a highly competitive degree to get into and I fought super hard to make it into a program like this. 

Here’s the dilemma. School is paid for, as long as I don’t burn out and quit my job or school for the next 2.5 years of non stop 48 weeks a year 70 weeks and then I’ve got a 2 year long supervision and licensing process in my state. 

Or. I can pivot. Change my degree program to a flexible schedule degree and do the “next best” degree, as fast as I can and just put my head down to get it done. Then I could work in IO psych, make a lot more money than I am now — and go back over time and finish my other degree at a slower pace while doing something I like a lot more than what I’m doing now.

1879mt7,is 65k a good salary for a developer with ~2 experience in Pittsburgh? If not what should I expect?,"I’m a developer with almost 2 years of experience in Pittsburgh. I work for a consulting company and do full stack web development. My tech stack is react, .NET, a CMS platform, Azure, and a lot more but those are the day to days. I would say I’m pretty proficient and constantly make deadlines and if not take on more work than I am allotted. Right now I am working within Azure AI and OpenAI and developing chatbots and machine learning stuff. Oh and I aim for at least two certifications a year. I currently have 4, including azure cloud fundamentals and azure ai fundamentals. When inquiring about a salary increase I was told that I am a young developer (im 26) and have a lot to learn. I think everyone has a lot to learn regardless of age lol. Anyways I’m currently making 65k annually. To me that seems really low for the value I am able to provide to clients and my ability to study and obtain new certifications.

I know people get protective of this profession and I’m not trying to come off like I’m a know it all or anything. I realize I know nothing in the grand scheme of things. I’m just trying to be objective. I want to become the best developer I can be but also make enough money to provide a good life for a family along the way.  I’m tired of worrying about money and saving for the future. Everything is so expensive and it’s crippling. When I look around at my co-workers that have a similar job title and maybe a few ranks above, I can tell I have a lot more drive and am able to be more productive day to day. I believe anyone can be that way, but not a lot of people put in the effort they kinda just except life the way it is. 

Anyways the reason I’m saying all this, is because I know there is money to be made in this profession. I know there are insane paying jobs out there and I know I’m not going to ever get there if I just keep getting told “you’re a young developer with a lot to learn” and stick with the same job trying to earn a managers approval or feel like I’m reel developer only once they tell me I am. I want a piece of the action and I’m willing to do what I have to get to the stepping stone that brings me closer to where I want to be. Hopefully this made sense.

18794m7,"Lost, unsure how to pivot back into the workforce","  
Hey Reddit community,  
  
I'm facing a crucial career crossroads and could really use your insights and advice. Here's a snapshot of my situation:

I left my last job as a shop floor man in a manufacturing environment after six months, right at the onset of the pandemic. I was miserable, burnt out, and struggling with my mental health. Despite the decent pay ($40/hr), I realized that the manufacturing sector isn't where I thrive or find fulfillment. Currently, I'm living with my parents in Canada (Ontario), debt-free, but my savings cushion is depleting.  
  
Since then, I've been pursuing day trading for the past three years, but it hasn't been as successful as I'd hoped. Now, with dwindling savings, I'm ready to turn the page and explore new career paths. I hold an undergrad degree in industrial engineering, but I'm uncertain about the next steps.  
  
I'm particularly interested in transitioning to business analytics, intelligence/data analytics, or UI/UX design roles. I got accepted into a Master of Engineering program at the University of Toronto with a focus on analytics (data science/machine learning). However, upon closer examination, I've realized that I'm not enthusiastic about the heavy math involved in data science. My preference leans towards entry-level analytics roles, but the current job market and a sizable resume gap pose challenges.  
  
Recently, I discovered that UofT offers a Master of Information program with a focus on UX-Design and co-op opportunities. However, if I apply to this program, I'd have to start in September 2024, with no guarantee of getting in.   
  
Another option on my radar is massage therapy, a registered profession in Ontario currently in high demand. The potential pay is enticing, ranging from $60-90/hr at clinics and even more if I take the entrepreneurial route after building a clientele. The only drawback is that registered massage therapists (RMTs) typically work 25-30 hours a week due to the physical demands.  I've always been into sports, lifting, mindfulness, and meditation. But on the flip side, RMT careers also seem to be short-lived.   
  
Given these choices, I'm grappling with the decision of whether going back to school is my only viable option. If I opt for further education, it would take approximately two years, regardless of the path chosen. I'm not sure if a BootCamp would be viable since I already have an undergraduate degree and with BootCamp reputation sentiment going downhill. I'm under a time crunch as classes are set to start in January for the M.Eng program, and I'd greatly appreciate any advice or insights you might have.

But I'm.not fulfilled in my position and I severely worry about my companies future.

My day to day job is quite simple for the most part. We have a lot of down time where I do nothing at all. I get to clock in from home every day which is great. So much about my position is amazing and I would hate to give up my work life balance but I need to do something else.

I started a new position in my company a few years ago giving me all these great benefits (besides actual benefits like good healthcare and retirement) but I've never really gotten good training on how to do this position. I haven't had a direct boss for over a year. I constantly worry about being laid off, my company does nation wide layoffs more often than I would like.

I love my job but it doesn't feel like something that I can sustain for a long time and I want to go in a different direction. I don't have any schooling, or any skills I can show on paper. Every time I try and look for a new job the pay is so low I just can't afford to take that loss of income.
I have a considerable amount of debt (30k) and I'm planning on getting married in the next few years.

I’m looking at changing careers from my HR federal government position to a landscape/landscape design career.

Context: I’m a m22 from from Australia and I have just finished a bachelors in business and I landed an 80k a year job on the federal government working in HR. Although I don’t enjoy the office environment or HR as I find it very draining as I don’t get to see my results I also don’t enjoy sitting at a desk for 8 hours. Also looking at managers or directors they seems to have no life outside of work and to be miserable.

I’m thinking of doing landscaping or landscape design. I come from a family line of plant growers and nursery owners. I have a high appreciation for gardens and Australian natives. I also enjoy gardening in my spare time. I know it’s back breaking work but I think I’d love the skills I’d learn along the way and hopefully I could run my own business one day where I’d be more designing landscapes and not on the tools as much. 

My questions, is this a dumb idea as I’d have to take a significant pay cut. It would be a 3 year apprenticeship that would pay $21  an hourlthough my parents are happy for me to live at home rent free while I try and work out what I enjoy. Also is it possibly to make large amounts of money. 

My dream is to have my own landscaping design company where I work with Australian natives and build natural pools.

187672d,Career and education advice for an almost 24-year old,"Hello redditors!

I have a few questions regarding what should I do after my Master's. I'll lay my background quite bluntly to make it easier to receive tailored advice—I have absolutely no interest in ""bragging"" here otherwise.

Tl;dr version:

I will be 24 when I finish my master's but need fluency to access the foreign policy analyst/political risk analyst positions that really interest me. Would doing a year of Chinese language in China (while maybe writing a few pieces to create an interesting portfolio) and then reapply to the Schwarman Scholars Program make me too old to start a career (at 26yo)?

Note: Schwarzman Scholars = rather prestigious, fully-funded Master's degree hosted in China. where career development is very valued, e.g. including a mentorship scheme, internship opportunities, post-graduation fellowships, etc

Long version:

I am a 23-years old French student who studied English studies with a minor in IR in France for my undergraduate degree. My English was not very good (typical French) at that time and I wanted to study something international so I thought it would make a good combo.

Did very well there, spent a year teaching French in the UK to perfect my English, and I am now attending a degree in Chinese Studies at a very prestigious university (not in the US). My rationale was to have an ""expertise"" in both American foreign policy and language and likewise for China. Preferably I would like to work in the broadly defined IR world (not in diplomacy though) with issues related to China, East-Asia, US foreign policy, and the Indo-Pacific. 

Small caveat: I will have an intermediate level in Chinese next year, which is not enough to use it professionally yet. I applied to the Schwarman Scholars program as I thought it would give me professional opportunities while continuing learning Chinese. However, my application was not unsuccessful—I am waitlisted but doubt enough people will refuse their offers because of the prestige of the program. 

I am thinking that spending a year in China learning the language while maybe contributing to a China- focused outlet, or perhaps a think-tank in some capacity, could be a great idea. I am also considering applying again to Schwarman Scholars as it opens door to high-level think tanks dedicated to studying China and US-China relations. 

However, I would be 26 after these 2 years, which is quite old by French standards to start a career. I do not intend on starting my career in France, even if I wouldn't refuse an interesting job offer, but still do not want to hurt my profile by doing unnecessary side steps. 

Thank you for any piece of advice!",Avenn17,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1701308156,2023-11-30 01:35:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/187672d/career_and_education_advice_for_an_almost_24year/,11,2023

Turns out, I HATE it. I am constantly reading the work updates page (work Facebook) and looking at the people positing shit they pretend to care about, or people hitting milestones that we ALL know doesn’t matter, I just roll my eyes. 

I once heard someone say “we’re all just playing pretend in an environment that someone made up, none of it REALLY matters”. Now I can’t stop thinking about it. 

I have no passion for this job, I don’t care about the business goals, nor do I give a shit about reaching my “performance goals”. 

I studied business as I thought this is what I wanted. But within the past 2 months.. I am feeling my soul being drained from my body. I actually hate this.

1875ah3,Colleague treats me like a subordinate. I’ve never been in this position and need tips on handling.,"I started a new role in September and my colleague, same role and title, speaks to me and another peer like subordinates. 

At first I let it go and didn’t think too much of it. Now it’s starting to really rub me the wrong way and I don’t know how to address it. 

It’s very passive and near snarky. Almost nice, but not quite.

For example, we’ll talk about task delegation and she’s not involved in the task. Then she will chime in and say “you should do xyz and she should do abc,” and give directives on something she’s not even a part of. 

My other peer is very nice and very sweet, but also younger than me with not as much corporate experience, so she kind of just takes it. I do not want to seem like the snotty new manager but I also do not want to be spoken to like I am her employee.

18758qr,I feel lost in my career as a mechanical engineer. Please help me find a job that doesn’t kill me via stress,"Hello askengineers. I have a problem and I’m hoping this community can help. 

The problem is that my current job is potentially not a great fit for me. I’m sure there is a great fit for me somewhere that I just haven’t considered yet. Any input is appreciated!

I’m an HVAC designer. I spend most of my time changing calculations and redrawing systems in Revit to coordinate with an ever-changing architectural model. This is at times very frustrating to me and seems to drain me of energy to the point that the rest of my life is negatively affected.

There are things I love about my job. It’s fully remote. There are decent benefits and the pay’s not bad. The company is large enough to have ample training resources and great software integrations. I love working hard with my team to meet goals and thinking creatively to solve problems. 

I think the main thing that’s not working for me is the sheer amount of information I’m responsible for on the drawings. Pretty much every day I find myself completely overwhelmed at the amount of tasks that I either don’t know how to do or know I’ll have to do over again as soon as something else changes. It could be partly that my company isn’t the best at planning these things out.

I’ve been thinking about my options. I think I would thrive in a role that’s more high-level. Something where I can use my problem-solving skills more and spend less time worrying about hundreds of tiny details that change multiple times a week. I feel like I’m working on the wrong level. I could be very effective at a lot of jobs, but it’s becoming obvious to me that my brain isn’t wired for this level of detail (at least not all day every day). I’ve been working in this role for 3 years and it’s not gotten much easier. 

Here are some options I’ve been considering:
Management/PM (still MEP)
Fire protection or fire alarm design (seems easier, maybe not)
Another field of engineering that would be a better fit for me (looking for input here)
Sales/product management (HVAC equipment)
Non-engineering jobs
Starting a local business (think sweaty startup)
Moving to Costa Rica and starting a new life

What do you do in my situation? Are you in a less technical role/field that sounds like a better fit for me?

- March: meet with manager to discuss merit increase/bonus from 2023

1874c93,Master Application,"I am a third year student in Economics and Business at Erasmus University Rotterdam.
I have been living my entire life in a small town in the south of Italy. After high school I directly moved to the Netherlands to get the most out of my degree. Still today, I believe that was the best decision of my life and do not regret anything I have done. I sometimes miss my hometown and family but I have learnt to live with it coming back occasionaly. I am now ending my exchange in Denmark and I am close to applying to master programmes, the problem is that I am not sure the way I should take.

First of all: my goal is to have a job and a career that could satisfy myself and thanks to which I could have a family with some children. It might sound stupid but in Italy with most basic jobs it is nearly impossible to live with even one child, specially in big cities. 

Secondly: I would really like to become a manager one day. I have always felt like having the skills to become a manager but, to be honest I do not know how it works in companies. How do you become one? How do you get noticed for these types of positions?

Thirdly: I am extremely passionate about the maritime environment and I really want to work in this field. I thought find difficult to understand what kind of job could suit me. Living in Rotterdam is surely an advantage as all the main companies working in maritime shipping sector have their offices there. 

After these premises, here comes a list of master I am thinking about:

Shipping and Transport
Urban Port and Transport Economics
Supply Chain Management 
People Organization and Change
Public Policy
Global Business and Sustainability

My parents thinks thar focusing on the maritime sector from the master is a bit too focused and I should find some more broad study for now.
This is probably due to the fact that they do not even know what kind of jobs opportunities this master could give and the real truth is, that I do not know either. That is why I am asking for your advices. I just know I have always been really passionate about shipping and logistic in general.

On the other side, I am REALLY interested in policy making, but I noticed three things for which I have nearly abandoned the idea:
Competition is really high. I have done some conferences and the process for getting hired is always extremely long.
Salaries are kinda low: this has been told me by a professor of the master.
The math behind is probably too difficult for me. I am not saying I am bad at math, but there probably will be a large portion of colleagues with better skills.
On the other side, if I manage to work for some governments it coulr become a very satisfying job.

Regarding HR it's also a decent option, maybe to become a HR manager one day, I like the job. The problem stands in how to become one.

Supply Chain Management is also a valid option.

From the view of the people around me I have always been seen as a kind of leader. A lot of people have adviced me to go into politics. By spending these years abroad, and by studying economics and business it is thought difficult to enter in this field. It would probably be one of the few jobs that could match having a good salary to grow a family in Italy.

I am not intentioned to come back to Italy, unless I get any type of job offee that fits my needs. I am  willing to stay abroad for now, and probably have a family there. 

Said so, what would you suggest me?
I am really struggling now as I have to decide what to do in my life soon.
What potential starting position and careers I could get after these studies?
Are they worth it or I should fine something else?
What's the best master from the one I cited that could lead me to have the best balance for job satisfaction/family?

Thank you in advance.",luckiy3,1,1.0,0,1701302975,2023-11-30 00:09:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1874c93/master_application/,11,2023
1874a3i,Endless Job Search: 8 Months of Unemployment—Where Am I Going Wrong?,"Hello everyone,  
  
I find myself seeking guidance after being unexpectedly let go from my position as a Drayage Coordinator/Freight Broker back in March of 2023. The circumstances surrounding my layoff were rather abrupt, with no prior notice and a replacement already in place. The company explained it as a consequence of the downturn in the ocean freight business, insisting it was not a termination but a result of the changing business needs. I found that to be dubious at best.  
  
To provide some context to my career journey, I graduated from Loyola University of Chicago in 2012 with majors in Human Resource Management, Marketing, and Management. Initially, I worked in processing Family Medical Leave Act claims but faced a change in management that led to my departure after seven months.  
  
After working in real estate brokerage for six years, I transitioned to my family's construction company in 2016 as a Materials Buyer and Inventory Specialist. During this role, I successfully implemented an efficient SAP-based inventory management system, resulting in a notable 10% increase in job profitability over four years. However, in 2020, I opted to explore new opportunities due to disagreements with my brother.  
  
Becoming a freight broker, I faced challenges but consistently gave my best. In 2021, I moved to a new brokerage for better technological support. Later, in 2022, I took on the role of a Drayage Coordinator. While my ADHD and Auditory Processing Disorder posed occasional challenges, I never let them become excuses.  
  
In the fall of 2022, I made the decision to further my education and enrolled in the University of Tennessee's online Supply Chain Management master's program, which is ranked in the Top 5. My goal was to enhance my career prospects. Unfortunately, my employment trajectory took an unexpected turn in March 2023, resulting in unemployment. Despite approaching job applications with unwavering dedication, treating them almost religiously, and possessing robust skills in Excel and SAP, I find myself facing challenges in securing interviews.  
  
I've invested in professional resume and cover letter services, but the outcomes have been disappointing. Even the career counselor at my school is perplexed by my prolonged unemployment. I approach job hunting with dedication, and my skills are proficient.  
  
I'm reaching out to this community for any advice or insights you might have. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

I am a 24 year old student finishing up a mid-level medical degree (MS in Cardiovascular Perfusion) and so far I'm filled with dread that this is what I will be doing everyday for the rest of my life.  
For those who are unfamiliar, my job is operating the heart-lung machine during open heart surgery and working with the surgeon to keep the patient alive during the operation. I'm starting to realize I was a bit pressured into medicine. I never enjoyed science or the coursework but thought maybe practicing would be different. The stress eats at me, ages me even. I find the medical world toxic and judgemental, people aren't sympathetic to slow learners like me, and to a degree I understand. Mistakes in a field like this are not acceptable. But it's eating away at me to the point that I can't eat (have lost 15 pounds since starting clinicals) or sleep and my hair is falling out. Even during my weekends I'm filled with fear about returning to work Monday. Me and medicine are not a natural fit.  
The aspects I enjoy about the job are that it can help others and get good pay (\~165k) so I can afford to do the things I want (i.e. enjoy life and provide for my amazing family). But honestly, I'm so envious of those who can work from home because I would absolutely love it. I dream of being a stay at home mom because I honestly can't think of another job I'd enjoy more. The love and appreciation I receive from family is unbeatable to me. I just don't know what other jobs I could even consider or would be eligible for. I'm a relatively smart person, can be very articulate and am good with people, business minded, but have no clue what to do. I'm highly educated in this particular field but have no other skills.  
I'm terrified of the future and the only thing keeping me in school is the fear of disappointing those who believe in me and looking forward to the times I can spend time with my family or be done with school and have a break before working.  
Please help me. What can I do? I value a job that pays well enough for me to have life experiences and support those around me and preferably is not life/death as my current role.

1872spu,Career guidance in oil and gas?,"I work in oil and gas as a contracts administrator. My background is in industrial distribution engineering with a minor in business. Currently doing an MBA with project management focus and will finish by the end of 2024. I only have about two years of corporate experience and took the role at lower labor grade than my peers. I’ve only gotten one raise about 6% which wasn’t significant and still lower than the starting salary of my colleagues. As it’s discouraged to discuss wages in corporate oil and gas companies, I am very much in need of some advice. Also typically the highest raise is with promotion at about 10% and best case scenario is 15% which requires corporate management approval. For context and salary, I’m in Texas and making about 65k with ~2 years experience. Looking for guidance on a career path that will set me up for 6 figures within the next 3 years.

Note: I am an immigrant and have been in country over a decade and need an employer to sponsor my H1B visa. It’s hard to find many employers that are willing to or can even sponsor, so switching companies is the last resort.

Few questions on how I can maximize salary and career opportunities—

1) What kind of actions can I take to improve my career growth and opportunities? 

2) What certifications could I pursue to add value and increase my salary? 

3) If I should switch roles or companies, what would you suggest I look into? My background is supply chain focused and I would thrive in a sales type role however those typically aren’t eligible for sponsorships. 

4) We had some changes in the department management, what can I do before my pay raise cycle to show that I am underpaid without mentioning names or burning bridges?

5) what other companies in oil and gas sponsor h1b? 

6) What other jobs / roles can I explore with my background that offer room for career growth? I only have 2 years experience so still need to be entry level role…

7) My MBA is in progress and may have to pursue another masters if I don’t get selected in H1B lottery. What other masters programs would be beneficial for growth or career opportunities?

I am very keen to learn, and I pick up things quickly. Though I have engineering degree it’s supply chain focused and not a technical engineering major like meche and cheme. Though I feel at the current employer I have been undervalued and not invested in, nor have I had the right opportunities such as a site assignment.

1872sp9,What should I do?,"Hi, I am a 24 year old guy from Kolkata, India . Recently (July' 2023) I graduated in B.Tech (CSE) from a Tier 3 college in Kolkata, India. I took a drop year after my 12th boards. So I graduated from school in 2018 and my University course was from 2019 to 2023.  
During my University days due to lack of guidance I ended up exploring a lot of fields like ML, Data Science, AI, Data Analysis, web dev and more but ultimately ended up learning nothing on a deeper level in general because I was always confused between which is right tech stack to learn and I quickly shifted my focus to different tech stacks and technologies one after the other. I wanted to get into a good product based company after graduation so I spent too much time on what to do rather than actually doing it.  
In my third year I accepted offer from a WITCH company at 4 LPA and they told me that the internship will start from January' 2023 for 3-6 months in my preferred location without any bond .I wasn't interested in the 4 LPA package but I would graduate in July 2023 so I thought that I could show the internship experience in my CV and use that as my leverage for applying to a product based company and also since it was in my hometown so I was not worried much. But the WITCH company kept on delaying the internship dates and fast forward to now ,it's almost December and they told me that my internship will start from February' 2024. I was blocked from campus placements and due to my grandma's death and depression I could not really find another job. I know excuses are useless, but it is what it is. I messed up. The depression due to the death of a loved one and a fake sense of security of the job offer and the fact that during covid a lot of people were getting hired by product based companies for SDE made me lose a lot of momentum in my preparation and time .  
Now the WITCH company wants me to relocation to cities like Chennai or Hyderabad for the internship for a mere stipend of 12k and then they may/may not give the FTE. Now I feel so depressed . I researched and found out that once I get a testing related job in these WITCH companies its super hard to switch to a good product based company as a developer. I know that to some extent I am myself to be blamed for it but the lack of proper guidance and too much online information confused me up big time. Now I feel that I can never become a developer in a product based company especially since now there is a hiring freeze in most companies and I read that developers are going to get much lesser due to AI and hiring freeze impact. I resumed my DSA practice and other subjects. If everything goes at this rate then I can complete atleast 350+ DSA question in leetcode by July next year along with DBMS ,OOPS ,OS and Computer Network, OOD and System Design by September .But I feel so hopeless .I keep feeling that nothing will change for me because of current hiring scenario. I will probably be stuck in such WITCH companies for next 4-5 years since all companies want 5+ experience people only currently and these WITCH companies may give me testing role only which will give me no experience when I apply for an SDE in a product based company . The dream to become an SDE after graduation feels like it's over for me. I feel so depressed . I feel like a loser in life who is good for nothing.  
What do you think I should do? Should I Join the WITCH for now ? Can I still apply for SDE in good product based companies if WITCH gives me a testing or non developer role ? Will the hirings start again like before? IS there any hope for me to switch to a product based company after 7-8 months if I have good practice of DSA, System Design, Object Oriented Design, Database Management System ,Operating System ??? Or do I have to wait for 4-5 years??PLEASE HELP.

1871hax,Is it normal to receive frequent feedback?,"I just started a role in a new company, and I’m unsure what’s normal VS what’s a red flag in terms of feedback.

My old job was very laissez-faire, and feedback was only really brought up sporadically, or when something was wrong. I also wasn’t being watched very closely – as long as my work was being done/good quality, my managers didn’t give two shits what I was doing.

This new job is very different than what I’m used to. I’m being watched very closely and receiving frequent feedback. My manager sits down to have a one-on-one feedback session with me every month basically explaining everything I’m doing wrong. I try to take it in stride & implement the changes, but it seems really hard to please him. 

I’m relatively new in my career, so I’m not sure if this is normal or not. I understand my old job was probably more relaxed than one should expect, but I constantly feel like I’m failing in this new job. 

I don’t know whether or not the frequency of this feedback is just some kind of professional standard I’m not used to, or if I genuinely am doing a bad job/should be looking for a new one soon.

186zyo4,"Career-changer at 31 going into the entertainment industry with zero experience, I need to know if my expectations are realistic.","So, I'll summarize my professional experience here.  I (31F) started working in retail young and had my daughter at 19, so I didn't go to college.  I have had several attempts at college and was only able to complete an aesthetics program in 2017.  I have tons of sales, customer service, and hospitality experience; then a few random switches here and there.  I wanted to be a makeup artist working in the theatrical environment from a young age and worked hard towards that, but I lost my passion for makeup when I began doing it in a professional environment after getting my aesthetics license (this was in a studio, not a theatre).  I still absolutely adore the theatre, so this is the environment I want to work in, preferably in production.  

After trying so many things, I'm now in a situation where I just impulsively quit my job (long story but this was not before having something lined up for the first time and I'm working on that currently but stressing a bit).  I started school again this year and essentially made a pact with myself that if I re-enrolled, I would not leave school without a degree in hand and I decided to finally pursue a job I would realistically love.  I am working towards my bachelor's degree in theatrical production and am officially a sophomore beginning in January.

I have two options for school once I transfer after my sophomore year (currently getting my first two years free at a community college thanks to a state program).  One program near me is a theatre production degree at a great school, the other is still a really good school and it's a communications degree with theatre production as a focus (seems a bit broader and safer, but the other school is a much better school).  So, I do need advice on that. 

But once I graduate, my ultimate goal would be to be a technical director.  That is obviously way down the line and I'm open to other possibilities within the industry.  But I know it's going to be a long and challenging road given my lack of experience and age.  My local theatre is pretty large and well known in the city and they do offer internships for Juniors and Seniors to gain experience, so I'm hoping to land one of those, but currently trying to see about getting volunteer opportunities there next year to help boost my chances there.  

I know the arts are notoriously not big money makers, and I do understand the expectations there.  I do live at home with my mother and daughter as I do help my mom as much as she helps me and she's agreed I can stay at home as long as I want because our dynamic works well (I'll likely move when my daughter leaves for college, but want to give her stability and prioritize her now).   I suppose I do need some realistic advice, but I'd love some words of encouragement as well.  My daughter is an incredibly creative girl who wants to go into some form of graphic design at some point and I want to set an example for her not to give up on her dreams.  Thanks in advance!

There's also the fact that frankly? I don't care. I don't care about work. I don't feel a sense of accomplishment from work. I don't feel inspired by work. I just want to finish my day, get my paycheck, and go tf home. So I'm never really driven to push things either.

Anyway, recently got called out about my ineffectiveness in the middle of a meeting. So... that was cooool. They weren't wrong though.

I was promised a more mid level role within the company doing B2B sales, but its been more or less just me harassing family and friends trying to sell them home and auto policies which is definitely not what I signed up for.

I'm pretty unhappy and wish I stayed at my prior job now. I don't want to necessarily accuse the friend of a bait and switch, but I don't think it was ever mentioned that I would be doing this entry level sales role before doing more mid market sales.   
I'm worried that leaving after two months will end the friendship and hurt my reputation, but at the same time I do not like what I am doing. I also don't want to be viewed as a quitter just because I can't make it work.

186xxzj,Family Business is Limiting my Growth,"Hello all.  
I (23m) work for a small family owned business, where I started working part-time in college. I interned in other fields, but recently began working full-time here after college. I feel like I am going crazy with how little work I have to do and the office environment. I am a very social, out-going, and motivated person and I cannot be idle and get paid by doing nothing in an office environment compromising of 6 people all over 50 years old. I have already gotten two job offers from bigger companies, in a much bigger and younger office atmosphere, but turned them down over guilt and betrayal of my family. I understand at any job when you start out, especially salary, you are not given a lot of work, but I not only have had no work really given to me and I haven't been properly trained compared to my peers in their specialized fields and feel like in many ways I am completely missing out. The majority of the time I am here I am on reddit or texting my friends, where someone like me can get easily distracted and slack off with no structure and so much time. There is a lot more context that unfortunately I cannot share, but my relationship with my family is why I work here and I feel extremely suffocated and that I will end up useless and have no leadership or executive skills when I am older and in a more prominent role.  


I don't want to come off as ungrateful or entitled either, throughout college and high school I was extremely entrepreneurial and enjoyed making something out of nothing.

I am an Italian-American citizen, born and raised in the United States. When I graduated high school (2021 so in the midst of covid) I was accepted to an American university in Rome, Italy, and I am studying international affairs. I have been here for 3 years and graduate in May 2024.  
  
I was accepted into an international master's in security, intelligence, and security studies (IMSISS) and for the next two years I will be studying in Glasgow, Dublin, and Prague. My degree is part of an EU ERASMUS program, and the final degree will be rewarded from all three of the universities I attend.  
  
After 3 years of studying in Europe, I've had a couple internships in the military studies/intelligence field. I was a research intern in Vicenza and working with US and Italian military personnel. Now I am an intelligence analyst at a private intel company in London, where I publish reports and work on private contracts.  
  
When I complete my masters, I want to come back to the US and work in the IC. Of course, I am worried about coming back and not getting a security clearance in the US.

Economic hardships in the market leading to redundancies as well as a manager that was quite clearly socially anxious and so pretty much avoided coming in to manage (perhaps due to being the same age as me and under-confident at that level - the words of partners to me privately not my own). 

I was one of those redundancies after only 9 months in that role. 

What was meant to be an exciting new career that appeared full of hope at the start has turned into a nightmare where I feel I have to explain myself to new potential hires constantly. It’s a difficult one to explain and does not look good alongside a move of my own prior to a “failure” / decision made for me.


I feel this whole career path is hopeless now and I’m inadvertently blacklisted and untouchable. Never mind the economy making it a terrible time to try and find a new role.

Do I keep trying or do I bite the bullet and either get a random job with little career progression, focussing on what I can get from life outside of work, or try and say get a tech apprenticeship due to the fact that many people I know did this for the good salary outcomes despite all of them having no prior passion for it?

Any similar experiences as well as advice would be greatly appreciated.",AlfieDGS,3,1.0,0,1701276959,2023-11-29 16:55:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/186u518/career_path_is_a_mess_feel_inadvertently/,11,2023

186slbg,What should I be doing differently when applying to Mechanical Engineering jobs?,"I graduated with a mechanical engineering degree during covid with a 3.53 GPA and it took me 7 months before to get any interviews and I fell for the first job that was interested in me. During the position I worked two roles, one was a repetitive CAD position and the other was investigating quality issues and implementing changes. While working there I passed the mechanical engineering FE exam. The company was mismanaged with a toxic work culture and the position lacked the learning and career growth opportunities I was looking for. After two years of working there, being unable to get another job due to my lack of experience, I decide the best course of action was to quit my job to tackle projects of my own where I could learn and be challenged. I tackled four projects, two are Arduino projects with a react client-side website used to communicate setting updates to the Arduino via Bluetooth and two are React / react native products. After creating these projects, I built a website portfolio to display them. The past few months I have interviewing/ struggling to get a job. I have experience with Siemens NX, SolidWorks, Abaqus, C++, Arduino, python, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS & HTML, React, and React Native.   
  
My ideal role would be a position at a startup company that mixes my interest in coding with mechanical engineering, but I am willing to work any engineering position at any company as long as I can learn and progress in the direction of my “ideal role”.

186scix,Changing career path,"I’m from the UK, attending a university for a bachelors in biological sciences. 

So far, I have been completely dissatisfied with my course. I had always maintained an interest in science in high school and would often read about it in my spare time. I’ve come to the conclusion that perhaps I have been deluding myself into liking something I’m not good at. 

Despite the fact that I was reading science outside of school and liked collecting factual knowledge about it. I wasn’t actually very good at it. I worked hard to eventually get better grades through better study techniques, yet I constantly had to keep up with the material. If you liked at my report, all my humanities such as history, geography, religious studies, spanish, french, Arts and english. I constantly got high scores without trying, while barely passing the stem subjects. 

For the first few years, I improved my revision strategy to up my scores in all subjects. Yet there was still quite a divide between the two. You could  say the humanities had easier exams, so perhaps I’m overestimating my ability here. 

But somehow not getting good grades in stem made me think I’m stupid. The only stem subject that I got high scores was maths. I would still try soo hard to get an A- at least. It did get more easier at GCSEs se. But yet, I would struggle again to keep up with other people. 

I really wish my teachers would’ve told me not take to any of those subjects. I had teacher meetings, I showed improvement, so I was allowed. 

Like a lot of Asian kids, I was pushed into it. I didn’t want to get laughed at by my parents for choosing a language or arts. They thought it was stupid, and always said why I always got low marks in the sciences. 

I did keep an interest in science so that’s why I was keen to keep it. But truth be told, I hated the science classes the most. I forced myself to see the things taught in class as interesting so disciplined myself to continue.  

GCSEs were terrible, and I don’t know how I managed to survive through it. The highest grade I got predicted was in English. 

I taught myself to code in python at a very basic level. It was the only time I had been engaged with something but I gave it up after going to A-levels. 

My grades in sciences were mainly A/Bs. I worked hard in the exams and got into this course. It was a stupid decision. I wish I picked a maths undergrad or accounting. It would’ve been way more practical. 

My fascination for science has gone out the window. If you are not good at it, it’s not gonna be very enjoyable. It might not be true for everyone but for me it kinda is. After years of feeling left behind by everyone else in STEM, I’m tired of failing every time. 

I’m doing average in comparison to everyone else in my course, so I’m clearly not failing. But my lack of motivation is going to probably fail me. 

I feel stupid for thinking that humanities are below STEM, they still require reasoning skills and intelligence. I wish I didn’t shoot down my chances like this and picked variety of subjects at that time. 

I’m not sure what career path to go on from here. I’ve made up my mind to go back on coding and learning a language or something. I consulted an advisor, and they said I can’t transfer to any other courses. The only option I do have is somehow getting a masters in bioinformatics and learning to code through that. Maybe I can combine some skills and apply for jobs that don’t necessarily have to do much with a science degree. I’ve heard there are jobs that don’t consider a particular degree but just that you have one. Perhaps that would be like somewhere in finance and banking? 

Any other advice would be appreciated.",awatch90,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1701272481,2023-11-29 15:41:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/186scix/changing_career_path/,11,2023
186s6ip,How long to follow up after an interview,"A higher up at a great company reached out to me on LinkedIn stating a former colleague of mine recommended me for an amazing position that opened up there. He said she had great things to say about me. I had a preliminary interview with him and it went fantastic. He didn’t speak in “ifs,” which I know can mean nothing, but I did pick up on. He seemed to love what I have done and am doing at my current job and we had great conversation around the opportunity. He said that the man that would be my boss will reach out to set up a second formal interview. My old colleague almost immediately reached out to congratulate me and said she heard I was getting the next interview and that the first went well. That was on 11/20, so 9 days ago. 
I’m a little worried now because this man has yet to contact me. They do have unlimited vacation time there, so because of the holiday I know things could be delayed, but do you think I should be worried?

186rb5t,Should I Leave Or Am I Being Short Sighted?,"I'm not looking for an echo chamber; I genuinely want critical advice. If I need a slap of reality, I will greatly appreciate any input.

So, I work as a Support Role Administrator/Coordinator for a specialized role, preparing and setting out clients for my colleagues who use their specialized knowledge to advise them.

When I started, the process was painfully manual, with templates being downloaded from emails and opened in Word each time. Seeing an opportunity for improvement, I migrated everything to the Cloud and automated about 80% of my basic responsibilities.

My manager, noticing the increased efficiency, asked me to take on responsibilities typically belonging to those in a specialized position, suggesting it would lead to career progression. So, I accepted and even extended my automated tools the entire team, significantly reducing their prep time.

Despite these advancements, my role's requirement for specialized knowledge seems undervalued. Requests for formal training are often brushed off with suggestions to ""read articles"" instead.

I applied for the specialized role I've been supporting, seeking to formalize my knowledge and experience. However, I was rejected with reasons ranging from not having enough life experience to concerns about ""ruining my confidence."" Feedback from the interview was vague, pointing out I didn't leverage my university or prior job experience enough, which felt unrelated to the questions asked.

Meanwhile, the person hired over me has already caused significant errors, affecting my workload and efficiency. My manager's response to these incidents has been dismissive, even joking about my potential termination in other contexts.

My role is supposed to involve coordination, yet I'm often excluded from key meetings that could help me improve our team's efficiency.

 My self-directed efforts to improve and develop within my role have been substantial, but the lack of feedback and guidance makes it difficult to gauge my effectiveness.I'm questioning whether my desire for clarity, progression, and potentially leaving is justified. 

While I'm willing to make sacrifices, the lack of clear direction and recognition is concerning. The specialized nature of the work means job opportunities in the field aren't abundant.

I've been with the company for 2.5 years, starting as a temp and working up to my current role over the last 1.5 years. Is it time to seek opportunities elsewhere, or am I not seeing the full picture here?

186o7yx,Is it okay to have boundaries of my workload capacity at work?,"I work in a tech company as a software engineer. I've been here for less than a year. Lately I noticed that our manager is not managing us well. He overpromises to management and putting the burden to finish deadlines on us. Our lead engineer got sick but he can't stop working because he is the only one who knows how the requirements are done. There are multiple senior engineers in the team. One of the engineer moved to another team. The other one got burned out and when I see her at work, her eyes look like they're soulless. While another enginer is on a work from home setup because of what I heard is an intense conflict with our manager. I, on the other hand, is doing my job but not letting this manager burn me out. It feels like he wants everyone to put their 200% at work which means after work you still have to work. Because he overpromised a deadline, we also sometimes have to work weekends. 

After working for several startups with intense workloads, I learned that I am better off not burning out myself because that takes a long time to recover. 

I'm worried because I might get passed up for promotion next April. At the same time,  the bar is set so high that even our lead engineer can't reach the next level. He has been at that role for more than two years now. 

Today, I was asked to take on more tasks than what I currently have since another engineer was on leave. I refused since that legacy project is notorious for always breaking in production. I have witnessed several engineers lose their weekends fixing bugs. Defended that I have urgent tasks to do also. At the end of the meeting, I volunteered to help out another engineer since what he's doing is my forte. I was told by our manager to finish my tasks first before volunteering to help out.

It is abroad and in another country which is quite similar to my own, but I just don't like it. All I can think of is to leave, but I don't want to mess up my future career since it might make it look bad if any future interestants find out that I left.

186m1ak,I dont know what to do,"feel like I've made a mistake

So this is my second week in my job with the NHS as a sterile service technician. This job is late shift which I have no problem with but I feel stupid for not thinking through the long term cost for travelling there as its quite far, even to save money I would have to take 3 buses and that would take almost 2 hours. Its very stressful on top of overwhelming work. Also its not as interesting of a job as I thought.

I left my other job which I was in for almost 4 years as we got new management and and a new senior who made my life hell and suffered very badly with my mental health to the point of crying everyday and almost having panic attacks daily.

I feel like I should of eased myself into part time work before going into full fledged full time like my other job as my mental health is deteriorating as well as having underlying health issues flaring up making everything difficult so now I'm very stressed and again crying daily. I don't think I should be in the job any longer

Idk what to do anymore, I want a remote job but it's hard to find them without experience and that pay well. I feel trapped as I need money and part time doesn't pay much but it seems full time isn't great for me right now. All these years of powering through and persevering even when my mental health was very bad does not work anymore.

Does anyone have good ideas of remote jobs with no experience? Or any tips for me? I'm thinking of talking with my line manager for my one to one in a couple of weeks to be honest because I feel like I'm wasting everyone's time but again you don't know how you would like a job until you get there.",Android_NineS,1,1.0,0,1701252345,2023-11-29 10:05:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/186m1ak/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,11,2023
186kkbe,Fired for calling out when partner had a seizure…,"I’m in need of some guidance regarding my situation. Long post but I could really use some help here. Recently my partner had a seizure…he’s had them in the past but since our relationship has started (2 years in) he hasn’t had one…until Thanksgiving night. It was 3 am and it all happened so fast I didn’t know what was happening. I turned on the lights and the sight scared the shit out of me. I thought he was dying. I’ve never witnessed a seizure before. I called 911 and he was taken to the hospital. They told me where they were taking him and said I can see him there. I calmed my nerves. Sat at the end of the bed and wrote work before driving out “I have a 911 emergency. Partner had a seizure if someone sees this in the morning please take my shift”, I shouldn’t have had to but you’ll see later why in the middle of something like this I made time for work. I had work at 8:30am, we didn’t leave the hospital until 8. At 6 I called the store and told them I wasn’t going to make it. I then also texted my manager(A) to personally let them know what happened as they were not there at 6am yet. Not one person reached out to me to see if he was ok or me…radio silence. I had an extremely anxious day, both worried about why nobody was saying anything to me and also for my partner bc I was terrified of seeing that happen again. His mom was on his way over but wasn’t going to make it until later the next day. I called out the next day too to say that I needed to be there for my partner in case it happens until someone else was going to be able to be around. And I was extremely transparent that it had been on hard for me as well and I hadn’t slept in almost 2 days at this point. I told the people in the store and again texted A to let her know personally as well. Then I finally got some sleep. I woke up to no new calls or messages. I checked the work schedule and saw that I had been removed for the rest of the week. I was very confused as to what this meant for me. I texted A to ask just that…”hello, I was removed for the schedule what does this mean for me?” I get a call A says “we’re gonna part ways with you. Bye”. That was literally it. I was distraught. Confused. Angry. Sad. How could I be treated so inhumanely? And my partner? Not a “glad he’s ok!” Even! Now I’m gonna be completely transparent. The week before this I had my own medical emergency where I had to ask A to leave work early, I provided a drs note and I was given the days off” but on Wednesday, a week later, (before thanksgiving) my other manager(B) told me. “Did we work you too hard? We can cut your hours down if you need since your injuries(I was in an accident some time back) we love having you, we just need you here for that”. Clearly A said something to B and since they are the higher up manager. They spoke to me about it instead. Understandable. This is why I was very quick to let them know what was happening and very communicative bc I didn’t want this to count against me. It was just bad timing! 

Now I could never have imagined something like this happening. This was so detached from my own situation. The only reason I can imagine I was fired for this happening was if they didn’t believe me. But why would I after being essentially given a warning the next day pull a stunt like this. It was unfortunate timing. My partner even gave me permission to send them his drs papers but I really felt that should be unnecessary. 

I was a good employee, and I loved working there genuinely. I started off very strong but during the time when I was dealing with my own injury I had a few hiccups running late and being more stressed than normal but nothing to such a caliber to essentially just be ghosted by employers. 

My partner was then back in the hospital the day I was let go. So I don’t feel bad for asking the next day off too. I’m glad I was there. 

I’m wondering what I should do in this situation? I don’t really want to ask for my job back bc clearly I don’t want to work for those people. But I’m wondering if I should contact B or the higher ups and explain that the way A treated me and the situation was completely unprofessional? A was newly made GM as B was transferring to another store and I almost feel they didn’t like me very much and we’re looking for a way to get rid of me. Bc B was always very kind. I’m wondering if the story was skewed in anyway. I talked to a coworker today and they told me they were very surprised I was let go for that. I feel like I deserve an explanation. 

What would you do? Should I send a letter? What would I say?

186h73u,Career choices I made in 20s were fear-driven and now aimless at 30.,"I am a 30F and feel like a loser. Any tips or relevant experiences?

The choices I made in my 20s have been driven by fear and wanting financial freedom. I chose accounting as my master's degree and economics for my undergraduate, none of which fit my interests or capabilities. But I thought they were a guarantee to making good income for myself. No matter how much effort I put in school or career, I have come to terms with the fact that I am just not a number or technical person. I hopped around job to job after college, aimless, and feeling unfulfilled and lack of purpose in what I did. I desperately wanted a direction in life to invest all my effort in but the jobs I worked at either felt like dead-end or extremely niche to build my resume and transition into the job I want. I recently quit my job a few months ago because I just can't take it anymore. Currently, I'm unemployed. 

I know age is just a number, but there's an expectation life should be put together at least by 30. My life right now feels aimless because I don't own the choices I made, nor do I know what I am really good at. I feel like I'm going crazy. If you ask me what I would do without fear or wanting financial freedom, it would be writing and journaling. Time flies by whenever I sit down and narrate my own experiences. Unlike accounting, I actually enjoy the whole process of writing. The only fear I have is not knowing how to make money out of writing especially because I'm not very good at it.

I am an out of state student from Colorado, and right now I am deciding whether to transfer back to Colorado and go to CU-Boulder next semester. Overall UW-Madison has been ok for me, I’ve made a couple friends and recognize that it’s a great school. But I am overall wondering if I should transfer to CU as it is nearly half as expensive (due to me being a CO resident) and boulder is a much nicer place to be than Madison. Some context on my situation: I can go to either school without taking loans, but after undergrad I would probably have to take out loans to go to law school or masters from UW-Madison and could go without loans from CU (I understand I am incredibly privileged in this regard).

186gd10,Going back to finish my degree after one hell of a career detour. What should I do next?,"So. I have a pretty unconventional experience with higher education. After finishing high school I went on to study mechanical engineering and applied physics, but I found it too hard for me at the time, or maybe I just didn't have enough motivation.   
I started working in the manufacturing industry doing low level technical roles like CNC programming, operating lathes, drawing technical sketches, and quality control.   
After a few years of trying to balance work and school I burnt out and I left my first college with 3/4 of my degree completed.  
However, as faith would have it, over the years in the industry my interests kept broadening into electronics, programmable controls, robotics, etc. and I had a period of around 2 years where I possessively studied electronics, and eventually I started  using my manufacturing background and combining it with my newfound love of electronics/micro-controllers by designing and producing prototypes for some dope industrial equipment, robots, measuring instruments.  
So far in this story, things have been moving slowly and all of what I have discussed has happened over the span of 6-8 years but this is when things start moving really fast.   
By this point I was balls deep into technology, but truth be told, I was very unhappy with my life. By now I was 24 - close to 25 and I was still doing menial, low paying jobs and I started regretting the decision to drop out of university. I felt like my options were being limited because I was lacking formal education and no matter how talented you are,  an engineer without a degree is always just a technician.  
I started feeling pressure, like I was falling behind in life, and I developed a severed case of anxiety disorder. I thought to myself - ""What is a college dropout with passion for engineering and technology like me, to do?"". And the most obvious answer for me was IT. From now on I spent every nanosecond of my free time obsessively watching educational courses and googling and within a year, I successfully switched into IT and had become IT Systems Engineer for a small local company.   
Signing that job contract felt like such a relief, knowing that the last year wasn't spent in vein.  
Now I had my foot in the door in a lucrative field where being a college dropout doesn't automatically label you as a loser, but instead as rebellious and smart.  
I loved IT, and I was getting very good at it fast. I was getting so good in fact that I decided to go back to school and get a CS degree. It was a no brainier for me because I was already doing it, I already knew so much about computation and IT and in my free time I was coding a lot and so that's what I did.  
At this point in my life, I was 26 and I was definitely feeling out of place among my peers who were 18 years old, but I had collected so much knowledge over the years and I was a lot more mature then I was when I was going to college for the first time. My math heavy engineering education and recent professional experience in IT has proven to be like a lottery-winning combination, as I  was completing my degree without breaking a sweat. And while everybody else was struggling to balance all the tests, I was having plenty of time to learn more deeply about subjects, often studying topics way deeper than they were taught in school.  
One of those topics was software engineering. I loved it, and I often studied software engineering for too long, even to the determent  of other subjects. But, this has led me to landing my first software engineering job by the time I was finishing my first year.  
I have to say looking back I would never have guessed how far I would come. I was very lucky as one of my first applications I sent out turned into a job offer.   
I am graduating with Bsc in computer science next year and I am looking to see what my options are career-wise. I am even contemplating finishing two degrees at the same time by moving doing Masters in computer science and enrolling back into mechanical engineering to finish my degree there. It is like a thorn in my eye because I have probably no more than 3 semesters if I pass everything and I can graduate engineering.  
I guess I can balance two schools and a job. What kind of career outlook would that offer?  
And to everyone who's feeling inadequate or like they are behind in life, your current situation doesn't define you.  Your lowest moments will make your character indestructible. This applies the most in this tough job market conditions. If you are a young person just graduating or someone who has lost their job and has been sending 100's of applications a day due to the recent recession and feel like giving up on your passion. Don't lose hope.   
At the end of the day, things will go back to normal and the dust has settled, and all those who were in here because of promises of easy payday have left to do other things, those stayed undeterred will be in the most favorable position when the market starts going back up. The hopelessness and difficulty of your path will make you relentlessly motivated, and tough as nails, and such people are impossible to compete with.

How much would you have to earn to justify being away from family 50% of the year?

Notably, my career is specifically suited to skills I have learned across two decades. I’ve just never had an option of lifestyle once I began, so I never really considered what valuation I should apply to my time at home.

Short of a sudden shift into slumlord millionaire status, the only adjustments that I can make to my career are time vs money trade offs. I am simply curious what the outside perspective is.

186cz75,How to switch roles in the same company?,"I'm interested in switching from finance to marketing in a very large company. I've been in my current role for 2 years. My concern is that I'm anywhere 3-12 months away from promotion to the ""senior"" level of my current role and I'm worried that if I bring up my interest in marketing to my manager, the promotion will either get delayed past the aforementioned window or even worse, they may just view me as a flight risk and not promote me ever. 

I'm not sure what to do. One on hand, keeping my mouth shut till I get the promo would give me a solid fall back plan if marketing doesn't work out for whatever reason. Also, I'm still early in my professional career and started late so I think demonstrating ""growth"" in a role would be good for my resume overall before jumping ship to something new. 

On the other hand, I just don't see myself going down my current path for the next 6+ years. I learned a metric shit ton and I think much of it is transferrable to paths that are more aligned with my interests.

186c4in,Advice on work after layoff,"I'm looking for some advice. I got laid off in October from my previous job in finance. Since then, I am in the final interview stages with 2 companies. One is due to a manager from my former company reaching out to me saying she heard I was affected by layoffs. She left the company a month before the mass layoffs. She was brought to her new company by the director of finance who is also from my former company. Essentially, she reached out asking if I would be interested in a role she was recruiting for. Both her and the director were in a different finance group than mine at my old company, but I had brief chats and experiences working with them. I spoke with both of them and they want to bring me onto their team. The role itself isn't my first pick since I would have to commute 2-3 hours a day for it and they're in the office 3 days a week. At my past company, I was WFH. I would also be taking a 18k pay cut if I'm counting the benefits I had at my old company. I still have a final round of interviews with a second company later this week that is more aligned with what I'm looking for. I'm thinking if I don't get an offer from the second company, the first company would be my backup.

My dilemma is would you take a job if it's the only one offered - even if it requires a long commute and a pay cut? My plan probably would be to keep applying for jobs until I find a job more aligned with what I'm looking for. I know it's not recommended to do that, but for context I'm 25, single, based out of Chicago and only have 3 months of savings which puts me at needing a FT job by late January. I feel bad that even after potentially accepting the offer I'll still be applying and will be looking for something closer/higher pay. I know I shouldn't think of it as personal since companies are not loyal to anyone. The job market is terrible right now and I don't know if I'll be able to get an offer before late January if I don't take this one.

What would you do in my situation?

186c2t3,Would it be appropriate to bring these things up in a 2nd interview?,"I'm in a good spot with my current company. It's stable. They like me. I'm content. A recruiter reached out on linkedin and I did a video interview for a position that would be a 35-40% pay increase and would be fully remote.

The first interview was with the person that would be my boss. They've asked me to do a 2nd interview with HR (for the parent company) tomorrow.

I came away from the first interview uneasy about the job. It's a company that was bought out by a larger one, and it all sounds very new. They have something like 10 employees now, and plan to grow to about 50 by the end of the year. The recruiter and my would-be boss mentioned ""startup feel"" several times. That sounds like the opposite of ""stable"" to me. 

It's an engineering position, and my boss is not an engineer, so I came away from the first interview not completely understanding what my day to day would be like. They do have one current employee in the group that would be in the same position I'm interviewing for.

Seeking clarity, I questioned if my performance was an issue, but he evaded specifics, claiming he could handle some tasks himself. Frustrated by his lack of appreciation and understanding of my constraints, I decided to end the conversation, stating, ""I think I'm done with this” before hanging up. 

My Dutch boyfriend thinks I was too kind, while my American family finds my approach rude and unprofessional. Feeling undervalued and disrespected, I believe if he disregarded our agreement, further discussion wasn't worthwhile.

Culturally, Americans tend to emphasize strong work relationships, while the Dutch favor directness. Importantly, he hired other student girls my age who work two jobs to supplement this, adding to the questionable practices at the startup. It seems like he was trying to get me to do more for less. TL;DR: Is quitting by hanging up unprofessional when the boss breaks a prior agreement?

This guy also has greatest hits such as lying to my face when I asked him if an integration he set up worked and also requesting I sleep at his house on a business trip.

186apc4,What do I do if I am starting to not like the city where I am currently employed?,"I moved from NYC metro to a college town in the Midwest for a job this summer. I am now over 3 months in and thus far have had a good time, but after visiting Chicago this past weekend, I am now aching for a bigger city.

While this college town is not terrible, and I was not happy working part-time while in the suburbs of NYC at my childhood home, I feel like I am wasting my time in an area where there aren't many people like me (especially since I am a working young professional and not a student).

I'm a little depressed this week about it, so I started casually applying to new roles in Chicago. Should anything yield an interview, how honest can I be regarding my need for a larger city, to both prospective employers during interviews and my current one, as a reason for wanting to leave so soon? I think my current employer would understand, but I worry hiring managers don't like that as a motive.

Of course, I would never leave my role for something I am uninterested in. My job pays well for the area, I super enjoy my co-workers and my work, and have made some friends. It's not the worst place, however, it's not the best for me, and frankly my employer has at times mentioned the desire for me to stay for \*years\* (yes, plural). I am only 25, and never saw this role as my end game. They have also expressed the difficulties they have had in finding quality employees, and we have some remote capabilities, so should I continue working here I may have leverage, and when my lease is up next summer, I wonder about moving to Chicago, which is still within the region we serve. However, I know fully remote is not ideal for them.

186a2fr,Stay for stock options or take an offer at a new company,"23F working in accounting in the auto industry in country A, making 37k net a year which includes all kinds of insurance. Last year, I relocated from country B to country A for this job. My current job is pretty demanding, the commute is long, and I’m required to be at the office most of the time. On the bright side, my manager is god sent. He’s a great mentor and a friend. I also got along well with my other colleagues, but I have 0 life outside of work because my energy is so drained from the long hours and the long commute.

I recently accepted an offer for a job in the country B (where I used to live), the job is in FP&A which I personally think is a great career development for me. This new job pays a bit less at 34K, no insurance, but from what I asked from the interview, a better work life balance, 60% WFH policy, and less overtime. My partner and most of my friends reside in country B, hence why I looked at new jobs at the first place. This past year has been tough with moving to a new unknown place, pressure from work, losing loved ones, and dealing with loneliness overall.

When I was arranging my off boarding at my current company, the HR enlightened me that if I stay for 3 more months, I can vest 7.5k of stocks (which is doing pretty great). The problem is, this new job starts in 2 months, and taking time off until the vesting date would not be an option. I haven’t signed any new contract yet nor handed in my resignation letter. I’m now conflicted to stay and tough it out for 3 more months while looking for another job, or to go with the new job offer.

TLDR; should I stay in my current company to get 7.5k of stock options or move to a new company for a better work life balance?",mattchampchamp,1,1.0,1,1701213477,2023-11-28 23:17:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/186a2fr/stay_for_stock_options_or_take_an_offer_at_a_new/,11,2023

1869npc,Would you push for a promotion or ride it out in my situation?,"I work as a type of scientist for a very large manufacturing company. In terms of career progression, a level 1 = fresh out of undergrad and it progresses upwards from there. A level 2 is typically a master’s degree and no experience (or bachelor’s and 5 years’ experience), and a level 3 is typically a PhD and no experience (or bachelor’s and 7-10 years’ experience).

I have a master’s degree and 9 years of experience, although 7 are related to manufacturing and only 2 to the scientist role. I started as a level 2 in this company in manufacturing and later moved into the more science-based job. I was told that it would be a lateral move from a 2 to a 2 because I lacked experience in the “science” type work. I was ok with this because I really wanted to move into something more technical and was told that I could move up quickly. I also got a fair pay bump during this lateral move.

I have some resentment as I see people with less experience than me move up in the manufacturing side of things, but I’m told that my job is more technical and will take longer to move up. Every review I have had with my manager has been glowing. A quote from her is “you are knocking it out of the park, I’ve tried to find constructive criticism to give you and have none”. As an example, I have completed ~40 reports this year while my peers have done about 10 a piece. She let me know that I would be put in for a promotion in the next promotion cycle, but that unfortunately is next year with the results coming out around September/October. She also let me know all she can do is put me in for a promotion, but I’m not guaranteed to get it. Another note is that I only have her word on this from my quarterly review, nothing is in writing. Part of my pain is that I feel like people are starting to judge me a bit for being at the level I am at despite my education/experience. It makes it seem like I have done something wrong to still be here, but I have literally never gotten any feedback that I am doing something wrong or have an area to improve in (not implying I am a rockstar though, I'm sure I could be better in some areas).

I’m a bit frustrated but I do really enjoy the type of work I do, so I thought I’d just stick it out. Now where I’m getting pushed over the edge is that a manufacturing area is closing, and we are getting two new team members from that area. One is already level 3 (as said, manufacturing folks get to move up quicker). I happen to know this person. They have just started their master’s degree in the same subject I already got mine in. They won’t finish for another 2-3 years. They also have 5 years of manufacturing experience but no “science” experience. Now clearly, they aren’t going to get demoted to a 2 when they join, so they will be at a higher level with less experience and less education. I don’t hold a grudge against them or my manager (she couldn’t control what happened to them), but I do find the situation to be kind of messed up. I also happen to know it’s possible to get promoted outside of the annual cycle from a discussion I had with HR (a friend I know from outside my particular area. The process is the same company wide though).

So, my question is, what would you do in this circumstance? Would you just say, “well comparison is the thief of joy” and just wait to see what happens in a year since it’s not SOO far away? Or do I schedule a 1 on 1 with my boss and let her know I am upset/push for the promotion ASAP? Quite honestly, I have been invited to apply to a level 4 position in a different area of the company and it’s tempting, but again, I prefer the type of work I do now.",Chogath_Eat_World,1,1.0,1,1701212488,2023-11-28 23:01:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1869npc/would_you_push_for_a_promotion_or_ride_it_out_in/,11,2023

186972y,Advice for a non-eu English teacher,"Hi everyone,

A little bit about me: I am a double-trouble non-native and non-EU English teacher, and I want to work as an ESL teacher abroad. I have a bachelor's degree (from my country) in English teaching, and after finishing that, I did a one-year internship at a language school in London, UK. 

This year I will start a master's in applied linguistics with TESOL in England. I received Level 3 qualifications for teaching English funded by the council. I know they are not enough, but it is also a thing.

So, I agreed to volunteer for a charity, basically helping refugees learn English. It will also be beneficial for my master's research, and I will be looking for part-time jobs during my studying period. I will also have two years of full-time working permits in the UK after finishing my masters.

 In the second year, should I look for ESOL jobs? I heard that teaching assistant jobs are very common and can help you understand the curriculum of the UK education system.

I met some people working in Hong Kong as an ESL teacher from my country, but they neglected sharing information and basically asked for $200 for ""helping me find a school,"" which I found absurd! But it is good to see that some people found jobs in my country.

What should I do next? I want to make the best of it in order to increase my employment opportunities when my UK visa expires. What should I do to increase my chances of getting hired in a European country or in an Asian country?

I also believe that receiving CELTA would be better if I certified it in the UK. So I will go for CELTA when I have more time.


Or should I choose a different work pattern with my master's degree? (I know it's limited.)

1868w2j,Passion vs Future benefits,"Hello (:  
  
I am 29 years old. these 2 past years I have faced a bunch of changes. In 2022 I worked as a recruiter in the IT market. I really want to migrate to another country since I live in Mexico and it is very unsafe to live here, and also life quality has decreased. WOrking as a recruiter, I saw that being a software developer helps a lot to migrate, and also it has very good salaries. in the begining of 2023 I went for it and quit my recruiter job to study a bootcamp in programming. I finished it and I found my first job as a software developer Junior three months ago. This job is very frustrating and it is harder than I imagine. I feel that Im not good at it, and It is hard for me to imagine myself working in jobs like this the rest of my life but also I know I have so little experience that is normal to feel that way. My current job has very good benefits like remote work, and so on.  
  
On the other hand, I have been thinking about jobs that I would really love to do, and my only answer is being on videogame media. Like reviewing games, talking about games, go to game events to inform the news to the people etc.  
That would be my passion, is my dream job. but the cons of that job is that:  
\-I dont know the salary that I could get.  
\-It is very demanding since a lot of events are on weekends and it has sometimes short deadlines   
\-I would need to move from my hometown to mexico city, which I have never lived before and I dont know anybody there.  
\-It is way more dificult to try to migrate with a media or press job, than it is with an IT related job.  
  
So I dont know what to do, I think also that I am already 29 and I feel that it is already too late to change carreer for the 3rd time in less than 2 years... yo I dont know what to do.  


Note: I am sinlge, no kids nor people that depend on me.

1868mhk,I’m stuck between 2 very different career paths and don’t know which one to go down,"I (18m) am stuck between two very different career paths. 

Originally, I wanted to be a police officer and I was passionate about law enforcement. I joined the explorer program with my local police department and spent a couple years there (pre covid). I went on ride alongs every weekend (most of which were 8 hours long) and I loved every second of it. Although most of the days were boring, I never wanted to leave the car at the end of the day. I have always had this undying urge to protect everyone and everything. 

After covid hit and everything locked down, I realized how much I love outer space. I would (and frankly, still do) spend hours on YouTube watching nothing but space documentaries. I wrote down EVERYTHING in my astronomy class and would sit outside at night on a blanket and just look up at the stars. I’d take my telescope out and stare at the moon. I’d find Jupiter and Saturn amongst the stars. I absolutely love studying outer space so I believed than being an astrophysicist was the right career for me. This has been my life for the last three years. 

However, during these last three years, every now and then, these feelings of wanting to be a police officer and protect my community would come rushing back to me. 

I’m currently in college studying physics. I don’t know which career to choose because I am so passionate about both and don’t want to waste more time in college than I need to because if I’m being completely honest, college life isn’t for me. Has anyone been in this kind of situation before? If so, how did you get out of it? Were you happy with your decision in the end? Does anyone have any advice?

Like the title suggests I’ve narrowed down 2 careers. The one I think I’ll succeed in would a track laborer with the railroad. I’ve had some experience as a laborer and I love traveling and working outdoors. I also think trains are pretty sick but I wouldn’t call myself a Foamer. (That’s slang for train nerd). The other option is being a firefighter. I’ve always had an interest in it however part of me seriously thinks I’d fail for a variety of reasons such as…..generally undisciplined, have done dumb things under pressure, mathematically illiterate, never had an “alter boy personality” commitment issues, not taking many things seriously, (including once cracking a joke at a funeral when I was 15). However I’ve never had too many difficulties working with others. My overall athleticism is pretty decent besides the fact i suck at running. And firefighting just seems more rewarding to me. For reference if it helps I’m 20 years old with no college degree, no certs to speak of. I have taken a variety of aptitude tests. Both of the jobs I have listed were top options which makes the decision even more difficult.

I have been doing a lot of self improvement recently and feel confident and ready to take steps to find a career that I believe I can excel in.

That’s what brings me to project management. In most of my jobs, I’ve ended up in leadership positions, whether it be the foreman of a crew or a shift leader/supervisor.

18673n9,MD badmouthed me at a company dinner. What should I do?,"I have been at my job for almost two years now. I worked very closely with this managing director. He gave me essentially all of my assignments, even though he was not my direct supervisor. I would call his clients every month, update his financial plans for his clients, and shadow his meetings. I was considered his “go-to girl.” 

About 3 1/2 months ago, I switched roles to a completely different team because this managing director told me that he was “moving me up and that my pay would increase via Zoom call, and none of these things happened. The head of our department said they could not promote me and asked me who said I was getting promoted. I said the MD, and they took his word over mine even though the conversation was via Zoom and all conversations are recorded. I told them to pull the Zoom call and take a listen, and they refused to do so. They told me I was “spreading a narrative to cover my ass,” and all the MD said afterward was, “Sorry you misunderstood. I never said that.” I was distraught, and from there, our professional relationship was sour. 

I just found out that there was a company dinner about a month ago. One of the other employees had said that he missed working with me. This MD said, “I don’t. That’s what happens when you think you’re more important than what you are.” 

I was not at the dinner, and I’ve been told by two people who attended the dinner that I am relatively close to the company. I don’t know if I need to talk to my manager about this individual or if it’s worth mentioning.

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

After which, I plan on applying to a supervisory role within my previous department since I can help them optimize some of the inefficiencies they're experiencing that I have encountered during my time there. Also, it's because of the management's great culture in my previous dept. Will applying right after the 6 month period the right call or should I just wait for a bit after that?

1865tpd,Is it time for me to leave the best job I’ve ever had? When do you know it’s time to quit?,"Is it time for me to leave the best job I’ve ever had?

I have lurked Reddit since 2011. This is my first account. 

Anyways, what can I say? I probably have one of the best jobs ever. 11 paid holidays? 2 weeks for Christmas? 2 weeks for Thanksgiving? 80 hours of paid time off a year? Boss regularly brings in steaks and grills? We all goof off? This is an office job. Did I mention I come in at 9am and leave at 4pm, but I get paid as if I worked 8-5? Did I mention the pay is so incredible, that it makes my wife jealous too? 

Holy cow, yeah I probably have the best job you ever heard, especially since I’m only 29. I’ve been told I’d be dumb, by my friends, to even consider it. What other job can I tell my boss, “hey I’m not coming in today LOL” and he says back, “lol” but puts on my time sheet that I came in anyways so I can get paid?

You can’t find a job as good as this, you just can’t! 

But here’s the thing though, I’m not interested in the grand amount of money I get. I’m not interested in the amazing benefits. Truthfully, I want to go back to college and leave the office world behind. I have two ideas of what I want to do in college (despite the fact I already have a degree)

However, I’m considering leaving my job for a slightly higher paying job to finish paying off my debt I owe on 3 credit cards. If I do that, I am thinking I can work a cheap closing shift job while I go back to college. 

I already have a plan, I know what I want to do, what I need to do, but my question is should I? Should I actually quit the best job ever, just to switch careers and fulfill my identity? 

Am I crazy for actually thinking about leaving it behind? It’s been on my mind for weeks. I’m just unsure if I should do this. Would you guys do it? Would you stay for the benefits?

How do you know it’s time to quit?",LurkMarc,2,1.0,7,1701203303,2023-11-28 20:28:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1865tpd/is_it_time_for_me_to_leave_the_best_job_ive_ever/,11,2023

1864f4a,New leadership role is making me doubt myself. What to do?,"In my mid-20s and been promoted as a manager of a team of 6. Team is relatively small and I think being on a leadership role this early is nothing but rewarding however I think I still lack vision and technical competence to lead. My strengths lie in my self-awareness and a bit of my personality tho I think. 

Now what's recently been happening is I can't make my ""people"" follow me coz they've already been burnt out by workload even before I came in. While I know for sure that it's part of the learning curve and all that adjustment stuff, right now I just think I'm not ready to deal with people coming to me to complain and vent and indirectly shift certain accountabilities from them to me. Their mistakes are now also my mistakes. Their oversights are now also my oversights. 

It's making me question my abilities. That maybe I'm not born to lead and maybe I work best as an individual contributor. 

Now I'm thinking of quitting as I guess self-doubt will eat me up early on my career. 

I honestly don't know what to do as I think no coaching can help me overcome this. Any tips? Or anyone who can shed light if choosing an individual contributor role over a leadership role makes me a red flag?",loveistheanswer111,3,1.0,3,1701199784,2023-11-28 19:29:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1864f4a/new_leadership_role_is_making_me_doubt_myself/,11,2023
1864f3y,I’m not making enough to survive,"Advice?
I’m afraid it will never ever change. I am 27f. Recently married. I should be so happy and I am so sad. I have a master’s degree and a job that pays $21 an hour. It’s hard to say if I’ll make more here anytime soon. My husband is working pre load for UPS and then as a driver helper. This is temporary until he can find something better and the hourly is as much as I make. We also own a bike shop, but new bike sales have dwindled severely post pandemic (which is why my husband is looking for other work and is part time now). However, our paychecks don’t even count. All of our money immediately goes to a car payment, gas, groceries (we are very frugal), bills and student loans. I have no ability to save for anything. I feel like at 27 I should at least be capable of saving. I think all the time about how I could be making more money on the side, but nothing ever seems like it will work without me completely overworking myself.

 I’m a certified personal trainer, but the Y where I train clients will only pay me 13.50 an hour for about 4 hours a week. It doesn’t even feel worth my time. To go private would mean having extra insurance and a gym to train from, which I don’t have the capital for. 

I feel like I did all the right things— went to school, got an extra degree— and have nothing to show for it.

I want a home so badly and I don’t ever see it happening. My husband can’t have kids without medical assistance even though we both want them and I don’t ever see being able to afford that either.

I spend my nights lying awake worrying about paying our bills and how I can whittle our grocery list. All I do is work it feels like— and I never have anything to show for it. 

I don’t know how to dig myself out. I think I have marketable skills— background in journalism and a masters in nutrition. I have applied to many remote part time  copy editing jobs with no luck. Any suggestions or leads?? I’ve applied to higher paying jobs, but most want more experience. I have nearly 3 yrs in nutrition education and 2 writing.",Pressuredrop718,17,0.8500000238418579,47,1701199783,2023-11-28 19:29:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1864f3y/im_not_making_enough_to_survive/,11,2023
18649zz,what job should i look for while in graduate school?,"for context, i am a senior undergraduate student at my university majoring in psychology with a minor in clinical and communicative behavioral health and a second minor in child studies. i graduate in the spring and i am hoping to start the counseling program at the same university that fall. i have the option to do it completely online (and it's accredited), so i am wanting to take that opportunity to work a bit more.

  
an issue that i am starting to discover is my age. i graduated high school with my associate's degree at 17, and now i'll be finished with my bachelor's at 19. (i'll start graduate school right before i turn 20.) many people have recommended that that graduate students work a serving job (which i have done before, but it's hard to find serving jobs that make decent money when you can't serve alcohol) or bartending (again, alcohol), but i am underage. 

  
i know that my undergraduate degree gives me very little options and many people have recommended to not try too hard to get a job in my field yet purely because the pay is less than many jobs without one. however, i am not really sure i have a lot of options. another concern i have is that although these classes are online, they still do meetings that start at 4 or 5 pm, which means i would need a job that can be a bit flexible with hours (i.e., working 6 to 3 instead of 9 to 5) based on what my schedule ends up being like each semester. 

  
i don't expect to be super comfortable because i know it's pretty unrealistic to expect a bunch of money right out of undergrad, but i want to at least not be worried that i won't make my rent (\~$400 with my roommates) when i move out. so, are there any other jobs that i can look for that would allow me to make okay money ($17+ an hour) despite my age?",Lumpy-Flan-2430,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1701199433,2023-11-28 19:23:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18649zz/what_job_should_i_look_for_while_in_graduate/,11,2023
1863k23,Timesheet and payment issue,"So, I have adhd. It causes me to avoid things I find taxing. I’m absolutely working on it but things don’t change over night ya know?

One thing I desperately despise and thus avoid is logging my hours. I am supposed to log them by signing into a vpn and clicking “clock in” and then the same to clock out daily. However this is just extremely annoying to me and time consuming. Therefore I opt to use the “timesheet” where I log my hours in the sheet online manually in a batch at the end of two weeks. 

The company doesn’t love this but they’re a huge corporation and have bigger fish to fry so it’s whatever. 

If you don’t log your hours by 12pm on the Monday they’re due (we are paid biweekly) then you don’t get paid. Normally they email you like hello?? 
I’ve gotten much better and typically haven’t gotten the email as I have gotten my times in ahead of time so no one really notices. 

Last pay period I fucked up and had to get emails from two different people like “hey fix this STAT and also don’t do this again” 

Well, due to the holiday weekend, I of course fucked up again. However I did not get an email. I thought I got my sheet in on time but it must have been just slightly too late. 

I am of course now super low on money and I checked my online portal for paychecks and it said I was paid a check or $0.00

It’s my fault. I completely know that. I am blaming literally no one but myself. 

Advice needed: do I reach out and explain or do I lose the two weeks of pay? 
I am lucky enough that I do not have children relying on me but this is going to be a really tough time until I get paid again. And of course I won’t get paid before rent is due. I have some cash I can deposit however to get me through. 

I’m just so embarrassed I am literally willing to lose out on ~$1500. Please help. 😔",throwawayxx125,1,0.25,5,1701197666,2023-11-28 18:54:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1863k23/timesheet_and_payment_issue/,11,2023
18630pu,I need an advice from ppl who been in the same situation.,"Hello 

This might be a bit long so thanks for reading in advance.

I'm 28 soon to be 29 yo male currently in Chicagoland and I work as a software Qa engineer. 

But here's the thing I don't want to have this job anymore the pay is not enough and lots of stress working with off shore teams.

Basically I make 80k and I'm single with taxes and other deductions I lose around 42% of my income and surviving on the rest is not worth it.

So since everything in this world falls under supply and demand I'm thinking of trades I like working with my hands but on the other hand not sure if my body would be able to cope with all the tough work since I'm a type 1 diabetic and uts hard for me to get insulin cause its expensive and I guess most ppl know that its a chronic disease unfortunately.

So in this case what should I do ? Should I start over with trades and go through the risk of wasting 2-5 years if it didn't work or just try to stick with what I do and look for other skills ?

I'm looking for advice from older ppl who've been in this phase of life before where moving forward is hard and staying at my current state is killing me.

My desire is to be free not working under someone and I wanna get married maybe in the next 3 years and start a family but as a millennial I feel like the world and the economy collapsed after covid and I can't afford anything now.

 cons for being a Qa engineer :

 The raise is about 3% and the company is struggling and I need a bit of more vacation time like more than 14 days to energize and get back at it.

But in tech more than 14 days is nearly impossible cause everything changes a lot and so fast and you won't be able to pick up.

Also the raise is not matching inflation and rent which is another hassle right now in the world and I can't afford a house to lock down my payments.

Also the rapid development of AI which is Making me feel like that at any point I might be jobless and the market might shrink in the next 3 years due to that.

Pros of being a qa engineer:

I can do this at an old age as well if there's still demand for this since its not too heavy on the body physically.


Pros of being a handy man (plumber) :

You can work as a freelance gaining more money and experience and growing your connections since almost most ppl live in residential buildings and they need maintenance or new construction.

Also I'm able to start my own thing and work on growing my own wealth and support my future wife to be.

Cons of being a handy man(plumber):

Since I'm a diabetic it might hit my body with lots of blood sugar lows ,fatigue and exhaustion.

After 45 I don't believe that I can do it unless I'm managing employees and directing them to do the right job.

Please give me an advise that might help me with the current market and pick me up from my situation cause I know that the economy is bad and inflation is over the roof but I wanna be stable I wanna enjoy life and pass my heritage.

Sorry for being too long at this but I believe I've explained my situation well.

1862wgb,"I got another job offer, should I leave my current company?","I’m (25f) having a tough time deciding to leave my current company. I work in Advertising at a really fun company. I love my co-workers, my work life balance in unbelievable, im respected and trusted, and I’ve been promoted 4 times in two years. I currently make 84k, usually with a 2k bonus at the end of the year. They have good insurance plans, 401k matching at 4% but no stock options. My company is also pretty well known in its industry so I’m constantly being invited to events, taken out to dinner, and I have weekly meetings with very well known companies. (Meaning great connections). They also have an office that I go in person to twice a week. 

The issue is that the company took on this huge venture a couple of years ago and doubled our staff, all the metrics are pointing to the venture not being successful. Our CEO had a meeting with the entire company and told us if we don’t hit our goals, our parent company will probably do layoffs. We will not be hitting our goals. My job in particular doesn’t seem at risk since I am revenue producing but I’m betting next year there will be layoffs and my advertising budget will be cut. Because of this I have been looking for other jobs.

I just got an offer from this very financially successful bootstrapped startup for 100k salary, an undisclosed amount of stock (they literally won’t tell me, Is that normal?), decent health benefits, some money yearly for a gym membership, a company a yearly holiday trip somewhere around the world, but no 401k matching. It’s fully remote so I would need to buy a desk at a co-working space because I will go insane otherwise. I would have less support and take on a manger role myself, hiring people this whole next year, which I think I would love. But it would also be a huge challenge, it seems like they don’t have their Ad team defined or structured yet so I would take on that burden. I’m still new to the industry with only 2.5 years of experience, I’m surprised they hired me tbh and I’m nervous I won’t be able to perform or know enough. They aren’t big spenders yet so I won’t have the CSM support from buying our partners either. They are not a well known company in my industry yet and I will be helping charge their new venture. (Their financial success comes from a different and older branch of the company). P.S. Their reviews on Glassdoor are some of the best reviews I’ve seen and the work life balance also seems great. 

All my friends and family are telling me to take the new job but it’s hard for me to say goodbye to a company I love that has treated me so well for a company I barely know anything about that will be a  challenge. I also feel terribly guilty for leaving my current company, my boss would essentially double her work if I left since our company is not doing backfills right now for people who quit.",becca383,2,0.6700000166893005,9,1701196025,2023-11-28 18:27:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1862wgb/i_got_another_job_offer_should_i_leave_my_current/,11,2023

We got a new VP two years ago who doesn't know anything about our department, other than just being in meetings and nag at us if something gets escalated to her

Our current manager was ""forced"" to be promoted to his current role last year because our ex manager just left the firm without any notice. Therefore, our current manager has no real experience or training on managing. 

Few months ago, they hired another management role that can be utilized different parts of the team within the department, currently partnering with our team.

Management has been pushing us, the associates to pretty much do things that are at a management level without any compensation.

For example, the management would come up with ""ideas"" to enhance our workflow when we are already trying to put down the fire, and never follow through, have us train the managers for the vendor teams, expects us to manage the junior roles within the teams without any proper training.

All of our team is clocking in about 30 mins to an hour early, and clocking out 30 mins later to process all of our tasks. 

Pretty much I am complaining about these added tasks that are not in my job description without any compensation nor proper training on. But of course I am doing the things they want us to do at my own pace for my resume purposes. I am studying other fields to get out of this team but, our raises and promotions happen beginning of January, and that's our only bet to have a huge raise

185wzoa,Rights/Options Hybrid Work Model,"Need some guidance… I assume the answer is  “You have to return to their work model or risk being let go without compensation” but maybe I’m missing something?

My situation; I’ve been working with the same company for 5+ years. My contract states that I am to work from Office A and it’s full time all in office work. With the pandemic there have been lots of changes. We moved to a 100% virtual work environment from 2020 - 2022. This year they have implemented a one day in office day at Office B (in a different city) and next year are moving to a 3 day in office hybrid model at Office B. I try to accommodate the schedule for this year but it’s a difficult commute. 

So here’s my dilemma. My contract states that I’m to report to Office A which doesn’t exist anymore (one of the pandemic changes with the company). 

So really. What options do I have?
Do I have a leg to stand on as far as compliance?
If I can’t meet the demands next year could I be let go because of it? 
Should I be reviewing something more closely in my contract?

A couple of other notes, I have not signed any new contracts. The company is hiring employees that can work remotely 5 days a week to attract new staff (I guess the old ones get the shaft) and I feel I have good job security at the company.

I’m also not trying to be difficult about it but I’m trying to avoid getting taken advantage of.

I've been part of a ""tech scale-up"" for 1.5 years, initially finding it exciting and fulfilling. However, the landscape drastically altered with successive rounds of layoffs and top-level changes. Witnessing my connections disappear one by one through these layoffs left me feeling isolated and demoralized.

This transition has drained my motivation, leaving me feeling burnt out, constantly stressed, and disconnected from my work.

185t8hu,Conflicted about changing jobs,"
So I have been working at my current role for approximately five years. It's a fairly good job, pay could be better, but I am well established and a fairly important part of the team despite having no real seniority and still am in the same role I started with.

However, the place has suffered from chronic understaffing since the pandemic, and a number of staff have left unexpectedly since.  As a result I have put in a fairly tough year of basically covering most every task of the departed co-workers and more, which has placed serious strain on me mentally. All the work basically fell to me while managers made little effort to do anything differently. It has been a grim year, truthfully. 

This said, we have recently gotten another senior member of staff and this has alleviated the workload, so things have improved somewhat.  I get on well with the team and my workplace is fairly close to home, so save for the lack of staff and opportunities, it's not a bad place to be. 

However, I feel that after five years, it is time to move on. I feel I have stagnated in the current role and like the idea of a new challenge. 

As such I have an interview for a similar job, in what is better company in a much better staffed team, next week. The new organisation seems to be more future-focused and better run and all in all a better place to be.

But on the flipside, I would be doubling my commute to take this role, for only nominally better pay.

I am conflicted over the commute, which is a major drawback. I am also worried about the fact that I would be leaving the team in the lurch, especially when things have only picked up staffing wise.

I know you have to look out for yourself, but the thought of leaving them to deal with another member of staff leaving is weighing on me. They would also probably be asking why I would move to basically the same job which is much farther away, and bridges could be burned if the new opportunity doesn't work out.

The work, pay, WLB are all decent and it is a merit based culture all along. I have been rated top performer every year since I have joined and I'm pushing close to partnership.

However, the Partner I work back with since 2018 is very controlling and doesn't let me manage clients or pursuits independently or build my own network.

Listing some of the petty things he does to portray himself as the ultimate authority.

1) Makes me heavy lift for his not so bright other direct reports at my level when they mess up an engagement
2) Allocates easier engagements and accounts to them and difficult to pursue/grow ones to me. But says I have improve my account management skills. Infact , he has taken away two accounts that I have personally pursued, delivered and grown to someone else
3) Always speaks after me after I have explained our pitch/approach to clients
4) Does a lot of back channel with clients to position himself as the knight to save difficult day
5) Asks me to take accountability when i position difficult decisions that only a partner can make. I see this as risk evasion and scapegoating even before the risk as already happened

I'm quite outspoken and straight forward and I have already told him in his face not to do 1-4 , he agrees then but he keeps repeating it often. 

He is also an office gossip monger and encourages employees to bitch about each other and uses it against the particular employees.

He also positions himself as a saviour of hard times infront of executive management but never gives credit to me infront of them.

I have a classmate who pitched to me an idea to start a business together doing medical concierge.

As far as I can see, nothing has changed and the reason is ‘we can’t really afford extra staff right now.’ I persist with engaging with the team and just feels like I can barely get their attention for more than a minute. It doesn’t help that she also makes simple video content and doesn’t talk to me about it.

I've got a diverse but not deep knowledge from programming and web design to having a bit of marketing knowledge. The challenge is, I lack the confidence to label myself as 'skilled' and secure a job and I think I need to learn more or master something until I can apply for one. I would prefer remote jobs but even if I have to get out and work I believe I could do it, the problem is where I live there's not much job offers especially for someone like me who is young and unexperienced.

I've got full time availability on my hands, and I'm eager to learn new skills. I'm even willing to working for free initially just to gain that valuable experience. Desperation has kicked in, and even a $200/month salary would be a good starter for me at this point. I'm reaching out to you all for advice. What skills should I focus on to quickly land a job?

I'm a 25 year old male residing in the US, holding a BA in Political Science from a British university. For the past 5 years, I've been navigating the home improvement industry, from project management in flooring to selling custom gates, fences, and garage doors. Recently, I started my own small venture in garage doors. However, I feel it's time for a change.

Here's what I'm looking for:

1. Prefer a small to medium-sized business environment; not a fan of the hardcore corporate setting.
2. Open to sales, but minimal to no lead generation; not keen on proactive business development.
3. White-collar profession.
4. Would like to avoid data-heavy roles; not proficient in crunching numbers or managing extensive Excel sheets.

I enjoy interacting with people and influencing their decisions, but absolutely hate the idea of proactive business development and lead generation for someone. Any advice on a suitable career path that aligns with these preferences would be greatly appreciated.

185n8wx,Need Career advice after running a business - What did you do and what's one piece of advice for me?,"As the title suggest: What career did you pursue after running/exiting a business.  
I'm 26 and fortunate enough to run a profitable consulting business since I was 21, however i'm experiencing burnt out and slowly losing my passion as time goes by. My salary is around $140k/year and I live a pretty frugal lifestyle. Now my biggest concern is the sustainability of the business and fluctuations of income if my end goal is to start a family by age 32, with the added responsibilities & commitment - my plan is to slowly deviate from the business and pursue a career path that is more secured and predictable. I would like to get involved in tech startups or into private equity. A little more context, I never worked corporate before and I have a degree in marketing & finance.  
So here are my top 3 options so far and I would like to hear everyone's suggestions:  
\- Option 1 - Start using some of the profits of the business to pursue my MBA and prep for the GMAT exam. Hire a co-operator to delegate to and buy back some time. Still run the business for another 5 years without much involvement.  
\- Option 2 - Run the business and go full scale for another 3 years - focus on increasing multiples. Have an exit plan in place that'll make selling the business feasible. Take the proceeds from the exit and work for a startup for the experience rather than the pay.  
\- Option 3 - Run the business as is but work part time at a startup as a project manager to add to my resume in the meantime.  
It's honestly scary to think about the future, would really appreciate as much advice or feedback as possible.

185l6um,"I quit my job because the owner attacked me. What do I say for ""reason for leaving"" on job applications?","I know that it's bad to say anything negative about former employers on job applications, but I genuinely have no idea what to say for this one. The job itself was great. I loved the work, and I loved everyone else who worked there, and the managers were awesome. The only problem was the owner, and specifically this one incident.

I was working as a baker and for Thanksgiving, she gave me a list of new recipes that she wanted me to make. She made an obvious mistake on one of them but decided to ignore multiple calls and text messages before she finally called back, told me not to question her before I was able to say anything, and immediately hung up. When she finally came in for the day and saw that I had followed her incorrect instructions, she backed me into a corner, screamed at me, and blocked me from leaving the room. I had to physically push her off of me to get away and quit on the spot. 

Every recommendation I've seen for people who quit because of a bad boss said to say stuff like ""I'm looking for a new challenge"" or ""It just wasn't a great fit"" but those don't really apply. Saying I'm looking for a new challenge or to advance doesn't make sense because I was the head baker, I have 10 years of experience in the field, and if I wanted to advance in the field, the only thing to do would be to start my own business. Saying that it wasn't a good fit doesn't make sense because the job was a perfect fit, and I want the exact same kind of job in the future. I'm in a very niche specialty, I'm very good at it, I want to stay in that niche, and I know that the people hiring want someone who can just jump in, do the work, and do it well. The only thing I can think of saying is ""the job was perfect for me but the owner physically attacked me"" but that doesn't seem right either. How do I explain what happened without seeming bitter but still being honest about what kind of job I'm looking for?",lilsalmonella,63,0.9700000286102295,46,1701138489,2023-11-28 02:28:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/185l6um/i_quit_my_job_because_the_owner_attacked_me_what/,11,2023
185kwdl,"Just moved to US, need advice for associate or bachelor degree","Hello people,

First of all i am so sorry about my English, may not be the best one you guys read everyday. It is not my native language that's why i may do many mistakes.

I just moved to US a year ago, as an asylum seeker im doing things i never did back in my country and im gonna write a short-story about what i did back in my country;

• First thing, i have a bachelor in Law, went to masters for Finance in Law but didnt finish it cause college got closed because of Covid, here in US i know Bachelor in Law its a whole another Universe, and its expensive and blla blla, its not something i see myself looking for,
• I was a professional basketball player, and i played for the best team of my country, but a back injury happened and doctors told me to not play anymore,
• I became a head coach for 7 years, even managed at a very young age to be assistant coach for my national team, After 7 years i finally found out that i dont like doing it and i actually hate it, cause not being able to put the shoes on and play, compete like i used to as a player, its hurtful!
• I worker for an Inventory Management company, i was a Coordinator, there we used to manage the Liquor of the Bars and Restaurants, how much they are spending, how much they are buying, and creating a work ystem for the bars and restaurants.

• Participated in many basketball camps and activities with different organisations, even got a certification from San Antonio Spurs (NBA) as a young perspective coach.

Since i came to US, since i got my work authorisation, i worked at a Construction for one of my relatives company, didnt learn a thing, cause they were unprofessional at what they did.
And after that im trying to be a bartender just so i can finance everything of what i wanna do in the future (associate degree or a bachelor degree)

My real question is:
Im 30 years old, for the next 5 years im planning to work as a bartender, while working i wanna finish something that after 5 years is gonna give me a real job, and a career that i can hold it till the end,
I really dont know what im good at, and what i wanna do or enjoy doing it, as long as i can provide good for my future family that im planning to create here, i dont mind.
I dont think i wanna do things like Plumbing or
HVAC.
What attratcs my mind everytime i do research for career are: officee jobs, something like 8 to 4 from monday to friday, jobs that i can turn to remote easily, things like that,
If anyone can understand what im trying to say, help me or suggest me it would mean a world to me.

185klib,Currently majoring in Software Engineering as a freshman and don't know if this is what I really want to do,"I once enjoyed coding, truly. I wasn't spectacular at it, but it was fun. I was in a computer science class my junior year of high school, and I really enjoyed the projects in that class. The great joy and feeling proud of the small projects I did felt so good. They weren't anything grand, but I liked them. Even when I struggled with my code, I still enjoyed it, and that was new to me. I had never enjoyed struggling with something and solving it...it was like a puzzle, and I like puzzles! Eventually though, the new teacher didn't teach and I didn't code as much.

Now I'm a software engineering major and am struggling with not only my programming classes, but my math class as well. I hate math. When I'm able to understand, I like it...but those times don't last too long. Prof doesn't teach and getting help on my work isn't as easy. I'm drowning. I can't code and I can't do math. What can I do?

I've thought about switching majors and maybe doing Journalism. I'm not too good at writing, but I enjoy it sometimes...as frustrating as it can get. I've also won a couple of awards for my writing, though they weren't high places like 1st or 2nd. The problem with this would be that the university I currently attend is predominantly a STEM school. No journalism major. I would have to switch to a whole different university and given that I'm not sure it's something I definitely want to do, it scares me. I don't want to switch majors because I would have to apply somewhere else and I really enjoy this school. I also have good friends here and I'm afraid that I'll disappoint my family if I do switch. A ton of money has gone towards me attending this university. It's a good school and I should be glad I got accepted into this major at this uni, but I'm not sure if I want to continue. I can't take a gap year either since again, I'll disappoint....and I've taken out a few federal loans to be here.

Something else to add is that I don't think my chances of financial success would be great as a Journalism major, compared to a Software Engineering major. Given that that's something I want and would need in order to pay off any loans I may take in the future, it adds to the cons of switching my major. I don't feel proud of feelings this way. I want to enjoy my major, but it's difficult. I'm sure journalism will be difficult, and I'll hate it at times. Not so great job outlook, not an incredible pay compared to SE majors, and I don't know how much I'll enjoy it. I wish I knew the right choice to make here, but sadly I don't and I'm not sure anyone else does.",Puzzleheaded_Stay73,1,1.0,1,1701136791,2023-11-28 01:59:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/185klib/currently_majoring_in_software_engineering_as_a/,11,2023
185k7u2,Is there a career for me?,"I'm 25, a woman and I live in England.

To summarise a lot of context in a couple of sentences: my career to date has been patchy to non existent. I worked in nursing homes as a carer through the pandemic and I've decided that I'm never doing it (or anything related) again. I now work part time as a teaching assistant supporting a couple of kids who have special educational needs. I love the kids, I hate the politics and constantly having to fight for what they need. Due to various health factors, I'm at a cross roads in my life and I would like pointers for a future direction. 

I have qualifications in health and social care and mediocre GCSEs. I don't have a degree and I've not been to university. I would be interested in attending uni, if only to show the teachers who reckoned I was too thick to teach how wrong they were. I have Ehlers Danlos syndrome (a connective tissue disorder) and I'm autistic. I find it difficult to be on my feet for long periods due to my pain levels and I'm likely to need a wheelchair more permanently in the future. As a result, jobs like nursing are completely out of the question. I have PTSD from my experiences during the pandemic and I'm not sure I could cope or function in a similar environment today. 

I love books, I love writing and I have an amazing memory for text. I can recite multiple volumes off the top of my head, even if I've not read them for years. If I read something through a few times, I'll be word perfect for life. I also have a weirdly specific perfect memory for the locations of books. I can tell you exactly where books are in my mother's house even though I've not been there in months. My mother's library is around 2,500 books so this isn't a small feat. These amazing fears of memory are extremely isolated and specific. My memory for other arguably more important things is patchy. I have washed laundry three or four times before actually remembering to hang it up and my partner has to remind me to eat or I forget to all day.

I'm not particularly good at following orders and I have little awareness or respect for social hierarchies. This is great when I'm working with kids, they love being treated like an equal. It's not so great when I'm talking to adults who think they're above me and mistake my lack of deference as disrespect. An environment where there are strict social hierarchies that I must respect won't suit me. I'm also not very good at doing as I'm told if I don't agree with it. This is problematic for my career longevity in education specifically, especially in the UK if they try and force schools to out trans kids to their parents. I don't care what I'm threatened with, I'm not doing it.

The main sectors I'm definitely not interested in going near are tech, finance or building type trades. I am not technically minded in the least. I have too many morals and socialist grandparents to work in finance and I'd be a liability on a building site. I have no coordination and I have been known to trip over thin air. It would be funny for everyone else at least, and I'm sure I'd provide useful experience for any medical students in A&E. 

As you can tell by my career to date, I'm not motivated by money particularly; although more than the minimum wage would be nice. I don't care about status. I just want a job where I'll be happy and can help people without killing myself in the process. I don't have family connections to any job sectors at all in the area of the country I actually live in. I moved as far away from my parents as I can possibly get without getting wet.

TL;DR, I like books and I want a job where I can help people that doesn't require total self sacrifice or deference to authority figures. Also teenagers scare me. Oh, and I'm very hard of hearing so any career that involves lots of phone calls is out, especially if my hearing things accurately is vital. Nobody wants an ambulance call handler that can't transcribe a postcode. Career should include books and not too much in the way of stroking egos to get on.

185jd01,Should I give more than 2 weeks notice? (Software Engineer),"M25, if that helps with context at all. I signed a job offer that starts in a month. Leaving has put in a pretty awkward position because I currently act as the sole software engineer at my current company. I wrote most of the code that automates certain mission critical aspects from the ground up, and day to day work for certain departments is almost completely reliant on tools I have engineered. The board of directors seems to have thought they got me cheap, and got excited they could develop first party tooling with one guy. 

The head of the board has warned my boss/CTO that we probably shouldnt silo the software position off MULTIPLE times. Despite this, over the course of 3 years thats exactly what happened. My boss is a cool guy, and I'd like to leave on good terms, but im nervous about how I go about doing this. Im sure the board will want to take his head for allowing this to happen. 

He has to find a software engineer willing to take on my work and technical debt, and the (ill be real with you) speghetti code I made when I was fresh out of undergrad. Or, he'd have to completely revamp what we're doing and possibly start talks with third parties.

I'd feel really bad if I only gave 2 weeks notice.

185iosn,I am not the best at explaining situations,"Hey folks 👋🏻 lets get straight to point. I am currently first semester of computer science and engineering program (5-years), there’s always thoughts going in my mind about switching majors or even if am i in the right place? Cs is pretty chill i am doing well in introduction of computer science, struggling a bit in math and phy but all passes. At high school i took cs courses and i loved it also i was top in my class which isnt smth usual for me and that is one of the main  reasons to persue cs degree however, at high school i wanted to be a doctor, i applied for medical schools and got accepted but i passed the offer because i was scared from this career, omg you might kill someone or even not get good in university  to even graduate another reason is all the years i will be putting in studies that made me discouraged. But as now i am thinking to quit cs and the main reason is ageism and all stories about how difficult to get into tech jobs and all the layoffs companies do . I am thinking to  start dentistry! My sister is senior dental school and i find it very interesting. What are your thoughts i know it’s difficult to understand my story and even more difficult to understand my personality but please advise me with whatever you can.

185imwa,Anyone have luck transferring their role to a different department within the company?,"Background: less than a year ago I took a role doing marketing analytics. However, the job turned out to be much more tech-heavy than expected and I’m finding myself overseeing tag coding for the company website. I’m also doing a lot more requests for site usage & troubleshooting errors than marketing, probably only 20% of my time is devoted to the job I thought I’d be doing. 

With that said, I don’t actually hate the work. I can be interesting at times and very rewarding when I figure out how to tackle a difficult request. What I do dislike though, is my boss who doesn’t understand the level of work I’m doing (there’s some context to this that I’ll note below), gives unhelpful suggestions and wants me to do more marketing stuff. Which I get, that’s what he hired me to do. 

Now onto the additional context: there was a guy who was specialized in the tech-heavy stuff I was doing, but he was laid off shortly after I started so his tasks ended up on my plate. We have a data enablement team, but they don’t use the software I do. Fired guy was doing a lot of unseen work that my boss clearly doesn’t know the extent of and didn’t plan a backup for. He thinks an agency we hired was supposed to absorb his duties - but they don’t have insight to our business setup and usually come to me with questions anyway. If I don’t do it… things just won’t be done and it will negatively impact things (plus make me look bad). 

I’ve talked to my boss about changing my job title and workload, which he was open to. But after getting to know the data enablement team more, I feel like it makes more sense to join them and report to their director. My boss oversees A LOT of departments regarding marketing and VOC. I personally think it makes more sense for the campaign planners to handle metrics (they are more familiar with the goals and different plans they have running) and for me to shift to site analytics in DE. However, I’m unsure how to approach this. 

Has anyone been in a similar spot and had success?",TheUserAboveFarted,1,1.0,0,1701131305,2023-11-28 00:28:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/185imwa/anyone_have_luck_transferring_their_role_to_a/,11,2023
185ik1k,General advice needed,"Hello!

So a bit of a background, I am 21 years old about to start nursing school after a few years of taking classes trying to figure out what I want to do. So, I already feel behind even though it doesn't matter and I shouldn't think like that. Anyways, before starting college my dream was to take a gap year and live in a French speaking country to learn French. Due to the pandemic that dream was crushed and I honestly lost motivation for it, however I have taken a handful of French classes in college. Now, I am starting to think about how much I loved learning and speaking French (all languages in general, honestly) and I am thinking I should follow that small flame in my heart.

I am going to nursing school because I also have a passion for science and I love the flexibility and security nursing brings. I also love that I can get the degree in two years and be employed instantly. But, now that I am thinking about language again, part of me wishes I had done that in college instead.... but I also don't like the cost of education:salary ratio. I cannot make a decision for the life of me. 

I guess I just need general advice. I think I am going to stick with nursing because I just want to commit to something. But, if I started to practice French again on my own,... could that open ""career"" doors in the future? I also love to write and have thought about translating/editing, but again I don't love the salary those jobs bring. Urrrghhh I am constantly scared of 1.) making the wrong choice, and 2.) not living up to my full potential.

185hv9e,Going back to school for different degree after graduating only three years ago?,"Opinions going back to school for something else (Physical Therapy Assistant) after having graduated three years ago with another degree (economics) that I haven’t used/don’t care about? Money would be tight but willing to do it. And a drag to go back to school again… take 2-3 prereqs this winter then in the fall start two years in the program.

I will be working in an office soon for the possibly new career area, gaining experience, then possibly starting my prereqs in January… so I want to decide soon. Would only give me roughly 50 hours of experience before jumping into prereqs… I’m starting a job Dec 4 and working 2.5 weeks before I go on vacation.

I don’t really want to wait another year to decide and gain more experience but maybe it would be a good idea, I don’t know.

I’m also interviewing for another job (Health Educator) in another state which could be cool but I’m way of that career field with job availability… and idk if I did that job I don’t think I’d try to shadow a PTA for future consideration of being a PT because it’s a small town and could be with the same company, nor would I probably have time.

Also, many Health Educator jobs want you to have a bachelors in a health field anyways but maybe experience could work in place. So regardless I could possibly want to do two more years in school anyways…

185hpkp,Should I apply when I know I won’t accept an offer?,"I’m currently working in a government position in hopes that it would get my foot in the door with the same government but a slightly different department; a field I went to school for and am very passionate about. 

In my time in my current position, I have made good connections in my dream-job field and now a job opportunity has opened. It’s a 2 year term position, though likely to become permanent.

Thing is, I just found out I’m pregnant, and the term would start approximately 2 months before I would take maternity leave. 

Because my pregnancy is still early on, and I have had pregnancies not pan out before, I feel like I should still apply, just in case. However, when the interviewing period would come up for this position, it would be around the same time I plan on telling my employer.

So I’m in a weird spot. I’m being encouraged to apply for this position by key people in my dream-job field, however, I’m not at the point of disclosing my pregnancy. 

Do I apply and interview, and when the interview comes up, then I disclose? Or is that just seen as wasting their time? 

Also, given this is a government position, does me applying and possibly getting rejected or rejecting an offer myself blacklist me in the future if this position were to come up again?",_janedoe666,1,1.0,2,1701128900,2023-11-27 23:48:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/185hpkp/should_i_apply_when_i_know_i_wont_accept_an_offer/,11,2023

Job A is more of an IT/help desk support position which is troubleshooting shooting computer hardware and software.

Job B is more of a production technician role which involves electrical and mechanical repair of manufacturing machinery.

I have an A.S. in computer information systems but no job experience doing helpdesk. Job A would give me the experience to kickstart an IT career, and Job B will give me the experience to get in to the technical trade field.

I like both because they involve teamwork and problem solving, the only thing I don't like about Job A is the customer service side of things which is why I sometimes enjoy doing Job B better.

There is no guarantee with Job A that they will be able to find me work once the contract ends in 6 months. But I will have gained some valuable work experience to take somewhere else.

Job B is a contract to hire role after 3 months guaranteed I just really have to prove myself during the training from what the hiring manager said. Techs are always leaving this company though because ""they found something better"" which makes me scared to take a chance with them.

Both jobs have great outlooks for the coming future which is why I'm having a hard time deciding.

185hhoo,"Take a Director job I am under qualified for, to work for someone you barely know","I have been offered a Director position by my employer but the Vp who offered it to me barely knows me and we spoke for only 15 minutes about the role. I believe the offer is based on other persons advocating for me and to keep me in company. 

I have worked at this company for over 10 years in the IT department. Started on the help desk and have moved every 2 to 3 years due to promotion or lateral move all within the IT department and adjacent functions (Project Mgmt and Process Mgmt). Been at manager lever for ~5 years but not always had a large team. 

I have been in my current mgmt role for less than a year but my time is consumed way more with operation tasks (coordinating support response) and project fire fighting than I expected and I am not enjoying it. I have 15 direct reports plus multiple consulting teams. 

Looked outside the company and got offered a position with another large company, more money, no direct reports, person I interviewed with  seems great and I could tell we would be a good team. In recounting my experience during the interview it reminded me of all the great opportunities I had over the years and the freedom to move around internally at my current employer. When HR presented me with the offer I asked some questions about senior leadership being in office or remote (as it is a remote position) and they indicated senior leaders are all in office, so I came to the conclusion I was better to stay and try to move into a role I enjoy more. 

I informed my boss of my desire to move and that I got an offer elsewhere but declined it to stay. They are all good to support me. I then get a call back from the new company, they revise the offer and assure me remote senior leaders exist and it will not be a hindrance in progressing. 

I speak to a few people though back channel about opportunities in their teams, not to twist any arms but just to understand my options. I end up with an offer of a Director position in Data Transformation, a net new function and opportunity to build team. 

It seems almost too good to be true, this level role does not become available very often and I have no data engineering background, but do have a background in Project mgmt, general leadership, and have worked with data (creating reports in relational DBs) but not as my sole focus.

Ive (22M) been in the corporate life for about 3 years. I’ve worked at 2 companies in that time and have done some different office work related stuff. Sitting at a desk all day is really getting to me and I’m just not learning anything that I’m interested in or want to do as a career. 

I left my first company as I was literally doing about 2 hours of work a week, and felt my life wasting away. Now at my second company thats much bigger and it’s better, but I’m still doing useless work that feels redundant and is just super boring. I do however get a great wage at 85k a year.

Ive been toying with the idea of trade work. Ive always liked being outside and working, and in earlier labour jobs I had I always felt accomplished at the end of the day when I felt tired and saw the job completed in front of me. I had so much more energy, I was way more fit, tan, and honestly just had more zest for life.

Now I’m squishy (even though I hit the gym regularly) very sluggish and have very low energy to do anything. I feel as if I was cheated in not doing a trade and getting a useless business degree just to fill up a corporate job that fills a quota.

I thought about being an electrician, however I’m absolutely terrified of heights. Mechanic was next as I have a massive interest in cars, but I’ve heard the money is dog shit. So ive settled on Diesel Mechanics. Larger rigs, more money, and more knowledge. Plus its in my interests. If i was purely in it for money id become a plumber or something.

Does this seem like a stupid decision? I genuinely feel like it would be a lifelong career choice for me but afraid that I will hate it like my office jobs. My parents also think its dumb that id be leaving a high paying office job to start over as an apprentice.

185f4rv,Fireside Chat with a Software Engineer - What do you do?,"As part of helping people with their careers, I've been interviewing different people who are in different roles asking them - what do you do?  
  
From unravelling the mysteries of code to navigating the dynamic landscape of a software engineer's daily life, this interview promises insights and advice for aspiring tech enthusiasts. 21 questions are answered.  
  
The Value Add:  
This will hopefully give people a realistic understanding of the day-to-day responsibilities, challenges, and expectations associated with a particular job. Question 21 will hopefully set people up for success  
  
Here we go!  
  
Q: Where are you located?  
  
A: I am based in London, England, UK.  
  
Q: What is your role title?  
  
A: My role title is Software Engineer.  
  
Q: In your words, describe what you actually do?  
  
A: As a software engineer, I write, test and maintain code for various software applications. I collaborate with other teams like business analysts and UX designers to understand requirements, then design, develop, troubleshoot and improve the software.  
  
Q: How long have you been doing this role for?  
  
A: I've been a software engineer for around 5 years.  
  
Q: How did you get to this point in your career?  
  
A: I studied computer science in university, completed some internships at tech companies, and started out as a junior developer after graduating. I gained experience and worked my way up to my current role.  
  
Q: When it comes to remuneration, what are your three B’s? (Base, Bonus, Benefits?)  
  
A: My base salary is competitive. I am on a base salary of £60k and also get an annual bonus based on company and personal performance. Benefits include health insurance, retirement contributions, and lots of time off.  
  
Q: I’m not going to ask you who you work for, but, what industry is your company in?  
  
A: I work at an insurance company which is owned by a large UK insurance group.  
  
Q: When it comes to work flexibility, is your work primarily office-based, fully remote, or a mix of both? Which do you prefer? Does your company allow you to be flexible?  
  
A: I have a mix of office and remote work. I go to the office several days a week for meetings and collaboration, but can also work from home when I need more focus. I like the flexibility to do both. My company is very open to remote work.  
  
Q: What does an average week or a typical day look like for you? Can you walk me through your day? What time do you arrive and start at work, what are your main tasks/responsibilities, who do you interact with, what meetings do you attend, etc.?  
  
A: I get to the office around 9am, check messages, then usually have a standup meeting with my team. Later is focused work time to code new features or fix bugs. I'll have some meetings with other teams to discuss requirements. I leave around 5 or 6pm.  
  
Q: What does a typical day look like when things are going well vs a more challenging/stressful day?  
  
A: On good days I'm very productive, knock out tasks and feel I accomplished a lot. Stressful days have too many meetings, unclear goals, and distractions.  
  
Q: What skills or knowledge are most important for your day-to-day work?  
  
A: I need to have strong programming skills in languages like Java and JavaScript. Communication and collaboration are also really important.  
  
Q: What are some examples of recent accomplishments or contributions you've made in this role?  
  
A: I recently led development of a new claims processing feature that helped increase speed. I also did some cloud migration work that improved reliability.  
  
Q: Do you have a supportive manager and do you feel valued?  
  
A: My manager trusts me and values my input. I feel supported.  
  
Q: How much time do you spend collaborating with colleagues vs working independently?  
  
A: It's about 50/50 independent vs collaborative work. Coding is solo but meetings and planning involve others.  
  
Q: Is there anything you wish you would have known before starting this role?  
  
A: How many meetings there would be! It's much more collaborative than school projects.  
  
Q: What do you hate most about your role?  
  
A: Dealing with unclear requirements or scope creep is frustrating.  
  
Q: What do you love most about your role?  
  
A: I love solving problems with code and building things that help people. Seeing it go live is very rewarding.  
  
Q: What’s the next role for you and when do you hope to achieve this?  
  
A: In 2-3 years I hope to be a team lead or a senior engineer.  
  
Q: Is your next role going to be with the same company or a different one?  
  
A: I plan to stay with this company for my next role. I like the culture here.  
  
Q: What’s one piece of advice you could give to someone who aspires to reach your position?  
  
A: Keep learning and trying new things. Technical skills are important but so are communication skills.  
  
Q: It’s Day 1 for someone in your role. What one piece of advice would you give them to succeed?  
  
A: Here is a piece of advice I would give to someone starting in a Software Engineer role:

185b1si,Stuck in a job I hate - advice please,"Hello Reddit, 

I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice.

I work in housebuilding as a recruiter and have done so now for 15 years (I've been doing it pretty much since leaving school).
I was never one for pushing myself when in education and kind of fell into recruitment, in particular construction. I never really saw it as a sales job and have built up a good network over the years of clients and candidates. 
However recently since the interest rates have gone through the roof, production has slowed down a great deal and I find that I have fallen completely out of love with it all. It's been really tough financially also (as it is for many UK households at the moment I guess), I have 3 kids (2 in jr school and a 5 month old). My wife gave up her career 6 years ago when we had our first child so it's been on me and it's been pretty good financially until this past year. 

My basic wage is just covering the bills (no commision at the moment) and I feel I'm stuck doing a job that I hate but also have overheads with a mortgage and 4 dependents.

Has anyone got any advice or tips on how I can get out of recruitment and construction with perhaps a more fruitful and fulfilling job?

I love working and happy to do long hours /nights to provide for my family, also happy to retrain and travel if need be. 

Any advice would be great 😃",HarryMerton,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1701112642,2023-11-27 19:17:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/185b1si/stuck_in_a_job_i_hate_advice_please/,11,2023

I live in a LCOL area and have gone from position to position, disliking every one I've done more than the last. My most previous position was paying 85k/yr and they were working me like a dog, I even developed some health problems from the stress.

&#x200B;

The level I was functioning in that position, I could easily find a 120k - 140k position, or potentially more if I wanted to try moving up. But, the thought of moving up makes me want to vomit if more stress comes with it.

I've been looking at postings and found a position that pays 80k/yr, and it sounds like a cool gig, but I am just sort of going for it because I feel like I will hate it the least.

Is it dumb of me to go for a position like this, when I could be making 80%+ ?

1859nct,Gen Z Workplace Problems,"I'm not sure if this is just a me problem, generational problem, or if more people experience this but I have been having major issues with getting acclimated to my office workplace setting since graduating college.

I got a job with a small construction company after graduating college (I studied Economics but it was the only place that offered me a position after graduating). It is a fairly fast paced work environment with jobs going on constantly with mainly small crews (4-6 people) operating in a given area. Earlier this year I was promoted to Project Manager and it has been very difficult to adjust.

My management gives me little to no guidance on how to do my job and have high execrations for me to make money on every job I manage. With all this has come very high levels of anxiety and dread going into work. I wake up and think ""what's going to happen today to stress me out"" and keep on feeling I have no idea what I'm doing and no one else to lean on for help.

The reason I'm posting about this is I'm trying to get opinions on if this is an issue with me as an individual not being able to adapt to workplace setting. I see so many people able to go into work every day and handle their jobs. For me I always feel like each day is a burden on me and have been thinking it could lead to certain mental health issues. Really unsure if this is a generational thing too or something.

I was part of a wider company meeting specifically discussing my department being overwhelmed with the amount of work we're dealing with. Most people in this meeting (a dozen people aprox) were on board productively trying to figure out solutions.

However one person, who is not my manager and has had conflicts with another coworker in my department in the past, publicly brought up everyone in my department's salary and said we should just be expected to work more efficiently given our pay and doesn't see what the problem is. I am not highly paid to be clear. This person is more senior than me and I'm sure makes more than the salary that was brought up. I was completely taken aback by this and was incredibly upset. I have no idea how they knew my salary as I do not work under them. 

I'll be talking to my director about how frustrating this was regardless. They manage all of the people involved here, and they are also fairly new to the director role and unfortunately did not take more assertive steps as this meeting went sideways.

Hey everyone,  
I've been in the tech scene since 2015, after spending some time in insurance sales and retail. Now in my mid-30s, I'm starting to feel like I've hit a wall. I've climbed the ladder, even made it to VP, but it's just not doing it for me anymore. The work feels empty.

But I'm kind of stuck on how to make that leap and don't really have all of the funding to support my goals comfortably. I worry that I never really will.

23y'old. 
I did my school in India with Maths, Physics, Chemistry, English and computer.
I did my bachelor's during pandemic in Ancient History, English Literature, and economics. I dropped economics in third year and I studied history and literature. It's my fault, but I did not learn any skills during the pandemic but did help my father with his business. 


Now I'm an international student to UK from India. I'm currently pursuing MSc Management from Essex. I'll be completing my course in October 24. So I've less than a year to make something of myself. 

My modules include
 Management and Strategy
 Organisational Behaviour and Human Resources
 Accounts and finance
 Marketing and Innovation 
 organisational and Supply chain management
 Research methodology


I'm kinda enjoying Management and Strategy but I've no idea about O.B and HR. I think I'll also enjoy Supply chain management.

I'm also learning German to be a lucrative candidate.
Beyond that I'm lost.

What skills should I pursue and are there any Websites to learn and get certificates for pocket friendly budget. Coursera has a course I like but it is 3month course and it is like £65 pounds per month.

1856bfi,How do I find a job in my industry?,"Hello everyone. I'm a 35 year old who's having difficulties finding a job in my field, which is restaurant delivery. I've had major success in my life including obtaining astronomical order volume in two business, competing against industry giants, huge volume in sales, becoming a well-known brand in two markets, the list goes on. One business had nearly 700 orders per day, the last year we did over $4 million in sales. Another I bought a quarter of the company, served as an advisor, and it was grown from 60 orders per day to nearly 300 per day. Both were sold, the first for $1 million and the latter for $500,000. I took some time off, but have always been on the lookout for a job, without success. I feel like I was a force not to be reckoned with when I was in the industry, but now no one will call me back for even an interview.

I've had my resume revamped probably around 10 times, I've had meetings with career couches, I change my resume based on the posting, I have given myself titles such as ""Operations Manager"" for the first company and ""Senior Advisor"" for the second. I've applied for countless positions within my industry, I can't even put a number on it. I've attempted to reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn, without any success.

The career coaches have suggested finding smaller companies in which to work, but there are no more smaller companies in a market which has consolidated or are losing money against the giants. Even the companies and individuals which have revamped my resume claim that I'm looking in the correct direction, and that my resume is perfect. Some have even refused to work on it, saying that my resume is already in great shape.

What do I do? How do I go about entering this industry again? Should I give up? What is it that recruiters see or do not see that is off-putting to them? I feel like I have all the experience any large company, such as DoorDash, GrubHub or UberEATS could ever hope for. I competed against them, and I did so very successfully.

1853xa0,Demoralized ever since I failed a promotion application.,"Hello. I'd like to ask for advice regarding my situation.

I'm about to hit my 5th year in the company this January. Last July, I tried and failed my application for a promotion to a supervisory role. Admittedly, it's my fault as to why I failed because I was compelled to apply for the sake of the huge salary bump, which I badly needed due to a myriad of financial problems (and our annual increase is honestly very lackluster).

Though I was given constructive criticism afterward, ever since that failure I've been demotivated. I've been thinking about job hopping but I couldn't push through as I'm hesitating to let go of this workplace where everyone is nice, supportive, and without any kind of toxicity.


What would you guys suggest? Will this demoralizing feeling eventually go away if I just suck it up and just work?

USA, UK, Australia, Ireland, or Canada?","I'm currently contemplating pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science or a related field, and I'm seeking advice and insights about the academic landscape and job market in various countries. I'm particularly interested in understanding the current and future market trends, job prospects post-graduation, and the return on investment (ROI) for such courses. Among the countries that have caught my attention for pursuing my Master's are the USA, UK, Australia, Ireland, and Canada. However, I'm at a crossroads and could use some guidance in making an informed decision.

  
**Here are a few questions I have:** 

**Job Opportunities:** What are the current job prospects in the tech industry for graduates with a Master's in Computer Science from these countries?
**Future Market Trends:** Are there any emerging technologies or industries in these countries that could shape the job market for CS professionals in the coming years?
**ROI and Cost of Living:** Considering the cost of education and living expenses, how does the ROI stack up in these countries, especially in terms of potential earnings after graduation?
**Quality of Education:** How do the academic programs in these countries compare concerning curriculum, faculty, research opportunities, and industry connections?  

**Personal Experiences and Insights:**
If you've pursued a Master's in CS or any related field in any of these countries or have insights based on the current market trends, I'd love to hear about your experiences, challenges faced, opportunities gained, or any advice you might have for someone in my position.  

**About my\_qualifications:**
I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate from India with a B.E. degree. Over the past three years, I have transitioned my career into Software Engineering, working within a Product-Based Company.  

**Course suggestion:**
If you would like to suggest any course other than MS in CS based on the future market trends and the ROI, please go ahead. But also, please make sure that the courses are strictly restricted to Technology and Computers (For example, MS in data science, AI or Analytics).",yashdesoi,1,1.0,0,1701072872,2023-11-27 08:14:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184y1qp/seeking_advice_which_country_is_ideal_for/,11,2023

I have since worked in clinic administration but had been wanting to go back to school for 

 or a medical techinician for over 10 years but due to financial burden and lack of support from my family I just did not have the leisure to do that.

I know as a person, I should not let career and income define me. But ever since dropping out of uni, my life had been on hold, my dreams had been in hibernation all these years. Due to the constant 'fear of instability, lack of career',regardless of having jobs and having income, I could not save any money and only raved up in $60,000 debt. I also cannot get into any long term relationship that could lead to marriage because I could not share the fact that I did not finish my degree and do not have a career that can bring good income. 

Should I see a counsellor at this time instead borrowing money to go back to school?

I just know that there will no happiness or color in my future if I do not work in a career that I am proud of. And I am really concerned that if I don't make thr decision now, that I will be too old to start a career, let along a long term relationship or family of my own, or own a home of my own.

Most of all it's just so embarrassing, like I NEVER would have applied for Job B, so to be told I don't have the qualifications is like ""umm duh... that's why I didn't apply for it""  
  
**So what AM I qualified for?**  
  
**I have a bachelor of science degree in Health Education, and a minor in sociology (if it matters, and it never does lol). I've worked at 2 health nonprofit organizations since then, both as an ""intern"".**  
  
**Data Collection: Input, cleaned, and organized data. Assisted in analysis in order to guide future local health interventions.**  
  
**Administrative Skills: Scheduled meetings and took minutes.**  
  
**Grant Processes: got materials together for grant applications, researched organizations, prepared powerpoints for relevant opportunities. outlined and drafted grants, budgets, and lit reviews.**  
  
**Social Media and Marketing: helped draft and and schedule outreach and fundraising posts. Monitored social media constantly, was the person to make quick edits at 8 pm or 3 am, whatever was needed.**  
  
**Digital Publishing and Graphics Design: Designed and compiled an official document for my city's department of public health. Edited and compiled a video for the organization's fundraiser.**  
  
I hate feeling like I'm over or underhyping my abilities and that's why nobody's getting back to me. I've applied for admin positions, literally just sitting at a desk doing admin stuff-- more than I can count. The majority of them, even the entry ones, wanted 3-5 years experience, and one even wanted A MASTERS! To sit at a desk and ""welcome people""... But okay, I wasn't qualified. Everyone tells me to try and get a job in admin but I clearly am not qualified for that and it's getting embarrassing.  
  
I then tried data entry jobs. Again, scams or not qualified. It is what it is.  
  
Social media and marketing jobs: I'm not qualified.  
  
Graphics design jobs: LOL LMFAO... that's a fun pipe dream.  
  
I know the answer to ""what am I qualified for"" is gonna be ""pumping gas"" and I'd do that if I lived in an area where those jobs were like, a thing. I have applied to maybe 12 nearby stores and none of them have had a position for me, which is kind of insane to me. Like it feels unreal. So far I've had zero luck in food service as well.  
  
Now, unfortunately I have medical bills to pay and student loan payments-- I HAVE to pay these, I CANNOT miss payments (I DID do the unemployment plan but I MUST be paying the interest each month if I ever want to get ahead financially). Right now I'm coasting on the savings I set up for myself from my past jobs and saving money by not having rent but it's dwindling. And I need to move out of my parents as they're trying to sell their house (I moved back there after college because I got very sick). So food service and retail wouldn't really be enough to pay for that, which is why I was trying to get 2 jobs at once, which wasn't happening and given my health, the fact that I help take care of my family, and other things, I'd really prefer 1 job on a career trajectory with room for growth, accepting shit pay to start.  
  
**Am I being delusional to think that I should be able to get some kind of community health position? I mean, or at least ANYTHING close to what I did in college?** Like I said I was open to whatever but is it delusional of me to want to do the thing I went to school for and actually have a career? I've been applying to the absolute lowest of levels in that sector and I barely ever get a response, and when I do, it's some kind of weird shit or scam.   
  
Right now I live in MA, and I'd like to stay in MA for maybe a year, but after that I'll go anywhere. And even that is negotiable. I'm literally willing to compromise and negotiate on everything like pay, location, hours, nights and weekends, whatever. I just want a CAREER.  
  
**I obviously have things that I'd """" WANT """", but I'd NEVER narrow my job search by them. Beggars can't be choosers like I said.** But for instance, I really would like to work remote, even just to start, because I'm recovering from a back injury+ other health issues, I care for my parents and grandparents, and I'm in the process of relocating and can't be commuting an hour in each direction (and can't drive right now due to injury anyway). In the ideal scenario I get a job that lets me work remote just so I can start ASAP... I don't want a WFH job because they're cushy, I want to work remote so I can actually start as soon as humanly possible-- like most people looking for remote work. But it doesn't matter much, everyone's gonna just assume I'm lazy or entitled when I say that, and anyway I don't expect to find that at all. I'm just explaining where I'm coming from.  
  
I spend pretty much all day on LinkedIn, and half the jobs I see are marked down as entry level when they're actually not at ALL entry level, the rest of them are ads for jobs that are not at all what I searched for and are infuriating to scroll through, to the point where I feel like I have to spend more time scanning the page to see if there's ANYTHING like what I searched for, or if it's all ads and scams. Indeed is the same.  
  
I'm just not really sure what to do here. Advice would be appreciated because honestly I hate not working, I hate not having a purpose.",finmaththrowaway,1,1.0,3,1701062486,2023-11-27 05:21:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184vel1/am_i_qualified_for_anything/,11,2023

184ucga,Fell into a compliance role at work and want to negotiate a salary adjustment (not raise),"Hi! I’m a 27yo female who started a job as an underwriting associate at an insurance company in January 2023. Since then, Ive taken up more responsibility in the compliance dept. so much so, that it has almost completely turned into a full time role (I’m also still completing all of my underwriting duties). My one year evaluation is coming up in Jan 2024, and I have a good feeling they will offer to transfer my position to compliance associate, which I think I would accept. 

I currently make $64k. My question is two fold: is a career in compliance more promising than underwriting/ insurance? I like that if I were to do compliance, I might be able to move into different industries. Also, if I  pursue compliance can I renegotiate my salary if they offer me a new position? I’m looking for a salary adjustment, instead of a raise since things have gotten so expensive, especially around the area I live in. Will this come off bratty of me? What should I ask for as someone who’s only compliance experience is at this company?

184u6kg,Switching Roles So Soon: Right Call or Missed Opportunity?,"Hey r/careeradvice community,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some of your insights. A bit about me: I recently transitioned from software development to IT project management. I've been enjoying this new role for a few months now, and there's still a lot I'm learning every day. However, I was recently approached by a headhunter for a position as the manager of a web development department.

Initially, I turned down the offer. My reasons were twofold: firstly, I feel like I'm just starting to get the hang of my current role and there's much more to learn. Secondly, I'm only 26, and this makes me feel a bit apprehensive about jumping into such a significant position so early in my career.

But, this opportunity has been on my mind ever since. I'm starting to wonder if I made the right decision. I declined mainly due to a feeling of inexperience and perhaps some self-doubt because of my age. Yet, part of me can't help but think about the growth and learning opportunities this new role could offer.

I'm torn between the stability and comfort of my current job, where I'm still growing, and the potential of this new role. Am I being too cautious? Did I let a great opportunity slip away just because I feel ""too young"" or ""not ready enough""?

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who have been in similar situations. How do you decide when it's the right time to leap into a new role, especially one that seems a bit intimidating?

Thanks for your advice in advance!",Sea-Eggplant480,1,1.0,0,1701058283,2023-11-27 04:11:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184u6kg/switching_roles_so_soon_right_call_or_missed/,11,2023

184sytd,Feeling stagnant - What’s the right job for me?,"
Hi all!

I’ll try to keep this brief, but basically I’d like advice as to what direction to take my career because I feel absolutely miserable in my current role and so much of my time both there and home when I’m thinking about work is how to find something that actually makes me happy. 

Most of my life I’ve really struggled with money and so my last two jobs have been all about the pay. I worked as a machinist for CAT and now work as a blaster for a small company, but I’ve started to realize that I miss feeling like I got to help people and make a difference in the world. 

I have some college experience (1.5 years) in Business Administration, English writing, and digital art. I dropped out unfortunately when COVID hit due to loosing my main job at the time and some health issues that came up. 

Some background:

I grew up in a family business, so early one I developed customer service, sales, and even some receptionist skills. I absolutely love the aspect of helping people realize what they need/want and helping that get it. Seeing people happy with a choice I helped them to make gives me a lot of satisfaction. I don’t necessarily enjoy sales in most companies I’ve worked for though as the pushiness part isn’t my style. I have worked a sales job and been very successful in that but again the style most companies like to promote isn’t for me. I don’t enjoy trying to sneak sales in or push people to get things that I know they’ll never use or will cause them financial hardships. 

Besides sales, I’ve worked a couple retail/customer service jobs. I did enjoy the fast pace atmosphere and the times where I was able to help people, but the pay wasn’t very good and I didn’t feel like I was getting an opportunities to grow. I was quickly offered higher up positions where I was training new hires and enjoyed that but the companies didn’t want to increase my pay to match the work load so I didn’t stay in those positions long. 

I ran a business for several months and that was by far my favorite time in my career. I designed a website, photographed products, ordered inventory, handled complaints, advertised, etc and while it was the most I’ve worked in my life I really loved doing it. My issue was that I wasn’t passionate about the product itself and I decided that I didn’t want to sell something that I myself wasn’t very interested in as the customers really needed someone who was for said products.

I’ve also worked with animals and loved that, but I don’t have the skills/education to get into anything veterinary related.

Lastly, I’ve worked in blue collar jobs as mentioned before. I like the hands on aspect but with my current job I feel completely useless. I know I’m helping the company but I see no impact. I do the same thing everyday and my coworkers do everything they can to avoid working which means I’m doing more of a job I don’t like. I get very dirty as a blaster and I’m constantly bored of doing the same thing over and over everyday.

What I’m interested in:

My top goal would eventually be to run a business again, but I want to be sure about it this time and find something I actually want to sell/do and that I will stick with long term. 

I’d also love to do something that helps people/animals like a nonprofit but I don’t even know how to get into that and I doubt I have the requirements. 

Some other interests/skills that aren’t necessarily career skills but might be helpful to you guys are:

Art - especially anything digital. I am decently skilled at photography, I can design websites on places like Shopify, etc 

Writing - my college English professor actually thought I should I major in writing as I was very good at it, but I don’t simply want to be a writer and I’m not sure what other jobs this skill would land me

Training/Team Leading - I have several younger siblings that I basically raised and I’ve found that both then and now when I’ve been able to train people or just be a support character I absolutely love it. Feeling like I’m helping someone to succeed and to grow makes me feel like I really matter and since I pride myself in being a top performer in everything I do, I usually have extra knowledge to give to people

Organizing - I absolutely love making budgets, lists, charts everything that makes the process I’m doing easier. I especially enjoying tracking the money I’m spending and helping my partner/families to do the same. I also enjoy planning the events we have and making sure everyone knows what’s happening when, what to bring, etc 

For context, I’m a 23 year old female living in the states. 

If there’s anything else you guys would like to know or information you need, please let me know!

184rnhi,Want to change my career. I need advice on: is it even possible?,"Hey, everyone  
  
(female 24, LA)  I am a tattoo artist right now. An average kind of one, but things are going okay. (I am an immigrant in US, and this business requires mostly a good tattooing skill and being able to communicate, so I can do it almost anywhere in the world). Plus it is something that I like to do.  
  
But I'm thinking about changing it to a corporate job in finances, because I feel that I can be good at that, working in PM or financial analysis area.  
  
I've got a master's degree in accounting, in my country when I was 20, but I am not sure if it will count in here now)). I've worked as a bookkeeper for two years, while getting my degree, it was nice, even though I felt, like there was not a lot of options for career growth in my country. Additionally tattoos seemed like more fun, so I decided to go this way.  
  
Now that I moved here (not by choice, but because life is rough and you have to adapt) I am thinking about corporate job more and more, since there is more chances for developing a career.  
  
So I want to ask from where do I start? I've thought about going to some courses at SMC college, that would be related to the field, getting to know software, searching for internships/entry-level positions. I plan to get first actual job in 1-2 years.  
  
Is there any chance that I can get where I want from where I am rn? Or am I delusional and it has no sense?

184ongx,"Career Advice: What matters most to you?: Money, Family and friend's, or education and career?","What maters to you most? Money, Family and friend's, education and career?  
I'm suddenly in weird position that I've never have been in before. I am currently in the second and third rounds of interview for 3 separate and very different positions.   


My current job has had me move a cross the country unexpectedly, to a very expensive city that I never really had any desire to be in prior. They kept me on the remote salary, and did not give me a raise to relocate and now that it has been a year in this position I was denied a raise again. I was unemployed for a year while attempting to pivot careers, prior to getting this job which wiped most of my saving, and am currently living very close to paycheck to paycheck. So I have been looking for a new job pretty much since I moved. However, over time I learned to really enjoy the this place despite living on such a tight budget, and having so few friend's. The job it's self is easy enough, very low stress, with a lot of down time on the clock. I clock in, do work, and clock out, and almost never have to work overtime. If it paid more, I would have no concerns or complaints. However with rent increasing and students loans kicking back in, it's not sustainable.   


Suddenly 3 jobs got back to for interviews. All 3 are on the other side of the country.   
The first one is close enough to my home town that I could see my family and friends regularly, and pays a living wage doing what I did for work before I switched careers. Its a bit blue collar, but it's a step up from what I was doing a while back. I don't ""hate"" the work, but it's not necessarily the career I wanted for myself. I don't love it, but I know how to do it well enough. It's just a job. A secure one, that I could potentially stay at for the rest of my career, if I wanted to. The benefits are also really good. (local city government job)  


Job two: Is a really cool job. The kind of job that younger naive me always wanted. It's a bit out side of my current experience, and will require a lot of learning on and outside of the job. The person I interviewed with said they like to higher outside the company for low level jobs and build them up so then can hire from within for higher level positions later. As far as I can see, and from what a friend who works there had told me, its true, all the higher level positions are only filled by people who grew into them from within the company. This Job pays a just a good 10K more than the job number one, and then only goes up with time as I would progress up. The benefits are okay, pretty standard stuff. The biggest downside is that the company is doing contract work for a larger company. So my job would essentially be rely on our project being funded by that larger company. If that larger company just decides to cut the project, well that's it. I get laid off.  It's not the most stable position. My friend has survived two wave of layoffs so far. I'm not too sure I could survive being unemployed considering that I haven't been able to save much of anything this last year.    


The third job pays the least of the three, but has the best befits program. They would also be willing to pay for me to get a masters in a related field. The job is very secure, and with a well known company. The position is lab work in field of study I have experience in, and am passionate about. I could see this position being beneficial for my career in the long term, but I would have to live on a tight budget (not as tight as I currently am, but probably not getting a new car or taking any nice vacations if you get what I mean) for a few more years, and hopefully survive gradschool while doing it.  


So what I'm curious is, what do you suggest I do if I am so lucky to even have the opportunity to choose amongst the 3 jobs or staying at my current job. Realistically I'll take whichever I can get, but in this case, lets be overly optimistic and say I have a choice.",Brochachotrips3,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1701042211,2023-11-26 23:43:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184ongx/career_advice_what_matters_most_to_you_money/,11,2023
184ol4l,Should I stay in a comfortable job or take a new job to double my salary?,"Need career advice. I (26m) have been working as a healthcare research associate for 2 years, making 58k. Currently been waiting 3 months for HR to rework job descriptions and potentially offer a raise, but not certain how large of a raise. I've been doing project management work without extra compensation, including a new phase with multiple sites and stakeholders. Although my boss is supportive and encourages me to choose tasks wisely, no additional compensation is offered for this new project.

the job provides excellent work-life balance as most of the time I only work 20 hours a week. Spend the rest of the time on hobbies and socializing or helping parents with health issues. I've recently interviewed for a research and innovation project manager role at a chemical company. If I get an offer (which seems very likely) it will almost double my salary to 90k-115k and bonus. The new role likely requires more work and a one day a week 1.5 hour commute, unlike my current remote-friendly setup and 10 minutes walk from the office.

Discussing the potential move with my boss triggered ""talent retention mode."" She's uncertain about a quick raise but urges me to stay for another year to finish a significant project I've built from scratch. My family lacks experience with such opportunities, and my parents are nervous about the change, given the current job's relaxed nature. Despite that, the prospect of doubling my salary could provide financial stability to support my parents during their health challenges.

I am a self employed contractor providing long term training. My current wage is £60k per year.  I currently pay for my flights. Costing about 1000pm, but expense them through from pre-tax profits along with other business expenses.

I love the job, but the travel and time away from my young children and pregnant wife are taking its toll. 

I have been found another job in the U.K. about 40mins drive away, which means I will be at home in the evenings. 5 days a week. This role is £50k PAYE.
It’s not as exiting as my current role and while the contract doesn’t explicitly state I can work from home they say they offer flexibility, also the contract doesn’t state any core working hours - 40per week. It is a role that could be done from home though, my family want to move to an SEA country eventually and I feel this could offer that in the long run. 

The company in Denmark has countered with an offer of 3 weeks doing the commute and then 1 week working from home. And they would also cover the flight costs.

I've just recently turned 20 and it's got me thing about how I should properly start thinking about my future, when I finished school I decided not to go to uni because I didn't do to well in school, mostly because I'm so lazy but I'm hoping to change that, I've always wanted to make things like be able to say to someone using an invention of mine and saying hey I made that.

184kv00,What's next?,"Hello!

I (25m) graduated with a Bach. in IT from Uni. 2 years ago. During my time at Uni. I was a desktop tech. I started my current role two years ago directly out of Uni. My current job is an IoT (Internet of Things) engineer making 85k USD. This role is in the R&D sector of IoT where I run my own lab space, validate technology, integrate technology, facilitate PoC's (proof of concepts) and PoB's (proof of business), ultimately creating a market standard and gaining a customer base. I have had some frustrations in my current role due to my company not quite understanding what IoT means and giving me roles and responsibilities that, when stretched, could fall under the IoT umbrella. They have also had staffing issues as after reorganization and some departures / retirements it has left me as the only tech guy in my organization. I wear a lot of different hats, I have expressed disdain for what they currently have my responsibilities as and it does not seem like it is going to change anytime soon. I see a lot of people in this group echoing "" job hop every two years"" and I am approaching that mark. Just curious as to what you all think the next step would be for someone in my position.

184k5d3,Careers promoting health and well-being?,"Feeling lost…

Hi all. 26F, from Australia and moving to Greece next week!

I have a Bachelor of Arts (Philosophy & Creative/Professional Writing) from a mediocre Aus Uni, and Cert IV in Pilates. My work experience is primarily as a Nanny and Disability Support Worker, and I have brief experience 1-1 English tutoring with young kids, Pilates instructing and face-to-face sales. 

I am currently studying a Graduate Certificate of Health Promotion at a decent Aus uni online. It was originally a Master of Public Health but converting to online study and obtaining a work/holiday visa made my Masters more selective (only eligible if you have work experience in public health which I don’t, only some volunteer work which cannot count), and my visa restricts me to only 4 month study throughout the 12 month visa. 

Note that I have plans to gain residency in Greece. 

I originally wanted to study teaching after my BA, and then pivoted into public health. But now I’m 26 and am feeling overwhelmed by the career and study challenges ahead now that I’m moving to such a different country, and have altered study options. 

All I know is that I’m very good at working with people and that I want to promote health and well-being. I have considered social work, being an OT, HR and many more avenues, but my qualifications thus far, including what I’m currently studying, are just too broad. 

I want to finally gain some clarity on what I want to do. I feel overwhelmed by options. I don’t want to study for much longer and want to settle into a career. 

HELP!",ilovealmondbutter97,1,0.5,1,1701031009,2023-11-26 20:36:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184k5d3/careers_promoting_health_and_wellbeing/,11,2023
184jros,"I don’t know what career path to go down, and I need to choose a course in four days. What do I do?","I’m a 17 year old student and I’m currently studying art, media studies, Welshbacc and digital technology (I have done sociology at AS level, but dropped it at A2 because of workload) and I’m at such a loss right now. Like I genuinely don’t know what on Earth I want to do with my courses or my subjects anymore and I’ve completely run out of time. I feel like I’ve got no proper aspirations for a career other than literally being around people, and I’ve got absolutely no idea what to choose. I really really don’t want to waste my time at university studying something that may not lead me anywhere, it’s so expensive. I really need some advice on what career path to choose. 

I’m gonna go into a bit more detail about my thought process so far, so sorry if this is quite long. For years I planned on doing art, but at the start of year 12 after getting into graphic design and doing some research, I quickly realised that it’s not for me whatsoever. The job seems very individual, and the hours are extremely long up against a screen, and when I looked into it I got the impression that it often involves a lot of work from home and that is something I really dislike, I think because of my general personality. 

I then decided I wanted to do marketing. I had no idea what it entailed in all honestly, and simply pictured it as me working with a group of people to create campaigns, go to events to promote a company, coming up with designs for flyers or posters etc, which is something I’m really interested in (it would be amazing to work for Nintendo or apple or something lmao). but the thing is, I’ve never taken business or any subject related to it, my closest is media. I’ve got absolutely no idea what marketing is about and when I spoke to the business teachers about it, my lack of knowledge really put me off from it. The worst part is I wrote my entire personal statement about marketing, but when it actually came to looking at the modules at universities it all involved finance and accounting which is something I REALLY don’t want to do, and I doubt I’d even pass. I briefly settled on film and media production, because being in a film crew sounds absolutely incredible, but after going to Brighton open day to look at what they have to offer, I absolutely hated the course and also the university itself, which has put me off so much. I didn’t like how it was so focused on the editing side of film as opposed to using the equipment, writing the script or doing anything together.

Right now I’m just completely and utterly lost. I’ve achieved all A’s at AS, and I’m predicted all A*’s at A2, and I feel like I’m just wasting my potential entirely. I feel like my only option left is media studies, which I don’t mind, but I’ve got no idea what sort of career I can make of it right now and it feels so overwhelming. 

I wanted to come on here and ask anybody if they work in a job related to my subjects now, what they did to get there and what it entails. I really just want to go somewhere thats busy where I’m able to meet a bunch of people, and do something like that in the future. I just really need some advice, because our applications need to go in on the 30th, and I need to go back and chance my personal statement ASAP, as well as choose my university options all over again. 
Thank you in advance, I’m gonna try posting this on other subreddits too, so if you have any ideas where else I can post this please let me know!",Objective_Degree2368,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1701030045,2023-11-26 20:20:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184jros/i_dont_know_what_career_path_to_go_down_and_i/,11,2023

184ir4s,Leave med school?,"Im in 3rd year out of 5, i had doubts about it even before starting but because all my family are doctors but also because i liked science and was good at it i went into it without taking any gap years, a mistake. I did get influenced ofc by my parents but i never challenged them because i was indecisive and didn't know what i wanted. 

The work is difficult but manageable somehow, the learning part can be interesting at times but does get boring at exam times. For me im more worried about the future not necessarily med school( as one way or an other i can finish it I've already finished 2 yrs). Im worried about residency, the excessive amount of work studying and no balance in life(usmle plabs etc) Also remember that **Im not usa or europe based** meaning id probably move to somewhere in Europe or USA for work. 

For example people in my home country a lot of them studied medicine and i understand why because anything other than medicine won't get them out of their country or make them good money. I was fortunate enough to be from uk, yes i studied outside of it but now I'm wondering if i should have done something else,something less taxing as im fortunate enough to have more opportunities. 

Only good thing is about studying outside of usa/Europe is no debt i guess. 

I was thinking CS or anything, problem is I'm unsure about what i would do to replace because i havent put enough time into other fields i dont wanna regret it, id also have to start from the beginning. Its affecting me rn and Im. I know i probably wont drop out but i always push through and put the doubts aside, it's getting tiring and making me want to find an escape.

184ibu1,One week in and I know the job isn’t for me.,"Sorry this might be a bit long, so I just recenly started a new job, it’s a bit different from what I normally do I’m used to working retail and sales. However, I decided to take a job working as a lead at a gas station and it truly is awful. I’ve only been there a week and I’m about to spend my days off next week applying for new jobs.

It’s not a hard job at all. It’s all very easy and the pay is good but that is just not the environment I’m used to. I also have little to no training I started working the next day after my interview like truly I was immediately hired after my interview and did all the paperwork and went to work the next day. I shadowed the person whose position I was taking over and since I was new and used to training with someone for a few days I expected that to be the norm but nope the next day the person who was training me was off and so I was running a shift by myself. I am a fast learner when it comes to things but being there a week and continuing to mess up little things because I haven’t been trained on them is driving me crazy.

I also do not enjoy my coworkers. They unfortunately fit the stereotype of people who work at a gas station. They are always trying to take breaks to go outside so they can smoke or there is unnecessary drama. Lots of talking behind peoples backs and just overall unprofessionalism. I’m not the most professional but I hold myself to a much higher standard while I’m working but the people I work with do not and it’s just so awful to be the only one out of literally a whole team who is just trying to work the best they can while everyone else fucks around. Also a common trend is for them to be giving out their phone numbers or asking for phone numbers from customers and the first time someone told me this I said “while you’re working???” With probably some judgement in the words and they looked at me as if I’m crazy even though my manager is literally writing people up for giving out their number that doesn’t seem to stop anyone.

Im trying to stick it out for a few months but truly I think it would be better just to find another job because if I get a job soon enough I intend to leave those current bad job off my resume. I just feel bad for the manager because they literally told me I was first choice in the job and that they didn’t care about the other interviews that they had later in the day. I also met the district manager and they’re all nice but like truly this is a bad job and they’re short staffed and I would be leaving them in a bad situation but it’s not going to get any better from all the gossip I’ve heard. 

So if anyone has any advice or words of wisdom to help figure out what to do whether it’s best just to stick it out or leave or somewhere in between.",Lopsided_History6680,4,1.0,4,1701026349,2023-11-26 19:19:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184ibu1/one_week_in_and_i_know_the_job_isnt_for_me/,11,2023
184hw8k,"Unhappy at a new job, it just feels odd","Long story, short… I was laid off back in May. It sucked because the company had a great culture, great pay, great benefits, and I could work from home.

I was able to get a new job and started at the end of August. I’ve been doing my best to give it a shot, but I just don’t like the culture, vibes, and some other things.

There’s not necessarily anything bad about the culture, but there’s nothing good with the culture either.

The benefits are decent on surface level, but also not because I can’t add my wife to health insurance since she is offered insurance and they use some weird third party administrator and employees often have to argue with doctors and insurance. It just sounds like a nightmare. The pay is actually pretty solid, but there’s a big hit on the insurance side for my family.

The biggest thing is that I just don’t feel right about it. I feel like I don’t fit in with the company and culture and I’m quickly starting to dislike it. I’ve started drinking a little more on weekends and I get the Sunday scaries a lot more now.
 
I do think I’ll start keeping an eye out for new roles, which sucks because I’m burned out from looking for jobs after doing it all summer under extreme stress of being laid off. Note: I can’t just quit tomorrow because I have a family to support.

184h3bv,"Given responsibilities of my boss, but pay raise and title change keeps getting delayed","I joined an organisation 3 years ago in a company that has presence in 5 countries across the world with a decent sized funding and revenue top-line. The region I work in is not the headquarters but this region currently is responsible for over 50% of the revenues of the company. 
My boss and I worked well together until he was let go in January of this year. While he was being let go, I was told that since I was consistently rated high among my peers, I would be taking on his responsibilities and leading the team hereon. I took those responsibilities in stride since I was excited about the role and wanted to do things my way as the role (Head of Marketing) allowed for it. 
Since then, I’ve build multiple profitable marketing channels, streamlined the processes in the team, executed events that were outside my original scope of work and have successfully launched a product in the market with great adoption and retention ratios. 
In July (6 months after I was given the role) I approached the Directors (both of whom I have worked very closely with and have cordial relationships outside work) about a pay raise and an official transition into the role of Head of Marketing. I was told that I was doing an awesome job but the role needs to be discussed with the other members in the leadership since the company was getting restructured (new business units), so it would take some time. I said okay and gave them a soft deadline of October 2023 to have at least a first level of discussion with me about my place in the company. Come October, no one brought it up. So I approached the Directors and brought it up myself and they said yes, we want you here, we want you to lead the marketing function, but you will have to wait till November end since we are still not sure about how to structure this. They asked me for a number in terms of payscale, and I have given them a range, which they haven’t agreed or disagreed to. I have even told them that if I was not a part of their plans w.r.t heading the team, I was okay if they get someone good and competent to lead it while giving me the much deserved pay raise to the tune of a standard yearly pay raise. So far, I’ve heard nothing from them and I’m kinda sick of reaching out by myself each time. 
So here are my questions to the community:
1. Should I bring it up again in November end?
2. If they push the dates back again, what should be my next course of action?
3. My notice period is 3 months (since it’s a senior position) and I have emergency funds as well. Shall I take a gamble and quit, hoping they’d retain me for a raise in my current CTC? 

Notes: it’s a European company and I am in the SEA market, so budgets are tight, but they don’t seem to have a problem giving raises to my European counterparts. 

I am finding it very hard to stay motivated and working for essentially two roles for the salary of one, especially when most of the work is outside my official agreed upon scope since my boss was let go.",ghoshstories1512,3,1.0,1,1701023067,2023-11-26 18:24:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184h3bv/given_responsibilities_of_my_boss_but_pay_raise/,11,2023

How are you? I hope you are doing well.

I am a 26F who started a part time job on September in company X. After two months, I realized working for them was draining both mentally and physically as the environment is toxic and they don't provide transportation (company X is very far away from my house). I started looking online for a different job. I found company Y, which working for would be a dream come true, and I emailed them. I wasn't expecting hearing from them; however, after 10 days, they emailed me saying they wanted to have an online interview with me. I had the interview with them, and it went well. However, when they asked me whether I was working elsewhere, I panicked and for some reason I said I wasn't working for anyone. I don't know why it seemed easier for me to say that instead of saying yes I was working for someone and explaining my situation. I got scared they wouldn't want to work with me if they knew I was working for another company. At the end of the interview, they informed me that I was preselected and that they would email me the date of the face to face interview soon. 
I was really surprised and extremely happy to have been preselected. However, the problem now is that they will figure out I didn't tell the truth about my situation.

184fy9h,Audio professional unsure of next career steps. HALP!,"To keep it brief, through a weird windy road of luck & circumstance, I found myself working inside the podcasting and digital media niche back in '17.  
I found myself working a lot of big network jobs during the ""gold rush"" to create companion pieces for their most popular programs.  
Today, I find the landscaped has changed. Video is WAY more important as most podcasts are produced for youtube so they can get more cross-platform reach.  
I adapted accordingly, audio-only shows are now probably \~20% of my total income.  
I came from assisting at a film/tv audio post-production studio and at first I was excited to use my skills to help push the podcasting space forward. But, now I find myself pretty bored with the work.  
SO... I suppose the next thing for to do would be to go back to film/tv. Maybe VO catpure/post for animation or a transition into a sound design role. ( There are network shows in my folio where I did creative sound-design and music editing so it's not THAT outlandish)  
The problem is, working for a studio is TOUGH. Was regularly working 7am-10pm in my assistant days.  
The long hours and 1000% commitment is just part of the culture.  
Current book of business has generated 100k+ for a few years now, even though I consistently have a few very light months every year.  
Going back to film/tv likely requires taking a pay cut to work the same, if not more, hours.  
If it's all about the money, I should just juice up what I'm currently doing. I don't do any outreach at all currently. I've just been fortunate enough to get referred or keep working different jobs with the same handful of producers I've been working with since the beginning.  
Any perspective would be greatly appreciated.

184fi66,Seeking Career Advice - Feeling Stuck Despite Achievements and Setbacks,"As my 25th birthday approaches, I find myself reflecting on the twists and turns of my career since graduating in 2019 with a degree in Sport Management. Landing my dream internship in 2018 marked a high point, immersing myself in the corporate realm, in meeting's with brilliant minds, and soaking up insights from industry leaders. Despite a challenging high school academic journey and being a first-generation immigrant, I secured the opportunity, even if my program/institution restricted me to a 3-day internship instead of the standard 5 which was huge deal within my surrounding corporate circle as everyone knew that was unheard of.  
  
Post-internship, I transitioned into a part-time role at my dream company, focusing on game days. While grateful for the chance, it's been five years with just once-a-week shifts. Ive been MVP twice now in this part time role being acknowledged for my ""amazing work"" the MVP consists of a jersey with my name on the back, a total of $300 gift cards and signed team merch with me giving 2 speeches on thanking my peers for voting me MVP which all feels bittersweet knowing i dont have a 9-5. 

In these last 5 years at this company ive had promises from my manager, BK, multiple job interviews within the company, and a growing network haven't translated into a coveted 9-5 position. Recently, a dream interview turned bittersweet due to EDI quotas. I cried. a lot. Constant hours of hard work, extreme dedication and a positive attitude only to reach a dead-end. i was even called on the phone instead of simple rejection email out of respect by by BK, my long time manager and the man who took a risk on the 3 day ambitious intern years ago that i was the top candidate for the job not only by him but also his senior operations counterpart, the director's decision leaned toward a former student from a more prestigious institution as well as for diversity reasons. While I fully support diversity initiatives, recurrent setbacks like these are testing my patience.  
  
As a first-generation individual fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, thoughts of relocating for better opportunities have crossed my mind. However, my mother's terminal cancer diagnosis (with around 2-3 years to live) and my father's recent injury, rendering him jobless, make any move challenging. Returning to school is an option, with an MBA being my preference, but the prerequisites pose a hurdle. Opting for a regular BA seems like a step backward given my established connections and past experiences as an e-commerce coordinator in 2021 and a marketing coordinator in 2019.  
  
My last full-time position was in 2021 in an e-commerce coordinator role and my only other 9-5 was being a marketing coordinator in 2019. The continuous job search, coupled with the challenges I've faced, is taking a toll. Witnessing new grads secure entry-level positions within my dream company adds an extra layer of challenge. Despite being told over and over that  I'm young and ahead of the curve since 19, the gap between expectation and reality has affected me mentally.  
  
With the connections I've made, I've been offered a job in my field by long time friend of BK, now a project manager who was once my coworker in this part-time role. He's at another elite sports team, and this opportunity is in the West Coast. Despite my initial openness to relocating, the geographical distance away from family is not feasible and i may regret it in the future . Simultaneously, my recent manager, who essentially supplanted me through EDI hiring, wants me to take on a leadership role next year, mainly focusing on training new hires.  
  
This situation weighs heavily on me, especially with my mom's illness and my dad's situation. The guilt of being at home, applying for jobs without success for years now is a steep fall from the prodigal son my parents once talked about so highly about being the first 3 day intern at this company as well as a younger intern then most, adds another layer of guilt. I'd appreciate any advice, insights, or shared experiences you might have. How have you navigated similar career challenges, especially when faced with setbacks beyond your control? Thanks for taking the time to read my story, and any support or wisdom you can provide would mean a lot.

Now a more wiser and older me, with a beat up body  because of job choices, I realize if don't make a change my life will be less fulfilling than I imagine I want when I'm in my 50s. I have no kids and not married.

With all that said I just have a few simple questions.

At 30 is it a good idea to go back to college for mechanical engineering? 

Should I retake all of the math classes from scratch 1st before I start any program? (Because I cheated so much in the past I never really learned anything)...

184d8bb,Need advice I’m stuck,"Recently a was laid off from a CNC machinist apprentice role in the Tampa/St.Pete area and was making decent money during my 4 month tenure there. They were hiring people with no machining experience and training them. I was bringing home $1000/week working 54hrs a week at $20/hr. I didn’t mind the OT at all. Unfortunately my experience with the company was awkward. Before I was hired, they had 3 employees in the machine shop and fired 2 of them and the third one was there for 8 months and didn’t learn anything. Then I was hired along with 2 other people so we had four people plus the supervisor. All of a sudden everyone was let go and I was the last person working on 8 different CNC machines by myself besides the supervisor and was overworked. I was then let go because whenever a part came out wrong, I was blamed  for it even if I didn’t do it because the supervisor would throw me under the bus for it…. Anyways, now I am looking for a similar position but the only machining experience I have had was from that job. I have had assembly experience In manufacturing in the past but I always get overlooked because my degree field was in Culinary Management which is a worthless degree and I am no longer interested in the culinary arts field. I would definitely like some advice on how I can spruce up my resume so that I can continue in the manufacturing path that I want to pursue. I know going to school seems like the easy suggestion but I do not have the time or the money to go back for a new trade. If anybody has any good ideas or would like to view my resume, I can send it through DM.

184ckf1,"Excited Yet Nervous: Just Landed a Job Migrating On-Prem to AWS, Need Advice!","Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm thrilled to share that I've recently accepted a job offer to lead a migration project from on-prem platforms to AWS infrastructure. The catch? It's a solo mission in a small team of three (including the manager), and there are no senior engineers on board.

A bit about me: I've earned my AWS Solution Architect certificate and have some hands-on experience through homelabs, but professionally, I'm stepping into the AWS world for the first time.

During the interview, I asked about code reviews or technical evaluations, and the manager mentioned that I'll be fully responsible for my work due to the absence of senior engineers.

Now, here's where I'd love your insights: Is this a golden opportunity for hands-on learning, even without direct guidance from senior team members? Or, do you think the lack of technical mentorship might make it too challenging for someone like me, who's eager to learn but clearly a beginner in the AWS landscape?

Any advice, similar experiences, or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated! Excited to embark on this journey but want to ensure I'm setting realistic expectations.

Long story short. I am an immigrant still pending a green card. I thought by now I’d have it but I’m still waiting.

I’ve been unemployed for about 14 months, I was working in the non-profit space as an immigration advocate. I did the best that I could with what I had.

I wanted a career in international affairs, but because of necessity and not having the proper documentation I resorted to working in non-profit. 

I do have 7-9 years of experience working in organizations. 

I have bachelors degree in Political Science and I just finished my masters in International Policy. I am applying to jobs at international organizations like UN, FAO, World Bank…

However, I’m not hearing back, I’ve had interviews but it’s been really rough figuring it out.

184b409,How do you interact with friends at work if they don't work for your company?,"This is my first post-PhD job and I'm struggling to figure out social norms around coworker interactions, etc. The short of it is that I work in a lab which is a shared space between many companies. Some people in those other companies are people I went to grad school with, and we are good friends. It is in the best interest of everyone to be friends in the facility, as we can learn from each other and also grant each other common courtesies (""do you mind if I use 5 minutes of your tool time? My process is running over"" ""sure no problem pal"")

I have a few problems/questions:

1. Recently, my grad school friend asked me to use 10 minutes of my tool time since his process took longer than expected. I said sure. I would have said sure even if I didn't know him. What I didn't know is that my boss intended to use that time, and he was as a result delayed by way more than 10 minutes. This would not have been an issue except that I knew the guy well so it seemed like I was playing favorites. However, he had just granted me 10 minutes on his tool time earlier in the day. Should I avoid extending this courtesy to good friends of mine to avoid blurring the lines? Should I avoid extending this courtesy at all? 

2. This one is a softball question. Sometimes I'll be talking to my colleagues about work, and a good friend will come up and start talking to me. It's always something related to the lab (we rarely just shoot the shit at work), but not something urgent and not something more important than what I'm talking to my colleague about. How do I get this guy to go away so I can keep talking to my colleague? I was thinking on the spot recently and introduced him to my coworker, kept trying to talk to my coworker to resume the conversation, etc. and my friend just stood there. Unfortunately since we work in a shared facility we don't have any private space like a conference room or office where we can talk, so I'm wondering how to shoo away my friends while still maintaining good relations. 

TIA for your advice. I am the most social person on my team by far and really the only one on our team who makes friends with the other companies (mostly a culture thing, I think). Wondering how to continue that trend in the least offensive way - there is definitely a net benefit to our company from me being friendly, as we are granted these courtesies etc.",DishsoapOnASponge,1,1.0,2,1701006558,2023-11-26 13:49:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/184b409/how_do_you_interact_with_friends_at_work_if_they/,11,2023

1848p31,Condescending manager,"Hey guys,

For some backstory, this is about a manager at the restaurant I’ve been working at for the past year. He’s highly experienced, according to him, and has been in the industry for a very long time.

When I first started, I really loved working at the restaurant and all the staff seemed so lovely (including this manager). As the months went on, I started to notice that this particular manager would interact with me in a very condescending manner. He often nitpicks on very minor things and asks me “what’s wrong about the way you’re doing this?”, and will then continue to advise me on a very specific way to do a task that I was doing just fine beforehand. It’s even got to the point where I’ll be in the middle of doing something, i.e. carrying dishes to a table, and he will walk up to me and grab the dishes off me to serve the table instead. He also frequently gets irritated if I ask him questions such as the way a shift will run on a particular day, and his answers are almost always incorporated with a sigh or a glare.

Just recently, I had an interaction with him that ticked me off so much. A customer was inquiring about closing time, and so, as the restaurant’s closing time fluctuates according to each night, I asked him what time the kitchen would be closing. He responsed with a very loud sigh and said ‘I don’t know’ and when I proceeded to ask if he had a rough idea of a closing time, he viciously rolled his eyes and proceeded to lecture me about how he didn’t know when and how he hadn’t thought that far ahead into the night (we closed an hour after this interaction so it wasn’t like I was asking an impossible question..).

I feel so disheartened going to work knowing that he’s always micro managing whatever I’m doing and barely interacts with me in a friendly way. He’s a lot older than I am so there’s a very big power imbalance so I never argue with him and most of the staff have a good relationship with him so I can’t help but feel like I’m making this all up in my head.

What do I do in this scenario? Do I involve my big boss and let him know or try something else? As I said earlier, due to our age and differences in experience, I feel really uncomfortable about the idea of confronting him directly. Thanks for any advice :)",Upperose,1,1.0,0,1700997894,2023-11-26 11:24:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1848p31/condescending_manager/,11,2023

1840iqa,Got a verbal offer for a job last week but it’s not as simple as accepting their suggested comp,"And I have a trip planned in January that never came up during the interview process. 

It’s an outside sales job. It seems like a good opportunity and it’s strictly better than bartending full time (even though I’ll have to keep working weekends). I’ve been looking for a full remote gig so I can sell my car and pay off some debt but now I’ll need it for work and can’t.

As far as comp they said they’re going to pay 60 plus commission and that 55 is the typical starting. Theyre willing to push the envelope because they like my background so much (their words). The problem is, 60 isn’t enough for me until commissions start coming in. Another problem is they’re talking about 8 am meetings (not sure how frequently) but I can’t work nights as a bartender and manage that schedule at new job.  

Thing is, Im already in debt and I have bills now; not 3-6 months when my commissions start coming in. I’m thinking about proposing a draw on future earnings to front load the first few months because otherwise I won’t really be able to survive. 

Also, just with fixed costs my car is costing me about 250 a month and new job is only paying for miles; no stipend. The 250 doesn’t include gas, maintenance, licensing… nothing. Best i can think is to ask for a stipend so I can at least break even on my car if I can’t sell it.

183w5rc,Australian RN considering Sonography,"Hello Reddit,

    Looking for ANY feedback on this transition. Will give some background for context:

   - I am almost 40, Nursing is my second degree.

   - Being a nurse for 3 - 4 years now

    - Although I enjoy Nursing (I'm an ICU nurse now), I don't think it's a long term option for a few reasons.

   - I was considering some post grad or bridging to Paramedicine, but nothing really excited me

    - The idea of starting something new again at 40 is a bit ""annoying"". But hey, I will be getting older anyway, may as well get old doing something that pays me better and is less stressful....??

183rqhl,The negative side of “Pretty Privilege” in the work place,"I grew being very self conscious because I had a major underbite and severe cystic acne. Dealing with physical deformities as a teenage girl took a huge toll on my self esteem. When I was 18, I got jaw surgery which fixed my underbite, I now have perfect teeth. I also went on Accutane for my cystic acne which miraculously cleared up my skin. However, I am left with acne scarring that is not really visible under most good lighting and I cover with foundation. 

I’m at a point where I’m still self conscious with the way I look due to my acne scars but because my looks have drastically improved since my high school days, I feel more attractive.  

The way people treat me now is night and day from my previous experiences. Random strangers, mainly men will stare at me when I’m out in public. People are generally nicer to me. 

However, in the work place, I have noticed that despite how I hard I work, co workers mainly women colleagues are not nice to me. 

Male co workers are also awkward around me, they aren’t unfriendly but will act awkwardly around me. I have also dealt with sexual harassment from male superiors that has caused me to be afraid when my boss is a male. 

Do you think there is a bias/misconception in the work place that more attractive women will not work as hard because they think she will get by with her looks and flirty personality? 

I am not flirty at all, I still carry myself awkwardly because I still feel self conscious and anxious. 

I just feel like there’s definitely an upside to pretty privilege in all areas of life, but at the work place it can seem like a disadvantage sometimes.",throwRAsquishmallow,6,0.6000000238418579,8,1700941401,2023-11-25 19:43:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/183rqhl/the_negative_side_of_pretty_privilege_in_the_work/,11,2023

183r39x,I can’t be productive anymore,"I’m a software developer. I worked for years in a company that I made a lot of friends and even met the love of my life there. Haha

In late 2020, I decided to leave because I was unhappy with the way the company was working (lots of extra hours, absurd deadlines, and undervalued).

I started working for an offshore company that paid me really well and I thought I was really happy.

And then one day it’s like something broke and turned off within me, from this day I haven’t being able to be productive and effective with my work, I have paid a heavy price for that…

I was fired from this offshore company, then I decided to go back to the company I worked thinking that working with friends would help, it didn’t. And after a few months I was fired again.

So I got a new job on a company that was AWESOME, everything, healthy work/life balance, fair pay, good people to work with, all the good sh*t.

But I was still not productive, not effective like I used to, and I became depressed and anxious too.

This company tried to keep me as long as they could, but they decided to fire me as well in the end. I don’t blame them, they were very patient with me and all.

But now I don’t know what to do, I don’t know if I’m just done with technology, or if it’s something else. I go to therapy but honestly, I don’t even know what to say in this matter…

183qtsu,Should I go to Vet school?,"Hey guys, so I (30,F) am considering going into Vet school. I have a BA in Foreign Languages, but worked as a bartender through college and upon graduating, realized I was making more money in the Hospitality/Food and Beverage field that what I'd be making with a BA in my field. I love it and would love one day having my own F&B venue, but we can't even buy a house in this economy, so who we kidding. I've always been an over-achiever, graduating Valedictorian in every class, and finished college with a 3.75gpi and Magna Cum Laude honors, so I got my college tuition covered with my scholarship. Going to Vet school was something I had always wanted to do, but growing up lower middle class in a US colony, I quickly gave up any hope of being able to afford such a career, and I never considered asking anyone in my family for any help. Visiting my family back home, we almost lost a puppy who needed immediate care, as there is only 1 emergency facility and it's usually 6+hrs wait-time. I have always been a pet owner, and even though it's different now, I remember in college having issues providing my pets the best help, even though I tried mt hardest. Now a days in the states, I provide my pets with the best professional help and care, which comes at a hefty price, and I also freak out about their well-being with as much of a sneeze, as I am anxiety in a meat suit. I had recently been considering going back to school for a MA is Business or Hospitality as I work for a big hotel brand and they have a tuition reimbursement program -if they approve the field of study-, and I'd use it to try to advance my position within the company. At the end of the day though, an MA wouldn't certify they'd necessarily give me a higher up/better paying position, and this event kindof really motivated me to reconsider becoming that which so many people need (my family lives in a rural area, and there is high demand for trained professionals). I've considered the demands of the job, and that it's not all about just helping animals. I know there's tough decisions to make and nasty negligent people to deal with, and I'm sure talking about it is not close to actually dealing with it. In the F&B industry though, people treat you like less than animals sometimes, so I'm sure I'd fare well. I don't plan on having kids or getting married, am currently single, the pandemic messed my credit score up a bit, but it's now well on its way to get better, and I am perfectly fine with spending my early 30's working towards this major goal. I'm afraid I might be too old -I've read other very encouraging threads about people starting even later than their 30's-, or that I'm not aware of many other things that might not make it a great move. I have a BA in Humanities, so I'm sure I'd have to take some pre-reqs, but not over a year, I don't think. Obviously in the long term I'd also like the financial stability of someone who doesn't have to worry so I can fully just submerge myself into my craft for the rest of my days.

183o740,What should I do?,"I'm in a delema right now and I'm not clear on what direction to take. 

I'm a university student in Nigeria going into my third year now. I have a flair for entrepreneurship and I decided to start a business while studying. My mom pays for my tuition. My dad(retired) and my uncle helps with my other expenses.

Degree in Nigeria is not very important so I joined a network marketing business that has a branch involved in freelancing. I'm studying computer science so I joined because of the freelancing aspect and not necessarily the network marketing aspect. 

I had success in my first few months in the business mostly because we had a strike and I had time to focus only on the business. So when school resumed, with my boastfulness about  my entrepreneurship venture I decided to make running my business the sole aim whereas I had school to attend to. 

To cut the long story short, my school suffered. My gp dropped from 4.64 to below 3.5. Also, my business suffered because it wasn't structured properly just like my decision to relinquish school and focus on business wasn't a good decision to start with.

I figured the issue was that I trusted too much in what I could do. That's why I failed in business and in school. My 1st year was great, my second year sucks and I want to make the right decision for my 3rd and 4th year. 

I had believed too much believe in all those motivational nonsense that you can do anything you set you mind to. I believe the question should be ""what is possible in this particular situation"" and not ""what can I do in this particular situation"" also I believe the answer will be told to me not me just arbitrarily picking an answer that suits my pride. 

So now I'm deciding on partially quiting my business and focus on school. I'll still work on the business but as a side thing and not a full focus. I want to make school my full focus now.

183isy5,Have to decide between 2 jobs,"Hi all, first time posting here as I'm looking for some advice.

I (27M) have been working as an external consultant at one customer company for 2.5 years now. Main focus is MS Endpoint and Azure. Company has about 2k endpoints, the team I'm in is just myself and one colleague. Further we have 3 people on Service Desk and 4 within Infrastructure.

My goal always was to take up infrastructure tasks again (networking, switch management, server, etc...)  as this is the field I actually studied for. But I don't want to leave behind the Endpoint/Azure scene.

I've received a job offer to do just that at a smaller company (which is what I always wanted). \~250 endpoints. 2 people on SD who I'd manage and one IT manager above me. My infrastructure knowledge is limited, as I haven't really used it in recent years within an enterprise setting as my main focus was cloud based. I do think with the cloud knowledge I have, I could rather quickly put that to use in the new (and smaller) company so I can focus on building up infrastructure knowledge again. On the part of people management, I have limited experience here, mainly management within a project.

Now, the current customer I work at offered me an internal position with a 2 year path to become the architect for all our technical units (cloud, infrastructure, server). I'd be able to learn from the current infrastructure manager. Added benefit from this is that I have a good working relationship with my current manager and colleague. I'm not fully sure how the learning experience will be with the current infrastructure manager.

I'm also someone who likes to stay technical and maintain a broad view of the company and all systems. I feel like my current customer is getting too big to be able to do that, hence why I like the idea of a smaller company.

&#x200B;

What would you do in this situation, or any advice to help me make my decision?

183ibu2,How to manage a crossroad in my career path,"Hi all,

Until now I have only ever had quite atypical jobs, and I feel like this cannot go on forever. I would like to get some perspective from people who have more life experience than me, or who have possibly been confronted to similar choices in the past. Now I have moved ""back"" to France, where I don't have a place of my own and have little known reference points, I can finish my current contract remotely, and it will end at the end of the year. So, for context:

My first job was an overwintering in Antarctica back in 2019. After that I worked a bit on offshore windfarms and now I'm coming back from over a year and a half on Svalbard (remote archipelago North of Norway). As much as I loved these, they lack a sense of stability that I am craving nowadays. I can't keep running around like this. On the other hand, the prospect of living a ""normal"" life sounds very dull and unappealing. I'm sure it doesn't have to be, but since I've only ever done things that are out of the ordinary since the time I graduated, I just don't know what's out there. I would like to have the viewpoint from those who have been in similar situations in the past. What career/life path did you follow afterwards ?  
I'm an electrical/optical engineer by training with experience with various kinds of instruments (mostly related to geophysics), I can drive small boats, snowmobiles and have quite a bit of practical field experience at sea or in mountains/glaciers. I don't feel like I have one specialty or that I'm brilliant in one area but I am adaptable and dedicated to getting things done. I can move for work and don't need to stay where I am at the moment. If you have any tidbit of life wisdom I'd gladly take it!

Also, do you assume that Software Developers make more money than Software Quality Engineers?","Say you join a meeting at work with a person who's a Software Developer and a person who's a Software Quality Engineer.

Do you personally have the assumption/view than the Software Developer has a more prestigious job and also makes more money?

The reason why I ask is because I've had both of these jobs in my career. To me, it truly felt like people would treat me with a higher amount of respect when I had the 'Software Developer' title. Even if I made more money with the Software Quality Engineer title.

Personally, my view on this and job titles is that I feel like I can't make any assumptions about someone extremely accurately based on a job title. I feel like I would have to take a deep dive into what someone is doing at their job to determine how prestigious it truly is. Like, someone could be making more as a Software Quality Engineer depending on what they're doing. I would have to see what they're doing and what company they work for.",Ben5544477,1,1.0,0,1700896160,2023-11-25 07:09:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/183e3cy/do_you_personally_view_someone_with_the_job_title/,11,2023

So it's like, the resume of the person actually looks pretty good. But in reality they can't really do any valuable Software Development work.

When this person gets fired from the company will it just be hard for them to get a Software Development job again most likely? Are there any other consequences though?

My income is becoming stagnant and my current company can't afford to pay me more. I see lots of people switching into UI/UX design roles, or even web design. Or pushing into Freelance design for extra cash. Technically the next level up would be Creative Director, but I feel like there aren't many Creative Director or Sr. Graphic Designer positions out there right now. It's a competitive market.

Job A is closer to home, close enough so that my family and I can see each by 2-3 hour car ride. Job B is far from my family and would require a plane ride. This will make it less likely that they visit TBH.

Job A is in a new location, where Job B is in a city I've previously lived in and loved. The location of Job B is superior in terms of culture and strongly preferable in terms of weather.

Job A pays a little bit less, 5k-20k less depending on what the offers end up being finalized as. But Job B does have a higher salary band.

Job A is a little flashier and more prestigious, which I admit I like, but Job B is a little higher in seniority.

183c2hn,Regretting my Bachelors.,"Hello, everyone... this is my first post here. I'm writing this post to find out how many of you guys are regretting their Bachelors. I was born in Bahrain and lived there my whole life upto high-school. And now, I chose a course which is not so familiar to many people, it's called English, Communication and Journalsim (B.A. English triple main). This course is not a regular one so it doesn't has any colleges in Bahrain, so my parents sent me to India, Kerala... I hate this state and I can't get along with the people and customs here, I kinda feel like a lion who lost his natural habitat. The ridiculous fact is that in my high-school, I opted for a major in Commerce and Marketing but I found accounts too tough ( I passed in the exams tho) so yeah, I gave it up right after the final exam results because I was too immature that I didn't even gave a chance for B.com, I straight away opted for a course that didn't involve math, accounts or science. I just had to try harder inorder to score well in Accounts, but I didn't put in much effort the moment I found it a bit tough. I wish I had a second chance. Little did I know that I fucked up big time. Guys, I'm not ranting but I feel like this is not for me. It's not because this course is tough or anything, but I simply cannot adopt to the basic necessities for such course. Naturally, I'm an introverted person and sometimes my remarks can be deemed as mean, rude or sarcastic, I'm not much of a ""people's person"", in order to be a journalist, you must be able to express yourself and above all, you must be an extroverted, ""people person"". Plus, i was too delusional that I thought subjects relating to media and communication can magically land me into the cinema industry, but it was too late until I realized that it's not what I actually wanted. Most fucked up fact is that I cannot even blame my parents cos no-one forced me to take it, it was entirely my own goddamn decision that i even wake up in the middle of every night regretting about this. It was during the corona era of 2022 where I made this decision and now in 2023, I've completed my third semester here. I know what you guys are thinking... ""is this guy so stupid and delusional?"" Well i was but now I learnt my lesson. I'm unhappy and uncomfortable with this, also inroder to get a job abroad with a journalism degree from India is not so easy as they get applications from everywhere. 

I wanna find my luck in M.B.A. My parents tells me that it's impossible to go for an M.B.A, straight away from this as I'm required to complete my P.G. in this course which sucks again. They tell me that once I finish P.G. maybe I can try for M.B.A. but I know its a varied coarse and everyone can opt for M.B.A regardless of what they opted in U.G. Every time I try to convince them, they respond by saying ""we spent a lot of money on this, there are no promises that you can find a fortune in banking and finance  as you took a different course for Bachelors, you won't find a job in both journalism/finance field"". During the time I made this decision, mfs like Andrew Tate and all such bastards were on their peak, so I wanted to be someone like that.. ""influential"" and i thought getting into movies might be a way for it (as I mentioned earlier ""too immature and delusional"") but I regret this... 

I'd appreciate if any of you can help me out of this shitty decision or maybe give me an insight about all these... answers from people who had gone through this situation would be more helpful.",Horror_Reply6609,3,0.7099999785423279,11,1700888539,2023-11-25 05:02:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/183c2hn/regretting_my_bachelors/,11,2023

183asnf,"In a tricky situation, not sure the best way to handle this.","To start, last year this Director sent an email to my manager explaining how his team doesn't understand certain topics and they feel very lost. As well as he does and he wants more documentation, training, and job documentation.  
Over the past year and a half, for the entire company I've produced several detailed, job aids, and training sessions, all of which are now stored in our SharePoint site for future reference. Note - this Director who set this request into action never attended a single training session, and I can confidently say, has not made any effort to view any of the job documentation procedures I compiled or made an effort to learn anything on the topic that I am an SME in.  
In addition to this, my VP has asked me to specifically put together an assessment this past August, to test the knowledge of all our teams to see how well they understand this specific topic. This assessment started in August and I gave everybody 2 weeks to complete. After reviewing with my VP we had asked that I re-open the assessment and give everybody another full 2 weeks to complete since he didn't like the result of the participation since we didn't make it mandatory, He also said it's not required for Directors to complete. This was his decision.  
Yesterday I got an email from this Director telling me that it is his goal to learn the topic I am a SME in and to do this assessment and get ""100%"" on it. This was the assessment administered in August btw. He has 3 specific requests.  
set up time with me so that he can learn this topic so that he can get 100% on this assessment. (There is a job aid in our SharePoint that covers this and if you read it you would have no problem doing well on the assessment. I attached this and pointed it out to everybody when starting the assessment)  
Set up a monthly meeting with him to discuss where his direct reports are lacking and where they can improve.  
Set up another monthly meeting with him and his front-line team training them on certain topics they don't understand. (nobody on his team has reached out to me to ask for help so im reluctant to offer more of my time on this)  
When I first read this email I was very annoyed and frustrated. His requests are just going to take more of my time away on topics that have already been discussed and I provided training for. And all documentation has already been created and is in our team's SharePoint site.  
Additionally, nobody on his team has ever reached out for help or shown any initiative to ask me about areas they are struggling with. Every training we hold just seems like spoonfeeding and nobody ever has questions, nor do I think they are fully paying attention. The biggest issue I see here is the lack of attention to detail, and not holding employees accountable for their mistakes, rather than training.  
I am just not sure how to respond to his requests or what to do. I feel like it looks terrible on me by pushing back to somebody at the Director level, even if my resistance is justified by the reasons I gave above.  
My initial reaction is to push back, but on the other hand, I feel like that could maybe come back and bite me.  
FWIW, this Director has a reputation for doing what he can to make himself look good and throwing you under the bus so he never makes himself look bad.  
I just don't know how to handle this. I would appreciate some advice here.  
TIA!",Alternative-Fox6236,1,0.33000001311302185,1,1700884156,2023-11-25 03:49:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/183asnf/in_a_tricky_situation_not_sure_the_best_way_to/,11,2023
183aqnk,What do I do in this unique predicament?,"What do I do in this unique predicament?

A unique predicament

Im 28 years old and have always had a feeling of uncertainty over my career because I have Adhd. 

My father is a diamond setter but has schizophrenia. He makes a very good living of 150k a year despite his illness as he has 45 years experience in the field. I take after him a lot. He works a lot though, 7 days a week.

A year ago he kept asking me to start working with him as a diamond setter. I already had some experience working with him years ago but the industry was slow at the time. Now he's much busier.

I think I'm a very intelligent, creative and talented individual but I'm quite disorganised and struggle as a business operator. It's possible I just never delegate enough. 

After the pandemic, my investments dropped in value dramatically and now I'm forced to live with my parents again. My mother is practically wheelchair bound as she has advanced multiple sclerosis. Despite my sympathy toward her and her illness, I heavily dislike her as a person as she was very emotionally abusive towards me growing up. I'm often forced to take care of a woman I deep down can't stand. I really want to leave home.

My father and I work together from our workshop in our garage. One of my major issues with my job is that I'm very isolated from society, and don't really have much communication with anyone. Since the pandemic, some of my friends have moved overseas. These days the few friends I have never ask me to hang out or get dinner. My lack of social life and a romantic life are putting a huge strain on my mental health. I'm clinically depressed and feel trapped.

I started work with my father because he told me that there was massive potential for us in the jewellery industry if we go into retail. The issue is, as a schizophrenic man, my father is very erratic, paranoid and difficult to be around at times. I have reservations about what it would be like to eventually lease a workshop with him and deal with the public as a retailer. We wouldn't have a full blown retail store per se, but we'd do private jobs for high end clients. Custom jewellery.

My dad already stresses me out and we're working from home. What's going to happen if the stakes are raised and we take on more business and have our own business location?

I can't help but feel pressure to look elsewhere career wise. I know for a fact I'd be an extremely good sales person for a company that rewards their sales agents with commission. I could possibly imagine myself working in sales for a saas company. I'm very persuasive and charismatic. It would also give me the chance to get out of home and interact with people on a regular basis.

Although I actually do enjoy diamond setting, I already find myself avoiding being around my father. I try to work early in the morning when he isn't around. I can't help but wonder if I'm just depressed and can't tolerate human interaction or if he's genuinely insufferable to be around. 

My issue right now is that I make a minimum wage as a diamond setter with my father. However I'm apparently very talented at the job. In about a years time I'll be on six figures. I want to raise as much capital as possible before I have the chance to invest in a business acquaintances company this year (seed round).

1839ccq,"I love my job, but I think I’m going to get fired","
I work at a school as a paraprofessional (teachers assistant). I absolutely love my job, I love the students I work with, and most of my coworkers. But I think I’m going to get fired. 

A little back story, I’ve been working at this school as a para for almost three years now. For the most part, I think I do my job well. I started when my son was 6-weeks-old and when they hired me, they knew that if my son was ever sick, I would have to be the one who stayed home with him, take him to appointments, etc. I make the least in my little family, and my husband makes the big bucks and we can’t afford for him to call in, but we can manage if I do. He makes enough for us I could stay home, but not in the economy now, I need to work so we can be comfortable. Plus I love working. 

So when I was hired (granted we have a different principal now, but she was the vice principal when I started) they knew I would possibly call in. The first two years, we had some issues where my son was sick, RSV twice, Covid once, getting Covid myself, along other things. So far, they have not had any issues. 

Until this year. 

We get so many benefit days a school year and  it’s the end of November and I have used up all my sick leave (10 days). Excessive I know. I was sick with Covid in mid September, I was out five days. My son has had a lot of issues with his immune system. He’s 2, and everything goes into his mouth. He also attends daycare 5 days a week. He has had his fair share of the stomach bug, fever and vomiting, the whole nine yards. Every time, I’ve had to call in and miss work to stay home with him due to being sick. 

Just this past week, we only had two days that we needed to work because of the holidays, and I called into work Tuesday. As we were leaving, my son fell down our back steps and hit the back of his head. I immediately took him to the ER. I was supposed to be at work in 40 minutes. I send a text because I am a very emotional person and I was a mess to talk on the phone. I text and tell my boss the situation and that I wouldn’t be there and I don’t have time finding a sub. 

I get a message saying that it was unacceptable because I have used up all my benefit days and that it’s not even the end of the semester, that there will be a conversation that needs to be held in regards to my absence. I have a position that needs to be covered and I’ve been calling in averaging once every week. 

Now when we know we aren’t going to be able to be at our shift, we are supposed to find a sub for ourselves. I have 5 people I try to get ahold of to sub for me. I have difficulty finding a sub because there aren’t many to begin with and there are a total of 7 schools in our corporation. There is simply not enough subs. And most of the time, I don’t find out until I wake up if he has a fever or isn’t feeling good or whatever the situation is, and I don’t have a lot of time to call to find a sub. So most of the time, they are short because I can’t find a sub. 

I understand completely that they need to have staff. With me not being there, they are short outside for recess and they are short for early bus and curb club. But when it is other people who are out, we manage. Every time that I am out, there are usually others who aren’t and they aren’t struggling bad, they manage. I know they need to have people in the building, but I don’t get that as far as I know, nobody else has gotten into trouble for what I have. 

I cannot help that I get sick or if my son gets sick. I make a little over $13 while my husband makes $20 and works more hours. It makes sense financially for me to call in. We don’t have family that is willing to drop everything to watch him when he’s sick. I told them, family comes first and they were okay with it, but it seems like they aren’t now. 

I’m waiting until next week to find out if I’m getting fired. But I am worried sick if I am or not. As far as I know, they don’t have a “probation” period but I also know that we can’t find people to be paras in our area. I’m upset that all they said was “there will be a conversation.” So I might be getting fired but almost might not. 

Should I be looking for a new place of employment? Do you think I’m going to get fired?",ashdawn97,3,0.6700000166893005,2,1700879634,2023-11-25 02:33:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1839ccq/i_love_my_job_but_i_think_im_going_to_get_fired/,11,2023
1837z84,Mastering the Job Interview,"Job interviews can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. They are your gateway to a potential career opportunity and the chance to make a positive impression on a prospective employer. To succeed in a job interview, it’s essential to prepare thoroughly and effectively. In this blog post, we will explore strategies and tips to help you practice for a job interview and boost your chances of landing that dream job.

**Research the Company**

Before stepping into any interview, you should have a good understanding of the company you’re applying to. Research its mission, values, products or services, recent news, and the industry it operates in. This knowledge not only demonstrates your genuine interest but also helps you tailor your responses to align with the company’s goals and culture.

**Know the Job Description Inside Out**

Carefully review the job description and requirements to understand what the company is looking for in a candidate. Pay attention to key responsibilities and qualifications. This will help you identify relevant skills and experiences to highlight during the interview.

**Prepare Your Answers**

Practice answering common interview questions. Questions about your strengths, weaknesses, work experiences, and your motivation for applying are typical. Write down your responses, and then practice saying them out loud. Focus on providing specific examples that showcase your skills and achievements.

**STAR Method**

When answering behavioral questions, consider using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Describe the situation, the task at hand, the actions you took, and the positive results that occurred. This structured approach helps you provide clear and compelling answers.

**Mock Interviews**

Conduct mock interviews with a friend, family member, or mentor. This helps you get comfortable with the interview format and receive valuable feedback. Request honest feedback on your responses, body language, and overall presentation.

**Dress Appropriately**

Your appearance plays a significant role in forming first impressions. Dress professionally, and choose attire that aligns with the company’s dress code. When in doubt, it’s better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.

**Prepare Questions**

At the end of the interview, you’ll likely have the chance to ask questions. Prepare a list of thoughtful questions that demonstrate your interest in the role and the company. Questions about the team, company culture, and expectations for the role are excellent choices.

**Elevator Pitch**

Craft a concise and engaging elevator pitch that summarizes your background, skills, and career goals. This can be a powerful tool to introduce yourself confidently at the beginning of the interview.

**Research Common Interview Formats**

There are various interview formats, such as one-on-one, panel interviews, or group interviews. Research the type of interview you will be facing and prepare accordingly. For technical roles, you might encounter coding challenges or practical exercises. Knowing the format in advance allows you to prepare effectively.

**Stay Updated**

Stay up to date with industry trends, current events, and any relevant changes in the field. This demonstrates your commitment to continuous learning and your industry expertise.

**Relaxation Techniques**

Dealing with interview jitters is natural. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, mindfulness, or visualization to calm your nerves. A calm, collected demeanor will impress your interviewers. If you get nervous in interviews, Nick recommends to clients to wiggle your toes, this will help to distract your brain.

**Review Your Resume**

Expect interviewers to ask about your resume. Be ready to discuss your past experiences, highlighting your accomplishments, and how they relate to the job you’re interviewing for.

Practicing for a job interview is essential for success. Thorough preparation, research, and practice will boost your confidence and help you shine during the interview.

1836x5j,Break into tech at 70-80K,"I know this questions get asked a lot but I'm looking for thoughtful insight based on my situation.  
Im 41 I came up in a print business and learned how service customers through there. I also learned to accrue some tech acumen in regards to basic computer troubleshooting, using computer software in graphic design and building websites through Shopify and web based platforms as such.  
I worked in the family business until about 30 then went on my own and sold commercial graphics and had them produced by subcontractors. In order to do this I really had to hone in my account management skills and now my strengths lie in project/account management and relations.  
I continued my experience working for an employer until the pandemic hit. Since then I have been a realtor but now I am really thinking about my future and tech for a few reasons is where I'm intrigued.  
I am wondering not if its possible because everything is but how probable it is to break in at a salary of 70-80 with my experience and what role that would be in. I do not want to be a software dev, I know that much but I am open to other roles.  
Also  I would certainly be willing to taking courses and certs of any kind that would help me solidify some of the necessary tech skills as well as build a portfolio and prep for tech interviews. I figure this would take a year? is that reasonable.

18357ok,I don't think I want to be a lawyer,"Sorry if this is not meant for this sub but I am having an existential crisis so please be kind

I finished my masters degree in Law (I'm in the EU where Law is an university major) and I have been applying for jobs. I worked really hard in uni and basically devoted every day of my time to good grades, internships and extracurricular activities. 

I applied for a job in biglaw and I applied for a legal counsel job at our ministry for foreign affairs. The latter was my dream job and also has reasonable hours but I got rejected today because of the lack of work experience.

Because I have a young daughter I don't want to work crazy hours, but basically every legal counsel position that I like with the government or inhouse requires at least 2-3 years of experience.

I got hired for the job in biglaw, the particular department I work for is also pretty reasonable in hours but it's still a very demanding role obviously. Where I live you have to go through a three year program where you work and study at your firm after which you officially become a lawyer. 

Here's the thing though, I'm absolutely dreading to work at this office. I am just not excited about it at all and I have no passion about becoming a lawyer but I need the experience. Obviously it will look good on my resume and create other opportunities but I'm afraid I will be miserable the coming 2-3 years.

1834pmh,Am I wrong for feeling this way?,"Am I wrong for feeling this way?

I've been feeling very unhappy in my job, which I've been doing for nearly a year. A year isn't a long time but I've been trying to enjoy what I do and to find a sense of fulfilment in it. I've been thinking of at least being able to push through it for the rest of my life because I know logically it is not a bad career, it pays well for not much stress (work-wise), has great flexibility and work life balance. Nothing is wrong with my workplace and colleagues, people are lovely and respectful. I am very lucky. 

The problem is that the field I'm in is very subjective, and 90%of what I do is very trial and error, with little certainty that there will be success, and most of the time, results take a very long time to observe and even then progress can be minimal.

 I struggle with the uncertainty and having the assurance to tell myself it is a very normal part of my job (which it is, as many experienced colleagues have told me). The mental burden is taking a toll on me, and every night I dread the next day. When I am working, I do what I am supposed to do but I count the hours till I can finish to help me get through each day. I am not bad at my job, I have been getting positive reviews.

My parents have noticed that i am very unhappy, ive been crying occasionally in my room when i felt like i never want the next day to come, and ive shut down and spoken very little when im home. They pressured me into telling them whats wrong so I've had to confide in them. They tell me that I'm taking it too seriously and that it's just  part of the nature of the job, and really I haven't done anything to feel guilty about. The job is in high demand, it's great in every other way, what could I possibly complain about?

And this is part of why I'm feeling so miserable: I know the job is great, and I feel so guilty for feeling this way. I know that to even be having this ""problem"" is proof that I'm too privileged when many others have such a hard time finding a job or not being compensated well for the work they do. 
I am grateful for the job, I really am, I'm trying so hard to stick with it and be happy. It's nearly the end of the year and I'm just feeling worse as time goes on. I feel really bad that I want to change careers and study something unrelated at this point in my life when I've spent the last 5 years in uni and finally am getting a steady source of income. 

My parents are trying to understand how I feel... but they've also been saying things like, ""if you want to see tangible concrete results with what you do, why don't you go and be a cleaner or sweep the streets? Or be a farmer and harvest crops?""(or some other physically strenuous job, you get the gist).
 And I know they're trying to say ""you're so lucky to have a low stress non physically demanding job with good pay and you don't even know it "". This makes me feel awful because I know where they're coming from and I can't deny it. I am lucky, but I feel that I dont deserve to feel what I'm experiencing and I feel so guilty for being this way. 

I really needed to tell someone out there how I feel, so thank you to those who actually read this post, and please if you have any advice for me on how to sort this emotional dilemma please do. But pleaseee don't make me any more guilty than I do right now.",pb3377,2,1.0,1,1700866840,2023-11-24 23:00:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1834pmh/am_i_wrong_for_feeling_this_way/,11,2023

Anyhow years go by she graduates she is a Board certified obstetrician 

She goes back as the term of her Scholar ship states to the place where she used to work in a primary care center 

So she works in a clinic no deliveries no surgeries no inpatient (all things she excelled at during her residency)

Because it has been a while (a year and a half) since she worked in a hospital . 

Well how would she build her experience in hospital work if no one is willing to take her under their wing to give her experience

182z162,Write to the US senators about excess H1B and L1 visas,"Hello tech job workers who are struggling to find jobs,  
Please write to your senators about the H1B and L1 visas. Use this text below:  
*Since the tech layoffs began in 2022, there have been roughly 400,000 laid of tech workers over the past two years. Some of them have found jobs. However, many are still struggling even though it is not an official economic recession. This issue does not get enough media coverage because the labour department is reporting generally healthy unemployment numbers across all industries.*   
*Admittedly, multiple factors caused the layoffs such as excess hiring by tech companies when the interest rates were low , worries about impending recession, advent of AI etc. - all of these are rational and understandable. However, what is making matters worse, is that US citizens and permanent residents (green-card holders), have to unfairly compete with H1B and L1 workers that are admitted into USA every year.*   
*H1B visas have a 100,000 cap per year. L1 visas do not even have a cap. I do recognize the mutual benefits of H1B and L1 visas for the industry and the visa holders. However, for the current economic environment, the caps are way too high. The main purpose of an H1B and L1 visa was to cover the gap in high demand and low supply of skilled workers for US companies. However, this purpose has now evaporated, given the US companies have access to flood of talent.*   
*I am urging your office to introduce a bill to temporary (or permanently) lower the H1B caps (at least for tech jobs) and introduce a cap on L1, until outlook improves for US citizens and permanent residents.*    
*Thank you,*

On the other hand, while I was good at working with the software I’m trained it felt like they also needed a full-PC maintenance which I struggled a bit with.  I’m wondering if maybe I could play it off by saying that they wanted me to do things I wasn’t trained for and they needed someone who could better fulfill the role and that’s why I resigned.

182vib0,Car salesman for a change in pace.,"Good afternoon, I’m a car salesman (m31)and it ain’t working anymore. 

To be clear, I’ve done ok in the past as a salesperson at 10-12 cars per month, then 8 months at 15-22 cars per month before getting moved to the finance manager position. Long story short, it didn’t go well. Ended up, I didn’t believe in the product. It manifested as me not selling as hard as I probably should have , giving more discounts to people in guidance with my conscious and ultimately not meeting the monthly per deal goal they wanted to see. It also didn’t help that the office snake was constantly berating me to my manager and his boss about things he either made up, willfully misrepresented or was hypocritical about. But at the end of the day I wasn’t good enough. I was demoted to sales and the arts where I’m writing from now. I don’t like to admit it but the fact that the guys behavior has been an open problem that’s overlooked is frustrating. My manager not having my back to his boss was frustrating. The fact that they got me out the finance office, to sales and took 3 weeks to get me a pay plan or schedule was frustrating. The fact that I was demoted despite having on par or better first year numbers and a higher goal to hit than my coworkers did in their first year, specifically the snake who told me in confidence how he cried when he was having a tough time his first year while also apparently having admitted to someone else that getting people fired is how he moves up is frustrating. 

Here’s my problem because I’ve admittedly had a hard time pulling my head out my ass and performing in the sales floor as my second week in.

Do I take what I’ve learned and learned about myself and find a job that can support my wife and kids even if just barely while I work on building myself up a new skill to monetize? Or do I stay here, really buckle down and make myself the best salesman in my state? Part of me wants to stay but I think that’s pride, wanting to excel despite the setback and to keep my benefits but also I’ve been so unfocused and disillusioned with this business that I feel like trying to stay is an equal mountain as finding a new job.

182u86r,Difficult boss: how should I proceed?,"Just wanted to get the subreddit's 2 cents. I'm working as a marketing executive within a team of two, my boss is the head of department. For the last 10 months, I've done all the work - and I mean all the work, strategy, partnerships, analysis & reporting, far beyond what was outlined in my job description. I've introduced practices (such as PPC) to the department, which have resulted in huge returns (over 16,000% ROAS). I've carried out all of our presentations, video production/editing, social media management etc. etc. I'm certain that my boss has been taking credit for some of this work behind closed doors.

Speaking to my boss, he said a few months ago that they want to give me a pay rise/promotion in January, but a more recent conversation revealed they've pushed that date back to April. I wouldn't mind this, but he also insinuated that he wants to hire someone in my position first. Can someone help me to decode this? Am I right to feel infuriated that, rather follow through on his promise, he's hiring another me? Why is he doing this? What is his strategy here?

I know from other members of staff that he's feeling insecure about his role, but it's his own fault, he's been assigning all the work to me since I've arrived and has spent the last 10 months sat on his fat arse watching F1. I'm also starting to burn out.

182u4td,24 and lost as hell. What are my options?,"
I’m 24F and graduated college a year and a half ago (I took a gap year and had a baby a couple months before my twentieth birthday). I’m not really sure what career to ultimately transition into, because I’ve been working for a long time and am still trying to work out what I like/what’s feasible. 

 While I was in undergrad, I worked part-time at an independent  bookstore, where I started a creative writing club, a copwatch group, and organized monthly movie nights dedicated to independent cinema. I also coordinated a tutoring program there. In addition to doing that and being in school, I also worked as a copywriter for a children’s hospital. I did copywriting for them, contributing short form and long form content, for about 3 and a half years. After I graduated (I majored in English at a state school), I continued working for them, quit at the bookstore because I needed to focus on securing long term employment even though I loved that job, and began additionally freelancing for other copywriting clients. It allowed me to work a relatively flexible schedule and mostly stay at home with my son, which I appreciated. It also provided financial independence.

The only problem is, 1) I want to find something I like more eventually, and 2) I’m 
afraid of getting eventually phased out by AI. I’ve also had library assistant jobs before  in addition to my copywriting work, because I’ve always been interested in libraries and the community organizing aspect of what a librarian does. However, if I go down that path I’d ultimately have to pursue a master’s, which is a financial and time investment that might not be feasible right now since I’m a single mother. I’ve enjoyed working as a library assistant but most library assistant jobs where I am are temporary or part time. 

I’ve done volunteer work before (like grant writing and organizing job training and continuing education programs at a shelter where I had used to live), but I’ve been told professional experience is the only thing that employers look at. 

I want to make a change but I have no idea what my options are. It’s all so overwhelming. What do I do?",Inner_Lake_4988,1,0.4300000071525574,6,1700838450,2023-11-24 15:07:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/182u4td/24_and_lost_as_hell_what_are_my_options/,11,2023
182sxna,My 64 year old mother keeps getting yelled at by her managers - what can I do?,"As the title says, my mother keeps getting shouted at by her managers. This is not a daily thing, but it's often enough where it's upsetting. She has high blood pressure and take medications for it. This is not the first time this has happened and I have already complained to HR about these 2 managers. The majority of the time things are fine at her work but every once in a while, the store manager yells at her about something. This has happened in front of other employees but not in front of customers as she works in the back room.

Over the past 20 years that she has had at this job, this has happened over 10 times but it has only been documented with company HR 3-4 times. HR said they would get this resolved with this manager but clearly nothing has changed.

My mother speaks broken English and she feels discriminated against because the manager does not yell at other employees. Only her. These are trivial things that he yells at her about and I personally am sick of it. I have contacted HR in the past and logged complaints but it feels like my complaints are falling on deaf ears. We live in Massachusetts and the company is a multibillion dollar retailer that is publicly listed on the stock exchange.

The only reason she has not quit her job is because she needs her health insurance until she can retire and get medicare next year. She would not be eligible for medicaid or the state-sponsored masshealth program.

What can I do here? I feel stuck and complaining to HR feels like a lost cause.",puffyisreal,1,0.5,6,1700835005,2023-11-24 14:10:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/182sxna/my_64_year_old_mother_keeps_getting_yelled_at_by/,11,2023

182qe4q,What's a good career for someone who loves mental models?,"Let me start off by saying that I am currently obsessed with mental models and improve my decision making skills. I don't mean to sound obnoxious with that phrase so I apologize in advance.  
I love the idea of thinking more correctly. Charlie Munger and Shane Parrish have talked a lot about mental models and they really get me so pumped when I read about them. I am a college student doing undergrad and need to declare my major soon. I also need to get an internship soon.   
Are there any career and college majors that would involve learning and applying these mental models to something? I have a feeling that it could just be a complement to building other skills in a discipline like law, engineering, finance etc but something that focusses heavily on it would be good.   
Ideally, I'm also looking for something that's lucrative or at least has the potential to be. So philosophy and psychology are not really options I'm too interested in given that my education would have to go past my bachelors for them to be viable. However, if you feel I'd strongly benefit from those long term, please let me know. Something that can be self-learned would also be a nice bonus to have  
I enjoy conversations which involve playing devil's advocate a lot, and I love anything that has to do with finding what's somewhat true- usually through the socratic method or something like that  
I know these are vague themes but I feel like I have to be vague because I just haven't learned enough about myself in the context of a work environment- I don't know the kinds of jobs that are out there and what I'd be good at.

182mfzw,What can I do as a recent 26 year old ADHD guy who’s stuck and lost in life?,"Hi guys, I’m a 26-year-old guy with ADHD and OCD, and well, I’m just a mess, to be honest. LOL. I have a couple of associate’s degrees in business and political science that I finally obtained in 2020 after spending almost four years in community college. However, I faced difficulties transferring to my preferred college due to COVID, so I ended up attending another state school in spring 2021. Adjusting was challenging, especially with remote learning through Zoom. To be honest, it was tough, and I eventually dropped out.

In summer 2021, I discovered tech sales and decided to enroll in a questionable income share agreement boot camp that promised a high-paying job. Unfortunately, the CEO made false promises, and lawsuits were filed against the company. Thankfully, after six months and no job, I managed to get out of the contract. Shortly after, I landed a great remote tech sales job paying $83,000, but it didn’t last due to poor performance caused by the previous boot camp’s negative impact on my mental health and struggles with time management. 

Following the loss of my sales job in summer 2022, I took a break to focus on my mental well-being. I battled depression but was fortunate to find a therapist and life coach. In March 2023, I made the decision to re-enroll in college and finish my degree. I discovered that I could attend a reputable state school in my state, so I seized the opportunity. Currently, I’m studying supply chain management, possibly with a focus on MIS or finance.

Though I’m now 26 and facing struggles in college due to my ADHD and the gap in my education, I’m determined not to drop out. My tuition is covered thanks to my state’s financial support, and I expect to have little debt. However, I realize that a straight C’s average or like a 2.4 GPA may not be ideal for internships or job prospects. Am I a hopeless case? Am I just an idiot and a failure?

It's like an institute where you're taught the subject and they promise you a job. You have to pay then, they give you 3 months of internship and then they offer you jobs. It was written in the company prospectus. 

But after I joined, they didn't teach me anything job-oriented or anything advanced. The first 3 months were basic Python then they taught me basic SQL. I learnt nothing new. I knew Python (intermediate to advanced level), machine learning, deep learning, excel, SQL, and Power BI (self-taught)  from the start. 

I paid them a lump sum amount of money, just to hope they would connect me with the companies. In the part of the world I'm from, it's really hard to get a job for a fresher without connections/ referrals. 

The internship they offered was to teach other people. They didn't say anything about this. I thought it would be real jobs. Now I'm asking for my experience letter, the administration is just changing the topic, they're saying, ""It'll be beneficial for you to stay here."" As they know once I get my experience letter, I'll leave. I do practically nothing there, I just go around 10 AM and leave the place at 7 PM. I do nothing but sit there watching people.

Some of them have found jobs, but many are still struggling even though it is not an official economic recession and the labour department is reporting healthy unemployment numbers across all industries.*   
*A lot of factors caused the layoffs such as excess hiring by tech companies when the interest rates were low, worries about impending recession, advent of AI etc. However, what is making matters worse is that US citizens and permanent residents (green-card holders) have to compete with H1B and L1 workers that are admitted into USA every year.*   
*H1B visas have a 100,000 cap per year. L1 visas do not even have a cap. I do recognize the benefits of H1B and L1 visas, however for the current economic environment the caps are too high. The main purpose of an H1B and L1 visa was to cover the gap in high demand and low supply of tech workers for tech industries. However, this purpose is now flipped on its back.*

So the first instance that made me dislike working here is being sexually harassed by a older man in his 40s (I was 21f well I’m 22 now but still) I did report it and he got suspended for two weeks and apparently he’s appealing for it? My coworker told me. Idk how he got the information probably because he’s friends with people in HR

But he appealed and apparently his supervisor just sent him home and never told him why he was suspended so he’s appealing to get his money for those 2 weeks and to wipe the harassment off his record.

Another thing I dislike is that so many people are related and it feels like a workplace that a lot of people can screw off on and nobody cares too much depending on what department you’re in 

I feel the ones who have relatives up there can get away with more stuff like for example there was a guy who was in security and he started to miss and not even call in and would clock in during the morning and never clock out if he left the building and then would come back at the end of the day and clock out

I feel he got away with it cause the supervisor for security was related to him. he was his grandson

I’ve been here for a month and my supervisor likes me and has told me I am very eager to learn and that I’m a quick learner that she is trusting me with other responsibilities. 

The person who is training me, my “buddy” also likes me and thinks I’m a hard worker. 

The higher ups, I don’t really report directly to them, but occasionally will need to receive signatures from them or they could potentially include me on projects. 

They barely say “hi” and will just stare at me blankly. I mean it doesn’t hurt to be friendly to new staff? 

If it matters, I am young and female, and a woman of color so could it be discrimination related? 

The higher ups tend to be white males. 

It’s just really discouraging when they seem so cold when you’re new. 

I don’t think it’s discrimination related as our organization is government related, we have a lot of diversity. 

Could it be that I wear makeup? I don’t do any dramatic looks, I just have on foundation and blush because I try to cover up my acne scars to look more professional. I also dress professionally, turtle necks and dress pants.

Maybe I am just overthinking this?",ComplaintLess3288,2,0.5,18,1700785930,2023-11-24 00:32:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/182f6jm/why_do_i_feel_like_the_higher_ups_at_my_workplace/,11,2023
182f0p4,I think I regret my major. Don't know what to do.,"Hi everyone, I'm a 22 F, studying Translation Studies. I was born in Turkey and am living in Turkey. 

I chose this major cause the year I got into university entrance exams, the whole system changed. Due to the economic crisis, they made the exams extremely difficult. I used to study maths & science but kept having panic attacks, health issues, depression and suicidal thoughts due to many factors and decided to switch my focus to languages. Some teachers caused trauma as well so it all became too much to handle. (I wasn't bad at maths and science, you get the idea. I was even a maths tutor for a while.)

Initially I was excited, I always loved learning languages and I had no bad experiences with languages. I figured that if I was a mess, I probably shouldn't choose a hard major. I didn't know what I wanted to do anyways. So I thought I can at least learn some languages and translation as a side gig even if I change careers. 

However, I forgot how hard it is to change careers, how bad it may feel when you have a long-term partner (even more pressure to make money quickly), how hard it is to go abroad with just a Translation degree. For some reason I thought it would be enough but many say it's not. Redditors also seem to think any major other than STEM is a horrible career path.

Anyways, some facts about me:

- I've always wanted to make games and recently my passion for it was ignited. I can draw, need to work on it but I'm not bad at it. I don't know how to code but am open to learning it. Should I consider boot camps as a learning opportunity and a possible career change? I'm working on my game right now but they're baby steps and mostly on art.

- I know Russian, it's improving and I'm getting confident. I'm also learning French, basic level but so far so good.

- I'm currently teaching online for an American company. Should I go for CELTA in hopes of finding a potential teaching job abroad?

- I'm good at verbal interpreting. I don't think that written translation has much of a future so I would choose this route instead. I have experience in phone interpreting. As for written, I have translated an app and have experience on some documents. I also did my internship. I recently found a part-time translation job as well.

- I would say I love learning about many different things and love learning skills. I think I can sing, cook well, love puzzles etc. Maybe irrelevant info but I love being multi-dimensional. I would say I'm creative.

- I have relatives abroad, a relative said I could work at language schools across Europe (He knows someone). I have a green passport that I can use till 25 as long as I'm a student.

I know it was long but my question is, am I screwed? Should I get back into education or boot camps? Should I get a certificate? I have so many questions in mind. I guess I'm also scared about being jobless or making very little money.

I’m currently working for a manufacturing company and have done for over 10 years and I’m coming to the realisation that I won’t be able to continue this type of work once I’m in my 40s due to how physically demanding the role is (I’m 28) so I’ve started studying qualifications at a steady pace with the idea to start a career.

At the minute the only H&S qualifications I have is a NEBOSH Gen in occupational health and safety but I intend to get qualifications in fire safety, incident investigation, risk assessment, coshh and internal auditor training. I have other qualifications and licenses such as in construction, manufacturing, first aid and a fork truck license.

I’ve been just browsing jobs the past couple months and it seems that all roles in health and safety require experience first and foremost so I’m starting to think that even with all the qualifications I aim to get it will still be difficult to land a role.

1828y8u,Unjustified Yearly Review,"I've been in my industry for over 20 years. I have the highest credentials you can get, along with an excellent work history wherever I've been and impeccable references when I joined my current employer just under 3 years ago. My salary is also in the mid-to-high range for the profession. 

Where I work, pretty much like everywhere else in the world right now, there is a shortage of people, so everyone is asked to do more which I'm OK with because I get it. 

Boss has been forcing everyone to do ""other duties as assigned"" because we don't have front-line workers, causing what my position to do to fall behind in a backlog. Same goes for my co-workers.

We just hired a new manager so my boss can be promoted. 

Before he transitioned, he gave me the worst most scathing yearly review of my career, not in-line with the last two years with the company, which basically was a rinse-and-repeat of the ""other duties as assign"" issue.

The review actually states that I ""have more work than one person can handle"", but the reason I got ""Does not meet job expectations"" for the first time in my career was that I didn't finish everything as assigned.

I wasn't put on a Performance Improvement Plan or anything afterwards.

- My college degree is in marketing and advertising, so I've got some relevant education under my belt.
Now, here's where I need your guidance:

**Option 1: Pursuing an MBA**

- I've been contemplating whether to go for an MBA from a prestigious college. Will it significantly boost my chances in the consulting field, considering my marketing background?

- Are there any specific schools or programs you'd recommend for someone looking to transition into consulting? Any success stories from folks who made this leap?

**Option 2: Direct Job Search**

- On the other hand, should I start looking for consulting roles right away with my current credentials? Are there any entry-level positions or firms that might be more open to candidates with marketing backgrounds?

- What skills or experiences do I need to highlight on my resume to make myself more appealing to consulting recruiters?

1828dyj,I don't know what career path / university course to choose.,"I'm almost 17 and half-way through 10th grade and I still haven't chosen an university course or career path and I'm under heavy pressure to finally make a decision. In around 2 years, I will need to pass my University entrance exams & baccalaureate.

  
I honestly feel horrible. It feels like everyone around me has at least one thing they're really good at, or a passion, which can actually be a career path, but I got nothing. The things that I am really good at are History, Geography, Geopolitics, Politics, Languages (as in quickly learning them, I really hate literature), which don't have great career outlooks. I understand the whole ""Do something that you love"" ordeal, but it's simply not possible in my situation. I plan on emigrating and studying these subjects would confine me to my home-country. I also want to live comfortably and not live under the poverty line like most teachers.

  
This pretty much means that my only options require good knowledge of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, et cetera  
However, I'm not extraordinarily good in any of these subjects, I don't have talent like most people going down this path. 

  
Mathematics is a subject that I can learn to tolerate and I actually like solving problems, but I'm still not that great in it. 

  
I've always hated Physics hated because of my teacher, and I'm not sure if I could actually do it. Space has always fascinated me though.

  
I haven't really gotten to experiment with Chemistry, and my teacher is quite bad at teaching it to be honest.

  
Biology is a subject I've always loved and while I don't like learning everything by heart, I love learning about how our bodies & the world around us works.

  
I've always loved computers, but I haven't gotten into the programming world yet. I don't know if I could actually be good in Computer Science.

  
Overall it feels like I'm just not good enough in all subjects and it's so disheartening seeing other people excel, while I'm struggling to keep pace. Studying any of them seems so overwhelming, especially when I think of how hard University is going to be and how much of a responsibility you have as an adult working a job.

  
I don't even know where to start. Every time I gain a short burst of confidence, I quickly get humbled.   
My mother keeps telling me to study medicine, because it has the most job opportunities, it's a stable job, you are respected, and so on. I don't think I'm up to it, though. The thought of me being responsible for another person's Life scares me. Medicine is also a subject that you do out of passion, and I don't think I have a passion for it.

  
It once again comes to this problem: the lack of passion, of excelling at something.   
An option which I'm considering is doing something with Computer Science and Mathematics, but I don't know if I could do it. I don't have any experience with programming, even though I enjoy working with computers. I'm also quite mediocre in mathematics, which I believe I could resolve with enough exercising and hard work. I'm still very doubtful though, as I don't have a passion per se.   
How can I find a profession that I like and excel in, has a good career outlook and a good salary? This feels so impossible.

  
What should I do? If I don't decide now, I won't have enough time to study for my exams. I'm trying to keep up with all subjects at school in case I find something I like, but the clock is ticking.",WretchedPleb,2,0.7599999904632568,2,1700766157,2023-11-23 19:02:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1828dyj/i_dont_know_what_career_path_university_course_to/,11,2023

1827gaa,Seeking Advice: Feeling Conflicted About Career Direction After 1 Year as a Backend Engineer. What to do?,"Today marks my one-year anniversary as a backend engineer at a startup. I've recently found myself at a crossroads, feeling uncertain about my career path after not receiving any pay increases during the mid-year or annual review cycles.  
Reflecting on this, I've realized that perhaps my lack of active participation in meetings, struggles with writing optimal code, and a lack of initiative might have contributed to this stagnation. However, upon deeper introspection, I find myself questioning whether it's more about a lack of passion for coding or the software development process itself.  
I've put in effort, but the recent lack of growth has led me to wonder if coding isn't my true calling. Although I anticipate a promotion to SDE2 and a subsequent pay increase with more experience, I can't shake the feeling that this might be an opportune time to explore different career paths.  
I'm torn between continuing in the software development field, leveraging my upcoming promotion and pay raise, or taking a leap of faith to explore entirely new career avenues while I'm still at a stage where experimentation is feasible.

18259kk,24 y/o debating Mid-Level vs MD,"Hi all could really use some advice. Background: 24F, currently finishing school for mid-level healthcare position (MS in Cardiovascular Perfusion) and have been debating going back to school for an MD. Here are the scenarios:  
Scenario 1 (Perfusionist)

1. Would realistically start around 140k-165k at age 25.
2. After 2-3 years could be eligible for travel positions. These accounts are \~ $4500-6500 a week (\~215k-312k annually)
3. Student loan debt \~ 120k after I finish next year. Am PSLF eligible.

Scenario 2 (MD)

1. Would start schooling hopefully by age 26 (earliest possible) to 27 (more realistic).
2. Given a 4 year residency would finish at age 34-35.
3. I am not sure yet exactly what speciality I would choose but am hoping for a minimum salary of 350-400k but would like to earn more after a few years of experience.
4. Student loan debt in conjunction with my debt from my MS \~ 470k (120k from MS +350k from MD). Am PSLF eligible given I do not do private practice I believe. Will max out loans.

Other factors:

1. I am not comfortable as a perfusionist at this point because of the high risk. I would prefer a speciality where split minute decision making is not life or death. However, I am not the strongest student so realistically aiming for something mid-tier in competitiveness.
2. Have come to terms with the fact that I could work as a perfusionist and earn a good salary, live comfortably, however, I do not feel a strong passion for the job as a student now. I think my real passion lies in patient connection and the autonomy/leadership of the MD role. Ultimately, I think I may regret not pursuing it. This said, I do not want to pursue something that will leave me financially behind or unable to enjoy the fruits of my labor (i.e. I want to take care of my family and enjoy my life).

Questions:

1. Is shooting for a 350-400k+ salary realistic for a mid-tier MD speciality?
2. Given I can secure a position as stated above, would I still be financially behind since I am giving up years of compound interest? I don't really care about loans much If I can do PSLF but recognize they accrue interest. But am more scared I won't catch up if I pursue an MD just sheerly based on lifetime earnings.

1824x60,24 y/o debating Midlevel vs MD - Advice?,"Hi all could really use some advice. Posted here before but am back with a different scenario and more details. Background: 24F, currently finishing school for mid-level healthcare position (MS in Cardiovascular Perfusionist) and have been debating going back to school for an MD. Here are the scenarios:  
Scenario 1 (Cardiovascular Perfusionist)

1.  Would realistically start around 140k-165k at age 25.
2. After 2-3 years could be eligible for travel positions. These accounts are \~ $4500-6500 a week (\~215k-312k annually)
3. Student loan debt \~ 120k after I finish next year. Am PSLF eligible.

Scenario 2 (MD)

1. Would start schooling hopefully by age 26 (earliest possible) to 27 (more realistic).
2. Given a 4 year residency would finish at age 34-35.
3. I am not sure yet exactly what speciality I would choose but am hoping for a minimum salary of 350-400k but would like to earn more after a few years of experience.
4. Student loan debt in conjunction with my debt from my MS \~ 470k (120k from MS +350k from MD). Am PSLF eligible given I do not do private practice I believe. Will max out loans.

Other factors:

1. I am not the strongest student but am extremely emotionally intelligent which I hope can make me at least generally competitive for well paying fields/allow for success. Strong clinical experience working in cardiac surgery as a perfusion student. I love school far more than work.
2. Have come to terms with the fact that I could work as a perfusionist and earn a good salary, live comfortably, however, I do not feel a strong passion for the job right now. I think my real passion lies in patient connection and the autonomy/leadership of the MD role. Ultimately, I think I may regret not pursuing it. This said, I do not want to pursue something that will leave me financially behind or unable to enjoy the fruits of my labor (i.e. I want to take care of my family and enjoy my life).
3. I am not comfortable as a perfusionist at this point because of the high risk. I would prefer a speciality where split minute decision making is not life or death.

Questions:

1. Is shooting for a 350-400k+ salary realistic for a mid-tier MD speciality that aligns with my desires? Again, would prefer something not as high risk and a 3-4 year residency. Any suggestions from MDs on specialities I could pursue? I like IM as of now.
2. Given I can secure a position as stated above, would I still be financially behind since I am giving up years of compound interest? I don't really care about loans much If I can do PSLF but recognize they accrue interest. But am more scared I won't catch up if I pursue an MD just sheerly based on lifetime earnings.
3. I am having trouble comparing finances as well as quality of life with each of these paths. I ultimately am looking for highest quality of life but am aware that finances play a large role in this. Any advice and input would be greatly appreciated.",sad_perfusionkid97,1,1.0,0,1700756857,2023-11-23 16:27:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1824x60/24_yo_debating_midlevel_vs_md_advice/,11,2023

I had to update a legal doc and made an error to a file reference, and was told that it was completely incorrect and in no position to be signed off or reviewed.

18232d6,"I can't decide if I want a low paying passionate career, or a high paying career to pursue things outside of work","So my passions are social studies (mainly history, geography, and a little bit of law). Now law school is something I have considered quite a bit, but becoming a lawyer seems very unrealistic to me because of the high debt, and long hours. And I've been told by many that being a lawyer isn't as glamorous as it's made out to be, and you really don't make that much money like it's depicted. All other jobs that I could get with a degree like political science also seem to be generally low paying.

When it comes to history, I'd primarily be interested in being a teacher. Being a teacher would actually probably be the thing I'm most passionate about, but the kids I'm surrounded with kinda suck (most but not all) and I don't see it getting any better. The pay is way too low, and the hours I've been told can even be up to 70 because you can never leave work at home.

Geography would also be cool but it seems like the only careers out there in geography are through GIS, but that also seems to not make a good amount of money, and the jobs are few and far between.

I would most likely very much enjoy all these careers, but the downside is money, and I've come to believe that I'm a very money driven person. I'd like to have enough money to pursue passions outside of work, have a nice house, enough to support a family and put kids through college.

A career that I don't think I'd be passionate about but have been told can make really good money, and amazing work-life balance is being an accountant, but I've also been told in can be incredibly boring. But people also say that sure it's boring, you can have plenty of money and time to pursue many other things outside of your job. Also has very good job security.

So my question is, what do you guys think? Those that pursued your passion (primarily social studies) how did it work out for you? Would you recommend it?

And for those that went for a 'mundane' career, but really good pay, security, etc, would you recommend it? Are you happy with your choice?",Judge_Flat,4,0.7099999785423279,10,1700751755,2023-11-23 15:02:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18232d6/i_cant_decide_if_i_want_a_low_paying_passionate/,11,2023
1822y4o,Choosing an offer for salary with a poor location,"I am currently evaluating 2 job offers, one in retail and the other in defense. Company A (retail) is a higher offer, but in a less preferable location. It would be a day of traveling over plane to see family and it’s not near any major cities. I think this would be better for my career in the long run. There are stock options for this job as well, which would pay off if I stayed 3+ years. 

Company B is a lower offer theoretically, but with no state income tax it will come out to around the same. This is also a rotational program which I like over 3 years, but I don’t see myself wanting to stay in defense or this company in the long run. It’s in a much more preferable location however, and even though I am not as excited about the position and work it would still allow me professional development opportunities. I would have the opportunity to travel in this position. 

All in all, it seems like a similar level of work life balance, I just wanted to hear thoughts about choosing an opportunity that may be better in a less favorable location.

1821cwd,New co-worker is trying to take my job already not sure how to address the issue,"I’m 24 and work in a law firm. I started off as a receptionist but was quickly promoted to paralegal and court work. I have studied law for 4 years - I went to college and got a diploma and am now studying my law degree at university. My boss hired me when I was on my gap year, I had always made it clear to him that I intended to go back to university to finish my final year and he had no issues with this. Today I informed him I’ll be returning to my studies in January and he agreed to make me part time and that he would be happy for me to work my job around studying with the view that I graduate and become a lawyer with the firm. 

My boss recently hired a new woman, he wasn’t keen on her at first (his first option fell through, he said there’s something about her he’s not sure about) she’s twice my age and previously worked in receptionist roles in car sales. From the first week she started she had asked if she could do any of my work (I think she believes she knows more than me because she’s older) I replied ‘no it’s okay, thank you for offering’ she then went to my boss and complained that she doesn’t just want to answer phones, she wants to do typing. My boss then informed her that the phone is the main reason she is here. 

My boss asked if I would train her up and show her the ropes but she doesn’t want to listen to me then she claims nobody has shown her what to do. I’ve caught her out for lying and heard her give incorrect advice to clients which I think is extremely damaging to the firm’s reputation because she thinks she knows everything but has no legal background nor is she a qualified lawyer to give such advice. Myself and the other paralegal have told her not to do this but she continues to do it.

After telling my boss I’m going part time, he’s told her she can do some secretarial work to which she replied to me “it’s about time I started doing some of your work.” My boss explained it’s basic typing she will do. She doesn’t seem to understand that I have qualifications which is why I am in that job. Yesterday she was hiding from answering the phones and left them all to me - 12 calls I took to which she replied ‘I was busy’ but when I was on the phones I had to drop everything. 

TL:DR I think people at work are slowly starting to pick up on this and her attitude towards answering the phone and telling clients the wrong information. She is determined she wants a job solely typing but she can’t even organise the lawyers diaries yet she claims to have all this experience… I feel like I should be saying something to my boss about it but I don’t want to look like the bad guy.",Ok-Advertising-658,41,0.9399999976158142,12,1700746606,2023-11-23 13:36:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1821cwd/new_coworker_is_trying_to_take_my_job_already_not/,11,2023
1820mkp,"I went through an extremely competitive career, here’s ONE mistake I see all the time about mentorship","Having **invested career mentors** saved me hundreds hours on my journey to being a Cardiothoracic surgeon. Yet, many early-career professionals struggle to secure and keep mentors because they underestimate the importance **“reciprocated value”**. By doing these, you give potential mentors a reason to be **personally interested** in your career growth.  
  
**Make their concerns your own:** By independently acting upon your mentor’s woes, you align your goals and show empathy through action.   
  
**Checking in with your mentor:** The higher up the ladder you climb, the more difficult it is to speak out. Even asking about a tough experience over lunch can be a much needed outlet for their frustration.    
  
**Acknowledge their journey:** Show genuine interest in the challenges your mentor overcame in their past. This deepens your connection far more than just discussing their current successes.  
  
**Be a friend:** Genuine and sincere interaction is what humans naturally enjoy. When appropriate, delve into discussions about hobbies, holidays, and family.  
  
Humans are naturally inclined towards reciprocity. Show that you care about their life and career and they will do the same for you.

My sister has always stuck to being a Dr while I kept jumping around. I wanted to be a lawyer, then a Dr again, then a nail tech, then a Dr then a dentist ect. The one I've been attached to for a while now is a therapist. I want to be a therapist, but it doesn't pay well, and honestly I'm not too Shure I want to be a therapist. I always see people complaining about their therapist, and you can't live your life without the ""fear of a client.."" I can't go out what if my client sees me. I can't do this what if my client sees me. I can't go here ect. Every other profession you get to come home, and wind down, but it feels like as a therapist you'd always have to be professional. Clients forgetting you have a life outside therapy ect. 

dramatic example: a client dropping  you because they spotted you at Krogers buying alcohol.  They struggle with binge drinking, and soberity. Now they don't feel you can tell them about the problems drinking brings to their life because you're drinking, even though you don't have a problem with alcohol. 

I ultimately just want to help people and such. Too many people are suffering in unhappy marriages and I hate it so much. Not only dose it affect the person. Their living the rest of their life miserable but it affects their kids(if they have any) which makes a cycle of unhappy people and everyone deserves to have a happy life.

Should I do a masters in occupational therapy? (Aus) 

So for context, I studied a my undergrad in psychology with the intention of becoming a psychologist but u need further honours and masters to actually practice which is at least 3 more years. I’ve decided to not pursue the psych pathway and am interested in doing a post grad 2yrs full time to become an occupational therapist. Mainly because of wider scope of practice. But I have two concerns. 

1. I’ve heard OTs are low pay eg. it’s hard to get paid 100k+ and there is limited career advancement unless u go into management or supervision. Unlike corporate which has more options. It’s also not a well known job since it’s more niche in healthcare. 

2. The debt to income ratio is almost the same since doing postgrad OT is 80-100k hecs debt for 2years. This will probably be the same salary I will get as a OT.

181tads,Fellow Career Switchers?,"
Ever since high school, I have had a feeling that I wanted to go into the psychology field to become a therapist. I even majored in psychology at my University, but I felt burn out so after graduating I decided to take a job at a fortune 100 tech company.

I’ve been working in the software industry for over seven years, and I am ready to make a switch. I go through every week or so talking about how I don’t like my job, how it’s on fulfilling, and even when I’m doing well, I still feel unsatisfied. For context, I am in sales, which has provided a steady stream of income for me. I think it has been a double-edged sword, because while it has given me financial stability, each year makes it that much harder for me to switch. And it’s not that I even have a lavish lifestyle at all, I live very modestly, but there is this feeling of comfort and stability knowing that there is ample money coming in.

Now that I’m thinking about switching, I recognize that this means quitting my job, at least after one year of school, because the second year is an internship full-time. Not to mention the cost of tuition, which can be tens of thousands of dollars per year. I find myself procrastinating and making excuses every year for why it doesn’t make sense to go to that year. The excuses range from Covid to simply enjoying my life and not wanting to make a switch.

Hi, I have a non-traditional background in my career as I’ve been working as a self-taught embedded software engineer with a math degree for over 3 years now.  I find that people in my industry are very conservative and can be quite mean towards people who do things differently to the norm.

181rguo,"Should I go into theatre, education, or tech?","  
I'm 25, have a bachelor's in Theatre, and have been working as a substitute/art teacher in NYC for the past 3 years. I don't know what the hell I'm doing or where I'm going. I'm truly all over the place and have career crises daily.  
  
On one hand, I could easily become a teacher. There's a clear path and I would definitely find a job. I consider myself a ""lifelong learner"" and I love teaching and helping others. But, the k-12 school environment drains me physically and emotionally. Also, pay isn't amazing and I really want to be upper middle class.  
  
My dream as a kid was to be on Broadway. I did theatre all through hs and majored in it in college, but when I was 20 I realized I'm a terrible actor and didn't have any motivation to get better at it. I switched my concentration to Costuming/Wardrobe and recently took a couple Costuming courses and certifications. I've also worked a few wardrobe jobs professionally. I love getting to work in the theatre, and I'm passionate about Theatre, but idk if Costuming is really my calling. I'm not like a ""Designer"" type like idk I was super motivated to go into costuming a year ago but not so much anymore...I think I would be better suited to playwriting? I love telling stories and reading plays and novels...But IDK how tf to do that and even with a masters degree it's superrrrr hard to make real money.  
  
Then, I recently started dating someone who went to an ivy league school for computer science and had a super high paying tech job. When I was like 10 I taught myself HTML and dabbled in it in HS. Now I'm like DAMN I should've stuck with it I could be making so much money. Tech/STEM seems like such an appealing field to be in; constant growth and new jobs, possibility to work from home, and it's possible to combine it with art it seems like? Also Idk I feel like I'm smart enough for it. Like IDK I feel like I could do it lowkey... if I really put my mind to it.  
  
Then I have another friend who edits trailers and makes like 150k and I'm like....that seems like a nice life too.  
  
TLDR; I love theatre, intellectual challenges, storytelling, history/historical costumes, and helping others, and I want to make like 150k +

181r97c,My job is taking a big strain on my mental health and I want to quit but don't know how to present it to my family. Advice? (tw for suicide)," I can't handle the job. When I go home, I do nothing the whole day except overthinking about what I said and did at work. I don't cook my meals even though I used to and now just live of off cup noodles and shawerma cause it's easy. I stopped walking with my dogs because I'm too tired to get out of bed. My house is a fucking dumpster now. I also started drinking even though I promised I would never drink alcohol (my dad and grandad are alcoholics). I only have energy to get up, go to work, go back home, do more work, stare at the wall for 5 hours, go to sleep, repeat. 

I do it only for my parents. And maybe because I actually have a good job with good pay and a lot of room for career advancement. I'm working for whole 4 months now. It's just not how I imagined it but I don't want to be a disappointment for my family or even worse, be a financial burden for them. Mom gets really angry when I discuss all that with her, telling me I'm a failure if I don't try for long enough and everyone hates their jobs. She would start telling me a sob story how her job sucks and I get it, everyone gets fucked in life and we need to do things we hate but I'm not sure if this job is the right one for me. And I really don't want to go through all of that for the thing I hate.

The thing is, I'm not telling her everything. Well, I'm bipolar (she knows that part) and already had a lot of problems with depression but I never told her I tried to commit suicide a few times. I really don't want to tell her because I would feel embarrassed and I don't want to make her sad. Anyway, I'm already planning my new attempt now. But I'm more afraid that I would have a meltdown at my job and would embarrass myself in front of everyone (it already happened in the past). When I told my family that my job makes a toll on my mental health, they tell me to take more of my meds. I don't think the meds help all that much. 

Also, I don't really want to quit since it's objectively a good job and all and I was through worse shit so maybe I can handle it this time too. But I really need a fucking break. Maybe a three month vacation. Or therapy.

181pitn,3 Months In and Exhausted - How can I preserve my sanity and energy?,"Hey folks. My job is in management for a retail store with a dozen locations around the US. I manage an immersive experience space within the store, which people purchase tickets to enter. I am essentially like a stage manager for an immersive theater show.

Full time job with benefits, pay is $30/hr in a large city. All sounds great on paper. This is my first time working for a corporate company, and I feel wildly undersupported in my role. Every day feels like a sprint to put out fires (constant tech issues, low staffing). We've had lots of folks quit in 3 months: 1 GM, 2 Store Managers, and about 8 associates.

My question is -- for those who have found themselves thrust into a corporate environment where it feels like the welfare of the workers is the lowest priority, how do you stay sane? While being an effective manager? It angers me and breaks my heart when the folks working below me are clearly burnt out. Most days we have folks calling out ""sick"" and whether they're lying or not the truth is they're sick of the job.

Example of the environment we work in:  we are often sent screenshots from surveillance videos of employees chatting with each other. Sent from someone in a corporate office hundreds of miles away. Talk about not feeling supported. IMHO, if employees are chatting in the slower times at work, let them!

It's retail so there's a lot of upbeat customer service energy, which can be draining.

181pci3,How to navigate a negotiation?,"Would really appreciate some advice! Cross posting.

So my husband has been interviewing for a position that would be a big upward career move. But there have been some pretty major red flags (at least to us). One, he is working with a recruiter in the process (not a temp agency) and filled out the application through them. He did find a listing directly from the employer, with the same title as from the recruiter, but a much more detailed job description, explanation of benefits, salary range, etc. Got to the second interview and was told that the listing they posted isn't actually the position he's interviewing for, and they just created the position that he is interested in. It's sounds basically the same, but they explicitly said it's not. So that was confusing.

Two, they discussed a salary range that sounded great. But he got an offer email today, and it's $8k lower than what was discussed. I know the verbal discussion isn't in writing, but it's still pretty insulting after they confirmed the salary range in their listing was the same one they'd offer him. 

Our thoughts: health insurance wouldn't start for 3-6 months. We get a probationary period of course, but thats a big range and not having insurance that long is risky and doesn't feel good. The range on the listing is 43k-70k, which is huge. They agreed verbally on 50k. The email mentioned with the yearly bonuses, his total salary would be around 48k, with a base of 42k. The only benefits that would not take effect on day 1 is health insurance, but there's 401k, pto, etc that begin right away. 

My husband has said his instincts are going off big time, but doesn't want to walk away without giving a counter. It still feels very risky even with a higher salary just based on the deceitfulness so far. 

So we're hoping that you all might have some advice for how to navigate this strategically. Thank you in advance!",electricladyyy,1,1.0,2,1700702371,2023-11-23 01:19:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/181pci3/how_to_navigate_a_negotiation/,11,2023
181p9hj,New supervisor makes subtle remarks and it's making me hate my new job,"I just started a child care assistant job and I've been placed with a child who is extremely hyper active and according to my supervisor, has undiagnosed autism. He's scared off two other employees before me. I don't mind working with him, I try my best to keep him busy but it's impossible at times. My supervisor knows he's hard to deal with but will make comments to the other employee in our class about how it's weird that the boy is just now behaving worse than ever, for ""some reason"" as they both smurk at eachother. 

Due to the boy attacking other children, I do follow him around the room to make sure he doesn't throw things at people. After my first day doing this, the supervisor said to the other employee, ""look, now he won't stop running because he thinks it's a game"". So I tried to fall back and not follow him so much but I stay close because he will whip things at other kids. I don't understand why she would want me to stand far away from a child who intentionally hurts other children. If he's a bit hyper active, it turns into the supervisor saying the same thing to this employee about ""if he's constantly chased, he thinks it's a game"". She won't ask me to stop, recommend a different approach, nothing but these useless remarks. It ruins my entire mood and I feel like they're always talking behind my back.

181o66t,At odds with current manager 's personality and management style,"A little over a year ago there was a division shakeup and my manager at the time was moved to a different department, and I was assigned a new manager who has been with the company for a long time, but hadn't worked in or managed a department that does what mine does.

The previous manager was mostly hands off. His style was to tell me what the end goal of some project or task was, and then leave me alone to accomplish it. I have a lot of experience in my field, and he trusted me. 

The current manager is a micromanager who wants to be involved in every minute detail of the day-to-day operations.

I’ve been directed to post here after accidently posting on /AusFinance

I’ve been struggling to decide between two grad offers:
- Deloitte - Consulting - Cloud and Engineering
- Westpac - IT rotation program

Both seem pretty good, but both seem to have their pros and cons. Deloitte I think will provide better training, but will have longer hours and lower comp by approx 11k (excluding super). 64k vs 75k.

Westpac will have more opportunity to explore various teams, but not sure about the training. Don’t know if they have a proper cloud team either. It will also have better hours compared to a consulting role. I’ve heard once you role off the program you get a decent jump in salary.

My goal is to go towards the Cloud or data and ML (my degree major was data analytics). But thinking cloud would be a better area for future career growth due to growing demand.

I wanna know how the teams are ans what people’s experiences are within each company and the roles.
Any insights and tips would be greatly appreciated.

After i started working with them, they discovered that due to sanctions i cannot connect to thier network (technical issue) and there is no solution for that case except to travel to country B and live there or they can try to get me a work visa to the company country.

During the problem investigation my manager asked me when i want to go back to country B, i said mayber after i pass the probation period.

In this case, am i eligible to to ask for a change in the salary/contract if they asked me to relocate to country B or even they got me a work visa (Country company is also expensive as country B).

181h88t,How do I tell my supervisor her management and training style isn’t effective for me?,"I’ve been at my organization for 2 years but about 6 months ago I accepted a different internal position with a different department. It’s a small department: a department VP, manager, then me and my two coworkers. One of my coworkers also transferred from my old department to this department about 2 months ago. Our previous positions were completely unrelated to this one so we both have a lot to learn. 

In the last month, I’ve realized it’s hard to work with my manager and it’s her management style that’s causing friction. It’s getting very hard to come to her with a question because she basically turns it around and answers with a question. For example; I answered a question from an employee in a different department but didn’t feel 100% confident my answer was correct. So I went to my manager and asked her what the answer was for confirmation and she asked what I thought the answer was? So I told her the answer I gave and it was correct. The interaction just made me feel silly, if that makes sense. Another example that recently happened; I asked for help on the wording of a report I was writing after I’d spent a decent amount of time and effort trying to do it myself and it just wasn’t working out. So I asked if she could help me with it and her response was for me to try on my own and then she would review it and give me edits. Which is typically how our work flow is. But the problem was I didn’t know how to word the report so how was I supposed to produce the draft for her to review? My coworker from my other department has mentioned she’s struggling too with her management style. She told her one task wasn’t a priority and she could do it later after they do something. And then turned around and said it was a priority and she needs to do that task to complete everything else. That exact scenario has happened to me, as well. 

Basically, how do I communicate that her management and training style isn’t clicking for me? It’s gotten to the point that I avoid going to her for help and either go to her supervisor with questions or my other still inexperienced coworker and I know I can’t do that for forever.",ARD-123,4,0.7599999904632568,1,1700680713,2023-11-22 19:18:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/181h88t/how_do_i_tell_my_supervisor_her_management_and/,11,2023

181gx6m,Career options for someone very burned out,"So, I’m 22 years old, in the process of finalising my last year in my bachelor’s degree. 

My story is as follows: 
I did not get admitted to the degree in a university that I wanted to pursue, therefore as stubborn as I am - I decided to take a gap year after finishing high school. During that time, I began working in 2 internships full-time. Mostly for university admission and enhancing my resume. Back then, a 60 hour work week did not feel like a lot to me (also because I really liked with what I worked with, which was mainly marketing for tech). 
After being admitted to university and the degree that I’ve wanted (yay) at 19, I continued working part-time jobs (mainly office/corporate jobs) for about 3 years. I genuinely thought I was doing a great favour to future me by enhancing my work experience and standing out to future recruiters. 

Long-story short, I’m 22 now and very burned out. In the past 3 years, I also have gone through some traumatic experiences which have led me to be diagnosed with C-PTSD, however I just kept ignoring that because my parents raised me with the mentality that “hard work and studying solves everything”. 
I also have pretty bad physical symptoms (daily anxiety attacks, hair loss, etc.) 

I only have one semester left before I graduate.
Even though I managed to build a good network, after all these years there’s nothing I want more than to take a break and focus on myself and my mental health. And I would gladly be unemployed but my family cannot financially support me. 

Do you have any full-time job recommendations that would not be stressful at all? Something that would basically not require me to put more than 35 hours per week. I would eventually move into a more demanding role, but I just could really use a break from this stressful life man:( 

My major is kinda hard to describe but it’s basically Business Informatics/IT Project Management.",Still_Captain6951,1,1.0,9,1700679897,2023-11-22 19:04:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/181gx6m/career_options_for_someone_very_burned_out/,11,2023

How do you guys think of purposing a trucking career at this age? The job I’m working right now is a delivery driver and i make about +23 per hour. I already have experience driving hinos, ford trucks and cube vans. But I’ve been thinking about pursuing either a az or dz license because I don’t really have much to lose. Other than my family I don’t really have anybody who needs my time or attention but at the same time I feel like it’s going to be a lonely journey especially If I decide to stick with this as a career. I never went to college because I didn’t want to waste my time doing a course that I wasn’t going to be too sure of. I was thinking about taking a trade (preferably welding) but I heard there’s a lot of risks and you’ll be able to work a trade up to a certain age before your body starts to wear out. I’m just pretty lost in life right now and I don’t know which career path would best suit me. I’m not an academic so anything that requires math or science is out of the equation. My best options right now are truck driving or taking a trade but I have this fear of living a lonely life without any type of social or romantic life because of the demanding lifestyle.

I got my masters at 25 and after 3 years in Middle office roles (Analytics and  Model validation), I got an opportunity to join front office derivative structuring role. In my last role in model validation, I was a senior associate and the new role that I accepted at a BB Investment bank is that of an associate. So, I have two questions:  
1) Did I make a mistake by joining as an Associate from a senior associate position?  
2) Is 28 years old too late to be an associate ? Do people normally make VP or senior associate by 28 years? If that is the case, can I try for a senior associate position in a year provided that I pick up the work well?

I work in cyber intelligence, something that doesnt exist in my home country..I want to return home. I have some health issues, and im totally by myself in the UK, i have no friends or family and its a sad life. But...my home country is quite different... There is still prejudice against women in certain roles, there is intense age discrimination. I am considered old for example...and there are no women in cybersecurity in general... I am too short and too old to join the army, coast guard, the local nsa etc And a lot of public sector jobs require you to be less than 35. So, i now have to reinvent myself, and find something else to do, if i want to make a living back home. I need a more 'feminine' type of career, something i can do by myself perhaps. None hires people over 40 there........Especially women in tech. What do i do? I could try for some public sector positions like clerk in the judicial system, the salary is 700euro...There is a lot of nepotism, so even those jobs might be given to people who know people. Private companies are a bit risky there, because you never know when they might fire you or close down etc. Ill be 48 in 10 years, none is going to hire a 50year old woman to set up their computer or advise them or cyber threats...

So, what is a career that would be able to give me autonomy, and help me land jobs in the long term? I wouldnt mind going back to college or any type of school.

181ehtl,Experiences with leaving a high-stress career for something less stressful?,"Hi everyone. I would like to seek some advice for how to possibly transition to a less-stressful job. I am torn because I know I most likely won’t be able to make the salary I am making at a lower-stress job, and I want to make sure I’m taking everything into consideration for my family (my health, our finances) when making this decision.  

I currently work in proposal management and there are so many short turnaround deadlines. This is not new to me, so I am not saying this as it comes as a shock to me, lol. I was burned out before I had kids, but now with two small children (two kids 3 and under) I often feel very burned out from tight deadlines more than ever. With my job and the deadlines, the work must get done no matter what. I’m sure that is very common, but for example if you’re sick, on vacation, take a day off or even time off for an appointment during the day, I’m constantly working early and/or late at night to get the work done, because no one else can assist because they are inundated with their own work and the deadlines are short. I’ve worked with tight deadlines for a bout 13 years now, and they are really starting to wear on me more than ever. It’s been so hard balancing parenting and working, even with a supportive partner. It’s resulting in a lot of anxiety, panic attack symptoms, problems sleeping, and concerns with my blood pressure. 

For those of you that have taken a step back and transitioned to a less stressful career, how did that go for you? Looking back, was the extra stress worth the possibly higher salary and did you have regrets by leaving? Or, are you happier with possibly less money, but less stress? I’m not sure what else I even want to do/can do, so that would be a first step for me to figure out. I would love to hear any advice or experiences that you can share since I’m feeling so stressed and stuck.

181egpe,Career advice - change from marketing?,"Hi everyone! I’ve been in Social Media and Content Strategy for 5 years now. I’ve lead the content strategies for our clients, created posts, created paid advertising campaigns and copywriting for website and email. 

For the past 6 months or so I’ve felt pretty unsatisfied and down about this job. I’ve expressed to my boss that I would like to move away from social media. He has said time and time again that we will start doing other things, but it never happens. Over my time (1 year 7 months) at this company, I’ve gotten a raise from 55,000CAD to 63,000CAD. I don’t find social media has been great mentally and it just gets so draining. It’s not hard work, but I just feel like I could be doing something different. It’s also a small business and maybe I’m being ungrateful for saying this, but my boss is always trying to get me to tell him things if he thinks I’m feeling off. Which is very nice, but I also like to keep my private life private.

181c1lu,Boss told me not to talk to CEO without their permission,"Started a new job a couple months ago and discovered my boss is fairly incompetent, but mostly harmless. The position is closer to home and significantly less stressful than my last so I mostly just let it go that they constantly miss deadlines and generally don't do much. One thing that's proven too hard for me to ignore is their complete disregard for responding to any email in under a weeks time.

I was out of office for about a week, and when I returned and started to clean up my inbox I noticed an email sent to me and my boss (and another dept head) from our CEO that had not been responded to. Not only was I copied on the email but the CEO specifically used my name when asking us to do something. I responded to the email apologizing for my delay in response and that I would connect with my boss that week to move forward on the ask.

My boss responded to that email, though just to me, stating we need to coordinate our responses to the CEO and that they'd follow up with me later. My boss approached me a few days later saying they didn't want me responding to emails from my CEO anymore, and I told them I wasn't comfortable ignoring a CEO email. My boss them said I should check with them first then before I responded then. I told my boss I was specifically called out by name in the email and felt it was appropriate I responded on my own. They then told me we needed to be a united front against the CEO because they micromanage their work. They flat out said ""I'm definitely gatekeeping this relationship a bit, I don't need anyone talking to CEO on their own it makes things complicated"". I was pretty uncomfortable and it felt like a response other than ""ok"" was going to push things in a weirder spot so that's what I said.

I've heard through the grapevine in the short months I've been here that my boss doesn't care for the CEO but not any details as to why. I don't have anyone I am close to here to share this with or ask advice but I'm feeling icky.

Long time lurker looking for career advice.
I've been working for the same employer almost 3 years now, with the first 2 being a solo remote worker while the rest of my team were US based.
 
I requested to be relocated to the US to be closer to my small team (it was 3 of us total) and also to experience life abroad, got approved and my company paid for my visa. 

Within my 3 months here there were a ton of resource changes and the team is almost entirely offshore now. I also had a few physically uncomfortable run ins with my new manager when he visited, who is now thankfully back offshore.

The main issue is that I feel completely burnt out and even slightly shunned by my new team - the stress is really taking a toll on me and I am considering folding, giving up and quitting my job and heading home.

The problem is I got sponsored this 2 year visa, and my partner was also just approved to have her visa sponsored by the same company but his application hasn't been completed yet. I am afraid of ""burning bridges"" but also mentally I am so completely exhausted and I cry almost every night. Its not a huge industry and higher ups tend to know each other, but I am thinking of leaving still.

Is there any chance of me never finding good work in the industry again? I've made peace with likely not getting to work in the US again. Should I tough it out for a year to at least use half of the visa, and would it matter anyway?

18179b5,How to know if it's your ego talking when considering refusing a job offer?,"
I've always dreamed or being a businessman but I didn't work hard for it, I learned how to code since I like tech and computers but kept stopping and didn't stick to it, in the meantime I took a job in a retail store and I've been there since COVID started, it doesn't pay well and the environment sucks (place and coworker), I've always been applying and spending my CV and finally someone called me and offered me a position as an IT support for a software company (they have on software for businesses which they always keep developing), the salary is better by around 100$ and with insurance, plus they said since I'm a developer I might movd to another position in the future.

In general it's a great offer considering my current job but I've been hesitant for two reasons:
* I could take another job and it's something new that I've never done before which is to design and deliver kitchens to people, it's not a stable salary, I'll get a percentage for every new client I bring (btw the team who build and mount them aren't very professional).
* Keep my current job and take learning web development again seriously as I've been saying to myself for the last 4 years in the hopes of getting a new remote job offer which would pay me in a mounth what you'll earn in year or a bit less with the new IT support job.

18114r3,How Honest should I be in an HR Meeting?,"I work in tech and I sometimes support the technology needs of people in my organization. It's not part of my job duties, but sometimes my responsibilities require me to take actions have adverse affects on users and I think it's better to support them where I can instead of giving them the number to the helpdesk.   


So last week was one of those times. A director in our organization made a serious error that could have put our organization at risk. I reached out before taking action to minimize her downtime, but she didn't respond quickly enough and I had to act immediately. When I saw she was active, I called her to explain and to walk her through restoring her previous state. It's an understatement to say she was annoyed.  


She took a hostile, condescending tone from the start and continued to demean me and make jokes at my expense because she was inconvenienced. She even reported to our senior leadership that I had destroyed her work over a false alarm. Throughout the encounter, I was polite and apologized that it was such an (necessary) inconvenience. When the issue was resolved, she continued being short and rude and hung up on me.   


I was so angry. The way I saw it, I was going beyond what is expected of me to help this person and in response, they spoke to me in such a rude condescending way and misrepresented the situation to a senior-level executive. I've been in the professional world for decades and have never had a colleague or manager speak to me with such hostility. It was unprofessional and I will not accept being spoken to that way. After confiding in a coworker, I was told this is typical behavior for this director. So I thought to myself, ""FUCK. THAT."" and a filed an HR grievance.   


I was contacted by a senior executive recently to set up a time to clear the air. The meeting will include me, my director, the senior leader, and the person who was an ass to me. I'm not sure how honest I should be. I'm anticipating a lot of, ""This was a misunderstanding"" or ""You misinterpreted her tone"" sort of thing, which I just can't accept. This person was an ass to me. She's been an ass to others in the past, but no one has called her out on it. What I want is acknowledgement and an understanding that she cannot speak to me that way. However, I'm expecting the senior leader to take her side. I don't want this person's actions to get minimized. I just want her to stop talking to people like they're garbage. So when she says, ""I'm sorry if my words seemed hostile"" or ""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding,"" I want to respond, ""This wasn't a misunderstanding. You acted inappropriately and unprofessionally. You can't talk to me like that."" Otherwise, I look like a fucking idiot who overreacted.   


On the other hand, I'm a mid-level engineer. I have very little time with the company and I don't want the rock the boat. This isn't the proper arena for me to make a point about how people should communicate in a professional environment. I'm just there to address the incident and get back to work. In that case, I feel like I should just be gracious and simply say, ""I'm ready to move on.""   


I know that was long, but I would appreciate anyone's advice. ",HauntedGatorFarm,2,0.5600000023841858,40,1700628608,2023-11-22 04:50:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18114r3/how_honest_should_i_be_in_an_hr_meeting/,11,2023

I made it to 20 final rounds but still received no solid job offer. Yes, there are people at my school, TCNJ - The College of New Jersey, who got top job offers in top companies and Fortune 500’s, but they are all white, rich, in fraternities, and racist. I, on the other hand, am an older, non-traditional Asian minority in a white affluent snobbish student body. I tried to fit in, but no one wanted to talk to me or help me. I was even rejected from fraternities. Furthermore, the graduates from TCNJ who major in marketing and management with a supply chain management minor or emphasis are all white and stuck up. There are no poor first-generation minorities like me who end up in those top internships or co-ops, making $60k-$65k and then getting top-tier $70k-$90k entry-level job offers out of college in the top companies. This is seriously frustrating. Excuse me for comparing and complaining, and being miserable. Aside from nationally recognized colleges like Rutgers, Penn State, Michigan State University, Arizona State, and others being well-known and top-tier, you have minorities and people of color who achieve the success I mentioned above from those schools because they are not racist and white. So yeah, just saying. Now continue to hate me and make fun of me. Honestly, every night at 4 am, I literally go in front of the highway outside my ghetto neighborhood and debate on standing there and letting a car run me over and hit me and kill me. Fuck my life.

Literally look up how many minority graduates from TCNJ working top jobs in top companies like Johnson and Johnson or Church and Dwight making $70k-$80k+ entry level and $100k+ 3 years later you will find ZERO people but you WILL find a lot of minorities from Rutgers Business School, Penn state, Michigan State, and Arizona State so….",ParticularNeeds5384,2,1.0,5,1700628136,2023-11-22 04:42:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1810zzo/same_guy_from_tcnj_whos_been_ranting_and_venting/,11,2023

180yz4q,How to handle management pressure for certification after refusal for a raise.,"So i have this dilemma that I keep going back and forth on, and thought I’d reach out to the community for guidance.

I’ve been at my current employer for a little over two years. Things are generally OK, but with my skills, background, and experience, I’m finding that my salary currently is below market value.

I’ve already sat down with my manager and had a thorough conversation about a raise, properly discussing responsibilities I could take on in exchange. I also noted how my performance has been great, and clients are satisfied. His response was basically that salaries are “frozen due to the acquisition” (recently acquired by larger company), but not sure I buy it. He rejected my request and basically said tbd next year.

I’m currently searching, but recently I’ve been getting pressure to sit in on an exam for a certification relevant to my role. I’m in the technology field within the Arch/Engineering/Construction industry btw, with a technical background. The exam from what I hear isn’t  terribly difficult, but also not something you can “wing”. it takes probably a week of prep time which I haven’t really had in my personal time or at work. Also FYI, not having the cert doesn’t keep me from performing job duties, it just “looks better” of course…

I’ve asked why this is required of me at this time? No response. My take is that they’re getting it from the top down as some sort of initiative. There are others in similar positions you have it, and many that don’t. Also, now is usually around the time they announce yearly salary adjustments, but have yet to hear of any (if at all). All this bundled with the fact that the holidays are nearing, and I’m just not mentally motivated for exam prep right now (I don’t mind exams, I’m a good test taker, just not in the mood due to family time and what not).

So in the end, I caved and registered for the exam. However, the more I prepare, the more and more frustrated I get that they’re making me do this now. I can’t decide if I should push back at this point and reschedule, asking whether there’s something in it for me here (given my past conversations), or if I’m being a baby and should just take it to show initiative (especially since I’m already registered). If it weren’t for the fact that I know I could make more and my request for a raise got rejected, I’d think less about it. I’m also VERY checked out for the holidays after a pretty heavy past few months with client work.

Also (to be fair) I’ve generally been treated well here. My supervisor is pretty hands off and good working relationship other than the raise convo, and my work / life balance is really good. The only thing I don’t like is that they’re OK underpaying me atm, and no clear roadmap on my advancement here. 

What would you guys advise for handling the situation?",Harry_Flowers,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1700621474,2023-11-22 02:51:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180yz4q/how_to_handle_management_pressure_for/,11,2023

-Guiding and explaining employees when forcing a new project on their plate even though 9/10 it's her job to do said project

- Managing people; she prefers to pay attention to the 1 thing done wrong and takes credit for the 99 things done right 

-insists on having a weekly meeting that she is always late for or rescheduled at the last minute (sometimes up to 45 minutes after the start time SHE scheduled)

-our weekly meetings are basically a weekly  performance evaluation with a lengthy list of everything that she didn't like and then ends by asking me ""do you have any comments about this day or this day- as in- 'you are only allowed to respond to these specific things and nothing else'

- she likes to love bomb the part time employee in front of me and on emails, who reports directly to me and showers her with compassion & praise to rub it in my face & belittled me in front of that same part time employee

I told her the issues listed above and that I feel disrespected & severely undervalued & she got a board of directors member who she is friends with that she dubbed 'hr' (the board member is NOT HR)
and said the board member was only there for her and would not be supporting me

180wiml,I don't know what's going on with my job offer,"I interviewed for a position in a county library back in September. In mid October I was informed I was ""rank 1"" of all applicants and would be contacted for a current opening. After a game of phone tag I was told I was being offered the job on a tentative basis, requiring me to pass a background check and physical. I got all that finished by October 30th and let the HR worker I was communicating with over email know that everything had been submitted on my end, and she said she'd let me know when she had the final results. I heard nothing for over a week, so I called the place that had done my physical and got confirmation that the results had been delivered. After that, I emailed the HR worker again telling her as much, just making sure that everything was in order. Didn't hear back so two days later I called her, who informed me that I was calling her personal cell and it was her day off, then explained that it's not an immediate process and just generally sounded pissed that I had the nerve to call her on the one number she provided. So I waited.

November 13th she calls with a firm offer. I accept. She tells me I'll start on the 27th and will be receiving an email with my employment information and everything in writing. I hear nothing after that.

Yesterday, the 20th, I went to the job listing on the site I initially applied through and emailed the person listed as the contact there, letting her know the situation and that I hadn't recieved any information, asking just to be sure I wasn't missing anything or otherwise delaying. She was out so I got an automated message. This morning she simply told me she forwarded my email to the same person I've been working with to ""see if she can help."" I have not heard from her.

I don't know what to do now. I ""start"" Monday but I haven't even been told which library in the county system this is-- it was mentioned Once before I started my interview months ago so shame on me for not writing it down I guess. I didn't forsee this being such an issue. Who do I contact at this point? It feels like the HR worker is pissed to even need to deal with me. I don't want to be a pest but I feel like I'm going insane here. Do I call the library I think I'm supposed to be working at and ask them? Who do I escalate to?? With Thanksgiving this week I already know it's going to be a nightmare trying to catch people at their desks.

I'm afraid of being a nuisance and ending up with the offer rescinded for it, but at this point it doesn't even feel like I have the job. I don't understand what's going on. I'm genuinely near tears over it; this is my ideal job, finding out I allegedly ""got it"" was so wonderful and now it's like they're just keeping it from me somehow. Can anyone explain this to me and suggest next steps?

180vwj6,37 [f] Trouble with manager. .should I leave?,"Hi, I am in a fast paced finance job and I am having an awfully terrible time with my manager. Without going into specifics, I don't think its me.. because I have had a few different bosess and many, many coworkers before this and I have never met or worked with anyone like her before.

Can you pls let me know if I leave, would my resume be a big red flag to employers due to job hopping?  

1st job- 7 years, multiple roles.. promotions, etc 

2nd job- 3 years, no promotion

3rd job - 18 months (recruited for the job I am at now).

Current job: 5 years.

If I were to leave now, would you consider this job hopping? While all of the jobs are in the same industry, they are not a linear progression.

Any insight would be much appreciated. i am also open to staying a bit longer if you think that would help my resume. ",Test15151515,1,1.0,1,1700612219,2023-11-22 00:16:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180vwj6/37_f_trouble_with_manager_should_i_leave/,11,2023

180ukgk,"I'm so eager to get my life on track (and stop living paycheck to paycheck) but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I feel like I'm not getting the opportunity?","I (33F) was recently diagnosed and started treatment for ADHD and a handful of health issues. Now that I'm getting the help I've needed since middle school, rebuilding my life (and credit score) is so much harder than I thought. Immediately aftering high school, I tried a semester in college, couldn't figure out why I struggled so hard and thought I was just stupid and lazy, so I never applied for additional courses. Almost every year since, I've job hopped entry level jobs in different cities and state - hoping something would keep my interest.

Now that I'm in the healthiest relationship I've been in, with 4 incredible pets, I'm finally looking forward to my future for the first time ever. I just celebrated my 1 year anniversary at my current job and my 3rd year anniversary of staying in the same apartment. I'm finally dreaming about a home with a backyard. 

Having been treated and medicated, I've gained confidence in myself so I've started to look for higher paying jobs in the same field (automotive). I've done what I could with repairing my credit but I still have a loooooooooong way to go. 

Now, I've applied to several different positions that I feel like I'm qualified for - but I never hear back from anyone. I know dealerships *usually* have high turnover. Is it my age? My job hopper resume? Is it my credit score (when do employers check for that)? 

I'm so eager to get my life on track (and stop living paycheck to paycheck at $15/hr) but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I feel like I'm not getting the opportunity?

180t0cn,How can I break into tech(no experience currently),"I’ve spent all my life wanting to break into tech but I never knew what I wanted to do. I’m currently 21 years old and I still don’t know what to do so I’m seeking help. I’ve always been a quiet laid-back person who likes to keep to himself. So when it comes to working I would rather work alone. But that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy talking and working with people. I have always believed that teamwork means that everyone is equal and when one person goes down, everyone goes down. 

When I worked as a team in the past, no one knew what was going on and there was always one person with an ego that thought they were better than everyone else. I don't have a problem working in a team. In fact, I would rather work in a team. But in a team, everyone should be equal. Everyone should play a role or work together and learn from each other's mistakes in the process. 

 I’m currently living in a college town with no real job opportunities but I’m planning on moving at the end of the summer next year. I’m looking to get into cybersecurity and the cloud but I’m not sure which job role fits me.

Can someone help me figure out what tech roles sound close to what I’m looking for? Also, how can I break into these roles? What certs are the most valuable for these roles or what can get me in the door?

Also, what are good resources to use to gain enough experience?",jay89061,1,0.5,3,1700604530,2023-11-21 22:08:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180t0cn/how_can_i_break_into_techno_experience_currently/,11,2023
180s7uq,Advice needed: Non-engineer doing IE role. What salary should I negotiate?,"Hello! I am working in the foodservice industry. I have been working for 6 months now and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business admin with dual emphasis in operations management and analytics. 

Let me just say, while I am not an engineer by education, 1/3 of my college courses were engineering classes because of the ops side of it. And they pertain to exactly what my new role is going to entail doing industrial engineering work. (Time studies, layout design, mapping, LM, KVIs, etc.)

While I am very new to working, I catch on quickly. I work in food service, not at NASA, so the work isn’t severely complicated but it is still engineering based.

Because I do not have an engineering degree, I will not be titled “industrial engineer” like the counterparts I will have soon. 

I will be doing EXACTLY the same job as these IE’s, just without the title because I’m a non/engineer. The salary range that has been posted for the IE position is 70k-100k. The role that has been posted for me (Analyst) has a range of 55k-80k. 

I understand engineers SHOULD get paid more since they went through the schooling and are more qualified on paper. So I am not saying I should make as much as them, but I do think it should be comparable because I’m doing the same work. I want advice from engineers on how much I should negotiate for. I am thinking 85-90k. 

Additionally, they haven’t found IEs yet, and I have been tasked with putting job aids and a repository together and to train them when they do join the team.

I have amazing public speaking, professionalism, project management, problem solving, leadership, training, documentation skills, and more, 

My friend who used to work here as an IE started at 78k in 2018, which is about 93k in 2023. So I think my 85-90k range is fair. 

I have considered going back to engineering school since I know some of my credits from my existing bachelors would transfer and shorten the timeline to obtain it. Though that would take me out of the field and awhile to obtain.

I don’t know if I could live off of that but I’ve been pushing back the orientation as much as I can. 

I’m waiting to hear back from my first choice which is an in office job, and it would be a big step for me because it would get me out of these crappy jobs.

My background is technical recruiting, but I've dabbled in healthcare, finance, and construction. This job will be hiring tech people but also manufacturing. I hired an embedded engineer once, but that's all.

My answer: I would look at the current employee profiles and job postings of competitors. I would make note of overlapping skills. I would look to see what schools and programs are known to produce strong, or weak candidates. I would look for any industry specific groups, forums/chat rooms or online communities to both find possible candidates but also get a sense of what they are looking for in a new role.

180m4kr,"Planning to study abroad, frustrated with current job and currently in a LDR - what should be my next step?","
Hello kind peeps,
Looking for some advice on my career  in context to my life situation. 
I currently have 4 years of work ex in HR and have been looking for a change (I'm 25F). Was enrolled into an executive mba program after my bachelor's so I didn't really do a full fledged masters. Plus with the current job market, it's very difficult to land a job at some of the best companies with great culture. Although my company is ranked well in different lists, I don't resonate with that feeling as my work seems quite meaningless and transactional. I have bubbled it up to my supervisor quite a number of times but nothing much seems to be changing. I want to get out of this situation and achieve a good work life balance doing meaningful work. I'm also in a long distance relationship since couple of years, so the plan is to be together quite soon, wherever we are. 
I'm planning to do an MBA - had started preparing for GRE since I was earlier in the deciding phase about the course that I want to go for. Now it seems clearer to me that I enjoy that coursework much more.
However I'm feeling lost as my significant other wants to stay on in India, and my plan is to go abroad for good. 
Is it too late to pivot my approach towards XAT, GMAT or other exams that will help me land a good MBA college in India? Should I still give GRE and apply abroad as well? 
Time for studying is scarce with work and whatever I do, I'll have to put all my efforts into that

180lbw6,Relocate w/o family prior to moving them next year?,"So I've found myself in a predicament...  
  
I have been presented with a job offer that is about $36k more than my current salary. I'd have to move myself and family of 7 (yes..7..plus loads of pets) about 11 hours away from my current location and there is no upfront relocation being paid out. There IS full benefits and a per diem split that will be provided on top of my hourly.  
  
The location is somewhere I would definitely move to and my brother and his wife already live there, plus some others that my brother and I are friends with. All of my kids are in school here where we reside currently and would either have to move to K12 (or other online schooling) or start at new schools in the new location.  
  
I am low on cash and it would be pretty expensive to move all of us right around Christmas time. With that said, I had considered maybe just moving myself at this point, making a trip back here every 2 weeks or so to see my family, and after saving for a bit, setup the move some time next year (probably around summer). We are renting the home we are in right now, so wouldn't have to worry about the sale of a home.  
  
I'm open to any suggestions or ideas on how to work this. I think the position would be a great career move and the money is very good. Not really sure who else to talk to about it so here I am, Reddit. \^\_\^;

180kvbo,Career change? Lawyer to hairdresser,"Hi 😄 I (30, M) will try to keep this as brief as I can.

I’m a corporate lawyer & tax adviser, which is the product of many years of straight A grades and lots of study in my home (EU) country. I work in London, UK and earn a pretty crazy salary. My partner and I rent our home and don’t yet have children/dependents.  

While I’m OK at my job, I’m not passionate about it. I never have been. I’ve always viewed it as a somewhat interesting means to a secure life for my partner, my family/friends and I. I’m fortunate to have a loving partner and good friends, but over my ~8 years’ professional experience I’ve found I can struggle to connect with other lawyers beyond surface level.

For as long as I can remember, genuinely, I’ve daydreamed about becoming a hairdresser and following my passion. But when I think about the practicalities of actually doing this I quickly become anxious and overwhelmed.

I’ve known I’ve been fascinated with hairdressing since childhood. My aunt had a small salon at home and I loved nothing more than spending time there with my mother and grandmother. Though, I knew they both had strong views that hairdressing is a ‘woman’s job’ and that my ‘intelligence’ would be ‘wasted’ in such a job.    

When I daydream lately, I find myself less and less capable of seeing the big picture, which is why I think I’m posting here. Specifically, I feel anxious and overwhelmed when I imagine ‘what would X think?’, ‘how could I explain this?’, ‘shouldn’t you stick it out for longer before walking away from a lucrative career’?

Any help/guidance for my situation would be so greatly appreciated. Thanks!",pj_od,1,1.0,7,1700583897,2023-11-21 16:24:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180kvbo/career_change_lawyer_to_hairdresser/,11,2023
180ktco,UPDATE: I got promoted,"I wanted to share an update on my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/vIyRNxdXdy)

I spoke with my HR ""people partner"" and she confirmed everyone who was promoted in this round received significantly less than normal due to budgets, the economy, blah blah blah. She said in Q2 if things are looking better, they might be able to make up the difference of what I should've received. She also noted she had been fielding calls all day from others who were promoted inquiring about the (lack of) increase.

Personally I don't believe the company will do anything for us in Q2. Companies know they have the upper hand in this economy and can put the screws to us.

Cons: Stagnant progression, low market pay, people are a little siloed

Job 2: Actually from a past employer. Pros: They reached out with a higher position and a track for money and progression for the next 5 years, very secure 
Cons: However, it's 2 days in the office and office is 1hr away and its more corporate.

180khrx,How do you respond to people commenting that you look too young for your job? This ONE worked best for me as a surgeon.,"As a surgeon who doesn’t quite age superficially, I needed a response that **builds rapport**, **displays confidence** while **remaining truthful;** after all their consenting to being put to sleep for you to cut them up in the right places and hopefully the in right sequence.  
  
My favorite: “It’s been a while since I got that! Thanks for making my day 😊”, here’s why:  
  
**Builds rapport:** By responding positively, I communicate that my self-assurance and competence aren't impacted by perceptions of my age. This subtly dispels any doubts about my abilities based on my appearance.  
  
**Shows confidence:** By embracing the comment positively you show that your confidence and ability is not easily shaken while removing any notion that your appearance may be related to your ability   
  
**Remain truthful:** The phrase ""it's been a while"" is ambiguous in duration, and honestly, who isn't pleased to look younger than they are?  
  
Being defensive is counterproductive and will only undermine trust with your clients.  
  
How about you? I'm always open to refining my approach. Share your favorite responses!  
  
Stay on the pulse guys!

We see each other outside of work, have group chats where we send memes, and etc. The two of them have known each other longer and are clearly better friends with each other.

The problem is that the two often ignore or don't even acknowledge what I say, whether that be in-person or online. For example, if one of them asks a question, both the other and I would respond, but then the two of them would continue on the conversation as if I haven't said anything. I also get interrupted often when I am speaking, which keeps cutting down at my confidence.

It's confusing because the two of them have helped me when I requested help and acknowledges my contribution and skills. But then sometimes they'd treat me like this.

For data analysis, I'm already using Tableau and Excel during work. But my skills are very basic. For Tableau, I only know how to sort and download data from pre-existing graphs. I think developing this skill would help me with L6S projects within my current role and might be helpful if I want to go into commercial excellence.
I learnt a bit of C+ back in uni but have already forgotten all of it. Computer science is very popular and pays well in my country recently. But there's a lot of different things to specialise in, and I have not done enough research to determine where to start yet. 
Some ex colleagues who left the company went into sales and regulatory affairs. So these are options that I might also consider.

 I am lost in life as to career orientation and goals, I’ve been lost my whole life. I’m 40m, married with kids now, have a stable job that I hate, which is the main crux of my problem. I’ve had half a dozen careers in my life. I was a barista at a coffee house in high school, I was an NCO in the army, a helicopter mechanic, a helicopter flight engineer. I got out of the army and got a BS in business/IT at a university. I’ve worked as a database administrator, a systems admin for CRMs, a data analyst, eventually I got out of that and got a journeyman electrical license and worked as a commercial and residential electrician for years. I moved out of field work and am now an estimator for an electrical shop.   


My problem is that I hate it. All of it. ABHORE it.  I’ve despised every single job I’ve ever had deep down. Growing up, when asked what I wanted to do in life, I never had an answer. As an adult, if you asked me what my dream job is, I wouldn’t be able to answer you now, the question “what are you passionate about?” means absolutely nothing to me, I don’t know what that word means; “Passion”. I have been in therapy forever with different therapists throughout the years, I’ve taken every skills and interest test you can imagine to root out a possible interest in anything, I’ve talked to multiple career counselors throughout my life. Nothing, zero help.

180dsiy,My BA degree is worthless and I have no passion to do anything,"Hey, Reddit! 

Honestly, I am not really sure what the point of this post is. Perhaps I just feel the need to rant or maybe there's someone who has had a similar experience and could offer me some hope and assurance.

After high school, I (F24) felt pressured into going to university because nearly all of my class mates did and I didn't want to fall behind. My parents had also been quite strict with me my whole life, which caused me to be very competitive and ambitious. Even though I was depressed at a time and didn't really know what I was doing, I applied for an English Language and Literature study programme at university. As a creative, social person who enjoys writing and connecting to other people, I felt like this could be a good fit for me. Also, I would make my parents proud if I went to university. Honestly, if it was up to me, I would have studied music production but my family told me that I probably wouldn't make any money.

Anyways, I received my BA degree in English Language and Literature in June 2022. I remember the university rector's words at our graduation ceremony: ""Your life is only just beginning and you have so much ahead of you now that you are experts in your field."" In that moment, I felt hopeful that I would find a great, high-paying job that would challenge me intellectually. I planned on applying for a job as soon as I have graduated, but unfortunately health issues forced me to focus on myself for a year. In June 2023, I finally felt healthy enough to start looking for a job - only to discover that there are no positions where I could really apply my skills. NOTHING. 

I know that it is my own fault: I should have done more research on this programme. Today, I know that there are so many people who have received this degree who are either unemployed or work in an entirely different field. I've spoken to many people who have dropped out and all of them have said that if you do not want to become a teacher, a translator or a tour guide, you should apply for another programme. I didn't know all of this back then. I was depressed and I didn't really bother thinking about the future. All I wanted is to get my family off my back. 

I'm currently receiving unemployment benefit, but it is not enough to live off comfortably. I'm lucky that I have support from my partner and parents, but by this point, I feel so embarrassed to ask money from them that I would rather starve. I am in a DIRE need of money, which is why I've decided (reluctantly) to lower my expectations and look into low-paying jobs. None of the positions I've applied for seem fulfilling to me in any way. 

In recent months, I have been to a few interviews for positions that seemed pretty great: for example, a secretary at a law firm. Sure, my role wouldn't have been anything impressive at first and had nothing to do with my degree, but the company said that I could learn and grow and if everything went well, they could be promote me after a while. After interviewing for countless dead-end jobs, this sounded amazing to me. For the first time since June, I actually felt motivated and interested, until I found out I was not chosen for the position.

It is now November and I am SO unmotivated to keep looking. I have realized that my studies were pretty much useless, because I feel so incompetent. It feels like didn't learn A THING in these four years - nothing that would help me get a job, that is. I am sick and tired of pulling on a fake smile and pretending I'm interested at an interview for a position that I don't really even feel passionate about. Even if I find a position that awakes a tiny spark of passion within me, I always end up feeling disappointed because I am rejected. 

I am at my wits' end. It feels like I am just doing something for the sake of doing something. I plan on going back to university and study Human Resources Management next fall as it sounds like an interesting field to pursue. This time, I have tried to do research: I have visited the university that provides this programme and been to a couple of lectures, which were pretty interesting. In my spare time, I like to read books about HR to prepare for university admissions. I am just praying that it won't be just another wrong decision. 

I guess my question is - is there someone who also doesn't know what to do with their life? How do you cope with these thoughts? As I'm approaching my 25th birthday, I feel like I should have it figured out already. I recently went to my high school reunion. As an ambitious person, seeing how others have already figured it all out made me feel like a failure.",FluidCoast,22,0.8100000023841858,50,1700561678,2023-11-21 10:14:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180dsiy/my_ba_degree_is_worthless_and_i_have_no_passion/,11,2023
180dhky,"Let me here your careers, looking for jobs to “love to work” not “work to live”","Apologies in advance for a longer post! Looking for some stories, advice, words of wisdom on CAREERS! First is going to be some back story and I will put ✨✨✨ around my actual ask! TIA 🫶🏽

Some back story:
After graduating from a challenging private high school (with a not so great but not terrible gpa) I (f/22) was faced with the decision of community college or trade school. I was bummed that my family at the time couldn’t see university as a possibility. I chose to go to a trade school, finished my schooling, and became a licensed cosmetologist in my state. I worked for a year as a commission stylist (meaning I was paid hourly and a percentage under a company as opposed to renting a chair or room and running an independent business).

Unfortunately after a year, I was having a very bad issue with my skin condition, eczema, worsening with the chemicals I was constantly in. I’ve since tried working with a dermatologist to figure out what I can do, done allergen tests. They want to start me on a medication but it’s been over a year since I did hair and I don’t have a flare up right now- so how would I know if it was working? At this point, I am worried hair isn’t the best route because I worry about the economy and how getting your hair done is a luxury, as well as my own health issues. And after the one year break from it- I am questioning if my heart was fully in it.

I’ve been through a handful of small jobs since I broke away from hair- but none have stuck. Server, Call Support Customer Service, Baker. Nothing is sparking my happiness, and I’ve been wanting to start running my life to love it, experience it - not just live it. Sometimes I feel as if I grew up TOO well-rounded, I feel so mediocre ”across the board” that I question what I should stick with. (We love that anxiety!).
I want to be happy, I want to provide to my possible future kids (I’ve always imagined myself as a mother some day).

I wanted to come here and ask you all about your careers. I know I am someone who is creative, who likes to learn new skills and who wants to help others. I’ve considered going back to school for the following: Writing/Editor, Language/Translator (I previously know Japanese and a bit of Spanish, want to learn ASL), Counselor/Therapist, Behavior Technician, Publisher/ProofReader, Makeup Artist/Beautician (Skincare). I’ve also considered going to school for Business to be more well equipped to run my own hair business if I stick with it.

I love to read, I love to write. I tutored younger children in my past, I babysat. I interned at an Occupational Therapy clinic for children when I was a senior. I loved being a stylist because I heard peoples’ stories and were treating them with self care.

Any experiences you may have- within your career you may think fit my ✨personality✨, any similar stories of going to school for one thing just to turn around and do something else, any online school recommendations, grant/scholarship information and sites. Preferably I’d consider an Associate or Bachelor’s type of schooling and career ideas, but open to hear all.

I hope this post made sense- I just think best by asking the opinions of others. Thank you 🫶🏽",char_izzard,1,1.0,4,1700560341,2023-11-21 09:52:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180dhky/let_me_here_your_careers_looking_for_jobs_to_love/,11,2023
180b4oz,Use a contract role to tie me over and then quit when I get something better?,"Is it bad to accept a 3 month contract with the intention of only using it to tie me over until I find a permanent position? 

Recently found myself unemployed and with it being a bad time of the year for hiring, I decided to accept a quick fill 3 month contract role. The role seems fine and it’s a good company, but I’m far over qualified for it and the pay isn’t good. So I plan to just use it as a source of income while I search for a permanent position with better pay & benefits.

Is it bad for me to take this role with no intention of staying in it or looking for extension? Also, is it damaging to leave the role 6 weeks or so into it? I’m just guessing that number based on the time it will probably take to hear back and interview with another company.

1809u0a,Leverage job offer at equivalent salary to increase current salary?,"In short, the title. Can it be done?

I am an academic holding an outside job offer. The job offer is the same salary I have now but comes with renewed summer support (equivalent of bonus pay in academia) and the COL is cheaper at the outside offer place. 

After deep consideration I have decided I am unwilling to take the offer and I ultimately don’t want to move. In this event, is it worth it to bring this offer to my current university for a raise based off of this? 

Im not sure if I have any negotiating power or not, but a raise is always welcome in my profession (academics). At the same time, I dont want to create any adverse environment or signal that Im looking to jump ship. 

Advice is appreciated based on the development that I don’t really want to change jobs at present and prefer to stay put. 

Let me add the caveat that I would be asking my university what they can do, not looking to play hardball. OR is hardball the only way to get anything in situations like these? 

Also, do I have to even tell my current job the amount of salary on the outside job offer?

I’m 28, burnt out, and DONE working corporate. 

I know exactly what I *don’t* want in a job, but I have no idea where to go next. I can’t afford to go part time at the moment and I refuse to be trapped at a desk all day. 

I am very good in an high paced environment, that being said I can get overstimulated and burnt out if things get repetitive . For example, I was a elementary school teacher and I EXCELLED at facilitating group activities, art projects and meeting the individual needs of my students. However I struggled with the tedious parts like grading, tests, data analyzing, etc. and I’m not naturally assertive. 

When I’m out with friends I am the friend that’s aware of everything at once. I’ll remember everyone’s purses, I keep an eye out for anybody who’s struggling, and I’m good in emergencies. I’m social, good on my feet, and innovative, but I am very disorganized and I get bored REALLY easily. I worked retail for a bit and I discovered that I really loved meeting new people and helping out in any way I could. Am I right in thinking these may be good career fields for me to try?: 

- restaurant/bar management/bar tender
- x ray technician
- conservation work 
- zookeeper
- back to teaching

At first ran a one person department, basically. Company really took off and started hiring. Despite being on the leadership team, I didn’t have much of a say in hiring and someone came in above me. 

Since then it’s felt downhill. Scope of my role has really narrowed. I get almost no responses on Slack. CEO appears to openly resent me 😂

I made a huge impact on the company in that first year and I’m upset. I’ve tried to hustle to show I’m still making an impact but get little to no feedback. More hires seem to encroach on my skill set, too. 

I confronted my boss about it and blatantly asked if I was being “quiet fired.” They assured me “no!”, but it definitely feels like it. 

Am I being too sensitive or are there some actual bad vibes here? Normally I’d just bail but the equity makes it tricky. My paranoid gut says they want me to get fed up and quit so they can take back that equity.

Career advice? I feel stuck. I know many ask something like this, but it's true that each situation is different, and this is mine. I hope you can help me with your opinions 😀

I have 5 years of experience working in the electronics field, where I've performed various functions related to the supply chain. I'm not an engineer, but I'm finishing a degree in business administration. Lately, I've been very interested in learning programming because I believe it's the future, especially considering the low salaries nowadays that don't cover much, especially in housing and food expenses.

I earn about $45k per year I have a small family, and I'm concerned that my income won't increase much because I'm in a field where the earning potential isn't high. I think technology offers the possibility of earning much more. So, I'm torn between gaining more experience in my current field and becoming a project manager—an area that doesn't really excite me but might bring financial stability—or learning to program and switching careers. At 29, I can't say it's my passion, but at least I feel I like it a bit more than what I currently do.

Sometimes, I feel like programming is just a trend, and I hesitate to take the leap, thinking it'll be very difficult. I also believe it might take many years to earn the kind of money people make in that industry. So, my personal motivation here is more about money than a vocational calling.

What would you do? Honestly, I feel a bit lost and stressed because at my age, I think many already have their careers well-defined and are financially stable. This worries me.

I got a bachelors in an unrelated field back in 2021 in a pretty good, accredited university.  I have since figured I want to pursue a Psy.D. For most universities, I need to have had around 4-5 foundational courses I did not take in undergrad. How do people usually approach this issue? My first thought was to re-enroll in my alma matter and take those classes for credit, without trying to  get a second degree, but I don't know if that is possible. Another idea I had was to enroll in the local community college for some of those foundational classes, though I don't know if I can do that if I don't intend on pursuing another undergraduate degree. If I just go to school, get those credits, and then get out, would that even count for the purposes of my application for a Psy.D? Any advice?

18063x2,Career Advice,"Hello.   
I have often been told that I am a great peoples person. I have a background in sales (mortgages) and currently occupy a senior leadership position in a company that owns and operates a chain of retail shops. My previous experience is owning and operating my own businesses as a solopreneur.   
My current contributions to the organization in my leadership capacity have been increasing employee retention (almost 100% retention) and finally allowing our sales force to grow. Along with this I have provided guidance to our leadership team on how to approach our sales ideology and processes and procedures. This has resulted in growing our revenue substantially.   
Regardless of all of this I am often referred to as the 'peoples person', so I figured I should see if I could get some guidance on:  
1.  what kind of skills I should stack on top of my 'peoples skills' ?  
2. what kind of career path might be recommended?   
I would also like to share that I would love to pursue Real Estate as a career - preferably Commercial Real Estate, as this was the whole reason I joined the current organization but due to the necessities of the company I took up a leadership position, however, due to the lack of industry specific knowledge I feel I could hire a replacement with the soft skills and the accompanying industry specific knowledge required.

1801jxo,Too early to start interviewing?,"
My company had recently announced we may be acquired or undergo a merger some point soon, but nothing would be official for at least several months. I’ve been a fully remote employee for the last 2.5 years at this company, and recently purchased a house where I’m currently located. So maintaining fully remote status is very important to me. 

I recently learned of another fully remote opportunity that’s actually also based out of the state I’m located in. I am worried that if my current company is acquired, besides potential layoffs, that I’d lose my remote status. I like my job now but don’t want to risk having to relocate unnecessarily. Should I wait things out or is now a good time to start interviewing?

1801fo8,"New grads, don’t make my mistake.","I’ll back up to October of last year. I was in my last semester of college, pursing a bachelors in business management, when I attended a college ran job fair. I met a gentleman that owned a branch of a nationally recognized insurance company. After a few weeks of speaking with him, I was hired. I would purse and obtain my property and casualty insurance license(for which I would be reimbursed for), and then pursue my health and life insurance license when I started working January 1st. 

Within the first week of work, I was jobless and down 300 dollars. My boss, the man I met at the job fair, had tried to commit sudoku in an attempt to get out of CP charges(that obviously no one knew about), but was arrested. His wife would not reimburse me for the training and testing since the deal was I had to work there 90 days, and I was given my salary for the week. I then pursued other opportunities in insurance branches in the area, with no luck. 

I turned to searching for WFH options, as it was now February and my lease ended in May, and I was living off savings. Finally, come April, I got two hits in the same week. Company A was a smaller SaaS company that’s product was a CRM for small blue collar businesses, and I’d be an account executive. Pay was generous, with OTE at about 60k for first year AEs. Company B was a subsidiary of a massive data company, and I’d be a sales development representative. Pay was below market average, at about 43k, but room for quick advancement. 

I thought I’d make the same decision of going with company B. After reviewing Glassdoor ratings, product ratings, and just culture within the companies, company B seemed like a safer bet. 

Fast forward to today. I still work for company B and I deeply regret it. Work as an SDR is not for me, and the work given to me is laughable. I am at the mercy of AMs and AEs to give me work, and they haven’t given me much. My numbers started off extremely strong, but have floundered as I don’t have work to do. The process to be promoted is long and counterintuitive, and im at the bottom of the list as there’s some SDRs that have been in the position for years. I’ve been applying to other jobs outside of SDR positions for about two months with no luck. I live at home with my mom, as after tax, 401k contributions, and bills, my income is laughable and bested by my friends that work retail. 

TL:DR: Hindsight is 20/20, but I’d like this to be a warning to new grads: don’t be afraid to take risks out of college. I took the conservative route and lost. If I had to go back and do it again, I’d got company A in a heartbeat. Even if on paper they looked bad, at least I’d have money and I’d enjoy my works bit more.",DelaySerious6967,8,0.75,8,1700520265,2023-11-20 22:44:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1801fo8/new_grads_dont_make_my_mistake/,11,2023
18019ce,How would your employer react to an inappropriate video of you?,"So I was in a fraternity in college. We would send crazy videos in a groupchat all of the time. I never sent anything TOO explicit however most definitely things that were inappropriate and extremely unprofessional. Lots of others would send videos of drugs, urinating on things, etc. I however sent a video of myself, blacked out, and the n word slipped out (not hard r and very clearly using the word to replace the word people). Though I completely understand this is absolutely not ok, and I am ashamed of it, it happened. As time has gone on I have distanced myself from my old ‘brothers’ as many of them decided to go down very different paths, and I have gone on to become somewhat successful. Due to me going a different route in life and I guess you could say ‘cut’ a lot of them off, it has left many to dislike me and or straight up hate me. That’s fine. Its life. But what I am worried about is one of them taking an old video of me and sending it to my workplace. I work for a large corporation. Though I know my direct supervisor would most likely let it slide, HR and Corpo is much different and to make things worse many of them are African American. I made a grave mistake in both ever filming that atrocity on top of being friends and associated with the people I was with at the time. I got into an argument with two of them the other day after they both hit me up to try and bash me, which I immediately shut down however I most certainly said things to them that would hurt anyone’s feelings. These are unhinged individuals that would love nothing more then to see me fail. I know im rambling at this point but I am starting to stress. How long would you say it would take for me to hear from HR and or my supervisor if they were to get ahold of this video from multiple years ago? What do you suggest would happen? I love my job and the thought of losing it eats me alive.

18019b0,WFH/PTO Denied During Holidays - Am I Being Unreasonable?,"I started working for a company 6 months ago doing ad sales. The job is WFH two days of the week and in-office three days of the week. I am by far the youngest employee in the building and I would say 95% of my co-workers are 20-30 years older than me who have been at the company for 20+ years. I was given a completely blank book meaning I’ve been playing the hunter role the entire time. The quotas are yearly and admittedly I am not close to my quota as I had to start my book from scratch. However, I did get a deal done extremely early on and I have a few massive deals pending with larger brands for the upcoming year.  
My manager recently asked me if I planned to take any PTO for the holidays as we have unlimited PTO. I told them I’m looking to take 1x day of PTO in mid-December to travel home so I can WFH for a week to spend the holidays with my family, and then 5x days PTO between Xmas and New Years for a vacation with my fiance. I have taken minimal PTO since I started and based on other sales roles I’ve experienced, I did not think this would be a big ask knowing things are slow around the holidays.  
My manager proceeded to tell me:

* No one else will be WFH during the holidays and no one else will be taking that much PTO
* It’s wrong of me to ask for those requests when I’m not hitting quota
* Management views WFH as not working at all, so rather than the 6x PTO days I’m requesting, it really looks like I’m taking 13x days PTO
* Christmas - New Years is the busiest time of the year for company which I honestly have a hard time believing based on my experience
* Lastly, they indirectly told me I’d be let go if I did go through with my WFH/PTO and they questioned if I even want to be working at the company amongst a few other passively threatening things

I was truly stunned by this response and I’m now left wondering how to handle the situation knowing my trips have already been planned and paid for.  
I take full accountability for assuming this request would be auto-approved. In my previous sales roles which were filled with much younger employees selling significantly more innovative products, PTO was never a major ask regardless of how close you were to quota especially around the holidays, but now I’m wondering if that was an anomaly.  
Still, I’m wondering if I being completely unreasonable in my ask? Should I really never expect my PTO to be granted unless I’m hitting my quota? Is this a normal response from my job?",YogisaurusRex,2,1.0,1,1700519836,2023-11-20 22:37:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/18019b0/wfhpto_denied_during_holidays_am_i_being/,11,2023

1800j8a,Should I quit my college finance job?,"Since August, I've been working at a small wealth management firm in my college town, working two days a week, but my experience has been challenging. Essentially, I sit at the front desk: work on projects, answer calls, prepare for appointments, etc. This place is extremely meticulous. We have a script for answering the phone, we document every detail of every interaction with clients, and we prepare cookies & their favorite drink when a client has an appointment.The work itself has been fine, but I frequently face corrections, even for minor or non-existent errors. 

For instance, today a client came to collect two calendars. I chose not to give the ones on display, intending to maintain the required three at all times. My boss got ill that I didn’t give him the ones upfront. 

Also today, my boss told me to print out a beneficiary update form and said to get with my coworker to show me how. My coworker told me what to print, but it wasn’t the correct thing, and I got in trouble. 

The other day, I was upfront talking with a client, while my boss was right behind me, and under his breath, he corrected me for saying the client's middle name instead of his first name. (the client goes by his middle name, but we were laughing about sharing the same first name)  
Moreover, today I was criticized for not adding ""How can I help you?"" when answering the phone. 

All to say, I understand that this is how the firm operates, but I'm tired of going to work and only having negative interactions. They tell me what to do, tell me what I did wrong, and tell me what other people did wrong. They are very stern, which adds to the pressure. While I recognize the value of this job in terms of experience and resume enhancement, I also work at my university's RFID Lab and am uncertain about a future in finance.

Given these circumstances, I'm contemplating whether to continue for another semester. I'm concerned about how leaving after just one semester might appear on my resume and wonder if this experience is representative of the broader corporate culture.

180098y,Tired of volunteering but can't get hired. How can I break this cycle?,"Hello,  
Complex situation here. I'm nearing 30 and I currently volunteer my time and skill to a consulting company doing a wide range of work from project management to IT database functions. I regularly work with tech CEOs, venture capitalists and industry leaders, people who I aspire to be one day. I enjoy what I do, its great for my resume and its in an industry where I want to be in long term. The problem is that I'm not getting paid for what would be an $80-100k job at other firms. This isn't the first time i've volunteered for no money.  
I've done similar volunteer work at a nonprofit a few years back doing again a variety of work from program management to fundraising/outreach to wealthy donors and companies. Raising 6 figures and still never being brought on as a paid employee despite rave reviews and exceeding expectations.  
Whenever I try to transfer over to a paid position doing similar work, I can never seem to get hired and the past companies i've volunteered for either never seem to have an open position or hire someone else which is concerning. Was my work unsatisfactory? Not to sound entitled but why bring in an outsider when I already have the experience and know the company quite well? I've always been told I was doing a great job and was an asset to the team. It makes me paranoid that maybe I'm incompetent.  
My resume would read like someone who makes six figures but i'm on track to only make 15k this year, ridiculous for a late 20 something. Too much competition, too niche of experience? At this point, i'm starting to reach out to connections for opportunities instead of the usual cold applying. I often receive compliments on my experience but again I receive offers for volunteer work and virtually everything else except paid employment. One even asked me to relocate to the UK to help with a startup concept with no pay or relocation assistance which is absurd. Of course, no one owes me a job but I can't keep doing this.   
The reason I take on these roles is to gain experience, connections and get my foot in the door in the industry where I want to build my career for the long haul. I'll still continue to volunteer for my company but I need to figure out to leverage my experience into a paid position eventually. I can't keep doing this and would like to be rewarded for the work I do. Once again, no one owes me anything but there are times I feel like a fool.  
I apologize if I come off as whiny or entitled. All I want is to be compensated. I have a part time ""gig"" job but that isn't a real career worth my time in the long run.",BossBoudin,6,0.8799999952316284,0,1700517408,2023-11-20 21:56:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/180098y/tired_of_volunteering_but_cant_get_hired_how_can/,11,2023

17zzs0l,How much sick time usage is too much?,"I've asked a similar question in here before, but I have gotten concerned recently that I am appearing to use my sick time too frequently at my job. 
I have a specific bucket of time purely for ""sick time,"" and we accrue a day (7.5 hr) of sick time every pay period (every two weeks). So, I haven't called out sick in two months, until today I called out sick because I was woken up in the middle of the night with a migraine and couldn't get back to sleep, was tossing and turning, having hot and then cold moments, needing to chug water and then having to get up to use the bathroom multiple times until it got to 7am, and I knew I couldn't go to work like that. I told my boss and she suggested I just take the day to relax and get over my migraine. 
Well, my issue is, it seems like I get these migraines from anxiety/stress of the upcoming week because this happens quite often on Sunday nights. I am worried that looks bad on me, like I am doing this on purpose to extend my weekend or something which just, isn't the case. I think my brain just gets overworked thinking about the upcoming week and I get stressed which leads to migraines. 
Anyway, another issue I feel that could be seen by my boss or my coworkers, is that although I haven't taken a full sick call off day in two months, (I had COVID last month but that is a different situation in my works eyes, we have to have 5 full days from our positive test to return so there wasn't much I could do in that situation) but I did come in late one day a couple weeks ago because of a migraine. I had a migraine when I woke up, and then came in like two hours later after the worst of it had resolved. 
Then, last week I had a morning appointment, so I was in late that day as well. 
I am just worried that these sick call offs are starting to accrue and look suspicious to my boss and coworkers, even though nothing has been said to me. 
I keep up on my work, and we aren't a place with hard and fast deadlines so a lot of what I do is kind of at my own pace. No one has to pick up my work while I am gone, I am a the single person that does the work I do so there isn't anyone there trying to get my work done while I'm gone. 
I just worry that these days look too frequent, and especially since for some reason these stress related migraines consistently happen on Sunday nights/Monday mornings that that also looks suspicious. 
I think after using an entire day today, I have probably around 60-70 hours of sick time still left. It rolls over into next year so I'm not losing anything come January.
I mostly am just seeking the opinion of others on how this looks on me to my boss and other coworkers? I don't want to come off as lazy or irresponsible or something like that when I use sick time and call off. 
Thanks for listening to my rant. I have had bad anxiety and have been beating myself up all day about calling out this morning because of everything I just explained so it would be nice to hear another opinion.",1999rc,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1700516304,2023-11-20 21:38:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17zzs0l/how_much_sick_time_usage_is_too_much/,11,2023

1. Background: I'm a 25-year-old software engineer from India with decent academics and a few years of work experience in the tech industry.
2. Dilemma: Lately, I've been contemplating whether pursuing an MBA, specifically in finance, is the right move for me. It's a big decision, and I want to weigh the pros and cons before taking the plunge.
3. University Choice: If I do decide to pursue an MBA, I am inclined towards enrolling in a top-notch university, either in India or abroad. The idea of learning from the best in the field is exciting, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.
4. Tech Career: On the other hand, I wonder if continuing in the tech industry without an MBA is a viable option. I currently have a decent salary, but I'm unsure about the long-term prospects without an advanced degree.
5. International MBA Aspirations: If I do opt for an MBA, I'm considering top 15 colleges in the USA. However, this brings me to my next point.
6. Self-Doubt: I can't help but question whether I have what it takes to get into these prestigious universities, especially considering my inclination towards finance. Has anyone here made a similar leap into the finance sector, and if so, how did you navigate the challenging admission process?
7. Market Conditions: Given the current state of affairs, I'm also curious about the market conditions for pursuing an MBA in the USA, particularly in finance. Are there any factors I should be considering before making such a significant commitment to a specialized field?

I would love to hear from fellow software engineers, professionals who have pursued an MBA in finance, or anyone with insights into the current job market and education landscape.

17zxlcb,Extremely stuck in childcare.,"I graduated with an AA in education a couple years ago, I didn't go further because it turns out I *hate* teaching. I knew it just from 6 months of field work - the system doesn't support you well, it was a lot of effort into these children for little pay, lack of career opportunities. I was damn good with kids and babysitting so I thought I'd be a good teacher but it was awful.

I graduated with just an AA and jumped right into my ""passion"", I grew up riding horses as a hobby, turns out that industry is much more fucked with even less growth opportunities.

So here I am, back to childcare. I'm a nanny now, and while I can potentionally grow more in this, *I don't want to get stuck in childcare.* I *only* have childcare experience and education and I'm very unhappy with that. 

I genuinely don't know other options for myself from here. I feel lost and alone and frankly very very stupid. I have no idea any other kind of job I'd be good at, especially with a resume that basically says ""good at keeping kids entertained for years on end."" Everyone irl says ""you have options!"" but can't tell me WHAT OPTIONS. I'm tired and depressed. I have no money. I don't even want to work, but i need money to do anything I want to do.

As a Ukrainian refugee who has recently arrived in the US, I'm facing some challenges in securing employment, I'm trying to gain technical skills but it won't happen within a week as it takes few months time to attain them so I'm currently looking for any job that pays ok , I tried to find work in sales as I don't see other role that can pay well without a bachelor's degree to support my family but being with a terrible cv and without a degree is hurting my chances severely ( it's so bad that I don't even want to create a LinkedIn )

17zvgx9,Being asked to do work outside of my scope,"I’m a new project engineer, 22 years old. I work with 2 other engineers. Our current job is getting close to construction complete. I’m going to a new site after this, and the other 2 engineers are going to a different site together. 

They are having me put together submittals and CDE’s for their site, which is really pissing me off. I can’t refuse though because I honestly don’t really have anything else to do. 

Do I just have to suck it up? I’m obviously being mistreated as “the new guy” so they’re just passing off the shit they don’t wanna do to me. I’d be much more willing to do this for them if I was going to the same site as them.

Speaking of, they keep telling me they’re trying to pull me with them, but I haven’t seen any evidence of that. They’re being very unclear about where I’m gonna end up. It seems like they’re feeding me with false hope of going with them to their new site so that I’d be more willing to do their work for them

17zvdq8,offer from small business (vs corporate),"Hello,

I'm an EA with over 20 years experience in the corporate environment (my soul has the scars to prove it). I received an offer from a company that has 32 employees total. It's a tech company that's family owned, not public and has been around since the mid to late 80's. The vibe of the physical space is very relaxed/industrial and for me, a welcome change from the 10k employee, bureaucratic nightmares that I'm used to.  I liked the people I would be working with and was happy to receive an offer.

However.

The offer letter I received stated salary and regarding benefits included:  ""*At the completion of the 90 day introductory period, you will be eligible for the following company benefits, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable company plans and policies:* ***paid time off (“PTO”), paid holidays, and group health insurance.*** *Please be advised that the employment benefits, offered by Company, and their terms and conditions, may change from time to time, with or without notice.*""

**First question:  Is it common that offer letters are that vague regarding benefits?** 

I replied to the offer, thanking them, letting them know I was excited about the opportunity, blah, blah, and I also, understandably, had some questions. The biggest question I had was regarding the type of healthcare offered (PPO, HMO, etc) and the employee cost (along with how many days PTO, etc). Along with answering my other questions, I was told that the employee cost was 50%. Well, 50% doesn't tell me anything, right? 50% of what?? Having only worked in corporate, I imagine that small businesses don't get the same deal from them but I don't know. ..I inquired as to what 50% actually is $ wise and they responded saying they will be getting back to me later this afternoon and also confirmed they do not cover dental. Wow....**no dental or vision coverage? Is that typical with small businesses?** 

Also....it states that my position would be classified as ""Exempt"". Typically administrative positions are non-exempt and I find this to be....curious. I won't have any direct reports, my work is administrative in nature. I asked in my initial response ""How much work time over 40 hours do you foresee..."" and the answer was ""very little to none"". This concerns me though since I feel like it's saying ""We want you to work really hard but we don't want to have to pay you if we do need you to work overtime"". I have a good work ethic and usually give 110% but this offer does not feel generous in the least and I can't imagine feeling motivated.  The exact language in the letter was: ""*Your classification under the Fair Labor Standards Act (and applicable state and local laws) will be that of an exempt employee. As such, you will not be eligible for overtime pay. As an exempt salaried employee, there are no set hours for your position. However, you generally are expected to observe our regular business hours. In addition, you are expected to work as needed in order to perform your duties.""*  I want to negotiate this status. I believe that if they want me to be exempt, then they should pay me more. **Does anyone have any thoughts/insight to offer on how I should approach this in my counter offer?**

The offer was $80k. It's about 30% less in than what I was making with base, overtime and bonus in my previous position. I was prepared to take a cut but....wow....this really isn't adding up. 

Any thoughts are welcome.

17zuq85,Some Advice: Pending Layoff How to Handle,"Bottom Line:  
My company, in the healthcare data industry, announced layoffs in mid-October, affecting approximately 35 employees with a deadline of December 31st. The parent company is absorbing roles, creating around 15 openings.  
The Problem:  
Despite my crucial role, I'm at risk due to my boss's demotion, and they're now urgently requesting me to transfer knowledge before leaving. It's a bit insulting to be asked to train others while being shown the door.  
The Question:  
How can I delay their requests without jeopardizing my standing, all while expressing openness to potential offers that might allow me to stay within the organization?  
Any advice or strategies are appreciated.

17zu4vb,Would I be a fool to take a step back in my career?,"I just landed a very well paying sales role in my industry after being on the maintenance/management side of it since graduating college 2 years ago. I've made a transition from management to sales in a very niche industry.  

I enjoyed being on the maintenance/management side despite the long hours and blue collar work that is required during the busy season, but I always had the long term goal of moving into the sales sector of the industry. 

I've reached that long term goal much quicker than I previously had imagined. I should be head over heels for this job. Great salary plus commission, company vehicle, flexible wfh schedule, and it's a highly competitive role in the industry I've worked all through college to be in. 

The reality of the situation however is that I absolutely hate it. I've relocated 5+ hours from my friends and family, and I stay in a hotel about 3 nights a week. I spend all day on the phone or in front of a labtop, whereas on the maintenance side I was outside all day, moving and active. I'm questioning whether or not sales is even right for me. I feel extremely unfulfilled spending my days staring at a screen and driving from customer to customer. 

I could easily land another role in the management side of this industry much closer to my friends and family. It just feels like I would be giving up everything I've worked for to move out of sales and back into management. Sales was always my end goal. Not only would I essentially be kicking this end goal to the curb, I would also be giving up a six figure salary and commission to make about 65k to 70k a year and potentially work more hours to do so. 

So that's my dillema, either stay in a high paying completive sales role and make a lot of money, or take a step back to the blue collar maintenance side which is less pay but much closer to friends, family, and personal fulfillment.",cruz6794,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1700502107,2023-11-20 17:41:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17zu4vb/would_i_be_a_fool_to_take_a_step_back_in_my_career/,11,2023
17zu4lf,Going back to school at 28 and I'm terrified...,"I've been working with dogs for the past 8 years almost and have just recently decided that I don't see myself doing this forever. I'm starting to not enjoy it anymore like I used to and the pay is crap (even as a manager) and keeping up with the rise of cost in everything is proving to be more difficult.
Money has never been a huge motivator for me because I live very simple. I enjoy waking up early and getting to work still, but I need to do something else. I want to go back to school to get an associate's degree but I'm terrified about failing. I didn't have the best grades in high school due to family issues and hanging around the wrong crowd of friends, but I did end up graduating somehow. I tried to do community college after HS but was too immature and dropped all of my classes and have just been working ever since.
I'm thinking about getting into the healthcare field or something similar where I can be active during the day. I could not see myself doing an office job, I'm used to standing on my feet for 10-12 hours a day and hate to be in one place for too long. Sitting for hours at a time is torture for me. I was thinking healthcare would be perfect for me because I'm comfortable talking to people and people older than me have always told me how nice I am and that I have an old soul. But after reading into it and other people's experiences, they get burnt out easily. I know every job has it's ups and downs, like do I want to spray and wipe down this dog's butt that just had explosive diarrhea and got it all over himself? No not really but it needs to be done because he can't clean it himself. Oh and he got excited and jumped all over me so now I have poopy clothes too lol.
I'm anxious about going down the healthcare route too because I'm not very good at math and I've been researching that you do have to take some math classes. Other than healthcare what are some other jobs that might be similar where I can be on my feet most of the day? Preferably that only require an associates degree.
I plan on talking to a counselor at my local community college after the holiday but I'm just trying to get some ideas right now!

I'm 28m and I am currently working as a Client Manager and have been in this role for 7 months. I absolutely hate this company and really would like to quit.  (They rebranded and almost 25 percent of my customers have cancelled). 

I graduated in 2017 and had a really good first job in Client Management and worked there for 3.5 years. I then moved overseas and took a couple month break and found a job in which I didn't like and ended up moving back home to take care of an ill family member.

Long story short, I don't have any debt, spend about 1k a month and have around 23k saved + 15k in investments. 

I believe I really need to take some time off to reflect and figure out if the path I am on is the right one. Since moving back to US, I have been living with family so I don't really have expenses (haven't lived at home since I was 22).

I know I ""shouldn't"" leave a job without one lined up but I've done this twice prior and didn't really have an issue.

My goal was to take Dec & Jan, exercise everyday, spend time with family, get my mind right and decide where I want to live, work and back on the path. I also recognize the state of the job market and that it could take many months before I land something.

With Molecular Bilogy idk what I could do. I am also flexible about moving to a different country, like US or western Europe.

17zjqx3,"Took 7 years to graduate with BS, now want to go back to school for different degree…","I’m pretty sure I’m going to go back to school here soon to be a Physical Therapist Assistant but feel a bit nervous about it. I think I’ll do it anyways but curious if anyone has done a similar thing and your experience/how you dealt with it. Or grad students- how did you feel about going back to school?

This is a long rant. I could easily shorten it up but too lazy, sorry hah.

I already have a bachelors degree and changed my major so it took me almost seven years to graduate. I’m scared over two and a half more years (2 years for the PTA program in another town a couple hours south of here and 2 prereqs this spring at a community college in the city I’m living in now). Lots of colleges and another move!

I know I could do it but I just feel partly bad for not using my major… and I know it’ll be hard to try to make friends again/have a life while I’m busy. Doable, but ugh I don’t want to go back and relive college years again. I am excited about the community college I hope to go to, it’s in a sweet town, but I just think about all the lonely nights in libraries again and stuff (could try to study more with others but I mostly study alone so I can concentrate better). Perhaps I will try to study more with others. I’ll probably make another post about this…

This is my background-
I started college in 2011 for dietetics/nutrition (wanted to do a gap year but parents said no. I could’ve but I followed along and did it). Think maybe that’s where it could’ve all been different hah. Anyways. I loved the college but it wasn’t working out for a cultural reason and if I wanted to continue the dietetics route I had to transfer. I went to another school and studied dietetics for a year. It was hard but I think I was excited. My mom remembers me saying I was lonely and depressed but I don’t think it was severe as I recall. I wasn’t getting the best grades in some of my difficult science classes and my dad wasn’t happy (he was paying) and I started on adderall (big mistake). Had psychiatric issues that summer. My mom didn’t think I should go back to school. She said I was depressed (but I was excited to go) and I think she thought the location was too isolated (but I loved it). I ended up taking three years off college… worked different jobs and then finally decided to go back to school. Was going to continue with nutrition but last minute decided on economics so I could help change the food system… I graduated in 2020 with my degree in economics but didn’t enjoy studying it and have hardly sought out jobs in that field. I chose Agricultural Economics. Kind of a mistake but I learned a lot of interesting stuff so I try not to regret it. Actually ended up hating it so I switched to their other major “Natural Resource and Environmental Economics” just so I could survive the last two semesters (and didn’t take me any longer to graduate) because at least I’m passionate about the environment even though I had no interest in that career field. I do find it interesting now though but really don’t care to go into it… I was having so much back pain just from sitting all the time (despite getting up to walk and biking to school and stuff). I felt isolated and just unhappy.

I had some fun doing other jobs since college like ski instructing and other stuff. Been broke though and ready to make more money in something that interests me. It’s been three years now since I graduated and haven’t gone into economics.

So, I’ve been considering some careers where I can be up from a desk at least half the time, make decent money, and help something directly (people/animals/the environment/etc.). Economics could help but it felt so far removed. I am not a huge gym-goer but I like to be active so I am considering being a PTA, plus I’ve gone through an injury myself and think it would be great to help others.

I’ve also applied to be a PT aide and plan on shadowing more to make sure it’s what I want to do… Prereq classes would start this Jan. Hopefully I’d be done with the PTA program by Spring 2026…

Anyways, this is way longer than I meant it to be but if anyone has made it this far… what do you think, stranger?",BreadfruitOpposite49,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1700468257,2023-11-20 08:17:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17zjqx3/took_7_years_to_graduate_with_bs_now_want_to_go/,11,2023
17zj72n,I want a change and need some direction.,"Quick Bio to start: 

30s. No Degree. I have a couple years of college courses, a decade of on the job training, continued education through industry associations. I can learn. There’s not a role or task or job I have failed at. I’ve worked my way up from the bottom for a handful of  small businesses. 

I am a title professional (Landman), almost ten years in oil and gas providing mineral / leasehold title, land/leasenegotiations and regulatory services as a contractor. 

I’ve had ups and downs with downturns, layoffs and Covid. I have been working for the same oil and gas land services broker for about 7 years with a gap during Covid where I filled the gap by working for a large mortgage company. I have survived downturns, had work when others I knew from the industry didn’t and have hardly missed a billable day for 10 years (excluding Covid). 

I need a career change. I’ve seen what this job has for me. I’ve done it. I want something more interesting. Not fulfilling. I don’t think work is going to make me happy. I just don’t want to resent and feel like what I’m doing is entirely pointless. And not to be political or woke, but having to work with an industry of Trumper toolbags is not fun. It’s like asshole central. 

But my lack of a degree is keeping me out of the doors. And pretty much nobody I have interviewed with has ever heard of my job. And I have a hard ass time getting interviews. Nobody seems to respond to my applications. 

Pre Covid a highschool friend of mine with only an associates was in software doing implementation/onboarding for their new clients. He got me an interview. I didn’t even have to apply, I had never studied for an interview prior, I put a lot into it and got down to the wire. A guy with 20 years experience got the job. It was a heartbreaker. But it made sense. I would have killed it at that job. I don’t interview well, but I was answering and asking all the right questions. The CEO was giving me compliments but explained why she had to take the other guy. I had no business and have no business on paper getting an interview let alone getting to the final spot. But it was a perfect job for me. 

No, I have no friends with “ins” I’m not a networker. I don’t have a large circle. I just know I can do things that aren’t on my resume. Not just software or analysis, but I can do anything once I’m in the chair. But I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs without response in the last ten years. I make okay to decent money. So it’s not all bad, but I’m on a bullshit contract and making less than I was pre Covid. I should be making at least $90-$100k. 

I have a kid now and I’m just afraid I’m stalling out professionally when I feel like I can do much more I just can’t find that opportunity.",EntrepreneurFunny469,1,1.0,0,1700465863,2023-11-20 07:37:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17zj72n/i_want_a_change_and_need_some_direction/,11,2023
17zj33k,question concerning future career pathway (17),"hello reddit. i am to a large degree uncertain about what career trajectory i want to orientate myself into. have opted to study Economics and political science with additional law classes for my first year of tertiary study as I suspect this will give the greatest degree of variance among the serious humanities subjects. And although nothing has crystallized, it is a long-term aspiration to acquire a job working for the government, and or in some business/firm or intuition in the capacity of a zoom-powerpoint officer worker, who hopefully is able to work remotely.  
I feel as though the covid lockdowns have to some degree exposed the somewhat redundant character of a lot of desk/powerpoint office centric jobs, i quite frequently see how people were able to work in a concentrated manner for 2-3 hours or less and found their workflow/productivity to be unimpeded. i understand that this is probably exaggerated by the internet but i think you get the point. what would the optimal degree/carrier selection B for acquiring a basically fake degree/ ostensibly breezy job, something like a eg. psychology/therapist but with a greater degree of certitude as regards being able to land a position comfortably, or just any office job which where ur not daily working your fingers to the bone. Is such a thing realistic?  
I get it's probably not going to be a ‘one size fits all’ answer, but is there a particular area of business/ the corporate world or position in the state bureaucracy I should seek to orient myself towards, HR? Or some bureaucratic job? As i am quite unsure. Also i am to a large degree dispassionate about the major/minor course choices, so if they are really not optimal for maximizing carrier opportunities in these fields what would you suggest as an alternative.

17zhpc0,"Need your advice on selecting a Country and a University, End Goal is US and IB","Hi Guys,

  
I really need your expertise on this matter. I'm from Sri Lanka, I'm 19 and I'm a final year undergrad student (BSc Hons Software Engineering). Moreover I secured a job as a Junior Financial Analyst at a firm in Sri Lanka (They invest in US). My goal is to become an investment banker at a top US investment bank. But I know that it's hard to get into IB without having a degree from a prestigious university. And right now I'm not capable of enrolling in a prestigious university because of the financial barrier. So my plan is to pursue a MS in Finance in a other country, in a some what well ranked University, then I wanna break into IB in that country, get some experience, save some money. Then I would like to enroll into a MBA at a top US university and move into US. 

  
1. So now I need your opinion on this plan of mine. And I need your help choosing a University to do my Masters. So I was first thinking about Australia, and I was thinking about doing my Masters in a University like Deakin(#233) or Swinburne(#285). The problem with these are, they are expensive for me. The full course fee (For the two years) is more than 80,000AUD (52396$). It's extremely expensive for me as an international student. 

  
2. My second option is Japan. This is where things get interesting. My father worked in Japan for six years. So he's comfortable there and he can some with me and help me find money for the tuition. So if I were to move into Japan for my masters, my plan is to get into the Top Universities in Japan, such as the Waseda University(#199). It's one of the most elite and prestigious Universities in Japan. And it's affordable compared to Australia, and the total course fee for the two years is 3,826,000¥ (25,674$) . And compared to Australia, Japan has a huge financial sector with banks like JP, Goldman operating.   


3. And my third option is UK. I defo can't get into UCL, LSE, KCL cause of the cost. UK differs from other countries cost, the duration of their MS programs are usually one year. So I was looking at Durham and it's 33,000£ (41204$). And Of course UK has one of the best financial sectors.   


4. As the fourth option I'm thinking about Canada, but right now I don't know the affordable but well-ranked Unis in CA. I haven't looked into that yet.

  
So this is my situation, I need your feedback on this overall plan, and the Universities I have in my mind. Moreover what other countries and Universities do you recommend for me considering my financial situation. My end goal is US and IB.   
Thanks.

17zhncv,Career for someone who can't stand being at work 8+ hours a day.,"Title basically says it all.

I'm done with the traditional American 9-5 (or 7-3:30 in my case currently), 40+ hour per week job model. They promise you a 2 week vacation per year, however most times I don't even get that far without losing all interest and quitting the job.  I'm technically oriented and creative, and when something peaks my interest I can have a huge drive to get it done. I just cannot stand being tethered to the same spot for 8-10 hours, and my mental focus basically drops to zero after \~4 hours (This has been a source of tension for a few bosses and there's honestly not much I can do about it; I've tried). I like having maximum flexibility and having some control in my schedule and not having too many days the exact same.  


I've had contract jobs before and I always preferred them since I know it has an end date.

I was an electrical apprentice for 3 years but the 50+ hour week grind (and commute) was too much and I ended up changing to something else. The work itself was not bad.

17zcxju,Resource for those looking into changing careers,"Hey career advice community.  I’ve been lurking for a while and noticed a lot of questions about feeling stuck and not knowing which career is right for them.  Quite a few of these posts go unanswered and a lot of the career specific questions could be found on onetonline.org, which is a U.S. government provided resource with information on jobs.    
There’s a massive amount of information on there so I figured it might be useful to have an app that quickly surfaces this info.  I’ve building out this side project on the weekends- the app is connected to the onetonline resource and surfaces the info on all of the jobs listed there.  You can also chat with an AI counselor to see if it’s the right career for you.  
Lumisapp.com  
It’s completely free and I plan on keeping it that way.  I believe that everyone has the right to work on what they love so I’m currently paying for the hosting + AI.  I might need to introduce a donation feature in the future if this gets too expensive.  The data is hosted on Microsoft databases and will not be sold.  
Hopefully this helps!

17zcx3o,Concerns Regarding Job Offer Acceptance and Confirmation,"I received a job offer from a company a week ago, which made me very happy. The recruiter sent me the offer letter, and after signing it, I returned it to them. The process has now progressed to the payroll team preparing my official confirmation letter. However, after a week of excitement, I find myself entering a state of apprehension. It's kinda denial stage.

My concern lies in the possibility of being rejected due to some internal change or unforeseen circumstance. Is it possible for an offer to be rescinded after signing the offer letter, or does signing it ensure a 100% confirmation of the position? It's worth noting that my anticipated start date is 40 days from now.

I appreciate any insights or clarification on this matter. Thank you.",amyxpond,3,1.0,3,1700444007,2023-11-20 01:33:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17zcx3o/concerns_regarding_job_offer_acceptance_and/,11,2023
17zbxxt,STOP Wasting Time Networking with Managers and Executives. Here’s Why You Should Network “Bottom-up”,"Forget about trying to impress top executives right off the bat. Here's why and how networking ""bottom-up"" is the secret to building sincere connections and unlocking career-defining opportunities at networking events. 

1) Connect with Junior Staff

Begin by engaging with the junior staff of the executives you aim to network with. They're often overlooked at networking events and are eager to converse. Remember, the most interesting person isn't the one monopolizing the conversation, but the one who asks compelling questions.

2) Build Trust and Credibility

Once you've established a rapport, ask about their training and politely request an introduction to their supervisor. This voluntary introduction allows you to win trust and credibility even before you speak to someone higher up the ladder.

3) Leverage Your New Connections

Next, use the information and insights you've gained from your conversations to connect more effectively with the next person up the ladder.

4) Climb the Networking Ladder

Ask for further introductions until you reach the level you're aiming for. 

Most networking conversations last just about 5 minutes. By strategically chaining these interactions, you can forge meaningful connections within an hour. 

Even though you might only be thinking about networking the the big shots, for me it was the peers that became genuine friends who helped each other along the way.

Stay on the pulse guys! 💪

17zbcp2,"Chef feeling stuck, wanting a change. Am I complaining for no reason?","I (34m, USA) have been working in restaurants since I was 15 years old. The usual work-your-way-up-the-ladder thing: dishwasher>prep>salads>hot line>sous & chef. I never liked formal education and always responded well to a challenge, especially if someone thought I couldn't do it. I started working in the pastry kitchen simultaneously to gain knowledge, loved it, and that lead to climbing the pastry ladder to the point where I have worked internationally at some of the best hotels & patisseries in the world at an executive level. That job is not in high demand everywhere but when you find a place that needs someone experienced in making fancy European pastries at high volume, they roll out the red carpet for you. 

Roughly six years ago, I decided to try my luck with my own business and partnered with a restauranteur to supply restaurants & cafes in my home town as a wholesale service. I poured everything I had into it but, in an industry where the margins aren't the best to begin with, I have felt more and more squeezed by costs every year. Since losing my most recent sous chef I am now the only employee and still I struggle to pay myself most times ($40k annually, not great.) For the first time in my life I have debt ($8k on a company card; I have always been extremely careful with money, a trait I inherited from my dad who grew up very poor). Personally my wife and I are comfortable; we own a house and have plenty saved for a rainy day, but the fact that profits seem so scarce doesn't make me want to invest more of my own cash, let alone take on a shitload of new debt. 

So the situation is this: Barring a major investment on my part, I am sensing that the business is not long for this world. My partner is checked out (they are independently wealthy and are too busy buying new cars or jetting off somewhere to be of any help). I am exhausted by years of stress and sacrifice, always being on call for orders, etc. I don't want to pick up and move again for a good job, and I feel somewhat burned out with the industry. There are only 1-2 really well-paying jobs in my town doing what I do and the people who have them never leave. 

I want to find a career I can transition into where my skills will be put to good use, but in more of a white-collar setting. Ideally this job will have better pay, and a better work-life balance or WFH. We are expecting to have kids soon and I want to be around to spend lots of time with them. What are some careers well-suited for a highly self-motivated person that would only require a certification of some kind (I am not doing a four-year degree at this point).

Thanks to anyone who read this whole thing. I realize it's a weird one, and more of a rant than anything. Am I whining for no reason? Do I actually have a good thing going and should continue to invest in it? I can't tell. Maybe it's insecurity from only ever working in restaurants, but since hitting my 30s I have been longing for a 'grown-up' career where I can come home to family dinners and won't be covered in cuts and burns each day. Appreciate any opinions.

17zb17q,Boss has paid me in cash the past two paychecks,"Hello all, just looking for some possible insight to my current situation. My employer the past two paychecks (biweekly - month of pay) has paid me in cash at a rounded amount vs direct depositing my funds into my account with taxes taken out. I asked him as to why he's paying me in cash & he's claiming he's having issues with his payroll system and/or the agency that handles his payroll. The first time this happened (a month ago), I had to inform him that my paycheck did not arrive in my account on that Friday morning & if he could look into it. He said he would & was apologetic blah blah. I still went to work, did what I was supposed to & didn't bring it up. Fast forward that afternoon; he hands me a wad of cash & apologizes for the delay. Stated that I could wait until that following Tuesday to get paid direct deposit if I wanted to, but being that payroll has been sort of shaky since my day one of starting there; I accepted his cash offering & was just glad that I was paid for my labor. In that same conversation I was told that payroll would be squared away for the following check(s) & everything would be fine.  
Fast forward a week & a half later (Wed); I asked him if payroll would be alright considering what happened the previous paycheck (payday being that coming Friday). Told me that it would, but that ended up not being the case. He actually paid me on Thursday with another wad of cash in similar amount; with the same explanation. I took the cash because I want to get paid for my labor, but it's  rubbing me all types of wrong. It's better than not getting paid at all or 'waiting for payroll to get squared away' but it is rubbing me all types of wrong. My Google search resulted that it might have to do with avoiding their employer tax obligations & avoiding the possibility of having to sign up for worker's compensation insurance. Idk, it feels off. Maybe the payroll/payroll agency is difficult to deal with. Whatever it reason is; it has me rather uneasy.

17z9b0f,softboy looking for help :),"hello, i am a 17 year old softboy. if you don’t know what softboys are, google it. i’m not talking about this: 

“Similar to a f\*\*\*boy but without the cocky attitude.”  

i mean this: 

“a soft boy or « soft boi » is a guy who usually dresses with baggy clothes such as oversized flannel shirts, baggy pants or mom pants, oversized sweatshirts and jackets. they like light colors like beige, light blue, light brown, white, light green but can sometimes also wear colorful colors. the shoes they usually wear are converses (vintage or classic), nikes (air jordan mid or air force one) and vans (old school).  
their music taste is very different. they usually like calm songs but they can also listen to styles like hard rock, indie rock, classic rock.. they usually listen to less mainstreamed artists like conan gray, rex orange county, the neighborhood, frank ocean but also vintage bands like the 1975, the strokes…  
in terms of personality they can seem distant and shy at first but they’re actually really cool people when you really get to know them. it’s never boring when you’re having a conversation with them. they will usually hang out with a big friend’s group that is diverse in terms of gender. they usually like skating.  
unlike the fuck boys who like dark colors and are usually toxic, soft boys will date you for your personality rather than your body and are really caring. unlike fuck boys, they’re loyal and respect women lol.”

17z91hd,WFH to hybrid,"Hi everybody, my current job has offered me a new position in the company which comes with around a 17k pay raise. The only downside is for some reason this team works a hybrid schedule of working two days in office, as the manager feels it’s important to still have face to face interaction. I have been fully remote since COVID when my company decided to go permanently remote so this just a team specific thing.

I’m hesitating to take the position just because of the hybrid issue, even though the pay raise would be incredible. I don’t know if I want to start commuting again living a 30 minute drive each way from the office. I’m curious if anyone has gone from WFH to a hybrid and what your experience has been? Was the adjustment tough?

TIA for any responses or advice. I do want to take this role, just concerned that if I’m already weary about going hybrid I might regret my decision.",Apprehensive_Bed_401,1,1.0,0,1700433269,2023-11-19 22:34:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17z91hd/wfh_to_hybrid/,11,2023
17z8joq,Should I send correction Thank You email?,"So I've sent my thank you email yesterday on Saturday after proofreading it multiple times, particularly the body text which is all good. However, it was only today that I noticed that in the email title, I misspelled my first name and said ""Thank"" instead of ""Thank You.""

So instead of this title (w/ a fake first name instead of my real name as example):

""Victoria [Last name] - Thank You for the Interview""

I ended up sending this title:

""Vicctora [Last Name] - Thank for the Interview""

The only saving grace is that my interview was on Friday and dental clinic doesn't open on weekends, so I'm hoping that the interviewer, wbo is the office manager, doesn't check it over the weekend.
I'm going to try to recall the email, but in the event it doesn't work, should I send another email with the corrected title, an emaik explaining the error, or leave it alone?

For additional context, the position is a dental receptionist and I've done two interviews, both of which went really well where there was a good rapport between me and the interviewer, so much so she actually commented that some of my responses were quite impressive, so it gives me hope.

17z7c6l,"(29M) Feeling like I failed to ""launch"". Any advice beyond the generic stuff ?","Like most of the general population, I attend public school K-12. I was constantly made to feel like I was not socially or academically equipped in comparison to my counterparts practically every grade level by my teachers, my academic counselors and the school psychologists. So naturally, upon completing high school, my fundamental educational experiences at that point had left me bitter, angry and resentful and unmotivated to attend college/university. 

  
This led to feelings of low self-esteem and what felt like consistent low to moderate grade depression. But after living with my parents for the next four years functioning in life aimlessly, and working dead-end jobs, at the age of 22 I had an “awakening” and realized I needed to get my shit together fast. I harnessed all of the time and energy I had spent living without any sense of purpose or direction in life into something more useful, and I decided to enroll in college in 2017. 

  
Since then, I’ve relocated, transferred schools and reached junior-level status at my current institution with 30 credits left to go. I even joined the military as a reservist before moving to my current state and have two years of service under my belt now. It’s inconvenienced me at times and affected my lacking professional life that I’m still trying to get off of the ground and launch at 29, but it’s also provided me with a modest, supplement income and an academic scholarship.

  
In any case, I recently received a diagnosis for dysthymia and schizoid personality disorder and I’m deploying to Kuwait in February. I have mixed feelings about deploying; on one hand, I’m not going to be in any immediate danger, and I’ll make more money than I’ve ever made in my life this late in the game (which will also be tax-free). Which I am thankful for, but on the other I’m concerned with how my mental health will hold up. I’ll be able to put my unaccomplished life—in my eyes— on hold for a long time.

  
However, when I return home, I’m going to have to face the reality that the political science degree.   
I’m earning practically provides me with zero personal utility, because I have no desire to go down the traditional trajectory that is designated for undergraduates in this academic field of study. And to add insult to injury, I will have to also cope with the fact that I'm still financially insecure. 

  
Edit: I am strongly considering going on active duty upon graduating for one term, getting out and going back to college for ""free"" to reinvent myself and start the transition into a career working for the DOD, or even the private sector, if the opportunity presents itself. I'll be in my mid to late 30's at this time and am understandably worried if ageism will prevent me from finally rising to the occasion like I should have a long while I still had the time to. Will going on this intended path of mine set me back even further, or am I better off working with the degree I'll have soon?",NoNefariousness5151,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1700428945,2023-11-19 21:22:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17z7c6l/29m_feeling_like_i_failed_to_launch_any_advice/,11,2023

 I have 3 years of CNC programming experience,  i am very good at troubleshooting machines, finding little misplaces screws type troubleshooting. I enjoy working with machines but i do not enjoy working at my current place.

Currently i am also doing a google data analysis course, beginner's level. But my job is so messer up i barely get time to do it. Most of the time i will skip and hour of sleep to it. 

I have a  basic to advanced understanding of computers and i stated learning programming in python but then my schedule at work went from (7 to 5) to (7 to 8 or sometimes 9). So i had to drop it and then i wasn't able to start it again. 

Same happened to html and Javascript.  
I am now afraid this will happen to data analysis as well..

They do not pay overtime. Its just flat 20 CAD . No on time payments. The paycheck for 1 to 15 i will be lucky if i could get it on 5 of next month.  Sometimes on time sometimes 1 month late.


What should i do? 
I cannot leave my job until like 6 months. So i will have to bear them for 6 more months possibly less but in the meantime i want to get a bit job ready so that i can switch right away. 

How can i best prepare myself for a better job elsewhere?
I have no rainy day fund. (That is a dream for me) 
I cannot leave my job and then apply.
I want a job upfront and then leave.

Ya know?  
Since 13 I've wanted to start a nonprofit that helps women who are victims of sexual abuse/ sexual slavery in 3rd world countries. Primarily India and Nepal have always been my focus. I went to college for a year- for Journalism and Social work. I didn't really have the maturity at 18 to take it seriously and lay the stepping stones for myself and the eclectic path I'd dreamt up. At one point I really wanted to be a photojournalist. Tim Hetherington heavily inspired me as a kid. But I have lost touch with my camera over the years and don't really see the journalism element playing out sadly to say, in a practical world. I write poetry and occasionally shoot film photography still. Part of me wants to really buckle down and take it seriously again. But then there's the practical side of me that is just like- ya right that aint gonna happen. I do thrive off creativity though. It's a big element of myself...I just don't see it practically being infused into the way I make my bread and butter though....  
Now I'm really lost on where to go. I considered doing online school and getting into forestry- I figured my hands on skills with heavy equipment operation, and the degree would work beautifully in tandem with land reclamation....Which is something I also feel passionate about as I'm an avid outdoorswoman from the mountain west  
Right now I work this insane schedule. It's called a super 7. It is 12 hour shifts and the cycle goes like so; 4 days, 7 off, 4 nights, 2.5 off, 3 days, 1 off, 3 nights 2.5 off. And repeat. The schedule is great if you can be diligent about going to sleep (Which I haven't been doing on my 2.5 off after my last 3 nights. And am heavily regretting it.) It allows you so much free time. But again- you have to be dedicated and responsible to getting sleep. I don't have kids, and I'm single as of now...no roommates, so I'm the perfect candidate for this lifestyle. But I was thinking this morning....Honestly this is a schedule that would make doing online schooling easier in many regards. I looked into OSU online and it has great reviews.....  
So right now I'm just lost on the direction I want to go next. There's so much I have interest in. On the one hand I do enjoy working in the trades. But for me it's more of a bucket list thing, than wanting to spend the rest of my career in it. Like every piece of equipment, or new skill I learn, it's like ""check, ok what's next."" And eventually I think I'm going to be ready to move on mentally (physically I'm already to move on because my hands and neck are on their way to crippled.)  
In a dream world I could work a job that I have an office and work at a computer occasionally, but work hands on with people and or animals a lot. I care a lot about women and children's livelihoods health and safety, but I also really care about preserving the mountain west and protecting our wild predators. I don't want to be in school forever, and I still want to have time to backpack in the summer....Thats the whole reason I took this job was because the schedule allows for it.  
Sorry this was chaotic. I'm just lost. Thanks for coming to my ted talk",406f150,9,0.800000011920929,3,1700421575,2023-11-19 19:19:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17z4l3t/27_f_welder_miner_i_dont_want_to_work_blue_collar/,11,2023

I am only 23 and do not want to spend the rest of my life having to work odd schedules and be on call. When I look at other industrial plants, the schedules are all terrible rotating schedules or have the on call aspect. I need a career change and have no idea which direction to go. I make very good money, almost 80k a year but would be willing to drop to 70k for a better W/L balance.

 I’m contemplating an internship with one of the mag7/faang firms, but in Europe, not the US. While I recognize the pay differs, my focus is on the learning opportunities and prestige such a role offers. Is the experience valued equally to its US counterpart? For instance, would interning for Google in Italy provide comparable leverage for a future career in the US as an internship with Google stateside would? Despite the challenges of transitioning from Europe to the US, I’m curious if the international experience holds the same weight.

17yzp3q,Transitioning from Developer to Business Analyst or Data Analyst - Seeking Advice!,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm currently facing a career dilemma and would appreciate your insights. I recently graduated with a degree in BS Information Systems and have been working as a developer at a startup for almost a year. The salary is low compared to other companies, but the remote work setup is convenient. However, I've realized that coding isn't my passion, and I don't see myself pursuing it in the long run. Despite understanding the basics, I struggle with complex technical aspects and find them less enjoyable.  
  
My supervisor has offered me a transition to a Business Analyst (BA) role within the company since they lack this position. They're willing to provide training, and the company has resources like Udemy courses for BA. While this opportunity seems promising for growth, I'm concerned about my weaker soft skills, especially communication, which are essential for the role. Being an introvert with low self-esteem, I'm uncertain if I can excel in this area. Additionally, the salary would remain the same.  
  
Alternatively, I've been exploring the Data Analyst (DA) role, which seems more aligned with my interests. It requires soft skills but to a lesser extent than a BA. My background in development might be beneficial, even though advanced programming skills aren't a necessity. However, pursuing this would mean starting fresh without guidance, and I'd have to leave my current company as they don't offer this role. I'm hopeful about the possibility of a higher salary in a new company.  
  
My dilemma revolves around choosing potential stability by transitioning to a BA role, despite my concerns about lacking skills, or taking the risk of starting anew in the field of Data Analysis, which I feel more drawn to.  
  
I'd greatly appreciate any insights, experiences, or advice that you can offer in this situation. Thank you for taking the time to read and help me out!",Vegetable_Frame1324,1,1.0,3,1700408065,2023-11-19 15:34:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17yzp3q/transitioning_from_developer_to_business_analyst/,11,2023
17yyxwj,Moving Jobs with a Part-time Masters Project (Engineering),"TLDR; Moving jobs with 2 YoE + BEng, 2/3rds of a MSc done + Masters project left to do - good or bad idea?  
   
I'm a full-time mechanical design engineer with two years experience, alongside this I'm in the 2nd year of part time Mechanical engineering MSc.   
Looking at leaving my current job in the next 3-9 months (to move to another engineering role).  


At the point of applying to new jobs, I would have completed all the courses taught modules, and would have only the Project remaining (course layout of 2 years taught modules & 1 year masters project). This project would be done working on a product/research with whatever company I move to.  
Is a remaining project likely to be seen as a negative or positive aspect?

17yuo3e,broken over internal job rejection.,"I’ve been in my current job (movie theater) for a good 6 months, for the most part I enjoy it, I guess. Where I live it’s impossible to find a good job that’s gives a decent amount of hours so I feel like i’m just stuck here in a way since it’s the only somewhat good place to work at. I get somewhat good hours here. 2 positions opened recently for assistant manager and 2 of my “work besties” got it. I’m happy for them, they geniuenly deserve it however I’m sad and heart-broken for myself. I wasn’t good enough. Said coworkers didn’t even want to apply for the positions, and one of them has been here less time than me, anyway I convinced them to do so and apply and look at me lol… I’m the one that didn’t get it. I fucked myself over, I suppose. 

I felt like my interview went fantastic, clearly it didn’t. I asked my gm for feedback and all she said was that I did very good in the interview (supposedly) and that I have been doing so amazing work wise, that I’m in the right track and to not slack off and continue what i’m doing. She also said that there is a lot of potential in me and that she sees that potential. She claims that I was one of her “top picks”, which makes me laugh since she told that to 2 different candidates as well LMFAOO. The issue she had with me, what made her reject me is that “I need to be more friendly with my coworkers” meaning “to not talk bad about them” which is funny because I really never have. I simply complain that I have to be picking up after other people because they don’t do shit right . I feel cheated out of a great learning experience. Many of my other managers tell me “you have great potential, you didn’t get it this time but you’ll get it the next time” and it’s like there no next time. Fuck that, why do I wanna face rejection again? I’m hurt, sad, disappointed in myself. I’m a failure, never good enough.",Marcblopez,7,0.8199999928474426,7,1700391215,2023-11-19 10:53:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17yuo3e/broken_over_internal_job_rejection/,11,2023
17ysltg,"Pass over for a promotion, not sure what to do now.","Hey all I'm 36 years old in the UK. I've been at my company 5.5yr my manager is retiring next year. Around 2-3 years ago I asked for their job and its sorta been the plan in the company, last appraisal I was referred to as manager, but there was never any official plan or training. Now along with that my MD wants to bring a guy in from a different department to train with us, I think ultimately to replace our MD (very long term) now he joined us in our office in April this year just doing half a day a week.
Now just before the appraisals this year. I was giving a payrise and promotion to senior of my role (sort of a fake promotion as I'm the only person with my job title) but it was a 10% payrise. The guy they brought in from a different department at only half a day a week they have promoted to trainee manager and he is now full time. And I thought I would be ok with it but I'm not, I am seething but I don't know if I should leave, so between my payrise I just got and our annual payrise in January and annual bonus I'll be earning a very nice salary with none of the responsibilities. Just keep doing my normal job but I just want to leave and tell them to stuff it. 
I don't think I could walk into a likewise role at the same money as my job requires alot of niche information, which isnt directly transferable. 

But I am just so angry with them, has anyone had this happen to them, what did you do? If I just ride it out will I just be ok with it in a few months or am I going to quietly seethe for years.

17yrplo,How does Workday work?,"Not sure if this is the right place and where else I could get some advice about this, but I'm curious if anyone has insight as to how Workday (the job application system) actually works. 

Does it simply gather all the applications and allow HR people to filter through to create a shortlist? Or does it scan for keywords and reject applications based on this?

I'm asking this question because I've been receiving unsuccessful emails weeks after applying. During this time, the status shows as 'Under review'. I would've thought that I would receive a rejection sooner if it was done by the system. 

This gives me the impression that my application was not automatically rejected based on the right keywords (or lack thereof), but that there were other applicants that made it to the first shortlist and they just kept me in 'under review' ""just in case"" i.e., until they fill the job and know for certain they will not be going back to the pool of applicants.

I am passionate about both, but as I live in a different country, I would have an edge with English. In contrast, CS is much more competitive and I can tell getting high scores in CS will be hard. I've done some research and managed to identify two pathways :  
1. BA in English in my home country (3years due to our school system), then hopefully after high GPA and LSAT scores, get a full-ride to a T14 law school as international student (I consider this alone a success), then after getting the JD, work for biglaw under OPT for 1 year max, while they petition for H1B or some other category.  
Pros :  
\- get to live in the US after only 3 years  
\- I get to stay there for 4 years  
Cons :  
\- unsure about the likelihood of obtaining a scholarship, otherwise it's a deal breaker.  
2. Have to re-obtain HS diploma, this time majoring in math (our school system rejects a universal, general and flexible HS diploma), this would take 1 year, then 3 yrs for BS in CS in home country, then roll some dice with H1B or other methods.  
Pros :

So I’m moving from a Sr Business Analyst role (traditional BA with mostly SQL, excel analysis and presentations) to a Sr Data analyst role within my company. The Data Analyst role I’m moving into is more so going to focus on insights as well along with traditional data analytics in the product management org. My company tells me that this is going to be considered a lateral move rather than a promotion and is only giving me a 4% bump.

- Is the move from a BA to DA considered a lateral considering the increased technicality and the inclusion of insights as well?

- I was going to counter with a 10% instead, would this be too much.

I completed an internship in college. 

I used to work as a crew member for Dunkin Donuts. 

At Dunkin, I did not exactly take on a problem solving role. I mostly just asked my boss what to do and did. 

Therefore, if an interviewer asks me about a challenge that I overcame, it would behoove me to lean toward the internship to find a good answer. 

I can think of one good anecdote. 

When I did my internship in college, we had an outdoor event for Peace Day, and we had planned to have a table with baked goods on it, but the weather predicted rain. I called around to indoor venues but none were available, and the organization had no budget to buy a covering. I brought a tarp and canopy from home which I donated to the school.

17ymir0,Moving on from federal service at 26,"I moved to Washington DC in April, and got a job as an administrative assistant. It was a leg up from my prior job in procurement in the hospitality industry, at least it felt that way. My job was in the public sector, what it lacked in pay made up for with great benefits.. which I never got to use, because the office was putting out fires every week. Previously I have worked in media, procurement (not negotiating contracts, but procuring suppplies/entering invoices into QuickBooks), and at my last job I picked up payroll experience.

As it stands, I feel somewhat demoralized. Admin takes a special kind of person, but its also seen as ""baby's first office job"" that anyone can do. The tasks themselves were not unreasonable, but the time constraints (and the fact my boss seemed to legitimately not know when I got in to work) and the lack of direction made it a less than ideal work environment. 

If I didn't need health insurance, I would self publish novels. I did it during college, but of course the money is 2 months' in arrears and that isnt going to pay rent. I need to find a job by February, and I am primarily targetting digital media, political campaigns, strategic communications, and other related jobs such as government affairs. I also wouldn't be opposed to getting back into procurement/purchasing but leads are not forthcoming. I know that I am a capable, hard-working person who can submit quality results if given some kind of direction, but myy last position was very hands-off ""figure it out"" ype of work environment.

17ymcqx,Problems with higher up at work,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting in this sub but I would love some insight on my situation.

I’ve been in my current role for a little over 2 years now and overall I love my job. However, I have been having problems with a higher up since June of this year.

Some backstory, this higher up has the same role as my boss but she’s not my boss that I report to, we just share a little bit of the same territory so we must work together in that capacity.

She’s overall very catty and a mean girl personality. She picks favorites and she throws people under the bus. I share these thoughts with others in my company.

Back in June, I had come to her asking if we can have a sit down and discuss a problem I’ve been having in one of my stores (I’m an account coordinator). She agreed and we set a date to meet. The day comes and I assumed we were going to sit in a private setting but she sat at an open table next to other managers and started having the conversation there ( I was uncomfortable but didn’t say anything because what can I say). I discuss the problem I’ve had with someone in my store who I am trying to coach out but have had no success with the manager in that store following up with documentation on her end. I send a report detailing my own documentation every time I go to that store and told her she has not once responded to any email I wrote to her. The higher snarls and laughs and says and what do you want her to say? I was taken aback and asked isn’t it her job to at least respond back to an email so I can even know she read it. She again laughs and says no. We go back and forth on this a bit and other stuff but she was unprofessional the whole conversation and didn’t give me clear direction.

She calls my manager a few days later saying I need to watch my authority in stores and said that I haven’t been following my schedule (which I have and I have no idea why she lied about this) and complained about me to my manager. My manager defended me and said she doesn’t see those things and left it at that. She said it was a brief convo.

Since this incident between us, this higher up has not said one word to me and avoids me in person. She purposely excluded me from in person meetings by not adding me to the email invites. I only find out from my counterparts. I brought this up to my manager but she had no good solution to it and basically told me to ignore her.

My counterpart and I have been asked to send out this weekly report to our region (which is a big deal) so we take turns week by week sending this report out. I was the one who set up what the report should look like and my counterpart just follows my reporting but fills in the information her week. Whenever I send the report out she doesn’t say a word. Whenever my coworker sends it out she responds and gives her praise on her amazing reporting.

I will not lie and say it’s affecting me because I don’t want to be apart of her game because I know she does it on purpose. 

Is there anything I can do or should do? Am I overthinking this and should I just ignore it since she’s not the person I report to?

Thank you for any advice.",Lovelila44,1,1.0,1,1700359449,2023-11-19 02:04:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ymcqx/problems_with_higher_up_at_work/,11,2023
17ylybm,Is it worth studying Bio in university if I don't want to be a doctor or work in a lab?,"I'm a grade 12 student applying to universities at the moment. I'm really struggling to figure out what to study. I'm interested in learning pretty much anything, but I don't have a strong passion for any particular subject. I've always been a try-hard at school, so I have good grades in all of my classes (an even mix of humanities and maths & sciences), so that's not really a limiting factor. The only class I haven't taken is physics which rules out any engineering routes, which I've never really considered anyway. Within the sciences, I definitely enjoy biology more than physics or chem, though I don't *mind* chem so far. I feel like most bio students end up as doctors or in labs, but I don't see myself in either of those roles. I definitely want a social job, where I can spend my time interacting with people. Because of this, I think I'm leaning more towards a degree in the humanities. But at the same time, I don't love the idea of giving up on science. Ultimately I'm quite conflicted.

That being said, I'm curious what options are out there for a people-oriented job within the bio realm? Is the job market in this sphere actually demanding enough for me to base my schooling around it? I would really appreciate any insight!

17ykkpz,Military VS PT Job for Schooling,"I have a friend with HS diploma that's trying to figure out his life. His friend joined the military, and he now thinks he should too, even though he has no interest/reason to serve. He also suffers from depression and anxiety, and I don't think he'd do well in the military to be honest. He's weaning off antidepressant so he can enlist. His true goal is to go to college, so he wants to enlist for tuition support. He has a FT job (about 40k/yr) without benefits currently. I'm trying to watch out for him, so I've gathered some data. I'm hoping to get some input/feedback before I help him make his decision.

\[Military\]

\- Typically 4 yrs of AD commitment + 4 yrs in IRR (with other variations)

\- Low pay (starts at $1,917.63/mo = $23k/yr)

\- Tuition support: a personal maximum of $4,500 per fiscal year per student

\- Some other tax-related benefits, etc.

\[My thought\]

If he goes to the army, the actual benefit/gain doesn't seem worth the commitment. Plus, it'll delay how soon he can get to his real goal/career, which also drastically changes earning potential in the end (the sooner you start working on your life-time career, the more raises you'll incur over time + more promotional opportunities). If he cuts down his FT job to .75, he basically ends up with a similar financial outcome as the military (roughly 30k). He'll be working 30h/wk (roughly 4 days), and his job actually has weekend shifts, so if he takes weekend shifts, he can free up 3 days per week for schooling. That should give him enough time to take 12 credit hours, not to mention he could also work less during the semester and pick up more shifts in the summer. While he'll be pretty busy, I think this is the most cost-effective option that does not come with military commitments, including risks for death, disability, etc. I may even let him stay with me so he doesn't need to worry about rent, then he could even go down to working 20h/wk to make this work. He'll obtain his degree sooner than the military route and will be able to invest in his real career sooner, leading to a greater financial gain in the end. Am I missing any other factors to consider? I'd love to hear other people's thoughts. Thank you in advance.",refundroid,1,1.0,2,1700354065,2023-11-19 00:34:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ykkpz/military_vs_pt_job_for_schooling/,11,2023
17yi1h2,Paralysed by career choices,"Hi guys. I’m a recent graduate looking to start my first job and I don’t know which direction to go down. During university I was an avid student journalist and was convinced that journalism was what I wanted to pursue after graduating. But in my penultimate year, I interned at a tech startup and loved it. The work was dynamic and the mission was something I felt really strongly about. They offered me a job after graduation, which I was thrilled about… But then what might be the best newspaper in the country offered me an internship. Reluctantly, I turned the full time offer down and spent the summer at the paper. Also loved it; it consolidated my love for journalism. However it soon became clear that there wouldn’t be a role for me after the internship had ended. They were on a “hiring freeze”, and rarely took on interns without them gaining some experience elsewhere first. 

I reached back out to the tech startup—lamenting my initial decision to leave and asked for my old offer back. They reoffered me the job verbally, but said they couldn’t fix a start date until their Series B funding round had ended. I was happy to wait… until six weeks had elapsed. I ask them what sort of timeline they were working around. Then they rescinded my offer.

Around the same time, my colleagues at the paper had reached back out to me. There was an early careers role on the table that they wanted me to apply for. They set up coffees and lunches between me and the other members of the team. And they took in my application weeks before they had listed the job publicly. They still expected me to interview with the other candidates—but I felt that, so long as I didn’t bomb the interview, the job was mine. I just had to wait.

While waiting, the tech startup got back in touch. They were “super sorry to let [me] go” and wondered if I was still interested in the role. I got on Zoom with them and said yes. I signed the contract later that week. This was on my parents’ advice, who argued that the job at the paper might not have come off. They’re also apathetic about me pursuing journalism at best. The pay at the tech company is about double what the paper offers, and they’ve offered me decent stock options (and IPO looks like it’s on the horizon).

Did I make the right choice? I don’t feel empowered in my decision. What happens if the newspaper offer me a job in the coming weeks? Could I leave the startup without burning bridges?",Awkward_Jump6767,1,1.0,0,1700346936,2023-11-18 22:35:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17yi1h2/paralysed_by_career_choices/,11,2023
17yi0mo,Getting paranoid about my job while I’m on a 2-week vacation. Comms with bosses and staff have gone cold. Advice on how to deal with this?,"I took the week off before Thanksgiving holiday week to a far-removed country (omitting the name in case any coworkers lurk this sub, as I’ll already be providing way too many clues otherwise) and it’s been a dream trip I’ve been planning with a few friends all year.

For background: this is something I’ve also taken the appropriate steps to submit for approval and communicate to all parties at work: I got the days approved on our back-end system, I sent an email to all the top brass outlining the days, I mentioned it on numerous occasions in both meetings and conversations over the months and days leading up to the trip, and I made sure anything I was on the hook for had been arranged to be covered by my colleague.

A bit about my company without again giving too much away: taking a month off work is often the norm with a lot of employees. It’s a small company with a laissez-faire C-suite that often take massive trips on the company dime under the pretense of “business” when it’s clear they’re mostly partying it up on these excursions. Because of this vacuum of leadership, a few coworkers in middle management have also taken to prolonged vacation days. 

Back to the present: nothing has been on fire, nothing seems to have been dropped, however I did miss a massive meeting with a partner that had been scheduled a week prior to me leaving but landed on one of my vacation days. I signaled to a colleague I’m probably going to miss this meeting, due to the extreme time zone difference and jet lag, not to mention I’m on vacation, and he said not to worry, that he’ll cover.

So here’s where I’m wondering if I made the right move: I didn’t repeat to leadership that I would be away. I figured that with my email, the time approved, and the colleague covering, that to repeat I would be gone would invite further scrutiny or questions e.g. “why are you missing this meeting?” etc. I didn’t feel the need to overexplain myself and thought that would rope me back into having to work while I was off.

Anyway. In the days since I left, I’ve been posting to my Instagram stories and have noticed not one boss (except the one who approved it) had been even watching (I KNOW, this feels insanely immature/paranoid to even type, let alone read), and even the boss who approved the days has fallen off of seeing anything.

I’m wondering two things now:

1. Is my reputation tanked because of me being MIA? Have I cut myself off from open comms with these bosses?

2. What’s the best way to revive my conversations with them, if they were caught off guard by me not being present at the big meeting? “hey, back from vacation, caught up with the meeting docs and I’ll be catching up with [colleague] on anything else we need to presently work on?”

Anyway, that’s the (long-winded) gist of it. Thoughts? Is my paranoia completely unfounded here?",vittorioe,1,0.25,12,1700346870,2023-11-18 22:34:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17yi0mo/getting_paranoid_about_my_job_while_im_on_a_2week/,11,2023

17ye6aq,Data Engineer in a corporate or a Data Analyst in a startup?,"Hello,

I'm facing a difficult choice and would appreciate some advice. I currently work as a data warehouse analyst/developer in a major bank with 5 years of experience communicating with business, analysing requests and preparing Teradata SQL scripts. I have a Master's in finance and am working towards my PhD. 

I have two offers – Company A is a another large bank offering a ""Data Engineer"" position. The job entails similar duties as the one I currently have. They also use Teradata so I may be immediately useful to them. In addition I would do some ETL in Informatica and some development in Cloudera. From the interviews I saw that the people are experienced and there certainly is some room for growth for me there. They also offer roughly 10-15 % higher salary.

Company B calls itself a startup, but is in fact a medium-sized fintech with roughly 120 employees. It's been in the finance market for 10 years and has recently changed ownership. The company has never been profitable, but has changed ownership a few times in the past as well without any significant lay offs, etc., so no matter the ownership the situation should be stable in the future. They offer a Data analyst position working primarily with their PostGre database and Tableau, but the position may also entail anything I make of it – data integration, propensity modelling, etc. The people I'd work with are quite experienced as well, but will likely have a little less time to guide me. Everyone working there was EXTREMELY nice, honest and straightforward about everything to the degree I've never seen.

I'm looking for two things – a good salary (we may expand our family in the upcoming year or two, hopefully, so I'll be the sole money-maker of the family for some time) and professional growth to stay relevant in the market. My head says Company A, as they offer a higher salary, more stability, arguably a better position and career path. My heart says Company B, as they offer a more creative position allowing me to learn pretty much anything I want, more pleasant boss, and far better community of people. Is experience from a startup (or a small company in general) valuable enough to compensate for the arguably lower-level position?

Do you have any advice on what I should do? Any questions I should ask them to help me decide? Or is the answer clear and I'm overthinking? I should add that this is in Europe and in a country with a stable market where company bankcruptcy and large lay-offs are quite rare, hence I mostly disregard the red flag of the Company B. I need to make the decision on Tusday.

17y6akw,"I have golden handcuffs, but job is crushing me mentally","Another one of ""these"" posts I guess... I'll list the facts and , do some venting along the way for my own sanity. I'll leave it open to any comment or if you want to answer some of my questions further down. No TLDR, sorry.

- 30yo, no debt or mortgage, no car, no family 
- Been at this job for about 6 years, 
- Live in EU , job pays €31k a year , nothing extraordinary but my expenses are low so I have 2k every month to save/invest. 
- I own some stock options in company, golden handcuffs. I have to stay for around two more years for them to become vested. Payoff could be around 300k maybe even more if company continues to grow and profit. If not for this I'd quit in an instant a thousand times over. 
- I am depressed, sad, lonely and angry. Mostly due to my social isolation, neglect and death of family member and a really tough loss of a love interest, and of course my office environment and the golden handcuff situation. Lots of income goes on comfort food. I come home to apartment I can't bother cleaning anymore it's gone out of hand. I was drinking alcohol almost daily last year and playing a lot of online games for quick dopamine hits. I stopped drinking and decided to exercise more start of this year. Was on the verge of a gambling addiction also. But I digress... 

- Restructure of company and investors since two years ago which introduced corporate bullshit, office politics, random policies, people trying to manipulate you. A lot of fake actors. Can't work from home and so on. 

- Job now feels suffocating , didn't feel like job at first because of very chill coworkers and I could work on projects I wanted and decided. Now I have to work with assigned projects that do not motivate me at all, stress me, etc. and expectations and list of responsibilities growing. They push me and what I can do as much as possible, even though I would argue it does not fall under my job description or role. Constant struggle, because I feel I have leverage over them, they'd be devastated if I left. 

- Most of my coworkers I started with quit long ago, I don't feel connection to anyone. Absolutely nobody to talk to, hence this throwaway account and Reddit post. Strong feelings of hate towards people and environment and it spills out outside office as well. Annoying loud-mouth coworkers. Dead cramped new depressing office space. I have to deal with people and companies now that go on my nerves on the daily. I think it's probably ""just me"" because people in general seem way more normal than me. 

- Random injustice. Guy was hired from from the inside that made like 60k his first year for a basic office role that requires zero experience. I've worked for years and don't make that much today. And a lot of other things like this that just piss me off for example I worked on stuff that others took credit for, without them even asking me, or me even knowing about it (god that shit makes me so angry).


All I want right now is to work on my own stuff, things that inspire me. Change careers likely. The less people involved the better. Maybe consulting work , part time. Maybe not work for a year or just do very simple work and just come to my senses and put all energy getting rid of my soul crushing depression.

 I want to engage my self with things that I want to do any not have any project lead or person telling me what I should be working on. My plan was always to stick out for another few years at least for the stock options and become financially free to work on my own stuff without the financial stress. Who knows, maybe with that kind of money I'd find an excuse to do nothing but play online video games all day every day.

These thoughts contradict themselves and feel like a complete paradox and I'm not sure I'll manage even working for another year. It feels like by the time I am done here all my time and life energy will be depleted. I have feelings and sense of a sunk cost fallacy.

17y4u39,How do I avoid religious discussions at work?,"I live in the Bible Belt and I am an agnostic atheist. I recently changed jobs and in my first week, I’ve heard my boss say “god is good” to some of our clients multiple times. Yesterday, he told me he loves social media but it shouldn’t be used while you’re on the clock when he was going over the employee handbook. He said he really loves Twitter (X). This prompted me to look him up and his page is full of Joel Osteen retweets and other religious commentary. Every single post is religious. 

I don’t mind that others have their beliefs. I’m fine with it. I’m afraid he will eventually bring religion up to me or invite me to church. This has happened at every job I’ve had by at least one coworker. Usually, people with the kind of faith my boss has not only do they bring it up and invite me to their church but get terribly offended when I tell them I am not religious and atheist. 

How would you suggest I respond when it inevitably gets brought up? I don’t want to lie but I don’t want my boss to dislike me because of my lack of faith.

17y4kbq,"Feel stuck, is that ok or do I need to be moving in some direction.","Have been at a company for about 8 years now, I've done pretty much the same work supporting various data storage systems to different capacities.  The work itself is not super stimulating and does not lend to much growth in any particular direction but rather it often feels like efforts are squandered across far too large a breadth of information to really gain any deeper knowledge which may be useful or transferable someday if the need should arise.  All of this said, the hours have been great and allow me to have ample time with my family which is ultimately what matters most to me, pay is pretty much the same (solid enough to support a good lifestyle for my family).  I have no problem continuing this for the next 30+ years if I know there will be stability, I have time with my family and they're taken care of, however the way the tech world feels this seems less and less realistic (maye I'm wrong).  I'm not sure how much interest I have in much in tech at this point and feel very 'stuck' on this path.  It feels like I'm surrounding by a lot of career (mostly older) folks who are closer to retirement and don't have quite the same worries so its hard to communicate these concerns clearly and expect to be heard.  Should I be not having these thoughts of feeling stuck and this is just the normal? Or am I not being a worrier in thinking that my whole life (family and home/life we've built) is tied to a job where I'm not super interested nor confident I've built any skills to be useful anywhere else?  On a daily basis I 'feel' like I need to be doing something to progress so I'm not stuck and I have a backup rather than being caught with my pants down but at the same time life at a big tech company can be easy to fall into the flow of it and just get complacent, ESPECIALLY with a busy lifestyle and family leaving hardly any free time.  Any advice is greatly appreciated on how I might think of this differently / proceed differently, or maybe its just life and I'm being a baby.  Thank you all.   
TL;DR  
I work at a job I'm not very interested in and do not feel I've developed any marketable skills, however it allows me to provide a good life for my family and spend time with them.  Do I accept this feeling and stay or do something to claw my way toward something different / new because this is not a good way to live (uninterested and feeling like no backup plan).  Thanks.

17y2aks,Toxic coworker in a recent job change. Should I quit 6 months in the job?,"Hi everyone, I took a director role 6 months ago in a company with the promise that I will become Managing Director soon. 

I was pretty excited to land the position but since I arrived there, I knew something was wrong.

I realised in 4-5 months that the director from another department is pretty toxic. 
She started by attacking my direct reports in front of everyone, multiple times, my direct reports quitted because they couldn’t handle it (among other things) and it feels like the company is in a complete turmoil because of the toxic director. 
A colleague lost her job because the toxic person was bad mouthing her to the owner of the company.

I was left without a team and had to handle all the work by myself. 
While struggling and putting 80-100 hours per week to get everything done,the toxic director was talking behind my back to clients saying that I don’t deliver in a proper way ( I am doing the job of 3 persons at the moment.)
 
Too make matters worse, she also attacked to me 2 times already saying that I don’t deliver properly and in time. 

These attacks are all documented and sent to the HR director, who asks me to be patient as they completely understand the situation. 
However they don’t seem ready to fire the toxic person since she has very good relationships with the clients. 

I am completely demotivated but I don’t want to leave yet  another company because I m getting picked on. 

I love the brand and I think we could do amazing stuff if I remain but it is clear that the toxic person has to go. 
If they continue to tolerate her Behavior the company will fall apart. 
They know it but they don’t act decisively. 
To make matter worse, I am onboarding two new direct reports this week but I am very sad that I hired them to work in this environment.

17y0cir,Am I being paranoid? (Code42),"I feel like I just need some reassurance here or something. I probably drank too much coffee today.

I work for an eCommerce company. I used to work out of our office but I’ve been remote since the pandemic. The company has gone through a lot of changes since that time, we recently even lost our CEO. Revenue has been decreasing ever since the pandemic ended, as with many online businesses. I work in a senior role within our Trust & Safety team, I’m tenured but I’m not a manager. Everything’s good as far as I know, as I haven’t been warned for anything, my attendance is pretty much perfect, like I can’t think of any specific reasons for why the company would want to let go of me—other than that I’ve gotten a lot of wage increases over the years and right now the company is struggling.

Anyway, the company doesn’t fly us remote people out to the office too much because of budget, but my team is actually schedule to be in the office at the end of this month. I’ve been pretty anxious about it because I haven’t been there since last year. 

Earlier this week, quite randomly, a guy who I’ve never talked to before pinged me in Slack. His job title is “IT Support Administrator.” He asked me if I could check whether I have a program called Code42 installed on my laptop. I checked and I told him that I did not. He just placed a “thank you” emoji on my response and that was that. So, I looked up this program and I understand it’s used to track file sharing on employee computers, like to prevent sensitive information from being shared nefariously by employees. I ran into some article that talked about how it’s important to have programs such as this installed on employee computers prior to offboarding them. 

So from there my mind started racing. I started thinking “maybe they are planning to lay me off when I show up to the office and they want to verify whether there’s tracking software on my work machine before they do.” Then again, and perhaps more realistically, they might just be checking in with people to very who does and does not have this software installed already. I would imagine they’d like everyone to have it installed, although, after I told him I don’t have it, he did not ask me to install it.

I feel like I’m just being paranoid but it got me all worked up for sure. I can see layoffs being a thing in the near future, the company has grown a lot and now revenue is down. If they were to let me go, it would probably be due to money and not anything performance-based. I survived a round of layoffs in 2020 and we did let some folks go who were great, they were just getting paid a lot. 

The plan for this trip is my team is having a planning session on Wednesday of that week and then the next day is our company holiday party. I am assuming I’ll go there and we’ll do the planning and I’ll go to the party. But yeah, I don’t know, I can see a reality where they use the opportunity to let me go in person and take my work laptop, as opposed to me having to mail it to them. 

Sorry for this post, I’m just stressed out about this trip and the vibe at work has been more serious and weird in general lately, so every little thing is raising alarm bells.",purplewheatxylophone,1,1.0,0,1700288997,2023-11-18 06:29:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17y0cir/am_i_being_paranoid_code42/,11,2023

17xx396,[AZ] Job wants to change our pay plan and it feels really sketch…,"
A new pay plan has just been presented to my coworkers and me. We have always been 5% commission of our sales. Now, the company wants to be able to deduct pay if we choose to take an unpaid day off.

17xw55u,"What’s the move, literally?","I currently work at an organization that I have been at for the last 3 years, doing a job I love and thrive in (when I get to use my specific skills and get to actually do my job). It had been a place that allowed me to be creative and I felt like I was growing. I have also gotten to quickly risen through the ranks and am now a manager. But, although I am paid the manager salary, our HR Team has been overwhelmed and hasn’t actually given me the paperwork to sign which is what makes it official, and that makes me nervous. Plus, the work environment has become really toxic - to the point of feeling suffocating due to the atmosphere and some of the people. 

So, I started applying for other jobs and found a dream one. It was for an organization that operated on a global scale, that has much more influence, and I would be working with industry experts. I got through all the interview rounds and was chosen for the job. This job had the largest applicant pool (over 1500) the organization had ever seen, and I was offered the opportunity - something I’m proud of. However, when I got the official offer it was no longer a fully remote position but an in-person job. I would have to up and move 11-hours away to a city I’ve never visited and where I knew no one. And the offer is for a lower salary amount than I had expected (and lower than I honestly would take if I have to move).

The current job has potential to get better with a new VP of my department starting soon.

The new job is exciting and the step in the right direction I wish to see my career go. But it is so far from home and less money than I want.

17xvyah,What do I do in such a situation?,"I (25M) work at a company that's into hospitality, it's a company whose core values is about love for people and helping as many people as possible to bring them out of poverty and stuff I cannot be too specific so I don't loose my job.

However those passions and philosophies are only prevalent on paper, I joined the company because I believed in working for the greater good, helping people is something I am also passionate about and it was sung in my ear throughout the interview process.

Things started to fall apart when I got my first paycheck, it was a very miniscule figure but I didn't thing much of it, I just hoped that things would get better since I was sort of like an intern at that time, also I noticed that people are not very serious with their job in the workplace, it's almost like they all think it's a scam, we come to work have meetings and go home, there's so much meetings that it's hard to get any work done.

The meetings just reiterate how important our work is and why we must help people, and how important the quality of our work is, but afterwards people just go about their business, only a few people get the actual work done.

When I started I was very excited and passionate about working here, but now it feels like it's just easier to avoid actually working and do what everyone is doing

I now dodge work and carry out the little work I get to do with half measures, the salary has increased a couple of times for the last 4 years I've been working here but it's still like half of what we should be earning.

One of the biggest questions I've asked myself is how can you really care for people if the people working inside the company are underpaid and treated badly, I forgot to add there is no health package and any other perks, we're employed as contract staff but are expected to resume 9 to 5 for 5 days a week.

I'm literally just hovering around waiting for my next paycheck and then the cycle repeats.

Is this bad? I'm so lazy about this whole thing, and going to look for another job is scary because I might get to actually get to do serious work again.",codaNakamura,1,0.5,1,1700273906,2023-11-18 02:18:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xvyah/what_do_i_do_in_such_a_situation/,11,2023

17xveuu,Should I send a thank you email now? (Halfway through interview rounds),"
I have to go through 4-5 interview rounds for this 1 US-based company. 

I'm about halfway through, finished the 3rd.

For the past 3 rounds, I haven't sent a thank you email, but I read an article that suggests I should.

My dilemma is this:

- If I send a thank you email to the last interviewer, it might not look good to the 1st two interviewers.

- If I send a thank you email to the last interviewer, as well as follow up thank you emails for the 1st two, it would look late because the 1st 2 interviews were a week ago or longer.

- Whichever I choose from the above, it'd be best to continue sending thank you emails for the 4th or 5th rounds, if ever.

For context, my job is an internship in the Accounts Receivable department at my company. This was an internship from a partnership with my high school, but it has continued on to an at-will type. It'll be 3 years there next month. With my boss cracking down my hours to 8-5 for 3 days a week, after already maxing me at 30 hours a week, it's simply not livable anymore for my apartment and rent.

17xqpw2,I've wasted all 16 years of my life and really I don't know what to do anymore,"I was born into a Chinese family full of engineers on both sides, and my parents (read: emotionally abusive mother) being the stereotypical Chinese parents they are pushed me academically, very, very hard.  
I'd exhibited a talent for math as a kid, as well as an interest in certain aspects of science, so naturally I assumed that I wanted to follow my parents' footsteps and do something stem related. At first, it was probably doctor, which then got morphed into ""engineer"". But I always knew something was off, a gut feeling perhaps? I don't know, but it was strongly encouraged by my family, so I let it slide.  
Anyways, I am also a pianist, saxophonist, and enjoy singing. I've been told by some that I apparently have a lovely voice. I remember when I also wanted to act, but always froze up on stage, only able to read out lines in a terrible monotone, lacking in tone, feeling terribly self-conscious about myself, a mental blockage of some sort. As a child, I remember having brief phases where I'd think and work towards possibly being a singer of some sort, though eventually I dismissed that as a lofty dream. But one passion that has persisted with me extremely strongly is my love for the piano.  
Music does shit to me, especially romantic-era music I can't describe it but it's like LSD for all my senses except I don't hallucinate I don't know what it is but it isn't normal. I began playing piano when I was 4, and it took me a while to get past the ""oh woe is me, my parents are forcing me to practice noooooo"" stage, before the passion hit me like a truck and I'd genuinely find no problem practicing for an hour or more a day.  
Now what about the acting mental blockage? Well that was rather forcibly ejected from my brain with the help of a friend(?) a few weeks ago. It's gotten a lot easier and I realised for the first time in my life I genuinely could truly lose myself on a stage.  
So it's a friday night. I am lying in my bed, thinking about things, my homework, tests, friends, but mostly, my future. A few nights ago I had signed up to a work experience at airbus, but what did I want to do in my life? That was the question. Then it hit me. I have 0 passion for anything in the sciences. Sure, I have an interest, but then again that's my nature, anything to me is interesting just look at my search history and them endless wikipedia spirals ranging from St. Sebastian to the history of bubble gum or whatnot. I could never be the boy who delivered a whole-ass presentation to our Science Society on thursday on underwater robotics, I could never be those kids in sustainability society talking about how our coffee would not taste the same in ten years.  
I wanted to focus on my music, play my heart away, act maybe. But at this point I'd chosen my A-levels already. Physics, maths, chemistry, and where a sane person would say ""further math"" I'd chosen latin for probably the same god-forsaken reasons why I wanted to do all these performing-arts related shit. I've already set myself on this stupid path towards being an engineer. Yes, it's practical, yes, my family will be happy, and yes, I'll probably have a more stable income than working in the west-end or being a struggling artist working in some obscure orchestra or something. But I won't ever be happy, and the knowledge of that is more than I can bear, and with the way the world is going I'm likely just going to be stuck in this stupid rat race until the end of time.  
I know, maybe some of you will think, ""Well why doesn't she just tell someone about this"". The stakes are too high, I'm enrolled in one of the most prestigious schools in the country, I've chosen my A-levels, it's november, my teachers are convinced of my passion for my subject. I can't switch to art, or music or drama, for fuck's sake I didn't do them at GCSE I didn't have my stupid grand revelation back then and anyways I begged my mom to let me take music or art but she shut it down. I can't go back to music school on a saturday because I have school on a saturday, I can't take more piano lessons because my mother will not let me so I can forget about being a piano soloist, and I can't do acting school on a saturday either because of same said reasons.  
I know if I continue down the engineering path I will be perpetually unhappy, and this isn't just a sudden idea I have this is truly something that I've been ignoring my whole life and have only come to terms with recently. There is no chance of taking another path now because I would be taking everything, every single academic achievement I've built up in my life up to this point and throwing it all out. 12 years, all wasted, and we can forget about telling anyone in my family about this: I'll be ridiculed and potentially ostracised.  
Call this a severe case of main character syndrome, but if there is any character I feel I fully resonate wtih it would be Neil Perry from Dead Poet's Society (It also makes a whole lot more sense now why I cried so much during the movie despite it not logically being the saddest movie I've watched). I have never felt this alone, or more lost in my life, and I don't know what to do. From here, it is either two things: Continue doing what I am doing, and live the rest of my life never fully satisfied, and probably not even do it well enough due to the fact it's not something I'm passionate about, or take the plunge, and probably fail miserably due to my lack of experience. And at this point it is very much looking like I'll be forced to take the former out of practicality, and really I don't know how to feel about that.  
There is a third option, which would be to Neil Perry myself, but I really don't want to think about trying that again.",YanZi101,6,0.800000011920929,10,1700259411,2023-11-17 22:16:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xqpw2/ive_wasted_all_16_years_of_my_life_and_really_i/,11,2023
17xqo6d,I feel I deserve a larger than usual raise. How do I bring this up at year-end without sounding bad?,"I have a unique role at my company - they made the role specifically for me a few years ago and there’s no job description, and I am the only person who has ever had it. 

My position allowed for us to not re-hire some client-facing positions when people quit because I basically “pick up the slack” which means I cover employees sick days and vacation days so that they don’t have to worry about client impact. I also train the new employees and work in the HR department so that I can do some random admin items too.

I currently get paid at a Level 4. My base is about $58K and then I make around $6K in bonuses and OT. I fill in for Level’s 1-5. I feel like I should be paid at a level 5’s salary range if I’m expected to do their job. That base ranges from $62K-$74K per year (they are salaried). I want to ask for $68K, but would be happy with $65K. That would mean a 12-17% increase. Last year I got 9% which was very unusual, but was due to inflation being so high. Usually 2.50-4% is standard. Higher ups are worried about the economy, so I’m expecting 2.5% and a smaller bonus at year end this year.

Does my logic make sense for why I should get a higher raise? I absolutely love my job and my boss, so I don’t want him to feel insulted since he’s done so much for me. Normally I wouldn’t care about asking, but I know he always pushes for higher bonuses for me, better raises, etc so I don’t want to seem ungrateful for all he does.

My year end review is next week, and we find out our increases the week after that, so technically I don’t for sure know what it is yet, but at what point should I bring it up to him? At the review? Or should I try and counter the increase when he tells me what that is?",PPP1842,2,0.6700000166893005,6,1700259291,2023-11-17 22:14:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xqo6d/i_feel_i_deserve_a_larger_than_usual_raise_how_do/,11,2023
17xpwkh,How to put up with bad experience // references from the get go of one's career,"Hey !

  
I'm just out of a 1-year contract I had after recently graduating. I ended up leaving for harassment 3 months before the end - things were fine at first and they proposed for an extension but it wasnt in my plan. Things got worse when I told them I would not stay. Anyway :  
I'd like to know how I could put up with bad references in my future work life.  
Before that I had done some work study and I remember this company calling references from a previous internship I had. Btw I know for a fact that the company I did my work study program with would not support me - and the internship I had is too little of an experience compared to where I am now so it is not relevant.

  
I do not really know how to proceed, actually it is pretty demoralizing, even more given the fact that I worked my ass off at school since day 1.  
I had 1 young coworker from my team who I know could testify for me as she is a friend now but she's not my manager and it would not put up for a whole ""3 references"" or more if asked.  
I guess situations like this where one could not get by with its former boss or colleagues is pretty common so I have to either find a good strategy to put up with references - get hired through processes that won't ask for those - or simply go my way outside the classic corporate world I guess ?? Or totally change branche ??

  
I don't know how common is reference check, and I guess it is very dependent on the economy and the job seeker / employer position of strength. I was especially thinking about this bc I had a friend of mine having his former employers called for a cleaning-person position.  
Is there a way to know which company would have a recruiting process where they would not ask for it ? I am planning to look for some jobs in Switzerland but I may be looking elsewhere as well - and I spotted some recruiting-consultancy companies full of interesting jobs but I guess they might be more prone the do the full check.

  
I am open to any suggestion on the way I should proceed. Except going homeless I guess.

17xjs3l,The Unspoken Value of Teaching Co-workers: Straight-up Career Advice for 20s-30s,"Strategic teaching” is the most under-rated tactic to showcase your competence, confidence and foresight all at once. For example, I used to explain upcoming surgeries in vivid detail to my interns while waiting in the surgeon’s lounge which subtly displays:

- Competence: Being able to explain complicated processes in simple terms is the surest outward sign of mastery.
- Confidence: Sharing knowledge without hesitation implies you hold an extensive reservoir of expertise and potential.
- Foresight: Displays your grasp of the team's potential, where the collective value exceeds individual contributions.

I gained the loyalty and friendship of my interns, while gaining trust and therefore operative experience from my bosses. Win-Win.

Takeaway: Strategic teaching an effective way to amplify your value.

FYI, its also exactly what I’m doing right now!

17xj0ni,I like my job and my company but I have no trust in my incompetent boss.,"I'm sure this isn't an uncommon problem. I'm just getting more and more worried that my bosses incompetence will start to hurt my image and advancement opportunities. 

My boss is the definition of a middle management cog that is broken and routinely stops the machine from working. 

We have a small team and he wants everything we do across teams to go through him and then he delays and messes it all up. I'll do work I'm proud of but the minute it goes through him it's a mess that I'm embarrassed of and I feel like it reflects poorly on me. I've heard whisperings from other teams that my boss isn't viewed in a great light. 

I know some people have caught on because there are certain people that come directly to me instead of my boss when they need something from our team but it irritates my boss. These are just people on my level so I'm not sure they have a lot of say in my career progression. Anyone in middle management or above always goes through my boss so I worry they never see my work or my capabilities. 

Do I jump ship or do I wait until the contract we're on ends in 2 years and see how things shake out in the company? I really like the work I'm doing and I want to stick with the company in the hopes that I'm put on a new team in 2 years but my biggest fear is that I'll be laid off instead because my whole team will be viewed as incompetent.",Punkinprincess,1,1.0,1,1700238892,2023-11-17 16:34:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xj0ni/i_like_my_job_and_my_company_but_i_have_no_trust/,11,2023

so i have a strong interest in both forensics and criminal law similar to that of lawyer work. is there any specific careers you might reccomend that can blend the line between these fairly different avenues of work 

To go a little more in detail about what interest me about criminal law and forensic science i guess some background info is needed

Im a 22 years old and i believe that its my duty to help people in some way with whatever i do, no matter how much of an uphill battle that can look like sometimes. Ive always had interest in the law due to my own experience and perceptions of some of the more corrupt preceding and members (regarding poor lawyers, attorneys and the like). Ive used alot of these terrible ecents to motivate myself to be better in that manner but i fear that trying to ""fix"" a naturally unbalanced system as a lawyer might not be enough

Which brings me to my other interest which is not just any science but forensic science. My main reasoning for the interest in specifically criminalist & pathology admittedly i dont know enough about either aside from what could be gleamed from a general definition but i can clearly see distinct traits i like 

I did see a job that ive not seen too much info called a forensic lawyer but before making any moves towards schooling id really appreciate any opinions or perspectives that could clear up my blurry path

If it helps any i figured id include my top 3 traits that i believe work in my favor well and coukd be honed towards either practice 
1.my analytical and inquisitive nature 
2.my relentless effort
3.my logical consistency 

My goals for either of these careers also follows a rule of three 
1.put good into the world and help others in a 100% just way
2.put my brain to good use in a consistent yet stimulating career 
3.maintain financial security and a projected path towards my ideal future

However, I basically have lost all hope after the recent rise of AI and my job basically being snapped into thin air. I was working as a graphic artist when covid hit, and fortunately, was able to save up to $3700 however all that dissipated after my parents borrowed around $2000 from me as we had some financial struggles. I asked them if they could turn it into a convertible so that I could have someone support me for college (I was thinking of supporting myself alone back then).

  
Now I'm just always stressed and anxious (emotions that I've probably gotten used to at this point, even my mom asks ""why is money all that you're thinking about"") Sometimes I feel guilty too because I have such big dreams but no job to back it up, plus our family is really struggling financially. Despite that, my parents are still so positive and keep telling me ""As long as you get there, we're happy."" and that brought me to tears.  
  
I wanted to help even more so badly, so I started my own sticker business, I'm still going at it despite making 0 sales after 2 weeks of starting. I am also still looking for gigs on freelancing sites, waiting for that stroke of luck that the heavens will bless me with again.  
  
Right now though, I am wondering on what skills I can learn so that I can sustain myself right now and for when I do study in another country.

I was fortunate to be offered a job quite quickly in a different company however I’m not enjoying it one bit. The company should appeal to me, on paper it ticks all the right boxes, the people are lovely and I’ve been welcomed with open arms but it’s just not doing anything for me. Commute is longer than I’ve ever done, hours are longer and everything is done via teams or email. I feel like a robot.

I seem to be shuffling emails around all day and drinking coffee with my headset on, listening to teams call after teams call. I feel utterly useless, beyond new job learning curve.

In the 9 months he has been with the company, he has lost 4 people on the team with a 5th informing me this week that they are in the process of leaving too on a team of only 5 people. There have been numerous HR complaints filed against the manager, but he has some executive level protection. I like the work and the company itself is great, but my well-being has been severely impacted by boss who is a bully and extreme micromanager.

I have made attempts to set boundaries and try to work with my boss to facilitate a better situation, but if anything things have gotten worst.

17xdn7s,Use These Headlines in Your CV to Beat the ATS Game,"Resume headings are the unsung heroes of a standout job application. Within seconds, these headings determine if a recruiter will continue reading or set your resume aside.

But here's a critical aspect to consider: **In the digital age of recruitment, using improper or unconventional headings can lead to a resume being overlooked by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).**

Navigating the world of resumes, there are some standard, non-negotiable resume sections you'll come across:  
\- Personal Information  
\- Resume Summary or Objective  
\- Work Experience  
\- Education  
\- Skills

In the next part, we'll discuss effective and avoidable resume headings for standard sections. 👇

✅ **Personal Information.** Just a variation of the above. Still good and to the point.  
❌ **About Me.** Too vague; it sounds more like a bio or personal statement than a section with contact details.

&#x200B;

✅ **Resume Summary.** A brief overview of your career accomplishments and significant skills.  
❌ **My Career Story**. Sounds like a bedtime story, but we're aiming to wake up the recruiter with your qualifications!

&#x200B;

✅ **Career Objective.** A glimpse into the direction you're aiming for in your professional journey.  
❌ **Hopes and Dreams.** Your career aspirations are important, but let's keep it a tad more professional.

&#x200B;

✅ **Work Experience.** The most common headline for this section. No frills. It just works.  
❌ **Places I Worked At.** Too casual; this isn't a travel diary.

&#x200B;

✅ **Education.** Classic and straightforward. It's universally understood.  
❌ **Where I Studied.** Not a mystery novel's title.

&#x200B;

✅ **Strengths.** A reflection of both your innate talents and honed skills that differentiate you.  
❌ **Things I Can Do.** Sounds like a magic trick introduction, doesn't it?

&#x200B;

Hence, the key thing to remember is that while creativity can set you apart in many areas of a resume, when it comes to headings, it's best to stick to the tried and tested, simple forms. For example:  
✅Yes: ""Education""  
❌No: ""Where I Studied""  


Choose your headings wisely and set the stage for a resume that resonates and gets results.

17xdg66,Urgent Decision Dilemma: EdTech Stability vs. Solar Startup Potential - Need Your Expertise?,"Hey there, amazing Reddit community!

I'm facing a crucial career decision and would genuinely appreciate your expertise in helping me out.

I'm a 23-year-old based in a metropolitan city in India, fresh out of a BSc degree program. I've landed two job offers, each pulling me in different directions, and I'm in dire need of your collective wisdom to make the right call.

First off, there's an offer from the highly reputed EdTech giant, Allen Digital. The role they're proposing is a Sales Representative position, focused on their courses. It's a purely inside sales role with no fieldwork involved. The package they're offering is 4.80 LPA, albeit without any incentives due to the nature of the role.

The other tempting offer is from a budding solar energy startup. The role here is also in sales, but it requires direct fieldwork as a Solar Sales Representative. The package is slightly higher at 5.30 LPA, with a potential additional incentive of 2 LPA based on their policy. However, here's the kicker – I'll need to invest in a bike for field visits, something I don't currently own.

I do have a year's worth of experience in the EdTech industry. Both opportunities are based in Jaipur.

I'm stuck between the known stability of the EdTech industry and the potential rewards of the solar startup. Your insights, advice, or any personal experiences would immensely help me navigate this life-changing decision.

Forget the idea that your dream job will magically appear on the first try—life's not that simple. The real treasures are discovered through a bit of trial, error, and a healthy dose of curiosity. Trust me, I say this as a hockey player turned civil engineer turned tech CEO. It took me several trials and errors before I found what I really wanted to pursue in my professional life.  
Firstly, trying new things is like a self-discovery treasure hunt. Each new job or challenge is a chance to find hidden talents and use skills you didn't know you had. It's the ultimate growth hack, helping you refine your goals and become a superhero version of yourself.  
But there's more. Jumping into uncharted territory strengthens your adaptability and resilience muscles. The job market is like a rollercoaster, and being okay with change is your golden ticket. 🎫  
The perfect fit is like a puzzle, and you don't solve it without trying different pieces. Your dream job or fantastic business idea won't just fall into your lap. It's the explorers, risk-takers, and ""let's see what happens"" types who end up creating the cool stuff.  
Trying new things isn't just about jobs; it's about creating a career that excites you. Be open to new experiences, embrace the unknown, and watch your career mojo skyrocket. Your future self will thank you for it. 🚀",kickresume,1,1.0,0,1700219987,2023-11-17 11:19:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xcvwz/heres_why_trial_and_error_in_your_career_is_your/,11,2023

17xbfey,Flexible working advice,"Hello,

I'm looking for some advice on how to approach a request for flexible working with my new employer, having only started 4 months ago. In the period between successfully being offered the job and starting. My partner was diagnosed with a chronic, debilitating health condition which will not improve. We're both young, early 30s and I want to ensure we can do/travel as much as possible before her health declines further. 

My employer offers the opportunity to apply for flexible working, though this is done on a discretionary basis. The actual parameters of which I'm not fully aware of. 

The initial application is a form which consists of a few questions, followed by a face to face meeting to discuss in more detail.  Two of the questions I am looking for some guidance on the best way to answer are as follows, 'impact of the alternative working pattern, how will this impact the company and your colleagues? ' followed by 'how can this impact on your colleagues and company be dealt with?' obviously having just started with the company and not being in a analytical role within the company. I think it's impossible to say how this change to my days/hours would have a detrimental affect. 

Any advice from anyone who has approached this before would be very welcomed. 

The industry is public transport and the changes to my hours would be to work only monday-friday. 

Thanks",callmezimmy41,1,0.5,0,1700213713,2023-11-17 09:35:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xbfey/flexible_working_advice/,11,2023
17xa8wf,In a rut with current job that has no growth,"So I work as a project manager for a translation company. I’ve been here 3 years and I have realized by the end of year 1 that there’s not really much opportunity for professional growth and development, partly because of management and the way the company runs and the type of work they do. As a PM I basically do the same thing every day, receiving these small projects I input in our internal software and deliver files to the client.  There’s barely any thinking involved, it’s just menial work that almost feel robotic. I don’t even have a portfolio to show projects I’ve worked on because the type of stuff I handle aren’t really my “projects”, they are just files that need to be translated and I act as a middle-man between sales people and linguists. When I got a promotion after 1.5 years, nothing in my day-to-day really changed. That’s when i should’ve really understood that I am going nowhere with this company.

I stuck it out for as long as I have now because to be honest for a while back I was happy to simply get paid and get to do whatever I want outside of work. Unfortunately after years of being complacent i now feel very depressed and feel as though I’ve wasted years of my life not learning anything I could use as leverage to get elsewhere. Yes, I blame the shitty company I’m in but I know I am also to blame for allowing myself to be complacent and idle. 

My problem now is that I do not know how to get out of this. I feel stuck because I feel like I have nowhere else to go because I just don’t have skills that would apply.

I really would appreciate any advice especially if anyone out there has been in similar situations or have felt completely stuck in their professional life before.",Peanutss789,1,1.0,3,1700208364,2023-11-17 08:06:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17xa8wf/in_a_rut_with_current_job_that_has_no_growth/,11,2023

I was hired for a 6 month contract on a project along with several other people. About halfway through the contract they pulled me in a meeting and said they ran out of work and that I needed to stop working immediately. I became unemployed overnight with no notice.

I assumed that all of us got put on hold. But I still have access to everything so I can see that they are full of shit and everyone else is still getting work and making money.

I'm not sure why I was singled out, but I'm really pissed off at the situation.

I got an email that they may want to bring me back on in a month or so, and I'm not sure how I want to respond. Part of my wants to say fuck you, you treated me like shit and broke our agreement, so why would I come back?

17x7irv,Career Path that offers the most free time and flexibility? ( with good job stability),"I just finished my undergrad in psych, really love learning about the human mind and body. Of course, the first suggestion would be to become a psychologist or counselor, however, I simply don't see myself doing research in a specific niche for years, and working in that type of setting. I would get along with those like-minded individuals though.  
 Don't get me wrong, I enjoy reading research, but do not necessarily enjoy the process.  
That being said, I've concluded that I would like to be able to have free time to study psychology, neuroscience, nutrition, etc, and perhaps make content, write articles, or something like that. It would be nice to apply that type of knowledge, but it seems those types of positions aren't necessarily well-paid.  
If it helps, I do find joy in analyzing different types of data, investigating online, using different software/hardware to achieve certain things, and constantly exploring the potential of technology.

17x5vio,"Suffering from extreme burnout, but am terrified of the job market.","I’ve been at my current company for just over a year and it’s been the most stressful time of my entire life. When I first started, the whole entire team I was supposed to be joining quit and I was expected to take over ALL of their duties. I understandably couldn’t handle it and my boss shamed me for “not being a go getter” and supposedly being “unreliable” because I did not answer him one weekend, even though I gave him a heads up that I was going away and would not have cell service.

My company has now fired over half of our in office staff and outsourced it to India. My boss said I could keep my job if I became an independent contractor. I have the same responsibilities and need to work certain hours and attend required meetings as I did before. The only difference is that now I don’t need to be in office every day. I’m pretty sure this is illegal employee misclassification, but that’s beside the point.

I thought I’d feel much better once I started working from home. I don’t. I’m still doing the job of 3 people. I’m still subject to the company’s disorganized bullshit (e.g. last week my boss told me I needed to send a spreadsheet to one of our investors asap and told me who to add and CC on it. I said ok sending now. He said great. Once I sent it, the CEO of our company replied and told me to never send a spreadsheet to the investor ever again and that everything needed to be approved by him first).

I promised the man I would go check and see if we had the ingredients necessary to bake a fresh batch of Boston Cream doughnuts. 

Because my manager told me to, I offered the man a free doughnut. The dough nut could be any kind that we had, it would be the customer’s choice. The man could also have a hot chocolate. He consumed the jelly doughnut and the hot chocolate while we made a batch of Boston Cream doughnuts.

17wyc0t,Pls Help-Monday interview,"I’m searching around for a new job for better work / life balance and have an interview scheduled on Monday. 

In my current role as a proposal writer I’m expected to be available around the clock when there’s an active proposal. This means on-call. So if I get a message at 7PM, I better have caught it or I could miss something really important that will effect the project. Or if I’m out with my family for dinner and miss something, then I might not be around my PC in enough time to resolve the issue. It feels like I can never turn things off. I can’t really enjoy weekends because I need to continually check my phone and be ready for impromptu meetings or responses. Some weeks I work 50 or more hours without hardly seeking my husband who lives in the same 2bedroom apartment. I can’t plan trips on the weekends because of proposals and they often take a month to two months to submit. The timeline is unpredictable and I never truly know when the next will happen. Sometimes I’m juggling multiple at once.

I understand that it’s part of the job and all but it’s getting so bad I’m waking up with panic attacks, putting on weight, and having back issues. I’m 28 and feel like I’m physically 90.

I know a proposal manager who reached out about an opportunity a few weeks ago and I declined because I started this job 5months ago after being laid off and don’t want to look like a job hopper. But since the work/life balance is so bad, I decided to reach back out to her and see what’s available.

Just today, she told me about a proposal writing role focused on technical volumes which was exciting and she told me that they don’t have as many of the same expectations when it comes to availability during a proposal.

Then she said her HR rep is out of office next week for the holidays so she had me submit my resume TODAY and then I had an interview nearly 2hrs later and stumbled over everything because there were a lot of nervous feelings with just finding out about a role and interviewing for it the same day.

I still haven’t made total peace with leaving in only five months of starting this awful job. But I wanted to know if I could maybe find something better.

Now I have a follow-on meeting next Monday with the owner, HR rep, and a SME.

Do you have any recommendations for solid work-life balance questions to help determine if they will wind up expecting the same on-call behavior, what the average hours a week looks like, and if I can manage to drive an hour from my home without working about phone calls or meetings for 1-2 months at a time.

17wy8hi,Is it worth leaving over?,"I am brand new to the field and have no perspective, please give me some. Advice on how to not let it get to me would be appreciated 

I am in research with a bachelors in ME, I graduated last year. My work has started funneling grad students through my old mentor, they are how and why I have the job.

The first of what I assume to be many grad students is dead weight who I did their internship for so I wouldn’t look bad/data is out. Coworker crunched data last minute for presentation, same reason. They put me in charge per se so I felt if it didn’t happen it would be blamed on me. Grad student is in their first year but have no desire to do the work, at all. They now take up 20% of my workweek as I babysit them. I do have other projects but this project doesn’t get worked on at all unless I’m doing it. I have tried listing tasks so they might pick some up, nope. I say “you” and they come back with “we”. Won’t talk to strangers. It’s just extreme handholding while I felt like I barely made it in the door last year after working my ass off, independently. 

One coworker has complained and they don’t take them seriously or maybe don’t care. I have expressed indirectly that this person is taking too much of my time. I feel a direct statement will make things bad politically. I did get a bonus for “mentoring” over the summer. At first I was so happy but then started wondering if this is placating. Could it be an acknowledgement of “we know, here’s some money about it”?

With plans for more people coming in, I can’t stand the thought of this person plus more and more to take up more of my time. I am very resentful of this person at this point and am having trouble compartmentalizing, thinking about it outside work. 

I think I could get paid more for possibly less. But would they expect crazy overtime? Would I have to deal with really bad sexism and not just micro-aggressions? It could be worse even with more money, so it’s scary. 

Even with the red flags (this whole thing, hands off sink or swim training except for special people apparently?, lower pay but not embarassing), is it worth staying for the positives (work/life balance, nice people, nice office, interesting work) ? Will I leave and find greener pastures?

It was working full-time at a home and auto store that inspired me to go back to school in my late 20s to find something that paid better and wasn’t so tedious and thankless. Due to my success academically, I was also sought out to become a math tutor at the community college where I started my degree. There was talk of keeping me on staff after graduating but that died when the department was hit with steep budget cuts and limitations due to covid.   


I’ve been following the advice and guidelines offered to me by academic career service centers to apply and interview for jobs in the Electrical/Computer Engineering field, but it seems it’s a tough market right now and while I get phone interviews and the occasional sit-down interview, I’ve had no luck getting offers.   


In the meantime, I’ve gotten a part-time retail job to pay bills and try to start saving up while I wait for a salaried job so that I can move out from living with my ex who I’m in the process of divorcing.   


I’m realizing that most “Engineering Environments” aren’t very appealing to me at all. High stress, long hours, rigid structures, toxic hustle cultures with low regard for mental health, and poor work-life balance and boundaries have me worried there is a real chance of burnout in the future if I do break into the field.   


I got into engineering because I loved learning how things work and building fun small projects in my spare time that simplified daily tasks or were just fun and silly in novel ways. By junior year of my degree program, I knew engineering was not my passion but I had come so far and did so well academically that I was convinced to stick it out because having that degree would benefit me more than dropping out would. After my most recent interview ended with them having me sit to take a 30-page pencil and paper electrical/computer exam I’m really starting to think I want to go in a different direction.  


I really enjoy being in nature, building things, coding some things has felt rewarding like solving a puzzle. I also really liked the idea of improving people's lives as an engineer. If I have any passion at all it’s in music/art, but my novice guitar and songwriting skills definitely won’t pay the bills.   


I don’t need to make six figures out of the gate, I’d honestly be floored to find a steady safe job with benefits that pays enough for me to finally move out. I'd prefer to be in a position that isn’t high-stress or in danger of blindside layoffs like the ones currently happening to some of my former classmates. I wouldn’t even mind tedious. If I could make enough money to afford an apartment, pay off school bills, and save up to buy a house of my own, I’d take a retail job. The faster I could get into that position the better, living with my ex out of necessity is very demoralizing.  


I’m wondering which alternative career fields could I potentially branch out to with my degree that would allow me to live a modest life where I’m not constantly fretting about having enough money to survive. I’m a quick/motivated learner and am more than willing to teach myself new skills or complete personal projects to become more employable.

I’m currently still applying to Electrical/Computer/Embedded Engineer roles but am starting to try to think outside the box for other potential career field options. I’m willing to start at lower-end positions that don’t require my degree and work my way up to better paying positions but my knowledge of what’s out there is very limited. I’ve gotten mixed answers when it comes to asking about switching to an IT related role, but I’d be open to getting certifications for roles like that if it would make me more employable in any field. 

Any advice, tips, similar experiences, or direction would be greatly appreciated. After hunting for a job for six months without an end in sight, I need all the help I can get. Thanks for reading this far.

17wwtko,From niche industry to laid off - where to go?,"Hello all, 

I'm hoping to get some advice or feedback on potentially where I should move my career. Little bit of background - started as a plumber and quickly got out of that to get into something tech related as that's what I was always tinkering or working on. Got into a entry level position with a mapping technology company, moved up to a manager of the team that I was working on. Everything was proprietary and tools were developed in house. I did no coding or things of that nature. I dealt with managing teams of 5-50+, workflow enhancement, data auditing, workflow analysis/ improvement, quality assurance /control, software testing, and training people.. these sorts of things.

I enjoy collaboration with teams, remote or in person is fine, just looking for some roles that my skills will transfer to, and that way I have some things to target when applying.",Flybeck2,2,1.0,0,1700167134,2023-11-16 20:38:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wwtko/from_niche_industry_to_laid_off_where_to_go/,11,2023
17wwmon,Mentally unwell and feeling incompetent at my job. Should I quit?,"I'm a 34F working in a corporate office as a in house design PM. Before joining this firm, I was at a big design agency as one of the youngest project lead. I was very confident and I always got people telling me how great I am at my job. 

I switched job for better work life balance, but it's been very unfulfilling. I'm getting very little recognition and opportunity, even though I have more experience than a lot of people here. On top of that, the project I was in charge of when I got hired went on indefinite hold, so my role has become more like an assistant PM to other projects. I am still good at the job, but my boss has no idea.

I spoke to my boss over the past year, that I wanted to take on more, but my boss says that there's nothing she can do. She mentioned that the company values longevity other than performance or accomplishment, and she is only comfortable working with the two people on team that were hired before me. 

I finally got a decent project after 1.5 years of working here. I worked really hard hoping to prove myself. But I got so nervous at the big presentation today, and did not do a good job as i expected. One exec asked me to slow down, and another exec asked a question that I was trying to answer, but took too much time explaining. 

I feel horrible after, i think my boss probably liked me even less. I've been looking for a job for a while, but the market is so bad that I haven't got much luck finding a job I like or one that does not require a 70 hour work week.

I'm lost and I just want to quit at this point. Even if that means that I will have no income, I probably would feel better mentally. I would have to use my savings and be supported by my husband. He makes less money than me and has only been freelancing.

17wvi3w,What are my options within Client Services or how can I pivot with my current skill set?,"I am based put of a South East Asian Country, with a Bachelors in Business Administration from a decent college.

I have worked in a startup for 2.5 years in client servicing, moving up 3 times from Analyst to Consultant across the 2.5 years, after starting out rough, I managed to quickly find my rhythm and kept moving up being mentored by one of the co-founders and by help of my seniors and peers.

After some structural changes, I left the organisation as the org had changed a lot and the business was evolving.

I moved to a multinational NASDAQ listed IT Consulting firm, I joined as an Analyst (Title took a hit but it was an upward move in terms of pay, 30% base increase from the start up job) and have now been promoted to Senior Analyst within the Client Services unit.

My core skills are account management, query management, client servicing, and key account management.

Now the problem is, the part of IT landscape I am in is evolving and the role is as well, its moving more towards inside sales rather than client management. So, I am looking for a new job but I am not able to find anything that competes with my base pay. 

Everywhere I look, either my paper qualifications don’t meet the criteria or the pay is not enough, I have been looking on LinkedIn Jobs primarily and all the recommendations are for starter roles.

I am worried that I haven’t gathered enough transferable skills or core skills to have secured employment throughout my life, and I am worried it’s now too late to start over and develop hard skills.

Looking for any advice on what could be my next steps in

1. Looking for better opportunities if they exist in client servicing.

2. If client servicing is a dead end, how can I pivot without taking too much of a pay hit.

3. What can be a career path in Client Services.

17wv7z8,Im stuck,"**BEFORE STARTING**

Im a 3rd out of 5 year medical student. When i started medical school i was very unsure of it, i didnt know what i wanted to do and never thought of perhaps taking a gap year to figure things out. But i decided i enjoyed science the most in school and i guess my family are all doctors so it's the thing i thought i was most interested in (i had nothing else). I did feel a bit of pressure from my parents as they are both doctors and that's what they wanted for me but i definitely could have tried to convince them to do something else but the problem Was i had nothing else, it was unclear so i went with it.

**NOW**

So the past 2 years i got very good grades somehow, i was able to study and push through the subjects. The subjects can be interesting to me, sometimes i find myself wanting to learn more about a certain topic, now,    when it gets to exam time or having to study on a strict schedule that's when i start hating it.
If im honest the workload is a lot however i definitely know i can do it, because as i said i dont despise it, i definitely find the information i learn interesting, how complicated our bodies are etc etc. 

**Myskills/Interests**

Im off right now and for the past few months i learnt how to code and honestly it was a breath of fresh air wasn't as bad as i thought it was and it's actually fun. I wouldn't know if its something i want to pursue though. I've been trying new skills and new things like coding, gym, it kind feels like im trying to escape from the doubts about med school though. I even though about somehow starting an online business so that i can quit medicine 😭

I have noticed im a learner, i enjoy learning new things even outside my field whether it's geography history computer or anything else tho

Even in med school i prefered studying at home and working through things in my own time, makes me wonder if being a doc is for me. 

**MY PROBLEM**


I can probably push through the remaining years but my worry is in the after medical school, it really feels like an endless amount of studying and the residency and work seems to really take a toll on peoples mental health. Idk if im suited to be a doctor, i feel like im not that selfless to the point id wanna sacrifice work life balance for someone but maybe im wrong who knows. It feels like there are easier ways to make a living, ways that don't strip you of your time,maybe even a more ludicrous career. 

Also im an introvert (not great at communicating) and it's like i dont even enjoy talking to people much nor do i have a burning desire to save lives, you know?

Like i feel like with engineering or CS for example one can struggle through uni and then be more relaxed when doing  the job, with med it's like even after school you gotta go through torturous residency and stuff. (could be wrong tho) 
 

It feels like im indecisive and I'll never know if a career is for me be that medicine or something like computer science for example, suppose i wanted to switch to CS how can i know i wont get doubts again or i wont hate it man, i feel lost. 

I don't have any debt as im not usa based i guess thats good.  

Also being responsible for someones life it's like bruh is this even me, it's probably very stressful dealing with death and stuff even though I'm sure there are different types of specialities. 

Could i be over thinking, over worrying about the future, what shouod i do, drop out or no, drop out and do what. Im really worried about after med school and residency and all the night shifts I'll have to do. Making me regret my decision to start medicine 


**i doubt I'll drop out though, especially since i dont know what i would do for Sure to replace medicine, it would also be hard to explain it to my family, the question is  will medicine be worth it in the end for me, or would a more laid back career like cs or something be better idk**",DamageSure909,1,1.0,2,1700162918,2023-11-16 19:28:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wv7z8/im_stuck/,11,2023

I could not remember everything in the videos after watching them just one time. Hence, why I screwed up about 8 million times during the four weeks I spent working there before being laid off.

I happen to have high functioning autism. One of the symptoms of high functioning autism is slow processing speed. I cannot just hear or see something once and then memorise it. I have to see/hear it multiple times.

Fast forward a few months. I apply to and get a job at Dollar General. As was the case when I worked at Dunkin Donuts, I had to watch some video tutorials, before actually doing on the floor training. I asked the permission of my supervisor to have my phone with me, so I could video record. That way, I could go home, listen to the recording and take notes. My supervisor said that that was okay.

At the end of my first day of training, my supervisor told me that I was scheduled to work my next shift in a week. A day before I was scheduled to work my second day, I received a call from my supervisor, informing me that I have been laid off.

17wu6ty,"Graduating in a year, unsure about major and future","
I’m about to wrap up the first semester of my fourth year at college with one more year to go. My major is Cybersecurity, a field I was once really interested in but have slowly realized that it is definitely not for me. I enjoyed it at first, especially learning how to program in Python, but now that I’ve started to hit the higher courses and have spent more time in my work-study and studying certifications, I’ve realized that it isn’t really for me. 

So my main problem now is deciding what I actually want to do when I graduate. Changing my major is out of the question due to the extra time I already have to put in school and the fact that I’m so close to graduation, but the time to get an internship is fast approaching. 

So, what are some career options that could be somewhat tech-related but not really IT. Primarily ones that would deal with Python, as it is the one thing that I have found consistent joy doing. I’ve heard that there are jobs that have you work with Excel and other spreadsheets that can be pretty much automated with Python, but I’m unsure if these jobs even exist, if they’re attainable, and if they’re actually as good as people say they are.

Are there any jobs like? Or jobs similar to this that I could possibly do well at and enjoy?",breadforbrains,1,1.0,0,1700160216,2023-11-16 18:43:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wu6ty/graduating_in_a_year_unsure_about_major_and_future/,11,2023
17wtqwy,Do I stay or go?,"I’ll try to keep this short and summarize things into points:

-Currently at small and new commercial hvac business as intern for 2 months now, 6 month contract

-Internship duties were never clearly defined, I’m now fully responsible for what a  former FT employee did on top on anything and everything else he sees fit which has included driving all over the place at sometimes ungodly hours (construction starts early for field like 4-5am but I’m supposed to be in office) and handling a very important software implementation that he has barely been involved in (he even sent me outta state my second week to go to a training he was supposed to attend)

-Owner keeps pressing me to decide on whether I’m gonna stay and even already offered me a job to basically continue what I’m doing at a whole whopping $1 more an hour despite already being like $10 less an hour than what I was making previously

-He wants me to become a PM but that will take years before I even have the baseline knowledge to know what im actually talking about but keeps hyping it up as a 6 figure career etc

-Other PM told me he’s still not making 6 figures after 2.5 years and this guy regularly works OT and starts earlier than normal hours often due meetings w clients onsite (again construction timelines). Basically 10-12 hr days on a semi frequent basis.

-I’m worried if I leave I’ll be back at square one job search wise which was already hard enough in the current climate

Feeling very conflicted and don’t know what to do. Am I just being a bitch or am I being taken advantage of under the guise of a pipe dream?

17wtkwb,I do nothing at work - it’s not normal and it’s really bringing me down.,"I just don’t see ANY point in doing ANY work anymore. I just don’t get it. The connection between “working” and “earning money to live a life” or “getting satisfaction from working hard” has been severed for me. 

Background: I struggle with depression and think I have ADHD but I think this problem might be even deeper than both. I’m on medication for the depression and it’s not bad at all anymore. I’m getting assessed for ADHD but it seems like if I have it it’s pretty mild. I also am an addict and have been sober off weed/booze for 12 months.

I have worked hard in the past but usually when I’m under pressure to perform (eg brand new in the job or got a really tight deadline) and only for a short time - like 6 months max, usually much less. My whole career has been marked by really enjoying jobs early on when I’m new and fresh and then losing all motivation.

I had a major career crash in 2022 after ten years at the same company. I was successful there and got promoted. But I always felt like a square peg in a round hole forcing myself to do it, and after a major depressive breakdown I stopped doing any work. I literally stopped doing anything. Totally burnt out unhappy and disillusioned with my entire career. Before long I got fired which wasn’t such a bad thing. Decided to make a major career overhaul. Left the line of work I had been in for 12 years which was really brain-dead and stressful but really well paid. Instead I moved into another line of work which is kind of related but the environment is totally different. I’m paid quite a bit less but it seems more interesting, more enjoyable, less stressful and there’s a chance for upward progression in the long term. 

However within six months of this new job I had got to the usual point of “how little work can I get away with doing”. I spend entire days just staring out the window, surfing the net, messing around making music. When I know my reputation is on the line I can put effort into preparing for meetings so I impress the right people and look good. But anything else gets postponed or I just ignore it. On Monday I had two 30min zoom meetings with my camera and mic off and then took the rest of the day off - like over 5 hours. I have raised with my manager that I don’t have a lot on and she just tells me it’s a quiet time of year, things will pick up, I’m still learning the basics, be patient. I think she is probably checked-out too as she’s job hunting but she still gets a lot done. I’m the first person she has ever managed. 

My manager thinks I’m great because I’m intelligent, upbeat and confident. And I also come with a lot of privilege that biases people in favour of me (I’m a straight white male, well educated, nice accent, dress well). So people always like having me around and assume the best of me. 

It just seems like whatever job I do I have always ended up sitting around coasting along, doing the bare minimum, eventually getting bored then getting depressed. I know I should be trying to find ways to add value, asking to take on new projects or doing all my work upfront instead of right before the deadline. I just have zero motivation. None. I literally don’t care. 

I wish I was the sort of person who threw themselves into their work, got stuff done and felt good after a hard days work. I feel so much guilt and shame just coasting through what should be the best years of my life and most productive years of my career.

I’m not even complaining; I’m just honestly asking for an answer…?","Like seriously, is there anyone here who didn’t go to a top nationally recognized business school, majoring in supply chain for their bachelor’s degree, or engineering? Who actually ended up making $70,000 or $80,000 entry-level after doing a top-tier internship paying over $60,000? And are they working in top companies right now, like Johnson & Johnson, Merck, L’Oréal, Estée Lauder, Church & Dwight, Unilever, Amazon, or Walmart, etc.?

 I want to know if there’s anybody who went to a no-name state school who actually made that kind of money entry-level out of school, and who is currently making over $100,000 a year, making six figures. I also want to know, in the last 10 years, if anyone did go to any of those “bullshit” no name regional state colleges outside of the top 100 nationally, did they become a vice president making over $250,000 a year, just like the MIT graduate or the Michigan State University or Penn State or Rutgers graduate did with just a bachelors degree…

17ws0w9,School Psychologist Turned Felon,"All,

Can anyone help me brainstorm ideas for what I might entertain in terms of a career?

Long story short, about ten years ago I went to graduate school and earned two degrees in school psychology (administering IQ tests, social-emotional assessments, creating behavior intervention plans, consulting, determining eligibility for special education, counseling, IEP development, etc.). 

It was my dream to become a school psych since I was in my early 20s (I grew up in a abusive and poverty-stricken home setting, so I had a lot of childhood traumas that impacted my educational experience; thus, the field struck a heart string and my passion developed in wanting to help in youth development. Also, I enjoy data/science, which the field is largely based on.

Unfortunately, around 4 years ago, I was 33 and caught with growing marijuana in my closet for personal use (long story how I was caught but it was a freak set of circumstances—law enforcement was not investigating me or anything; just an unfortunate set of rare events led to it). So, I was arrested and ultimately did no jail time. Just 2 years probation in what is called Drug Court or Recovery Court. This, I am grateful for. What I was not grateful for was the prosecutor demanded the revocation of my certification to practice—I ultimately had to agree to his terms (in the US, society basically bans those who have a record from working in schools—which is understandable, but I don’t personally agree with it when it comes to marijuana use in one’s personal life).

So, at 33 I went from being a well respected school psychologist to an unemployed convicted felon. i jumped at any job opportunity I could find that would at least pay the bills until I figured out my next step. 

I was able to find a job doing sales consulting for a residential solar company and did that for 3 years. I did well there. Then around a year ago, I jumped to another solar company to further develop my skills, etc. but the company recent got rid of their division, so I am once again unemployed. 

I’ve thought of going back to school (law, healthcare, master’s in counseling, etc.) but given my record, there are many barriers. Not only that, but I’m 38 with a shit ton of student loans I was planning to have forgiven through the public service loan program. So, to say the least, I am broke. 

Can anyone help? My main goal at this point is to find a job that pays well— as I’ve said, money is tight and I’m in a lot of debt. I’ve looked at other solar companies and it’s not all too great right now in NJ. I’ve looked at other sales positions (pharma, HVAC, etc. both those typically require experience and I am finding no entry stuff). 

I’ve struggled daily with major depression and anxiety from this for the last 4 years. The irony is that a senator in my state i(NJ) s proposing bill that would make it legal to do exactly what I did (growing MJ for personal use). I guess I showed up too early to the “party” …joking cause as of now, I can never have the record expunged—no second chances for me due to the harsh legislations of the 70s-80s (the War on Drugs).

The best prospect at the moment is a possible future opening through a friend would works at Commvault (major international company)… but that is no guarantee. 

Thank you to anyone who reads or has thoughts or feedback. I’m tired of sharing my woes with friends and family (as I’m sure they are, too).",Nervous_Knowledge_60,2,0.75,1,1700154495,2023-11-16 17:08:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ws0w9/school_psychologist_turned_felon/,11,2023
17wryfl,Advice on career change from PMO support to Project manager,"Hello, 

Looking for some career advice and suggestions. If you know any groups or spaces that could help. 

Total experience is close to 4 yrs.Currently doing PMO support (pmo experience 2.5 yrs) in a consulting firm. The whole support role feels kinda dull, and I'm not finding it interesting. The work, reports, and presentations don't seem to add much value. I am not keen on getting stuck in this role. Project management as a whole is cool but not the support role🙃

So, I'm reaching out to fellow project managers or anyone with tips on how to step up in the project management world. Trying to figure out how to land a project manager role without the typical experience. Most places want someone with PM experience, I don't have any. 

Certifications like Prince 2, PMP, CAPM seem like a path, but do they really make a difference when it comes to job opportunities? Feels like there is more to it?

If you are a project manager  without the usual experience ,please help me out how to grow in this career. I could use some guidance🥲",Separate-Schedule695,1,1.0,3,1700154313,2023-11-16 17:05:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wryfl/advice_on_career_change_from_pmo_support_to/,11,2023
17wrt99,Master's degree student in finance: I don't know what to do with my life.,"Good morning, I am a 23-year-old guy in the second year of a master's degree in Economics and Finance. In January, I will finish my last exams, and after that, I will only have to complete an internship and write my thesis (18 credits).  
For a few months now, I can't think of anything else but my future career. I find myself just a step away from completing my studies, and I have no idea what I want to do next.  
I partly blame my choice of master's degree: it's a finance master's that is not excessively quantitative, legal, or business-oriented. I've covered almost everything but nothing specifically, and nothing has either excited me or disgusted me.  
Now that it's time to look for an internship and choose a thesis topic, I find myself in quite a difficulty. I've had some informational interviews at the career day organized by my university, and I've mainly leaned towards traditional consulting firms (I know well what is said about them, but for a short internship where I have the opportunity to see many things, it could be a sensible choice). Even here, I struggled a bit to decide which branch of consulting I wanted to enter. Initially, I had completely ruled out audit because accounting entries and auditing were never a passion, but then, reflecting on other areas such as M&A or due diligence, I realized that they were still closely related to financial issues. For this reason, in fact, I am considering whether to accept one of the various proposals for an audit internship in a big4.  
I also thought about risk management, an area of ​​interest to me, but without the quantitative foundations of a STEM, it seemed quite out of reach.  
Compliance? Not very developed legal foundations, except for a couple of exams in banking legislation.  
Asset management? Non-target university, my GPA is close to 30, but I still don't think it's enough. Moreover, it seems like an extremely competitive area with significant entry barriers.  
I also thought about taking an exam instead of an internship to write a good thesis and finish by July, but even in that case, I wouldn't know what topic to choose. Since it is crucial for my future career, I would like to make a well-considered choice.  
(I thought about something on derivatives that I am really enjoying in a course I am taking, but even in that case, it seems that dealing with them professionally requires much higher quantitative skills than mine).  
In all this, like everyone else, I would still like to have a decent career in terms of compensation (not struggling with €1500 for a lifetime, in short). I am willing to work long hours in the first few years (typical of big4), but then, rightly, I would like to transition to a not excessively alienating work-life balance.  
This is a summary of my current situation. Has anyone else been in my shoes before? Any suggestions on how to get through it?",frankyantony,1,1.0,4,1700153965,2023-11-16 16:59:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wrt99/masters_degree_student_in_finance_i_dont_know/,11,2023

17wqlv8,Taking a 20-30k paycut to possibly be happier at work?,"Hi all,  
  
Need some advice from fellow redditors.  
  
I joined my current company in a digital marketing role just over a year ago, when the market was super hot. In terms of compensation, I lucked out, securing a HUGE paybump (90k to 150k+), a bump in title (Mgr to Sr Mgr), great benefits, and remote work.  
  
But since I've been there, the company has been a mess. It is an extremely young startup with very immature leadership who scaled extremely quickly during the low interest money times of COVID. We haven't been closing deals and I've since survived 2 layoffs that impacted my team by about 80%. While I am grateful to remain employed, I am now doing the work of what was originally 5 people and have had my asks for resources turned down.  
  
Some weeks are fine, other weeks I am extremely stressed, dealing with a lot finger pointing from Sales and executives who don't value or understand my work, and crying multiple times from the stress/blame. I've had a couple of good interviews, but pretty much every role I've been able to secure an interview has been for a lower salary (around 20-30k less) which seems more market rate for my role right now. Currently I am just trying to keep cashing the checks, save, and not to burn out while I look for something else, but as we all know, it's slim pickings out there.  
  
Recently, I've been interviewing with a company that gets me really excited; it's a B2B niche that really sounds like a lot of fun to work in and I feel like I could make an impact. The company is growing, and I've had great conversations with the CMO who really seems like a smart, empathetic leader who isn't a blowhard. I'm getting the feeling that I'd love working for him. But the pay and benefits would definitely be a tradeoff.  
  
Am I crazy to entertain giving up 20-30k salary, amazing benefits, etc? Should I keep trying to stick it out and put up better boundaries at work until the market improves? What have you done in similar situations? I can survive on the lower salary, it just slows down certain milestones, like saving up for a downpayment on a house. And it sucks to feel like you're going backwards.

17wqjbv,Is this a good answer to the question about an obstacle that you overcame?,"One question that some interviewers ask is this; 

Tell me about a problem you overcame at a past occupation. 

I was asked that question when I was interviewed for a job at Home Depot. I did not get the job. I do not remember what I said. I believe I made up a story. The made up story supposedly happened in college. 

I recently thought of an answer that I could give if that question is asked to me when I am interviewed for a job at Lowe’s tomorrow. I will describe the answer and you tell me if this sounds like a good answer. 

When I worked at Dunkin Donuts, one customer tried to pay with a gift card. I did not know what I was supposed to do, what button I was supposed to press on the cash register. That was actually covered in the videos I had to watch during the training session. However, I forgot. 

The solution to the process was two fold. 

First, I consulted the subreddit r/DunkinDonuts to ask for advice on how to perform that process. 

Second, I made a decision. From now on, at any job where I have to watch some video tutorials before undergoing on the floor training, I will either take notes or use my phone to record the audio from the videos, then I will go home and watch the videos that I recorded on my phone an study them. This way, I will memorise the information faster.",bigelow6698,1,1.0,4,1700150820,2023-11-16 16:07:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wqjbv/is_this_a_good_answer_to_the_question_about_an/,11,2023

I graduated this year and just started my first full time role as an SDR for a SaaS company in a weird niche. 

I know the transition from college to 40 hour work weeks is a factor, but the industry I’m selling in, isn’t something of interest to me. I don’t see myself here long term, and don’t want to move upward within this company because I don’t believe in what we do. 

I’ve been working here now for a month exactly, but 5 work weeks. It was only a 2 week “training period” which they didn’t train me at all really. With no prior sales experience they didn’t teach me anything… just threw me into the fire. No script, nothing, just outbound cold call. This is cold cold calling too, these companies I’m reaching out to about the software have never heard of us and don’t really care about software.


Pretty draining and repetitive… how long should I stay? 

I have my BSBA w an emphasis in marketing, so I’m not really sure what I would look for if I left. Another sales role most likely, I’m just not sure what that would be. I wouldn’t leave unless I had something else lined up. I feel like the outbound cold calling wouldn’t be as bad if my product had brand recognition behind it.

I used to work in journalism as a student, so that’s a great example. I loved prying into topics others ignored and exposing major cases. But aside from NYT correspondents, its not exactly big on the stable and decent paying part.

The other night, I found out a possible new lover, through INTENSE internet digging, escaped a dangerous cult (Insane, I know, still in shock) but then It lead me down this deep rabbit hole of the cult. I now know the ideology that started it a century ago, where its bases are, their rules, their hierarchy, ect. I even found of the names of some of the “anonymous” people who came forward about it.  You could ask me anything and I know. I happily pulled an all nighter collecting all this. Please note, I found this out about him with nothing but a first name as common as “john” despite living in one of the biggest cities in the US where there is at least a million other johns . I am REALLY good at finding things beyond what you would just see on google. Even if it means infiltrating underground niche web forums, getting in on their private text threads ect.  I especially love doing this sort of digging for other people. “Hey bee phobic go find this out for me.” BOOM I am on it.

Most of my experience has been in what some may call the “trenches” of this field. Working with very hard individuals, long hours, no personal life. Instead of leaving the field completely, I changed my mindset to “this will all be worth it”.

I worked my way up and around linear positions. I now work for the county, where I knew going in that this was a good resume booster and I would have a chance to build back my personal mental health and routine. I was asked to apply for a fellowship position with the state, where I would work to help change policies and practices to better help with equity and inclusion. My goal going into this role is to find if this is my “niché”, or to atleast have a chance at learning the system

As I’m typing this, I know this is the path I am distant to take. I have always been in a place of what I see as the “door opening phase”. However being surrounded by my colleagues who are less than enthusiastic about their role (work to live, don’t live to work) I can’t help but wonder if I am the minority. I am the first in my family to be career vested, I am also not surrounded by a lot of peers who are also career vested.

17wmvfe,Any advice for potential career paths related to my cross post?? I'd love to hear your experiences!,"For context, I am majoring in this because of my major interest in fish! I have been fish keeping for over 2 years now, and it made me want to switch my major to this because I thought this would give me a good opportunity to work with fish in some way shape or form in the future. My school didn't offer marine biology, and since I have been at this school for 2 years already as a psych major previously I didn't think it would make sense to try and transfer to another school since I'm in my third year now. I have really enjoyed educating people about proper care for different freshwater species I take care of, and I have also rehabilitated many before and I really enjoy the idea of doing that! I also like the research aspect and have enjoyed seeing microorganisms in a microscope during labs and other things of that nature :) Was I stupid for doing this concentration? For other fish enthusiasts, what kind of jobs do yall have in relation to them and what kind of educational background do you guys have? I honestly just want to learn more about what my potential options can be!

17wm905,Is this the right decision?,"I recently submitted a two-month notice to my current company, where I've been employed in a property role for almost two years with a basic salary of 2.2K. My responsibilities include handling tenants, administrative tasks, maintenance issues and occasional assistance to sales agents, although I've never received any commission despite raising this concern with my manager. Then.. after few months, I raised this concern for the second time, the managers discussed it among themselves. I was then provided with a monthly petrol claim of MYR 50. Additionally, if I successfully close a deal with a tenant for room sales, I will receive a commission of MYR 50, provided they sign a contract for a duration of one year. Then how about those who sign for 6 months only? Isn’t it unfair as I still need to travel since I have to bring them for viewings? going from another building to another building. And with MYR 50, I still find insufficient given the frequent travel involved in managing tenants, plus traffic congestion. Let alone management that is somewhat disorganized.. 

Recently, I received another job offer with a basic salary of 2.8K plus supplementary benefits. The company also has a significant name in Malaysia. When discussing this with my current company, they mentioned a potential promotion to a ""senior"" position. However, I am concerned that the salary for the senior position may be lower than what I’ll be received in another company, as previous staff resigned for similar reasons. Hence, a chose another company to work with next year. 

Am I doing a right decision?",Cultural_Wall_907,1,1.0,0,1700139488,2023-11-16 12:58:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wm905/is_this_the_right_decision/,11,2023

I've spent the last decade of my life working for the gooberment military and law enforcment. I recently left l.e full time and have gone into the corporate security world (not standing guard more intelligence and threat analysis stuff).

The company I work for has a lot of growth opportunity. My question to you is for fellow L.E who have gone down a similar path or anyone in the corperate security world. What courses or trainings do you recommend for professional development and career advancement?

In law enforcement it seemed easy. Find a subject you want to be a SME in and take the courses. But I feel like I'm flying pretty blind here.

17wky6v,From Job Hunt Frustration to AI-Powered Revolution: My Journey & How You Can Be Part of the Next Big Shift in Hiring,"Hi folks!  
Ever just yeet your CV into the Job Boards abyss and hear...nothing? Been there, done that, got the rejection emails to prove it. A while back, I was crushing it in tech project management. But then, outta nowhere, the company pulls a sneaky on me, and I'm out on my ass. Oh, and did I mention my girl dumped me around the same time? Yeah life…….  
So there I was, blasting out job apps like a madman, 20-30 a day. Felt like I was just screaming into the void. But then, over a coffee (and maybe a few beers), an old mate drops this on me: ""Bro, you ever try, like, actually tailoring your CV for each gig?""   
That night, I went full mad mode. Picked my top 5 dream jobs and tailored (without lying lolz!) my Resume for each one. \*\*And guess what? By week's end, I had 4 calls lined up.\*\* That's when the lightbulb went off. Maybe, just maybe, I'd stumbled onto what I was meant to do. I wanted to change the game, make job hunting not suck so much….  
Say hello to \*\*WeHunt\*\*. Okay, the name's a work in progress, but hear me out. I rang up my full-stack buddy who was itching for a side gig. We brainstormed, and bam! WeHunt was born. We partnered up with some big-brain indexers (cost me an arm and a leg, but hey, YOLO) and got access to a whopping 6 million job offers. Then, we set up a vectorDB to store all the CV goodies and started matching them using BERT, with a sprinkle of open-source LLM - LLAMA (finally, something from Meta that doesn't suck).  
So, what's the dream with WeHunt?  
\- \*\*Instant Job Hunting\*\*: Upload your CV (srsly thats all), and we're on the prowl.  
\- \*\*Auto-Fill Job Forms\*\*: Tired of those ""Why us?"" questions? Let our AI handle it as its apply behalf of user.  
\- \*\*No more CV Updates\*\*: Post about a project on LinkedIn or Medium? WeHunt snags it and beefs up your profile.That is, you no longer have to remember to add new achievements to your resume - we will automatically rebuild them so you won't even have to open Wehunt. Although VCs would say that I must be fucked :D  
\- \*\*Chat for Recruiters\*\*: No screening boring calls, just our LLM acting like a mini-you.I was recruiting for my previous team and spent millions of hours reading resumes instead of having the chance to simply ask what I cared about.  
\- \*\*Career Advice\*\*: We'll point you to the best courses and skills, based on real data. We know who gets the job so we can start suggesting after some time what made those candidates get the job.  
So, there you have it. My wild ride from jobless to startup founder. If you're tired of the same old job hunt BS, give WeHunt a whirl. Let's change the game together.  
But here's the kicker: This isn't just a business for me. It's personal. It's about every rejection, every ghosted application, every ounce of self-doubt. It's about turning that pain into something transformative. With WeHunt, I want to give everyone a fighting chance in this chaotic job market.  
So, if you've ever felt lost, overlooked, or just plain frustrated, I get it. I've been there. And I genuinely believe WeHunt can change the game. If you're up for it, let's embark on this journey together. Yeaah - looking for frens to build it together - we can't do it alone.   
But here's where I need you. We're on the brink of launching our Proof of Concept, and we need real-world CVs to train our models and refine our system. If you've ever felt the sting of rejection, the frustration of unanswered applications, or the sheer exhaustion of the job hunt, I'm speaking directly to you.

17wky56,From Job Hunt Frustration to AI-Powered Revolution: My Journey & How You Can Be Part of the Next Big Shift in Hiring,"Hi folks!  
Ever just yeet your CV into the Job Boards abyss and hear...nothing? Been there, done that, got the rejection emails to prove it. A while back, I was crushing it in tech project management. But then, outta nowhere, the company pulls a sneaky on me, and I'm out on my ass. Oh, and did I mention my girl dumped me around the same time? Yeah life…….  
So there I was, blasting out job apps like a madman, 20-30 a day. Felt like I was just screaming into the void. But then, over a coffee (and maybe a few beers), an old mate drops this on me: ""Bro, you ever try, like, actually tailoring your CV for each gig?""   
That night, I went full mad mode. Picked my top 5 dream jobs and tailored (without lying lolz!) my Resume for each one. \*\*And guess what? By week's end, I had 4 calls lined up.\*\* That's when the lightbulb went off. Maybe, just maybe, I'd stumbled onto what I was meant to do. I wanted to change the game, make job hunting not suck so much….  
Say hello to \*\*WeHunt\*\*. Okay, the name's a work in progress, but hear me out. I rang up my full-stack buddy who was itching for a side gig. We brainstormed, and bam! WeHunt was born. We partnered up with some big-brain indexers (cost me an arm and a leg, but hey, YOLO) and got access to a whopping 6 million job offers. Then, we set up a vectorDB to store all the CV goodies and started matching them using BERT, with a sprinkle of open-source LLM - LLAMA (finally, something from Meta that doesn't suck).  
So, what's the dream with WeHunt?  
\- \*\*Instant Job Hunting\*\*: Upload your CV (srsly thats all), and we're on the prowl.  
\- \*\*Auto-Fill Job Forms\*\*: Tired of those ""Why us?"" questions? Let our AI handle it as its apply behalf of user.  
\- \*\*No more CV Updates\*\*: Post about a project on LinkedIn or Medium? WeHunt snags it and beefs up your profile.That is, you no longer have to remember to add new achievements to your resume - we will automatically rebuild them so you won't even have to open Wehunt. Although VCs would say that I must be fucked :D  
\- \*\*Chat for Recruiters\*\*: No screening boring calls, just our LLM acting like a mini-you.I was recruiting for my previous team and spent millions of hours reading resumes instead of having the chance to simply ask what I cared about.  
\- \*\*Career Advice\*\*: We'll point you to the best courses and skills, based on real data. We know who gets the job so we can start suggesting after some time what made those candidates get the job.  
So, there you have it. My wild ride from jobless to startup founder. If you're tired of the same old job hunt BS, give WeHunt a whirl. Let's change the game together.  
But here's the kicker: This isn't just a business for me. It's personal. It's about every rejection, every ghosted application, every ounce of self-doubt. It's about turning that pain into something transformative. With WeHunt, I want to give everyone a fighting chance in this chaotic job market.  
So, if you've ever felt lost, overlooked, or just plain frustrated, I get it. I've been there. And I genuinely believe WeHunt can change the game. If you're up for it, let's embark on this journey together. Yeaah - looking for frens to build it together - we can't do it alone.   
But here's where I need you. We're on the brink of launching our Proof of Concept, and we need real-world CVs to train our models and refine our system. If you've ever felt the sting of rejection, the frustration of unanswered applications, or the sheer exhaustion of the job hunt, I'm speaking directly to you.  
Join us on this journey. We're opening up our waitlist, and the first 100 brave souls to hop on board will get a full 3 months of WeHunt's job search magic, absolutely free. I can't promise that what I have dreamed up will work immediately as I would like, but I have decided to dedicate myself to it completely  
Check out our site: https://wehunt.ai/ and sign with your e-mail and Resume :pray Apologies if the front-end isn't all glitz and glam right now. Our focus has been on integrating LLMs, ensuring a robust backend, and perfecting our API calls with indexers. The fancy stuff can wait; we're here to build something that works.

17wkjn7,"I'm stuck between the future of my carreer and my father, I don't know what to do. (F,24)","I'm 24 and I was working as an export sales specialist at my uncle's company for 1,5 year & after that period, my uncle wanted to move me and my dad (he also worked at the company as the local market manager) to a small distributor company.  
  
My uncle didn't trust the owner of the distributor so that's why he made my father the owner of that small/local distributor shop & moved me there as well.  
  
I was so passionate about my job as an export sales person. I would travel the world, attend exhibitons, talk to people around the world & now I'm in a local shop with no organization, trying to manage people everyday, trying to fix things all by myself with such little experience. I feel so lonely because my father is also sad that he moved here and doesn't have any interest to this place at all.  
  
I really miss my old job and think about what I could've done everyday. I can't leave my father with this mess, I truly want to support him but its becoming harder everyday & I can't see a future here. What should I do? Would it be selfish to go back to my uncle's company?

17wjz4v,Planning to move for studying abroad in Marketing,"I'm planning to pursue an MSc in Marketing abroad next year (I live in italy), and with 1.5 years of work experience under my belt, I'm looking to make the most informed decision. My goal is not only to further my education but also to build a career in marketing within the tech industry. I've narrowed down my options (must be Engliish as Business Lenguage) to Dublin, UK (specifically Manchester or London), and Singapore.  
  
Here's a quick rundown of my priorities:  
  
Savings Potential: I want to be able to save money while studying and working in the chosen location.  
  
Career Prospects: My endgame is to work in marketing for tech companies, and all three locations have significant tech industry presence.  
  
Quality of Life: I'm aiming for a decent quality of life but not necessarily looking for extravagance.  
  
I have a slight preference against Dublin due to lifestyle considerations, but I'm still open to it. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences with regard to the following:  
  
Career Growth: Which location offers better opportunities for career advancement in the tech marketing sector?  
  
Salary Expectations: Any insights into the average salaries for marketing professionals in these places?  
  
Cost of Living: How does the cost of living in Dublin, UK, and Singapore compare, especially for students?  
  
Fun Nightlife / Useful networking  
  
If you have experiences or advice regarding other countries not mentioned, feel free to share! I'm particularly interested in understanding the balance between a reasonable cost of living and the potential for a thriving career.

17wiot7,"For the past 3 years at my current job, I’ve been getting a lot of depressive episodes, anxiety, and negative thought spirals. Is that a sign I should quit my job or profession?","

I work in engineering, despite being under-qualified and not being as smart as many of my coworkers. To be clear, none of these mental health symptoms are new. Its just that I have C-PTSD and my therapist thinks I have MDD. I get triggered into my trauma responses quite easily everyday at work and after work since its an environment where other people judge me (quite harshly) and expect me to perform. It also doesn’t help that I feel that I’m the dumbest member on my team and working under my boss. Also, my boss hired me for a position I’m heavily unqualified for and he reminds me this every 1-on-1 and through passive-aggressive remarks during monthly team meetings. Other people stay away from me and avoid asking me technical questions.  
It doesn’t help that for the past 5 working days, I got pulled into a task that I only anticipated spending 1 day on, because it was supposed to a very simple fix on my end. But, I ended up uncovering several issues that are NOT my fault and they stem from other people’s work. I ended up pulling in several people, because I needed to ask them for help on those issues. I get the sense that a few of these people think less of me now and/or are irritated with me. The good news is that most of these issues are resolved as the result of my and these people’s efforts. But the downside is that I’ve been extremely frustrated for these days to the point, where I feel extreme distress, stress, and anxiety that my thoughts have been slightly suicidal. It doesn’t help that I have a long backlog of other work I need to get done, especially before next week.  
And I cannot help but feel horrible because I don’t know as much as these people for what should be simple things. I keep thinking that maybe I should quit my job and my career. I don’t see things getting better at any other company. Even though I love learning and problem solving, these people clearly perform at a much higher level than I do.

Now the COO sent this mail 2 days ago, basically saying ""We enjoyed the interview, now meet with CEO, adding him to the mail thread to sort out a time and date.""

Which I basically replied ""Thanks for the introduction, was a great conversation, looking forward to the meeting, I'm flexible regarding time and date.""

Then 2 days of silence. The CEO didn't reply back to his or my email on the thread yet. 

How should I react to this? How long should I wait before mailing back to check? Is it normal for a CEO to simply reply to their COO and the candidate with an answer saying ""how about this date and time?"", because that certainly was what the COO did with the 3rd interview within 1 day.

I'm a software engineer with an experience of around 4 years. I just got a job with a pay of 2600000 pa. It's very good considering the average pay in my country is around 950000.
So I cleared the interview and got this job. And as you know these days coding interview have very little to do with actual work. So after joining the organization I found the work very hard. I thought it'll get easier later but even after working here for 2 months I'm not able to understand anything at all here. And also it's not interesting to me at all so not able to give in hours here. So basically I'm hating this job.

Since my last switch was also within 6 months so leaving this job right now will have a bad impact on my resume. I'm even fine with that. 

But the main issue is I need salary every month to pay my emis so can't just resign from here without another offer and get a job in 2-3 months.

I'm also afraid they may found out that I'm not really able to do the work and fire me.

17wd0lz,Any Bylaw Enforcement Officers able to give feedback?,"I'm considering making a career change to Bylaw Enforcement as more than one Career test have recommended it to me. I'm hoping someone in the field can give me a little insight into the actual day to day and satisfaction of the job.

I was an Electrician but found it to be grossly under appreciated and in most cases under paid. It was hazardous work and strange hours. Often resulting in tons of overtime for a period and then no work between projects. Not the kind of stability I'm after.

After that I tried Car Sales. Being an outgoing person that can find common ground with nearly everyone I thought it might be a good move. That paired with my life-long interest in cars, I really thought I'd be a shoe-in. I was wrong. Every day I was pressured into tricking people into buying vehicles they could not afford. Everything seemed to revolve around dishonesty and fake excitement to get that signature. In the end, I was let go for ""not being predatory enough"" and being ""to concerned with whether or not they could afford the vehicle"".

Now I'm working as a Wholesale Parts Counter Saleperson. A mixture of trades knowledge and personable skills. It's ok, the days go by fast and I enjoy seeing my ""regular"" customers. But I know it's a dead-end job with no real advancement. So I'm some what content for now but looking for something more career orientated.

With this background, would Bylaw Enforcement be a decent choice? City work is often well paid, regular hours, and has a pension, all of which appeal to me. I have always been good at de-escalation and making fair decisions by gathering everyone's perspective.

17wcgui,"I want to return to college, but how can I maintain a form of stability?","Hey y'all, I need some help,

So currently, I work a FT job at Tesla. It's an okay job with 3/4 day work weeks and 12hr shifts and the health insurance is pretty decent compared to my second employer. However, I feel as though I'm super dependent on this job and it basically consumes my life. I'm honestly genuinely unhappy with who I am becoming because of the physical stress of this job. 


I want to return to college and get my associates in engineering. It isn't much, but it's a big bargaining chip for the the area I'm in. There seems to be a lot of aerospace companies and other engineering type companies (my main goal is aero)


However, like I said, im super dependent on my job at Tesla. I have two jobs, one FT, the other PT and my PT I can go FT whenever I'm ready and they'd even work around any school schedule id give them, but the health insurance is absolutely terrible. I feel like having health insurance would be very important for me as I feel my mental health is in the gutter and I take meds (concerta) for my ADHD. (that's only an important part because concert is well known for being extremely expensive. On a deeper note, im not even SURE my current insurance is assisting with the meds as I use the company coupon and still pay $200-$250) 


But I mean, how does one approach this literal fork in the road? How can I return to college while msintain some form of stability? I want to attempt to pursue a degree in engineering (again) but idk if I'm ready and how it'd affect my health insurance.",prototypefish72,1,1.0,1,1700104300,2023-11-16 03:11:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wcgui/i_want_to_return_to_college_but_how_can_i/,11,2023

17wc1pe,What should I do after I graduate?,"Where should I go after I graduate

Hello! I’m a 23f. I will be graduating in December 2024 with a Bachelors in Geoscience, I’m also already taking classes for my 2nd bachelors which I should finish mid 2025. My 2nd degree will be in Computer Science. I love school and learning so I may even go back one day for a bachelors in Astronomy but for now I’m just working on the Geoscience and the Computer Science. 

I currently work full time at an oil and gas company as an ECall Analyst. I work under a manager and above him is a Branch manager. The branch manager has told me that once I graduate with my first bachelors, he’ll gladly try to move me to any department I want to go to within the company, I know he’s being honest because he has done this for people before, although he only offers it to people he believes have a great work ethic. 

The idea of moving up in the company or moving to a better paying position which I can actually use my degree for is exciting but I’m not sure what department or position would be good for me. I currently get paid a great salary of $56,700. Its the most I’ve ever made before and I am so grateful to be here. 

So my question is, where should I go from here? Is there anyone on this site that can give me some advice or who knows the field and offer any suggestions? Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated.

I’m a finalist for another job that’s 40% in person / 60% remote. The hours aren’t as good, the commute is 1 hour (unless I move) on the in-person days. There is more job stability. But there’s also more bureaucracy. And the culture doesn’t seem as good. Everyone seems very stiff and without much personality. But the pay is great. I expect the offer to be $115-$122k.

Do you recommend that those of us that aspire to build a career in sales (with hopes for investing and entrepreneurship), maybe learn a more tangible/technical skill prior to embarking on the journey? 

I’ve read a lot about layoffs, peaks & valleys and especially burnout, so it made me wonder whether it would be wise or just a waste of time to get certs, degrees, learn a trade, etc.. prior to taking the leap to help get through more turbulent and lean times?

17wafur,Unemployed: agree to a contract gig in January or focus on finding a full time role,"Okay hear me out. 

My company is a sinking ship with 10 of 21 employees leaving in the last few months. They said I could go remote when I move from [current city] to [new city - my hometown] and then 2 weeks ago changed their mind. I move in one week. It sucks. 

I’ll be unemployed beginning 11/27. 

I’m aggressively job hunting and am in early processes for a few opportunities but still looking. 

My current client (marketing agency) called me today and said he heard my situation and wants to pay me to contract for him for their huge event in January. It’s 6 days in [west coast city] doing their marketing. I was going to go anyway and he’s so bummed I quit he’s ending the contract with my company and wants to hire me to do it directly. It’s January 6-12. 

I don’t know dollars yet but looking at existing contracts, we’re probably looking at $10k plus travel for 6 days of work. 

The problem is that if I took it, I can’t start a new job until 1/15. 

Is that going to be a dealbreaker for companies? Interview processes take a while and I know the time between thanksgiving and new years is weird. The jobs I’m in process with think I can start asap. 

I have to let my client know by Friday (two days) and I don’t know what to do.

17wa524,What are some careers that would see value in my having a BA and MA in humanities fields?,"I have a BA in Religious Studies and a MA in New Testament. Fwiw, neither of these are ministry-related, but academic; the original goal was to pursue a PhD in NT and work in academia (plans changed and probably for the better since that's such a crapshoot itself lol). Anyway, apart from that, I have 14 years in retail/customer service experience and two years experience as a pastor.

  
I'm currently unemployed in a very small town with nothing other than a Wal-Mart and fast food within a 45 min radius. Going into any kind of ministry work isn't something I'm interested in doing (I'm far more interested in the academia side of things). Tbh, I just have absolutely no idea what I want to do/can do. Going back to school isn't an option as I'm in a ton of student debt to begin with and seemingly any and every career opportunity requires experience I don't have.

  
I'd like to think that my degrees — particularly my MA — count for something beyond their niche field. High level reading comprehension, communicating complex topics in understandable ways, tons of language work (basically every course in grad school involved Greek and I studied Coptic as well), research and writing, etc. I love learning, problem solving, and being creative. I know that I have skills that are marketable; I just don't really know how to go about doing that, to whom I should/want to market myself, nor know what's worthwhile when everything requires real experience I simply don't have.",Mpm_277,4,0.8299999833106995,4,1700098012,2023-11-16 01:26:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17wa524/what_are_some_careers_that_would_see_value_in_my/,11,2023

I don't know what to do now,"I'm currently working in a manufacturing warehouse, building substation protection panel for high voltage use I am in the testing department. My job is decent but I can't see myself growing anymore as I prefer doing more project management and design work as that's what the market wants and need. Basically that's what the market needs. I'm also burning out as the team dropped from 6 people down to 3 with no replacement yet for 2 months. It's been really heavy I was so motivated the first 8 months now it's very draining.

 I have an electrical engineering degree and 2 years working experience but most of my experience is in hands on work such as the testing that I have mentioned. I have 3 months of design experience but in avionics for helicopters which is not much and kinda not related.

I feel like in my current job I'm stuck and it's difficult to make a leap to another job as my experience is not what people want. We have a design department but it has already been filled and I have already asked to shift to the design but they gave my an option to do both as the testing team is lacking people but that will be overworking and no salary increase. I also kinda dont like to deal with the type of clients we serve as they are abnoxious and self absorbed.

I have been applying to about 35 or so companies so far and got about 6 interviews 2 rejected by them, 1 rejected by me as the job description did not tally and has no company benefits, 2 ghosted, 1 more I have high hopes cuz the told me they were interested but they mentioned that they need some time to get back as they are mass hiring. I have contacted them as a follow up but no reply yet. 

Currently I'm still applying, since my current job is still tolerable I'm being a bit fussy about my application and applying those that really suits me with a few companies that I am able to do. It has been really difficult and confusing and tiring trying to build myself. I want to take professional courses but it's a bit pricey. I have taken 1 safety course so far but will be adding on it soon. Worst case I might go slightly of course from my degree by doing IT or something. 

So if there are any advice on what I should do please do let me know.

TLDR: I have a job. It's decent. But I want to do something else. Currently company set terms to do both that are not favourable to me but favourable to them. Been applying so far it's been ok but very little are suitable.

I recently received a job offer for $175k/year plus an 18% pension and 3 weeks PTO (plus holidays).

Paternity leave is 2 weeks and I'm expecting my first child this summer. 

If my math is correct, it would be better to keep my current job and max my 401k. Overtime, the 401k would be worth more than the pension because of investment returns, even though the contributions to the pension are greater when made. Am I missing something?

At the moment, I am considering copywriting as my main prospect, but would love to evaluate other options.

17w4m9y,"""Is a Career Pivot from Chemical Engineer to Supply Chain Strategist Viable?""","After graduation, as a chemical engineer with no work experience, I find myself in a unique situation. Here's why:

1. I have a strong aversion to studying chemical engineering.
2. My GPA is relatively low at 2.8 out of 4.
3. I lack knowledge and interest in the field.
4. Job opportunities in chemical engineering are scarce in my city.
5. The country's import-based economy offers limited engineering jobs.
6. Personal constraints prevent me from leaving the country for further education or work.
7. My plan is to pursue an MS in Supply Chain Management, gaining experience in managing imports of raw materials for my company. Given my country's reliance on imports, I aim to eventually venture into importing raw chemicals independently and selling them wholesale to small chemical companies.

17w4h7c,Not Sure About Looking Into a Transition,"Hello everyone,

To put things simply, I have a pretty stable job at a big engineering company with roughly 2 years of experience. It pays the bills, but I think I've decided that I don't see myself wanting to stay in my current role or in my department.

I was looking at job postings and found one at a competitor that is different than what I do now and much closer to the career path I want to pursue.

My problem is I have a lot of personal things going on right now and job instability could really make life hard over the next few months. I'd like to apply to this other position, but it's a small world and a lot of people in my industry know each other. Unfortunately, my department can be *really* toxic once people start to believe someone is a flight risk.

Is it worth applying to this other company? I think I would be a strong candidate and would expect a pay raise, but I am concerned about rocking the boat at my current job and dealing with those ramifications.

TL;DR - I want to apply to a different role at a competitor, but I'm scared that news may get back to my higher ups, which would be a problem. Should I be concerned about this?

17w3jr5,Advice if I should find a new job.,"I am not sure what I should do. I re-joined a company I left a few years ago due to the company having rumors that they were selling. The company was still around and I decided to come back. after taking a 10K pay decrease but getting a month of PTO a year the company sold 3 months after I rejoined. I was promised they would not sell. When the new company took over I lost all my PTO and was bumped down to 7 days of PTO a year. I essentially took a pay decrease to come back. The new company now has us tracking every minute of the day and will get reprimanded if we do not have at least 7 hours of time tracked that is billable to our customers. 

Now working here for about a year or so its only gotten worse. I handle 3 times the work load as my co-workers (I work in IT at an MSP) and I also handle all the network outages and most of the priority tickets. At this point most of the work is on me while others seem to be able to take their time on tickets.

17w2gtn,Resignation PANIC,"I gave my two weeks notice last Friday. My boss was understandably shocked (it was my dream job and I said that often- it was my first job and I was there about a year and a half) and I bawled when she asked me why I was leaving.

I’m giving up a stable fed job for a contract gig that pays double my salary, so I was already a little iffy about taking on extra risk. The contract covers a current event that I happen to have super niche experience in- I took it in part because it’s a super cool organization and I knew I was never going to have that chance again. It’s not something I want to do for the rest of my career, but I know it’s a great move in the scheme of things and I’ll continue to have some contact with my current office in my new role. I’m hoping the move out will make it easier to move up in the future if/when I return to the same organization I just resigned from.

I really did love this job, even if it had a few frustrations. It would have gotten stale if I had stayed a few more years, but it (and my colleagues) were great to me and I feel incredibly lucky to have had it. Everyone has been incredibly gracious and kind since they found out I was leaving. 

All that to say, every time I slow down enough to think about it I’ve been PARALYZED by the fear that I made a mistake. Did I leave prematurely? Did I fall victim to thinking the grass is always greener? Was I being greedy by wanting more money? Am I dumb and naive and not aware of how good I had it? Should I ask my boss to tear up my resignation letter? What amount of regret/sadness for leaving a job is normal? I know that it’s totally valid to feel sad over what is a good decision, but I just need someone much wiser and experienced to tell me if I made a major mistake or if this is a normal way to feel (and that if I did make a mistake that I’m still going to be ok.)",AudienceVarious3964,2,0.6700000166893005,7,1700078999,2023-11-15 20:09:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17w2gtn/resignation_panic/,11,2023
17w2f87,Thinking about quitting Restaurant Manager..,"Hi This is my first time posting anything on Reddit but I had no one else to ask but the ""experts"".

I am currently working at a very small fried chicken place as a manager. Small meaning only 3 staffs including me, and one of them is a part-timer. I am also the only manager so I guess I can count as a general manager. I am only 20 and this is my first time being a manager and had no idea what I was getting myself into. Anything previous manager told me was that it's just what I was doing as a server + inventory of the stuff we need. Of course I didn't believe her since I saw her doing other stuff but I decided to try it before I regret not doing so.

However, the problem is that I feel like I am just doing too much. The work itself is not bad but there are just a lot of little things. My main problem I think is going errands. Since this is my first time being a manager, I am not sure if it is the same everywhere else but every-single week I will have to go somewhere to buy something because we ran out, or it is broken. I would have to go to Restaurant depot or Sam's every week on my ""off-days"". Of course I also don't get paid while I am going and the gas money has to come out of my pockets. You might ask why I can't go while I am working. Since it is a small restaurant there is only 1 FOH staff per shift. 2 on busy weekends. I can't leave the store while I am working since there will be no one at the restaurant then. I also have to go to Sam's every Sunday to pick up the orders, since the previous owner did not want to spend money on shipping. Before I was promoted, there was a promise that the new owner will go pick up himself, but that only lasted one week and got passed on to me. However, the new owner did offer to switch to Costco and have it delivered, but I didn't want to mess up the system we already had and there are some stuff they didn't have at Costco, so we decided to stick to Sam's.  

The pay is also one of the factor. The amount I am getting (\~$20 including tips) feels like it is right on the spot but since it is a small place, there is a limit on how much the owner can pay me. I am a more of work hard get paid more than work less and get paid less kind of person. My girlfriend (Previous manager of my current work) is working at the HR department at a 5-star hotel. And the pays of servers/bartenders I heard from her are just above what I can comprehend. Maybe that set my expectations high of salaries. I know the pressure working at a 5-star hotel versus a small restaurant is incomparable but the amount of work and stuff I am doing? I am sure I am doing more than those servers. I know I don't have enough experiences to get hired at such places so here comes the issue.

In short, I am currently deciding if I should stay here and get my experiences as a manager? even though I dislike working here? Or should I leave and work as a server at a better paying restaurant?

17w1rz1,How to navigate when feeling lost in life,"It is easy to feel lost in life, not knowing what to do or where to go. We think to ourselves: Why are we lost? A simple yet often unnoticed cause of feeling lost is that there are too many options to choose from. The broad variety of viable options makes it overwhelming to choose a path and feel that you have made the right decision. There are different ways to go about this issue. One is to try out different options and then decide. Another possible solution is to take a break and find yourself through meditative practices. The first step towards a solution is knowing what the issue is.

I have already graduated from college with a certificate (took 3 years) and gone to university and graduated after another 3 years. My field of work is in science BUT after working in this field for a year or so I sadly discovered it's not for me. I had been jumping from job to job for anout a year following all this, which led me to where I currently work now. I currently work as a early childhood educator in a daycare. I have been in this position for just a little under a year and I LOVE IT. 

Working in a daycare sparked my interest in pursuing a new career Goal. I want to become a certified teacher in an elementary school. 

However, I came up on this decision a little too late. The program I wanted to apply to is only offered as a January start SO I'll have to wait an entire year before I'd begin courses. Which I then would have to wait 2.5 years to graduate from the program... Meaning I will be 32-33 years old by the time I finish and can work as a teacher full time.

Now my issue is, I am the type of person who takes forever to make a decision SO when I finally do set my mind on something I feel the urge to do it asap. The idea of waiting around ""wasting"" another year before I can even begin step one of my goal frustrates me. 

I've already been in school for 6years and really haven't accomplished anything with the degrees I currently have. This thought frustrates me more. I also ideally would love to have children before I am 32 years old so that's on the back of my mind too. Will future me be able to handle work, school and a baby? Idk

Am I overthinking? Do I be patient and stick with my goal? Is becoming a school teacher a wise decision?

If you are caught in between 2 offers between an Oil & Gas company (1st) and an Investment company (2nd), which will you pick?

The offers are pretty much the same in terms of work schedule, flexi, perks, pay, both are well established globally and stable.

Now, the 1st company has more ladderized opportunity to grow or advance and you are a ""team player"" in the department. On the other hand, the 2nd company offers a fresh position in the country - meaning you will be the ""star player"" in the department which offers a sure road to being the department head.

17vwuvu,Any suggestions on how to switch industries?,"
32M new father here, I’ve been in the agriculture industry for the past 10 years and have experience ranging from R&D and regulatory to technical marketing. My past roles have needed me to travel over 70% of the time, which to be honest was fun in my 20s and not so much now that I am a father and don’t want to see my son grow from a hotel room. 

I’ve recently relocated to Boston and the industries here couldn’t be any further away from agriculture, but we love Massachusetts and my wife has her dream job here. 

I’ve been burnt for a while and wanted to start over in a new industry, I have a biology degree with a masters in biotechnology, which I think could be useful for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries here. From previous experience I know I’m really good at technical marketing roles and have been considering becoming a product manager, but have no idea where to start. 

Appreciate any insights on how to get my bearings straight. Thank you!",Cabz_1291,1,1.0,0,1700064281,2023-11-15 16:04:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vwuvu/any_suggestions_on_how_to_switch_industries/,11,2023
17vwbfc,Sometimes I wonder if I'm in the wrong field.,"I got my undergrad in IT. I went later at 25. Graduated at 27. I'm a tier 2 tech working on the CCNA. 

What I noticed was that I haven't adjusted well to an office job. I did drywall, painting, pressure cleaning .. and I worked at Starbucks for a bit while in college. 

I am disciplined outside of work but find myself completely disengaged at work. My performance isnt great and I struggle to focus. I have no windows where my cubicle is. I have a standing desk which helps, but still I think I struggle to work without motion.

I wouldn't want to go back to hard labor. My joints wouldn't like that. But I miss being on my feet and having some face to face interaction with people. 

I don't hate my job, but it doesn't excite me. I just do it because it's a job and I need money. Yes networking does interest me enough to give it a try. I know the money is still in the office and I'll still have to deal with that. 

Sometimes I've really considered that I just choose the wrong field and should have don't something else. 

I don't know what else though tbh. 

But I can't afford to start over. I need to make money. I'm getting married at need to support more then just myself. 

I wish I felt more engaged and excited about my work life. 

Othe friends seems genuinely into their work. I just do it because it pays. My lack of interest does hold me back I think. I see others in the field excell because they go home and tinker. I could care less. 

But I don't know what else I'd do and I don't want to start all over with terrible wages. 

Is there any advice that can be given? 

I have two options. Do the CCNA and get a better job in IT and stick with it longer. or start a search for something else. 

I'm 30m btw. Almost 4 years in IT",Electrical-Ferret-64,3,1.0,0,1700062768,2023-11-15 15:39:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vwbfc/sometimes_i_wonder_if_im_in_the_wrong_field/,11,2023
17vvrbn,What are my options? (Long),"I am 24 and living in the UK. I have moved around A LOT, spending years trying to figure out what I should do as a career. A quick rundown:

&#x200B;

* After school I went to College and did 3 A-Levels - Business, Law and Health & Social Care. (I should note that I originally went for Biology, Chemistry and Law, alongside re-taking my Maths GCSE where I achieved a C at Foundation level. I dropped both sciences because I found them too advanced for me).
* I went on to study Law at University after achieving a B in it at A-Level. That didn't work out for me. I became very depressed because I couldn't understand the work (It seemed like everyone around me just ""got it"" but it used to make me cry). I hated it. On top of that, living away from home and dealing with difficult roommates meant that after a year I dropped out.
* From 2019 to 2021 I worked a couple of hospitality/retail jobs whilst managing my depression. I thought it would be a good idea to try University once again as a mature student. This time I went for Psychology. I started that in 2022. You can probably guess what happened next. I lasted from October to January. My mental health was at an all time low. I had no clue why I was one of the only people I knew of that had dropped out of University... twice. How on earth could everyone else handle it but I couldn't? How were 18 year olds managing better than a 23 year old adult? I didn't get it. I still don't. I've always thought there was something wrong with me because of this. Anyway, I'm going on a tangent.

  
So here I am, 24 years old, feeling like a failure and no idea where to go. I'm terrified my depression will ruin any chances I have of working in the future.

There are lots of opportunities for Apprenticeships where I live, meaning I would be working and earning money but would still gain a degree at the end of it. I'm obviously quite worried about doing something that has a degree integrated in it, but I also know it is the best route I could go down, and that the studying wouldn't be as intense.

The reason I included my education history in this post is because I have an interest in Software Engineering/Data Analysis/Cyber Security. Clearly I am not very good at Maths and if I couldn't do Science do I even bother trying? I don't know if it was just University that I majorly struggled with, I might find working a lot easier. I'd have to do it to find out. Some companies allow 'UCAS Points' from A-Levels to start an Apprenticeship, which I have enough of for one of these options, but I am worried I'll want to quit after a year or so.

My brother is doing an Apprenticeship in Project Management, and he and a few members of my family are pushing me to do that too. If it's not already obvious I am quite pessimistic and a big worrier, so I do wonder whether after the Apprenticeship I'd find it a managment role too much to handle. I don't want a job that takes over my life.

I know things shouldn't be this difficult but for me it is. Thank you in advance for any help.",Desperate-Future4258,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1700061240,2023-11-15 15:14:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vvrbn/what_are_my_options_long/,11,2023

17vu8om,Can’t decide between two job offers,"Hi, I’m really struggling between which of two job offers to take. First off, I was laid off a long while ago and have been struggling to find a new job since so I’m blessed to now have two job offers but I don’t know which is the right decision. 

Job 1 is joining a team as a kind of salesman (I don’t want to give identifying details on the industry). The base salary is higher than the other and commission earning potential is unlimited. I did this exact role elsewhere before but ended up getting burned out due to the pressure of hitting targets, however this new company is a lot less cutthroat and more understanding of quality over quantity. The fear here is if I come in and can’t find the client to hit my numbers etc.

Job 2 is joining a similar company but working as part of a sales team where the boss already has big international clients and needs the team to service them. The base salary is 15-20% less and much less commission earning potential. But it does mean I’m not responsible for hitting sales targets or bringing new clients in. 

On one hand I believe I have the potential to do great at job 1 and be a captain of my own ship but on the other hand I wonder if being part of a team and taking that pressure off to hit numbers is better in the long run.

I recently started working at this startup. Plis note this is my first proper job ever. Now I don’t know if this is normal or not but since we are a very small team, we report directly to the ceo, including our manager. 
Here comes the difficult part- this is my first job and I was really looking forward to learning and understanding how things go around in a corporate setup. Our boss isn’t the best leader and can be really moody. If they’re not in the best mood they’ll yell at us (usually for something that’s not in our control and was not communicated with us). My observations so far is that there’s a lack of communication on everyone’s part. And no one really does anything about it. 

I already feel incapable in their presence and the imposter syndrome takes over.

I will be graduating in December 2024 with a Bachelors in Geoscience, I’m also already taking classes for my 2nd bachelors which I should finish mid 2025. My 2nd degree will be in Computer Science. I love school and learning so I may even go back one day for a bachelors in Astronomy but for now I’m just working on the Geoscience and the Computer Science. 

I currently work full time at an oil and gas company as an ECall Analyst. I work under a manager and above him is a Branch manager. The branch manager has told me that once I graduate with my first bachelors, he’ll gladly try to move me to any department I want to go to within the company, I know he’s being honest because he has done this for people before, although he only offers it to people he believes have a great work ethic. 

The idea of moving up in the company or moving to a better paying position which I can actually use my degree for is exciting but I’m not sure what department or position would be good for me. I currently get paid a great salary of $56,700. Its the most I’ve ever made before and I am so grateful to be here. 

So my question is, where should I go from here? Is there anyone on this site that can give me some advice or who knows the field and offer any suggestions?

17vrwhc,"Getting mugged off, would love some advice with how to approach this situation (M28)","Hello, 
I'm looking for some advice/tips on how to proceed with this 

My supervisor in my current role was on long term leave since June, and has since been made redundant. Since then, I have been doing his job which involves training new staff, managing freelancers, liasing with clients, basically heading up the department and being the point of contact and decision maker for anyone and everyone needing to speak to us and work through issues. I have had no complaints about my conduct, and in fact have received compliments of my ability to step up and take over at short notice. 

I enquired with my line manager about the possibility of being considered for the role, which was received with interest. Since then, I heard nothing, until they announced they would be changing the role title to '____ Manager' and have already hired someone to start in January.  They have also hired a longer term freelancer to tide us through the Christmas period, who's rate is about £150 a day more than my salaried rate works out per day. I've asked for the job description of the 'manager' role, 90% of which I am doing, and have been doing since June. 

How do I approach this situation with my line manager? Right now I am mentally checking out and feel very undervalued as an employee, of which my salary is already quite low in the bracket for my position. 

Any advice warmly received!

17vqduo,Manager keeps delaying my promised raise?,"Hi there, I'm seeking some advice on what I should do about my manager having delayed my raise for almost two months now. Any input would be greatly appreciated.  
Six months ago (in March 2023), I had received an offer from a different company that included an initial increase in pay for joining, as well as an additional increase in pay effective immediately after completion of all required licensing for my role. Keep in mind that this new company had included these conditions in a contract they wanted me to sign.  
I had mistakenly presented this offer to my current employer, as and they had convinced me to stay by a) verbally matching the other company's offer and b) selling me a story of how ""I'm gonna get treated like a number"" at the new company and ""they don't have the same family work culture we do"". I had trusted that they would not do anything to deceit me as I've been working for them for around 2 years at this point.  
Fast forward 6 months to late September/early October 2023 and I had successfully completed all the aforementioned licensing. I follow up with my manager to inform her that I've completed all licensing requirements and to follow up on getting that raise. She tells me that she needs to confirm with the higher ups and she will get back to me. A few weeks go by, and no response, so I followed up again. She finally meets with me on November 6th confirming that she got the go-ahead for the raise.  
My problem is that the upcoming pay check statement I've just received, which includes the week of November 6-10, did not show any change in pay. Should I ask my manager about this, or bring it up with HR directly? I'm tired of constantly having to follow up on something that was verbally promised to me. Another problem is that since my company is fairly small and family owned, the HR manager is the owner's cousin lol, so I'm afraid anything I say will be brought up with the owner.... is it even legal to have a direct family member of the owner to be in charge of HR? Shouldn't a non-biased external person with no ties to ownership be in charge of HR?  
TLDR: Promised a raise 6 months ago, had to wait 2 months for the go-ahead from upper management, and now they seemingly forgot to process it with payroll.",kzxc123,3,0.7200000286102295,5,1700042343,2023-11-15 09:59:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vqduo/manager_keeps_delaying_my_promised_raise/,11,2023
17vq3rd,Second week in this job and I hate it.,"Hi this is my first post to Reddit so please bare with me if I mess anything up.. 

I (24F) just started a new role two weeks ago in a new company the other side of the country. I have just come from a very busy transport role (loved it but had to move county for personal reasons)  and this role I have just started is in supply chain, it’s completely different than what I was expecting. To be honest the role was sold to me as an administrator role but it is brain dead data entry work. Doesn’t look like it is ever going to change, I look at my colleagues here and I don’t want to be doing the work they are doing in 5 years time. It is not busy enough, it’s so laid back.

For me personally in any job I have been in I have to be using my brain at least a small bit like I have to be kept busy or my mind will spiral and I feel that is exactly what’s happening, this work does not excite me one bit. When I say I am doing data entry I mean I am copying and pasting and that is it. 
Then this morning what tipped me over the edge was being told I can’t eat my breakfast at my desk, I have never been in a role where I was told I can’t eat at my desk. If there was customers coming in and out of our office I would understand this but there is never any customers nor will there ever be. I am a very fussy eater who has struggled with food all my life, it takes me about an hour or two to want to eat in the morning. 

I had a meeting with my manager yesterday to discuss all of this and I was basically told the job was sold to me wrong.. (red flag) 

I just really need advice, I don’t know what to do. I dread coming in to work every day and I’m only two weeks in.. everyone keeps saying to stay at least a month so I know but I don’t even know if I’ll make it to Friday right now. 

For context i have no children and no mortgage or rent or anything to pay (yes I know I am so lucky) so do I just leave and start looking again?

I started this master's directly after graduating from my bachelor's. I came into this program thinking that I would want to get into a technical role (machine learning engineering, software engineering, or data science) but I now realize that I only wanted that because I was so concerned about making the most amount of money fresh out of college. I was never really that interested in computer science, and I know now that a lot of what drew me to do this master's was validation and ego. I definitely don't see myself being an engineer.  
My dream job is to be a product manager in tech. I have startup experience in my undergrad that was very PM-like and a consulting internship at a Big 4.  
Financially, I am already 1 semester and 20k in and am about to complete 2/7 courses for the program. The remaining degree would cost another 50k. This is all taken from student loans. I don't want to put any more money if I don't have plans to finish the program.  
I feel this desire to start my career, and wish I could take back doing this master's. I know I'm lucky to be in such a great program, but am not sure if the degree will be valuable for me since I want to go into more product-focused roles.  
If you were in my shoes, what would you do?? How valuable do you think the master's in computer science is for a future product manager? If I take a leave and apply for jobs, what do I tell the interviewer when they ask ""What did you do after your undergrad?""

17vluqc,Help: I’m leading a team of incompetents and have to now address their poor participation.,"I’m currently the director of a team putting together a major conference for my university. It takes months of planning and an obscene amount of money to put on. This isn’t a paid role, and when I signed up to participate I thought I’d be passing out fliers or something. Now I’m managing a team of 4 and running an entire portion of the conference which is essentially a sub-conference in itself. I’m passionate about the conference topic and the education it brings, so I’m motivated to turn out something of really high quality. 

My issue is: the members of the team I am directing are either lazy or passive aggressively not participating. With two of them, I believe they’re bitter because they’re not in leadership roles ( due to their bias that their position in the school is somehow more important or influential than my own, it’s not and I’m far more qualified to lead), the other one is just scattered. It started off with them not answering emails, then it evolved into telling other people from the main conference of their absences instead of me, now they’re just not showing up to meetings. They don’t even notify me they won’t be there. I’ve asked them to communicate if they can’t be at a meeting, if they have questions or if they need help in their roles; it’s truly far more babying than they deserve (they’re students in graduate programs, they know how to hold jobs, meet deadlines and respond to emails). I get that they may not have signed up for this amount of work or contribution, but these are the roles they’ve accepted and committed to. They did that, they volunteered, I’m just here to manage.

This is a struggle for me because, prepare for humblebrag, I’m actually a great leader. I’m kind, organized, and I manage our team exceptionally well. I have truly risen to the challenge of directing this entire conference with no experience doing so and I’m kicking so much a$s. I send updates to them when they don’t attend and refuse to micromanage them because they’re highly educated adults and know exactly how to manage their affairs (so no point in being mom here). 2 of my 3 teammates I know are not following through on their role assignments. Because these are not paid positions, I have no official authority to impose a consequence like a write-up, and I’m concerned that if I were to verbally reprimand them and kindly tell them their participation was sub-par that they would just quit on the spot and I would be left carrying their responsibilities (and I would look like an inefficient leader to boot). 

How can I navigate this in corporate-speak? My brain wants to say “pull your heads out of your butts and take some responsibility for your commitments” but clearly that would be ineffective for the context. Our next meeting is tomorrow, how do I ask them if they made progress from the clearly outlined list of tasks, and inevitably address them when they say they haven’t. I’m sick of their incompetence, albeit disgusted by their child-like participation. I don’t want those feelings to come across in my words. I want to inspire them to do better without soft-parenting these adults through something they’re entirely capable of doing. TIA

TL/DR: leading an unpaid team for a good cause but they suck. How do I kindly tell them they’re sucking and they gotta do better without causing them to quit?",mistressamericana,1,1.0,6,1700023379,2023-11-15 04:42:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vluqc/help_im_leading_a_team_of_incompetents_and_have/,11,2023

17vl8v2,My boss won’t leave me alone,"Frequent visits, extra workload, micromanaging. These were issues I that pestered me until I found a way to become ""bulletproof"" at work. Here's how:

1. Practice Tactical Empathy: Show your boss that you understand their challenges through casual conversation. This not only makes you more endearing but also demonstrates your awareness of complexities (or even the executives) beyond your pay grade.
2. Increase Your Value: Learn and promote a unique skill that sets you apart from your team, including your boss. For example, mastering prompt engineering and promoting its applications makes you irreplaceable.
3. Network Effectively: A strong, interconnected network serves as a safety net, adding a social cost for any potential mistreatment from your boss.

In summary, make yourself so valuable and well-connected that your boss can't afford to lose or hurt you.

17vkqhc,Debating Quitting after a week..,"I applied for a role that was advertised as “junior engineer”. Got an offer, and after the fact, I was going through the hiring manager’s linkedin when I realised this same role (same description/requirements/responsibilities) was previously posted as a job but without the junior title, indicating it was more mid-level, but then it was removed. That’s when they posted the it with the junior title, and that’s when I applied. 
I am confused as to why they would title my role junior if it is not a junior role ? I am guessing this is financial reasons because the salary offered to me was very low. Aside this, there are so many red flags I’ve come across with this company so far. I just have no choice because I am desperate for a job, and cannot seem to find anything else. 
Also from all the interviews I had with this company, the role seems scattered all over the place. No clear onboarding process, no training for this so called “junior” role, no clear set of responsibilities it was more so “you can be doing anything and should be able to do anything that is asked of you”. One of my interviewers even said “if you can’t do something we’ll just hire somebody smarter”. They also advertised it as a remote role but have now told me I need to be in the office. I suffer from anxiety and depression already and this job just made it sky rocket. It’s affecting me mentally and productivity wise to feel such a big pressure and feel like I’m just being used with no care for my career progression or wellbeing. The company culture is so so toxic. I don’t know what I am looking for in terms of advice I’m just so lost and know the answer is to quit, but I also need an income and have been job searching for 2 years until i got this one :/",No_Union_2224,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1700019513,2023-11-15 03:38:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vkqhc/debating_quitting_after_a_week/,11,2023

17vkfje,Should have asked for more money... now what?,"I am two months into a new job. I honestly was so excited by the salary and perks offered that I did not try to negotiate. It felt fair to me.

Unfortunately this job is in HR and because I can't not see what some others are making, I feel like I made a grave mistake not negotiating salary. 

I would prefer not to get the ""you always negotiate salary"" comments because duh. I want to know what I do NOW. Now that I'm two months in and don't feel that I'm being compensated the way I should.

I should add that there is a huge chunk of responsibility in my role that is not included in the job description, that I am a technical expert in, that only I can do. It's something I'm required to do about 20% of my time and it is not HR-related at all. I'd like to use that as leverage in some way.

Also, compared to some of the other salaries I see, my level of responsibility is over what these guys are doing. I.e. they may be over one location making more money than me, and I am over 7 locations.

I immediately put my hand over my mouth and nervously laughed because I was weirded out he’d make that joke especially with a kid in the room who could here. he immediately said “sorry, in my head I clocked out already” because we were nearing the end of the day. (As if that’s an excuse?). i didn’t say anything but nervously laughed because im awkward and have social anxiety. Zack also sexualizes things that the kids say IN FRONT of them. if they say something that can be interpreted as sexual, he laughs and repeats what they said. Leaving the kids confused and asking why he’s laughing. it makes me so uncomfortable that he can’t get his mind out of the gutter around the children. He also talks so explicitly about sexual encounters he’s had when me and my coworkers are simply talking about our boyfriends in a lovey and casual way before clocking in when there’s so no kids around. (I know I shouldn’t be talking about my personal life anymore.) but it seems like he’ll bring up certain topics so he has an excuse to speak about sexual things. Like he asks me about my boyfriend just so he can probably get to the topic of relationships just so he has an excuse to talk about sex.

I’m hesitant. Very. My degree is in marketing, but as we all know it’s very competitive. Even for entry-level positions. I want a job more geared toward marketing rather than sales, however, my resume is geared toward sales given the experience I have. I worked as a “Marketing Coordinator” for a company, there I was going door-to-door selling products for the company. I hated it, even though I was pretty good at it. 

The rest of my resume includes coursework, where I’ve learned and did a project on SEO. So I guess my resume is a bit of sales and marketing. 

I want to break into my career. Right now I’m a front desk assistant manager, but there’s not much room for growth at this small locally owned spa I’m working at. 

Should I go forward with the job for ADP? Or should I keep searching until I find something more aligned with my career goals? I heard that ADP will be a good stepping stone. I just don’t want to keep having sales positions that may hinder my chances of getting a marketing position. Especially marketing analyst or market research position.

$88k starting, healthcare prem covered, no HSA, opportunity for annual bonus up to 5% salary, report to office 3x weekly, located in a very HCOL region. Stable work. Downsize/layoff risk is low.

Vacay and holidays, 401k & matching are a wash. My primary reason for entertaining options is the constant biweekly scramble to find work opps.  That simply gets old.

17vgotm,I’m really uncertain about what to do next,"With a title like that I always think if your not 100% certain or at least have a very good feeling about it, don’t act on it. 

I’ve been with the same company for 7 years. They brought me into the country that I currently live in. I’m very grateful for the life changing opportunity they have given me. My colleagues are great, we have a great company culture and I generally feel quite appreciated and valued. The work is not always what I want it to be, and I don’t feel sometimes that I’m able to keep up with the top talent in my field of expertise. But more so, I want to feel that I’m excelling not just being and coasting along. 

A client that I have been consulting to for the last 5 years is looking at offering me a managerial role overseeing the department I work in. It’s a chance to apply myself in a generalist role, since I can do a lot of what each of my team members perform as their key function as well as learn to lead and manage. For the first time I will also be able to have a stronger influence on the choices and direction we go, what to prioritize and see if I can have a positive impact. The CEO is someone I respect a lot and we have a great relationship. 

But the thing is, the company culture sucks. I don’t really have a vibe with the extended organization not like my current employer. The industry they operate in I’m not overly enthusiastic about but I get a chance to drive innovation and create new solutions which does interest in. Money will go up a bit I suppose. There will be less flexibility cause in my current role I can pretty much go about my day as I please. There’s no micromanagement.

I want to challenge myself and feel proud that I’m achieving success but I am not sure if my need to prove to myself I’m good enough is clouding my judgement that I have a good thing where I am and thinking of leaving for the wrong reasons.

Is there a question I can ask myself or a process I can apply that can help me decide what to do. I could probably go back to my old job if it turns out I really don’t like the move but even leaving to go to a client requires negotiation. Need help all, can’t sleep cause I’m overthinking this already too much.

17vgj6n,My doctor friend just got convicted of Misdemeanor Hit and Run. He's starting to look for jobs. Is he fucked?,"So my friend has been going to school for the last 15 years. He finished his PHD a few years ago but because of family circumstances he elected to continue working in his department via post doc. Earlier this year my friend fucked up, drank too much and hit a sign. In his drunken stupor he made an even worse decision to leave the scene. Recently he had his day in court. The judge dropped the DUI charge but charged him for misdemeanor Wreckless endangerment, and a misdemeanor for the hit and run on the sign. 

His PI at the lab he's getting his post doc in recently informed him that they didn't get the expected grant money they were looking for and that his last day would be coming up early next year. My friend isn't getting laid very much as it is and is the sole.bread winner for his family. Plus he has an outrageous amount of student debt from the 12+ years of schooling he went through. He's now about to start the job hunt but is worried he's fucked due to these recent charges. 

Is that the case? Does he need to tell future employers about these charges during his interviews? Do you have any suggestions for things he can look out for or things he can do to help navigate this?

Sidenote: My friend's an amazing person that made a terrible mistake. He's learned from it and is no longer drinking and is now going to AA regularly. He grew up poor and in a really messed up family and unfortunately he used to abuse alcohol to cope with those feelings.

17vf7qe,30M no idea how to pivot.,"I am looking to change up careers and I have no idea what to do. Some background: I did not go to college because 1) it sounded terrible. 2) I do not come from any sort of money. 
I had a couple jobs during and after high school and then started selling cars for a little over a year. Had an opportunity to purchase a business with a friend and that was the best decision I ever made. At 22 I started making low 6 figures doing phone repair. Worked that for 7 years then got married and moved so I had to sell my half of the business. I opened up another repair shop and I have not been able to replicate the success and I just do not have the drive to make it happen. I mainly opened this because nobody would hire me and I had nothing else to do. Now I am 30 and want a career change. I am relatively smart and a great problem solver. Since I have been doing the same thing for most of my adult life I am having issues coming up with what I want to switch to. 

TLDR: I’m 30M that has experience in electronics repair/entrepreneurship but no college. What is a field I can pivot to?",Sammywinfield,3,1.0,1,1700003603,2023-11-14 23:13:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17vf7qe/30m_no_idea_how_to_pivot/,11,2023

I have plans of working in EU shortly after. Like I want to be there right after my program ends or end of 2024. I prefer the Netherlands, Germany, France. Basically any country in that area.

My problem is, coming from America every job alert I get from LinkedIn for opportunities in the selected countries say ""Hirer is not accepting out of country applications"" (because I have premium, I get this tip).

But I checked, the Netherlands government website for example, and these companies are on the approved list to give out visas. I even connected with an employee from one company I am interested in who is from the US and now works in the Netherlands.

So how do I find jobs that I can apply for that do hire out of country applicants? I know one route is to look for companies with an international presence that also have a presence in the US, get in with them and ask for a transfer. I'd just like other ways because that seems like too long a journey for my goals.

17vc6av,MEng in ECE or Finding a Job?,"Hey everyone, I’m a bit of a crossroads in my life now. I have the option of doing an MEng come this January, for a duration of 1.5 years. It involves a big research project as well. It’s paid for (I’m in Ireland) so I won’t be losing out on any money. I aim to work a little part time too just to have money for myself.

On the other hand, I wasn’t able to secure an offer from my internship during my BSc in Computer Science, and only have started looking for jobs half-heartedly since September (maybe 6-10 interviews and a lot of grad jobs starting next year I’ve to do interviews for). Countless OA’s as well. Still no offers though.

I’m stuck between doing the MEng, which I really would love to achieve during my life and giving myself more time to “chill” before starting the drudgery of employment for the rest of my life (I am also heavily interested in possibly doing a Ph.D. and the MEng according to the course coordinator would be an invaluable stepping stone and personally to see whether or not I’d really love research) or just taking the next few months to work part time retail somewhere and work on my portfolio and find a full time SWE job.

I just feel even if it took 12 months to find a job, which I hardly doubt it would given my response rate, I’d be employed far quicker than my masters and have experience before it concludes but then again on the one hand, personally, I would regret not doing my masters sooner as it’s a personal goal of mine and I feel once I start working I won’t want to go back to academia. I know it’s not now or never for my masters but it truly feels like that. I’m only 21 too so I’m in no rush to start my lifelong career so soon. Then I circle back to wanting money and financial independence and I feel like it’s just such a tough decision I’ve imposed on myself.

Any suggestions or insights? I’ve spoken to friends and family about this, family wants me to pursue the masters as they say get it out of the way while college is fresh in my mind and I’m young and some friends also think the same but others think financial independence and starting my career early is invaluable.

17v7j2k,Unrealistic expectations from colleagues in new job,"Unrealistic expectations from colleagues in new job

I’ve been in a new job for 3 weeks now as a programme administrator at a university. Before I was hired, there was no one in my role for a few months and my work was spread throughout the rest of the team so there was a large backlog when I started.

My line managers and coworkers in my team have been really supportive during training and have answered my constant questions, picked up leftover work and reassured me when I made mistakes. 

However, I’m really struggling with the academic team I work alongside. Most of them are really lovely and understanding that I’m still learning, but there are a select few (particularly head of department) who seem to have unrealistic expectations of me. The lead of the program, who I am in regular contact with, replies to some of my questions with snarky comments, writes long emails complaining of how disappointed he is when I miss something and is generally just really blunt and negative towards me. When I was on my lunch break today he sent me 3 urgent emails within 10 minutes of each other about the same subject (which I’d reassured him previously wasn’t urgent) and was really rude when I replied after I got back.

It’s really starting to bring me down that some members of this team expect me to know how to deal with everything quickly and correctly when they are aware I started 3 weeks ago. They have already received communication from my operations manager when I started saying to be kind and bare with us.

Should I really be competent enough after only 3 weeks in the role? Is there any way I can address this without coming off as overly sensitive?

17v6def,"Got an offer for a 1-time event that would pay 2-3 times my annual salary, should I take it?","I apologize for the length, I'll try to be brief.  I produce live events, mostly corporate meetings, galas, some concerts, etc.  Obviously COVID sucked, the company I have been working for shut down for a year, then wanted to bring everyone back at 3/4 of our previous salaries until we got back on our feet.  I had an opportunity outside the industry to make more money, so I walked away.  I didn't burn any bridges, I handed over clients, I answered questions, and in exchange they kept me on the company phone plan.  I had no desire to hurt either the company, or my clients, many of whom I've had relationships with for years.

The new opportunity wasn't what was promised, partly due to supply chain issues, and I hated my manager.  I regretted leaving.  After about 9 months, someone I've known in the event industry tried to recruit me to be sales manager for a convention center.  Since the industry is tiny, word got back to my old boss that I was considering a position with this competitor.  He offered me a $10k bump to my pre-COVID base salary (+commission), unlimited PTO and unlimited WFH - this was about $15k more than the competitor was offering and that would have been 9-5+ in the office.  

I came back to my old boss and immediately I had to fill in for a co-worker who had a medical issue.  With my experience and familiarity with the customers, I was very effective at this, everyone was thrilled to have me back.  When the dust settled I had lost some of the accounts I had transitioned while away, but the job is good, I'm good at it, good work-life balance, and flexible schedule, but nothing is perfect.  Earlier today I was thinking about long-term goals and if I want to stay here for 20+  years until I retire.

A customer just asked about bringing me in as a producer on a large-scale, one-time event. He's offering to pay what would be equal to 2-3 years salary (no chance of repeating), but we'd have to start in earnest in a month or so. Probably 20-30 hours a week for 6 months, then 80 hr weeks for 2 months.  If I walk away from my job again there's probably no coming back, and this is the largest (but not only) event company in town, and we don't want to relocate.  There's a slim chance I could convince them to give me leave for a few months, but it would be a struggle on all fronts.

The event is about 600 miles/2hr flight away, so I'd probably be spending 2 months away from my family working 60-80 hour days, coming home a few weekends where I'd be exhausted from work and travel.  Already my out of town projects are hard on my wife for taking the kids to sports, etc., and I've never been gone more than 10 days.  My marriage is strong, but this would be a strain on any marriage.  Complicating this, my Dad has cancer and it doesn't look good.  He's spending time with us regularly so my mom can have a break, and I'm worried about caregiver burnout.  This weekend I asked how I could help more and she said ""I'm ok now, I want to save you for when I REALLY need you."" Currently my job would be very flexible with me taking time off/away to care for him, so taking this job would potentially really stress my mom.  We don't have any other family in town and my dad doesn't want paid help like a home health aid.

Is it worth the money? It would also be cool to be a part of, and could lead to new opportunities, but I'd miss my wife and kids, and I know there's a limited amount of time left with my dad, and I'm worried about my mom. I'd love advice if you have any.",itsnotimportant2021,7,0.8199999928474426,10,1699980374,2023-11-14 16:46:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17v6def/got_an_offer_for_a_1time_event_that_would_pay_23/,11,2023

ENFP is my personality type according to Mayers Briggs, I was born in 1994. (scorpio in the horoscope for those who it means, and for those who don't, skip it and don't pay attention.)

In the past year, I researched about project management, studied and completed a course and prepared for work, because the agile methodology suits me. Then I realized that all my weaknesses and difficulties lie in the qualities of a manager. Time management, organization, etc... As if I subconsciously knew - came to what I should change about myself, or rather improve....

All my life I've been researching psychology, philosophy, sociology, anything about the human soul, ego, spiritual awakening, interpersonal relationships, energies, communication, influence, persation, etc... I'm non-stop listening to yt, podcasts, pdf books and just deeper and further researching about even though sometimes it's hard for me to verbalize it all (adhd) and explain it to people.
Since I am extremely extroverted and, on the other hand, spiritual, I am interested in working with people and lifting and leading people towards a vision... as I enter the space, I instantly feel the energy and all the people around me. people's blockages, what they are like and how I can approach them.. I can feel who is not right with whom or all those changes in non-verbal communication (on the body), and energy...

I have come this far and I am still looking for what is my passion and what I would do because I have and feel a huge amount of energy that I want to put somewhere useful and something that will stimulate my adhd brain. I want to use hyperfocus and make my future career profitable as I am extremely ambitious and believe that anything can be achieved if you put your mind to it (I lack a clear goal and direction obviously).

With the last research I came to the conclusion that I should switch to SALES, because I am extroverted, persistent and have great mental strength in the sense that I am self-confident and assertive. My doubts are cured by the fact that I will feel that I am deceiving people, stealing money from them for sales, in whatever area I worked, except for some luxury products or b2b... 
I can and often push people out of their comfort zones because I see limitations and I try to show them how to get out of the matrix and get rid of limiting beliefs and a strong ego. I have no problem giving speeches in front of unknown people and going into the unknown because I am a generalist and as an enfp I know how to handle situations well.. The problem is the technical part of precision and syndrome of incompetence (adhd).

Until now, I have considered selling as the best option because it is a numbers game, but I live in Serbia (the Balkans) and I believe that employers pay poorly, and it takes time to survive those miserable jobs until remote work for abroad is found...
For psychotherapy, although I am most interested and driven because I am spiritual, I think I am too rough and impatient so I could not just listen, be gentle and support people. (All my life I push forward, I don't like self-pity and over time I developed a fake or not - a sense of indifference).

This is the career list I came up with based on a bunch of tests, chatgpt, being adhd and being an ENFP personality type:
Entrepreneurship, Marketing and Advertising, Sales, Public Relations, Consulting, Psychology or Counseling, Politics or Public Policy, Entertainment (acting/music), Event Planning.

17v42z6,"I've been given a 2 week notice of being laid off, can they fire me before the 2 weeks?","My company is a small start up. They recently given a number of employees 2 weeks notice of termination (laid off). They said the project they hired me for is taking a while to set up, I have been doing ""fake mock work"". The person who is above me ""checks"" my work and also does the same work too (migrating/coping charts over to a fake chart). All actions (downloads, print, edits, deletes) are recorded and noted with the charts/pdf for all internal employees to see. We have to document in an excel sheet how long the process took, the name of the chart, etc. The person above me has not been checking my work and just says ""it looks good"".  
I recently seen that the person above me who has to check my work, has been claiming in the excel sheet that he has completed the work. However, when I looked at one of his claimed completed chart, there was no documentation of any of his actions in the chart. So I followed in his foot steps.   
He recently just checked one of my ""completed"" work and said it was not done correctly.   
The first of the two week notice, I have slowed down on working, but was still migrating information over. I started following his footsteps on Monday in the second week and then he decided to check and said I did not complete the chart.   
What should I do? Should I tell the manager above him (which already can see that he said I did not do the work) about how he is not doing work? Will I get fired before the 2 weeks?

17v3xcl,Last batch of interviews this week - cautiously optimistic.,"I, like many folks, have been looking for a different job and over the past several months. Basically, since April, I started looking relatively aggressively, with that aggression ramping up since July. 

My current employer has only given me one raise (4%) which also went along with a promotion to senior analyst (I’ve been with the company for almost three years).  There have been other smaller concerns I’ve called “yellow flags” which, on their own, wouldn’t bother me too much, but considering there are multiple yellow flags, in conjunction with the lack of a significant pay increase, have really frustrated me and beaten my motivation and morale down. 

I’m in my last batch of interviews this week for a new job with a different company that will pay about 20-25% more for a similar role. 

Personally, I feel like I wouldn’t have made it this far along if I didn’t have a good shot or have already “got the job” for a lack of better words. I’ve had three interviews with different people within the company already, and my last batch this week will be with people on the team who I will hopefully call my teammates or coworkers. 

Am I foolish or naive to think the position is already locked up for me? Barring any major gaffes or screwups on my end?",ChevalierNoiRJH,1,1.0,0,1699973678,2023-11-14 14:54:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17v3xcl/last_batch_of_interviews_this_week_cautiously/,11,2023

17v3ule,Young company or Startup,"I am looking for advice on joining a startup. I am currently a design engineer for a smaller company who has only been around for a couple of years. While here it has been a bit rocky from a management perspective, lots of short sighted decisions, not listening to employees, poor communication, unnecessary overtime, etc. The director likes to keep a close eye on everything and likes to micromanage a bit which can  sometimes be overbearing. Likes to call late at night and on the weekends. With that said the company has been improving the last couple months and I have a clear line for leadership as our team grows. 

My issue is that during a time of frustration with my position I started looking at what else is available in my area. I came across an interesting senior product design position for a startup. I had a lot of good communication with the founder and he decided to move forward with me as the candidate. I will be leading the design for this company and be employee #1. This position will also have future potential to be partner in the company depending on success. The startup has a lot of parallels to my current position and I feel I can successfully pull off what he is wanting. 

My current employer found out I was thinking of leaving before I could make a final decision because of another employee I was talking too(he recently quit). I basically have to decide in the next two days what I want to do. My current employer really wants me to stay as he believes I have lots of potential and wants me as a future leader and promises improvement. I’m just not sure I will like working under him. But this position is pretty safe and secure. 

This new start up scares me a bit as there is a lot of risk. But it has a lot of creative freedom and will be hybrid for the first year or two. Also initial pay is about the same with more pto. I’ll be given stock options after the first year. 

Does anyone have any advice on start ups? Is it smarter to just stick it out with current employer and gain the leadership experience even if it could be a nightmare? 

Any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the long wall of text. Just lost at the moment.",Blackbear9511,1,1.0,0,1699973459,2023-11-14 14:50:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17v3ule/young_company_or_startup/,11,2023

17v1io0,Am I being too desperate?,"(also posted on r/jobs)
How keen is too keen?

So I (34f) am at my wit's end in my current job. I have been applying for new mid-senior level roles for the past year and am struggling to even get interviews.

I found a junior executive role that could have been written for me, and I am so excited about the prospect of it. The thing is, the listing closed a week ago and I haven't heard anything yet (they didn't confirm receipt of my application which I always worry about, but they are a small firm). I spoke to the hiring manager on the phone before I applied as I wanted more information about the role and to try and generate a repor with them, however this was organised through their HR so I have no direct contact details. The conversation went well, so I have been hopeful.

I am really nervous that I am not going to even get an interview. They were quite slow to respond when I contacted them before the deadline, and I know they have a very small team. Would it look too keen/desperate to send them an email asking for an update on my application?

They posted the interview dates as 4th December, so it wouldn't be unreasonable to think they just haven't contacted applicants yet, but I'm getting antsy... I know that lots of people don't like to be hounded by applicants, but would it be unreasonable to chase seeing as I didn't get confirmation of my application even being received?

I’m so scared of working for such companies again. I have zero trust, and these are things that I may experience only when hired. Plus, the layoffs kinda had an hit on me, confirming that companies out there see us mainly as a cost to cut.

17uv9p7,"So lost, in desperate need of advice","I've been putting off making a post like this for months but I am just so, so, so lost and feel this is the only place where I might get some advice to put me on the right path.  
  
I'll try to keep it short.   
  
Computer Engineering and Computer Science major graduated in May and STILL haven't found a job yet. No internship, about a year's worth of research experience, degree focused on Machine Learning (hard to find any job with this when you don't have your masters or are not currently pursuing one). I feel like I've put myself in a really bad position for two reasons. One is I've touched on a lot of different topics/skills/etc in undergrad (computer architecture, electrical engineering, data science, artificial intelligence, etc.) but I haven't studied any of these in depth to set myself apart in jobs I've applied to or even feel confident in my skillset. Second reason I've put myself in a bad position, and I really hope that if you are writing a reply to this that you do so with some empathy because I already know I've fucked up massively,  is that I admitted to myself too late that CS/CE is not for me. I really wish that I enjoyed it, maybe it was just my undergrad experience and once I finally (hopefully ever) do start working I'll enjoy it more or maybe it just really isn't for me, but I think this point really is causing some issues with me finding a job. There isn't a company that I'm just \*dying\* to work for (as it seems for a lot of other people) and I apply for any job where I feel I kinda might meet the qualifications -- but they can be totally random positions (anywhere from web developer to data scientist, etc). So this obviously makes me feel directionless/no goals, so I start to feel even shittier and more lost, so it's even harder to find something, and the vicious cycle continues...  
  
My point in writing this post is to get some advice on what I can do better to help me land a job with my ""qualifications"" until I finally know/figure out what I actually do want to do. Money is not my priority, I will literally work anywhere just to get some actual experience as long as it isn't a weapons manufacturer or defense company or anything related to that. What positions should I be looking into or applying to when I'm not even really sure what I want to do despite 4 years of undergrad? Besides leetcode/youtube/online free courses/similar resources to keep me sharp and also learn new skills, what else should I do in the meantime to be able to figure out what I want to do? I know I have other questions but I just wrote this very quickly and can't think at the moment, but I will literally take any advice you have.  
  
Sorry for the ""rambly"" and poorly written post. 

Also, if this isn't the right subreddit to put this in please redirect me to the right one. Thank you!

I am currently 19 in community college as a criminal justice major. i originally was a psychology major and before registration i switched to CJ. i really want to switch again to a biology major as i’ve always wanted to be a wildlife biologist but i never liked studying cells in humans and stuff like that. i only like studying animals, and animal psychology and animal tendencies and everything like that. the problem is i’m really, really bad at math. i’m taking a basic math now and i’m doing okay. i’m fine on homework like a B/C, but i’m failing every test. (i’ve always been bad at tests no matter what it’s on and no matter how hard i study i fail) and my parents say that they won’t pay for it if i switch because it’s not a good idea to pay for me to “fail”. i said to them ill really try and get tutoring and everything if i need it. the president of my college today said that it’s absolutely okay to change majors multiple times and that even if you are bad at a subject that you can persevere. it’s just my parents kinda don’t get that, and i really don’t wanna have to take on student loans for community college because i’m going to when i go to university. i really hope someone that has a biology degree can give me personal advice or if anyone has any advice can tell me because i’m kinda lost on what i should do",Normal_Place4250,1,1.0,2,1699937612,2023-11-14 04:53:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17uuohn/collegefuture_career_advice/,11,2023

17uuevq,"A failure at 42, could use some advice","I'm not sure where to turn to as I've exhausted therapists and friends with this topic. I am 42 and barely graduated with a computer science degree. I only lasted 1 year in my first job before I quit as I just simply couldn't understand the basic concepts. I barely made it past school. Obviously I chose the wrong major. It was devastating at 24 to fail at my first job. I followed my dream to live in Europe for a few years where I taught English. Eventually I came back and was completely lost.  Each time I have a job, I  seem to have difficulty following instructions and I get overwhelmed. I seem to be unable to keep a job unless it is pretty easy. I found a pretty basic office job that doesn't really use the brain doing data entry,  lots of excel and data stuff, but it is a pretty basic job where I get paid just a little above minimum wage. I briefly had a side business on ebay and Amazon which did extremely well. Well, I won't get into details, but I had to close it for various reasons because of certain policies. I feel like a total loser, and it is so difficult as I can't seem to figure out what to do to get out of the situation. What should I study? Should I just look for another better job?

Also, I tried going back to school at 31, but would quit each time as nothing seemed to interest me.  I considered working as a counselor, but would really like the freedom to move if I can, and being licensed means that it is a bit harder. 

I have so many regrets, like if I had just worked harder, I wouldn't be in this situation where I am still living at home unable to move out. I had spent a few years in a failed relationship. I bring this up because I feel like I poured in too much time and wasted a couple years when I maybe couldve been working towards something as I had more energy and had a desire to work etc.

I am now at the age where I am really worried about saving enough for retirement. In addition, I just want a good job, but don't know how to go about it.

17ust0v,30f Totally lost after an MS in Pharmacology,"Hello, 

I am one of those “super determined” pre-med students who has completely lost their identity after realizing medschool may not be a feasible reality. 

- Question: Does anyone have suggestions or background knowledge on directions? I would like to eventually make 6 figures.


*Welcome to skip vent*
Hindsight is 20/20, I did not have much guidance, and I tried my best. 
 
*Vent: I began college a year early. I received my BS in biology at 25 y/o. It took me about 8-9 years, as my single mother is on the spectrum, and she would unfortunately not sign my FASFA papers. Therefore, I was unable to receive financial aid until the age of 24, when I am considered an independent under FASFA guidelines. Prior to 24, I was dropped from my classes due to inability to pay, and placed in collections several times. Finally, at 24 y/o, I was free to receive aid, and pell grants that could have covered most of my tuition costs. I applied for scholarships and emergency funds, and my school paid my collections balance. I graduated within months of receiving aid. 

Throughout my 9 years in university, I spent 5-6 years in volunteer science research, became project leader, and earned a first author publication, with a few pubs. For expenses and tuition, I was a personal care aid, pharm assistant, etc. I was constantly aiming to strengthen my resume for medschool, to make up for these gaps in my transcript. I naively did not focus on MCAT preparation throughout this time. 
I graduated, and applied for MS/postbacc programs. I was accepted and decided to defer these programs due to high risk & expense. I wanted to see if I could ace the MCAT (alot of content review as I studied physics 7-9 years ago).
Covid hit, a lot of death, adversity, and years of emotional toll triggered a painful nerve disorder. 
My experiences guided me to pursue an MS degree in pharmacology, so that I could be a doctor who better understands the drugs she may prescribe, to understand pain, and addiction. And to help me refocus for the dreaded MCAT.*

I graduated a pharmacology MS with a 4.0 last May 2023. I’m $102k in debt. 
I am 30 soon, I want to start my career, my life.
My physical ability due to nerve pain is not what it used to be. I am able, but some random days I may require rest. Healing resulted in me having to strip away the part of myself that needed me to be a medical doctor. I have tried to accept that there are other ways to help people in this life that don’t require an MD. Medicine is the most beautiful story, it’s my obsession, but studying medicine is not applying medicine. And I do not know at this time if I am physically or even emotonally capable for residency, which I would finish near my 40s, half a million in debt. 

I do not want to work directly in a science lab. 

- PhD: I could continue on with a pharmacology PhD; I cannot work with animals due to allergies, which is limiting in my program (developed them after working with rats) and I don’t want to spend more time in a lab. 
However, A PhD is required for many positions in my field, like medical writer or science liaison. 

- Pharma: I am being advised to apply to pharmaceutical companies, but I have moral issues with this. Change my mind.

- Dental: may be too physically demanding for my ability in the long run. Vibrating tool may not be physically sustainable. ?

- PA: I keep trying to open myself up to this option, but I don’t believe it’s for me. 

- Patents: typically requires a PhD in my field, I have tried to get my foot through the door as a patent examiner 

- Industry: I am not educated on what’s out there 

- FDA: Compliance? I do not want to work in a lab.  

- Gov? 

- Law: I enjoy ethics, bioethics, and writing  

- Non profits: I began a 501c3 distributing resources to underserved, and I’m passionate about humanitarian work. I wonder how I may utilize this for my career direction. 

I have seen a career counselor. 
I have leadership, research, teaching, writing, management, and patient care experience. 
I do not have direct industry experience. 
I have emotional intelligence.

- Question: Does anyone have suggestions or background knowledge on these directions? I would like to eventually make 6 figures.

In particular networking and security (for cybersecurity). Does anyone know any other certificates or online courses that can get me an entry level position. I would also like to learn how to code which I was thinking learning from YouTube.

Due to my inexperience in tech I'm currently applying for jobs in my field from my degree just to make a living and then pursue these tech related things on the side. I've considered going back to uni and studying IT, but I feel that might be unnecessary considering I've got a degree regardless. Plus my student loan will be really high at the end of it.

I do want to state I’ve never EVER done something like this before.

But recently, I took a job at a branch in the town I grew up in. I thought being back in somewhere familiar, I would have a better work experience. I had previously been a floater in our district and I really enjoyed doing that. (I’m trying to keep the industry I work in anonymous.)

As soon as I walked into the branch I was welcomed with the most unfriendly welcoming people I’ve ever met. (Excluding two people) . The process of getting me to know the branch was just “find it on your own” or “use your eyes”. There was one coworker that used to make fun of me for being “stupid” or “not knowing the job” after being there for two weeks. Apparently it was a joke, but after two weeks I’m not comfortable joking around with someone calling people things like that. 

Anyways, I was dreading going to work. Everyone saw it in me that I was having a hard time mentally. I decided to line up another job (which i start Friday) and leave my current one. I don't care about burning bridges since I am leaving the industry completely.

17uqnqv,Putting in my 2 weeks at a job I’ve only been at for 2-3 months tomorrow. Should I feel ashamed?,"After graduating, I was employed for 13 months. So I of course was estatic when I was offered this wonderful opportunity. I moved and bought a house 14 hours away from where I previously lived, in a town where I know no one.

The brown isn’t the problem, it’s very nice. My coworkers are very nice. But the job is so toxic. Toxic manager, understaffed with high turnover, nothing but bad things from the people who left. They warned me during the interview that this was a high-stress job with a lot of work, but of course after 13 months I thought I could handle it.

The first month was remote as I prepared for my move. This was great, I had a lot of fun and felt comfortable because 1- I was remote and new, and 2- I was remote so I didn’t have the full scope of work or understand the full responsibilities of the job.

So I move down here. In the past 2 months I’ve already cried to my favorite coworker multiple times, cried to my boss twice, had multiple panic attacks and suicidal ideations, meltdowns to my parents, you get the jist. They are understaffed so a lot of work is getting piled onto me, a newbie, and multiple other newbies they’ve hired as they have no employee retention. I’m drowning.

I tell my parents this, I even tell my boss this. My parents said to stick it out for at least 6 months to a year, but I’m at my breaking point and I don’t think it’s really fair to me nor my boss to keep this going on. I know it isn’t a good fit.

But, alas. I’m scared of jumping back into 13 months of unemployment. I’m scared my mere 3 months of experience will turn employers off. I know putting in your 2 weeks / quitting without a job lined up is a big no no, but I’m lucky to have plenty of savings and complete support of my parents in this time. The worry isn’t financial, it’s just about my employability.

I just feel ashamed. I know plenty of people have left the company for the same reasons, but I’d definitely be the one who had been there the shortest. I’m embarrassed.

17uq20l,Stay or Go?,"I've been working as a contract worker for my current role and I am almost hitting my 1 year mark.  When I was first hired I shared the desire to be a full-time worker.  Over the year working there, I have seen 2 new hires get hired as well as 2 contractors go perm.  I was told that I am now the next in line to go full-time, but the interview that I have had has started to raise some flags.

First Flag: 

The latest employee to have gotten converted was the only person who was interviewed.  I tried to apply for the same position but HR informed me that the position was for internal employees only.  The person they hired was a contractor just like me.  I was able to confirm he was the only person who was hired/interviewed by management(about 6 months ago).  

Second: 

Now that there is a current opening within the department, it is one other and me who is competing for the position.  I am their senior.  Being there was no contest for the previous hire, I am confused as to why we are competing.

Third: 

I have just interviewed for the position and at the end of the interview, the hiring manager made a comment that made me worried that I might not get the position.  Ultimately it was, &quote Please don't leave if we don't pick you. &quote

17upqi6,Got laid off day before probation ended with no explanation,"Hello,

Last week on Monday, it was the last day before my probation ended. I came in at 8am, and had a binder full of my accomplishments at the new job so far (I was gunning for a wage increase). At 10am I met with HR and my manager. I opened the meeting with a few sentences for making my case for a raise, I noticed HR and my manager looked really sad. I paused and they said my employment is being terminated.

They laid me off. They refused to give me any explanation and said it was a no fault of my own layoff, and that no one person made the decision. I asked a few more times and got no answer. I sat in my car and cried, and after 15 minutes my manager came out to tell me I had to leave the property.

I have been trying to figure out what happened. Here's a few things:

\- I regularly got feedback from my director, manager, other managers and HR that was largely positive, and if it wasn't positive it that I was in the right direction and proper feedback to improve upon.  
\- I was accidently CC'd in an email after I was laid off with my manager chewing out my director saying he didn't know this was happening and since he reported to me he should've made the call.  
\- The week before I made jokes about being laid off to several of my colleagues and director and they were immediately like, ""In no world is that happening and laughed"".  
\- I wasn't allowed to say goodbye to my colleagues, but several called me to check in and say everyone was surprised and disagreed with the decision.

Basically this is going to have no cohesion at all but I just need some advice.

I have undiagnosed ADHD ( my therapist was adhd specialised and did the test unofficially and said without a doubt I have adhd ) I don’t have enough money to be diagnosed. 

Anyway I’ve been married and was earning 22k a year working a remote job in the uk just after I got married I’m 22 my wife is 21 I got made redudant. I only have my GCSE. I have an entrepreneurs mind I’ve always done side hustles and made decent money from it but now I’m looking for my own business or a job that is good for adhd people as I struggle with focusing and get very distracted and I hardly ever last 3 weeks ! I am not a lazy person but sometimes I get negative thoughts that make me thing I am. I do also have anxiety but I’m definitely getting the better of it ! I just struggle to have an in person job due to health anxiety (no health conditions just intrusive thoughts about what if something happens. As I say I’m getting over it !) also I get anxious learning new things as unless I’m interested I will struggle learning things. I just don’t know what jobs to do. I love things for 2 weeks and then the day after I dislike it and can’t focus. It’s so frustrating. I just need a decent income of 2k/ month minimum. Then I can focus more on business.

17uoy8k,Finding a career,"I'll keep the backstory brief.  I have a Master's in History and a Bachelor's in history with a minor in public history. I'm a bit of a late bloomer and didn't really finish my undergrad degree until I was about 28.  I am now 33 and finished up my master's in August.  I have two kids now and can't seem to find jobs suitable to support a family.  I have had internships in museum work, archives, community engagement, and now a temporary gig as a cultural resource tech.  I had high hopes in getting a degree in History because I could truly pursue some of my passions.  But now that I have a family, things have changed, and I can't seem to find anything that pays to help support a family in Utah, where the cost of living has skyrocketed. We are trying to stay in Utah because my wife can work here, and we have help from family for the kids. My temp gig ends in January, and while I've been trying to find jobs related to my field, I am having no luck.  I'm beginning to feel a shift is necessary, but I'm not sure how to market myself, and I am having more difficulty finding a job outside of my field.  Any advice on where to even start?

17unmxt,Unsure if I should do a rotation to another continent for 2 years - what will happen to my private life?,"I (F, 28) have the opportunity to do a rotation with my job to the US (New York, LA etc.) from Europe for the duration of two years. It is / will be a high-paying job, so it is not a financial decision. 

I have friends and family all over Europe that I will miss but am not attached enough to stay for them. I have been single for the past three years and while I have absolutely no problem with that, I hope to marry and have kids one day. There is currently no one in sight for this, so I am not bound to stay in those terms. However, I feel like my time abroad will be like a break from any potential progress of my private life given the time there will only be for work, travel and relationships meant to “end” after the rotation. While I am not sure how easy / if I will find friends, I am a quite open person who gets along well with many people, so I hope to find enough social interactions through work and other activities.

What I am scared of is that I will be 30 by the time I return which feels too old to start looking for a serious relationship and later starting a family (which might take a while and I don’t want to seem desperate). 

Going to the US has always been one of my biggest dreams and I feel like it is a now or never decision. I am somewhat stuck / feels too much like a routine in my current position which is why I started looking into this opportunity. I don’t want to give up on my dream for something no one can guarantee will happen if I stay but also don’t want to regret it afterwards and seeing that as a reason I will be without a family. I might never have a family even if I do not go. I am almost done with my application, but I am scared and excited at the same time. Wish I could have done this over the last two years vs. now.

17um0l6,Getting my employer to pay for law school?,"Hi all, as the title says I'm contemplating pitching an idea to my current employer. I want them to support me through 3 years of law school in order for me to work with them and provide in-house legal guidance to their clients. The clients are primarily homeless individuals, and people with severe mental health diagnoses.

I have a BA in Anthropology, an MA in Policy, and very good LSAT scores but haven't put in any applications yet. I am looking at a school with hybrid options and night classes that's on the cheaper side, but still carries some weight in the name.

My employer is a nonprofit specializing in mental health and housing. My first year was 2020, and my job was to keep people housed during the pandemic by navigating state policy and housing court, and negotiating deals with property management companies and landlords.

My employer has promoted me multiple times over the last 3 years, on average every 8 months. They have a wonderful culture, and they've definitely taken a liking to me. Along with the work we are doing, there is a constant need for bona-fide legal guidance. 

In the past, there was a need for a Doctor, we hired a very skilled one, and pay them appropriately. They offer their expertise and ability to diagnose and prescribe medicine to our clients. I am looking to do something similar, but from a legal perspective.

Much of my employers funding comes from a combination of government grants that fund mental health and housing work, and large organizations that collect donations and fund projects in various cities around the state. In my mind we would be able to respond to RFP's for legal council serving disadvantaged communities, and potentially increase our funding, enough to support my salary and fill an overlooked need in our state.

How would I go about pitching this? Is it asking too much for them to hang in there for 3 years while I finish school?",Guilty_Scheme_6215,1,0.5,5,1699912266,2023-11-13 21:51:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17um0l6/getting_my_employer_to_pay_for_law_school/,11,2023
17ulg81,Is there such a thing as too much work life balance?,"I'm 25 and have a Data Scientist job at a big tech company (not FAANG) with incredible work life balance. It's fully remote and I work 5-20 hours a week with $150k. It seems perfect on paper but I feel like a lot is missing.  
Purpose - I don't feel driven to work because there's not much to work on. There's not much to learn either. People say purpose doesn't need to come from work but I've found it hard to come by from other things. I've spent a lot of time with hobbies like climbing, yoga, surfing, soccer, sailing, etc. And these activities are great but a lot of them are social and its hard to do them during work hours when everyone else is working.  
Social - Work isn't supposed to be family but even though I spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities most of my best friends have come from school, through school, or through work socials. I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on the camaraderie that all my peers have with their coworkers. Even though they're grinding, they're grinding together and that somewhat seems better than having ""fun"" alone.  
Learning - You can learn anything for free online, in theory. The reality is, however, without a structured goal with people it feels somewhat aimless. I end up bouncing around from random topic to random topic and there's no fire under my ass to make me achieve something.  
Dating - People say don't shit where you eat however, pretty much all my friends met their SOs at work, college, or dating apps. I've grinded away hard on the dating apps but have got no results. I feel like the regular interaction at work is hard to beat.  
I feel driven to find a job that's more demanding but it seems to go against everything preached by contemporary society (say no to hustle culture, prioritize self care, life is more important than work). Am I missing something?

always having a mentor/guide to help you out.

17ukvqq,How to handle when the CEO or the company you quit is now also the CEO of new company I'm interviewing at?,"I was hired by the CEO of a small company, and after about 6 months I quite because it just wasn't a fit. The company was led by the CEO and the Founder/Prez. The Founder/president seemed to run the show and he was a bit unhinged, but the CEO followed along. It wasn't for me.

Forward to 6 months later, the CEO quit that company and was just announced as the new CEO of a much larger company. (I was surprised).  I was just contacted by their HR for a role in the company (the same one I had at the old job).  The call is tomorrow. It's a very basic pre-elim chat with HR. Because it's a senior role, I'm chatting with the head of HR which is not uncommon.   The old company is in my LinkedIn so they must know I used to work for their new CEO.

Question: How do I go about this? For sure they'll ask me why I left. Or if for some reason they haven't connected the dots and didn't see that I used to work for their new CEO, how do I bring this up? I feel like I have to mention it.  Thoughts? 

I need the job, so it doesn't matter how I feel about the CEO now, but for what its worth its a much larger company so I don't think I'd be workign directly under him, and it seems that he left the old company because he also thought the Founder was unhinged.

17ukk25,Education vs Work Experience. What Should I do?,"# I NEED HELP!

&#x200B;

Hi everyone I am a 20 year old college student wondering what I should do for my future. 

&#x200B;

I am in the progress of completing my second year or community college and was looking to become a PTA (Physical Therapy Assistant). The schooling is 3 years and will cost me around $14,500, however I was looking at the pay they receive post-grad and I dont believe that it is sustainable with the cost of living in the Bay Area-Cali where I live now. The median salary is 71k and although it is good I was considering my options. I do not want to do a doctorate program to become a pt as the schooling is too much and can put me considerable in debt. 

My resume is really good on the other hand to the point where I have been currently accepted to work at Kaiser Permenente in patient admitting making $32.5 an hour. (I have experience working in administrative positions in retail, clinics, and hospitals. This position is on call, however with hospitals the hardest part is getting in as they are notoriously strict and have high standards, also they prefer to hire from within. With me already getting in I believe I can transfer to a full time postion at other hospitals or Kaiser starting at around 65K-70K with good hospital benefits and even make more with the more years I add to my resume. 

* Also it has been mentioned to me before that having a degree on a resume can be substantially beneficial, and I am close to getting an AA in Liberal Arts degree which would look good on my resume.

So do I:

1. Go to Pta school, continue with that career?
2. Get my 60 units and change into a different major once I get into a CSU to get a bachelors degree.
3. Continue with my work experience, and transfer to continue making higher pay with a AA Degree?

17uk5gn,Fair pay advice needed (uk),"I have worked for my dad since I was 17. Over the last 2 years he has had so many serious health problems and naturally I just took on more work. I have been doing a full time degree, I ran the business and I was scared to death about what would happen to my dad. A month ago, I found out that a colleague (who isn’t of any management level at all) has been getting paid £5 per hour more than me since April. My dad wasn’t aware of this as she was still being paid by a former manager still registered as a director (invoicing). We are all classed as self-employed and she said she got her wires crossed over her hourly rate apparently. 

I brought this issue up and after a month of it not being addressed or brought up, the decision has been made for this employee to remain on the higher rate of pay and for her not to pay back the extra money. I’ve worked out that she’s had an extra £3k than me so far; even though she has an awful lot less responsibility. He has said he understands that it is morally wrong but it’s a business decision as he doesn’t want to lose her as it would cost a lot of time and money to find a replacement for her. 

I feel nothing but betrayed and hurt after putting my life and soul into that business so that he didn’t have to worry. I wasn’t even on a management rate whilst I was running it! 

I live with my dad and as much as I don’t want work to interfere with home, I can’t get over it and I don’t know what to do other than consider moving out of the family joke for a while and leaving a job that I have absolutely loved and has been a huge part of my life for years, which would also upset me.

17ujm2b,Expecting an offer for more than double my salary in base next week. Should I leave my role at Amazon (1.25 YoE) to work for a globally remote US series A startup?,"Currently making 120k CAD TC at AWS in Toronto Canada (90k CAD base), came back FT as a returning AWS intern. In my mid-late 20s, no kids etc. My team is great and I have some amazing opportunities lined up this year to grow as a technical IC machine learning engineer. Got contacted by a recruiter recently for the start up role, and made it through the interview process for 180k USD base offer (\~250k CAD) + options + healthcare stipend on top. This blows most opportunities in Toronto out of the water for \~1.25 YOE and doubt even the 'Zon would match since I'm L4 and it's far out of band. I can keep living in Toronto with my partner + our friends and community and work remote as a contractor for the startup.  The role is less technical (ML dev rel / evangelism) but still very interesting and I think I'd be good at it. (Writing technical blog posts/public facing code repos, conference talks etc.)

I've been flip flopping about this decision a lot because I really like my team at Amazon and have some exceptionally good opportunities for technical mentorship ahead. I have been doing well at work with good feedback. I came into ML Engineering from a mechanical engineering background and through the sweat equity of my time at Amazon I felt would ""prove myself"" for future career. I'm worried about optimizing for money ""too soon"" over optimizing for skills at the end of the day.

Pros of startup switch:

\- Base $$$ right away, job is super interesting, travel to top AI conferences, still technical in ML (but in the capacity of quickstart code repos and technical blogs, so probably won't increase my depth of skill), path to more $$ is not fast or easy at amazon (1+yr for L5 promo and even that would be \~170kCAD TC)

Cons:

\- Job is less technical than current role (I don't want to close that MLE door forever), series A is a risk for stability (founder says 2y runway), 1yr and 2mo feels too short of a stint at Amazon to be taken seriously as an MLE in future. Also feel my WLB is pretty good right now... but it depends on the month. Canada might be heading into a recession in 2024 and this feels risky. (But also for 2x TC 1yr at startup is equivalent to 2 at Amazon financially lol). Also need to manage the tax overhead of being a contractor but I'm a finance nerd already and can get a good accountant.

Do I go for the sweat equity and 2YOE stamp on my resume? Or am I overthinking and should take the leap and secure the bag?

3. My pay is good for what I do, but it's not enough to keep my family afloat anymore. promises of pay increases have not come through after several months, though this is more on our HR department. I'm not sure what the pay for this job is, honestly, but they asked my salary requirements in the email. (I know to leave this out)

4. This new position would be admin in the medical field. Something I'm interested in because of my families history with medical problems. I'm not in medical right now.

17ui1tg,Is taking the manager position better?,"
TLDR: Leave for a manager position or stay as a sr analyst

What would you do:

I currently work in the supply chain industry in A senior analyst position making $90k per year (USD) & fully remote. I have asked for a promotion multiple times because my work duties have expanded and no I unofficially own the program I work in. Company has been going through layoffs often and recently a recruiter in company came and asked me to explain what my duties are in my job and what I do on a day to day (said she was curious to get into a role similar to mine). Long story, I felt like I was being interviewed and left feeling unsettled as if my job was on the line.


I also on the side have been interviewing and was offered a program manager role for $118k per year with a hybrid schedule. Commute would be 40 mins with public transportation (not too bad). This role will be in the cannabis industry (which not sure how this could be looked at). All the people I interviewed with were not shy about saying there will be challenges with the work we do because they are still working and building processes. They have been selling the role as an opportunity to grow and build out the program. This scares me because, well burn out.

This increase in pay sounds amazing. The company seems to have good culture, with monthly mixers, a good manager, and so forth. I’m just stuck because I’m kind of bored with my current job and now uneasy that maybe they’ll eliminate role or replace me.",Ok-Breakfast-5246,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1699902352,2023-11-13 19:05:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ui1tg/is_taking_the_manager_position_better/,11,2023

17ugojl,How should I approach my employer about a modified schedule for my medical issues?,"Hey all!

My mental health condition has deteriorated to the point where I need an intensive outpatient program.

Thee program really lives up to its name - it is hella intensive with its time demand, even though it is structured to be during evening hours for busy adults. It is three days a week of group therapy, three hour long sessions each.

I have a hybrid schedule, working from home 2 days a week and in office for 3. My round trip commute those days is like 2-2.5 hrs. One of those intensive care days is on my remote day, two are on two office days. I work a typical engineer desk job.

Honestly, in order to make my schedule feasible I may need to request a 2day office/3 day WFH set up, with one day being that I need to leave early to make it in time for therapy. This would be the case for about two months, unless medical advice tells me to stay longer. 

I have a good relationship with my project managers and my supervisors. Generally I just inform them when I’m going to be out, and everyone is chill. This type of accommodation is a bigger ask than I have put forward before, though.

How do I approach asking for this accommodation? Should I be talking to my supervisor first, or to HR?

I tried my best but the work environment here is toxic. I mostly extend our working hours just to finish the tasks. The quota for the tasks is impractical and most if not, all of us go under quota. I've done everything; from expressing my frustration and mental health to my manager, to taking it slow. Nothing happened. My quality of work has been regressing this past month. Recently, they trained me to do another task and at this point I don't know what I'm doing. My mental health is deteorating and I lack sleep every day.

One of the reasons why I haven't left is because we work from home. The convenience of being with my mother most of the time is one of the reasons why I'm reluctant to leave. Second, I tried applying to other companies and most of them are hybrid which makes me reluctant to accept their offer. Third, I'm thinking, if I do transfer to a different company, it could be that the grass isn't greener and I'm afraid I might regret the decision. Fourth, I will resign mid 2025 to put up a business in which I will manage so I told myself to just stick it out till then. However, I'm currently really in a bad place.

17ub2hi,Feel stuck and adrift.,"I hate having to post this. 
I have always been introvert and quite quiet, disliking conflict and consider myself more sensitive to criticism and tend to reflect a lot. 

I’ve been in IT for 15 years now and worked at varying companies of all shapes and sizes as a senior developer and agile process / delivery manager, so have a mixed bag of skills and experience. 

I’ve been at my new job now for 7 months and it’s a small company, you can’t escape anyone. Problem is, I believe I’m being bullied by someone there who is my peer, I believe he feels threatened and doesn’t want me here, undermining me, passive aggressive messages etc and makes my life a living hell. If he vanished, things would be much better. 

I raised this for ally with screenshots of messages as evidence. We were called into a room with the owner and manager and basically the bully denied everything,  didn’t take accountability for the messages and said “don’t poke the bear then”. The guy is pathetic and poor excuse for a professional. I’ve never encountered anyone like him. Being the bigger person, I said that we can coexist and that these messages need to stop, offered to shake hands and wanted to put this behind me. I don’t think I’ve seen the end of this though. He basically thinks I do nothing all day, which isn’t true, my value is in managing the delivery of software products and the ways of working which isn’t as tangible as a software engineer. It cuts deep when he says that as I suffer with imposter syndrome too and have burned out many times before. 

It’s got to the point now where I feel afraid to do anything in fear of him lashing out or starting all of this back up. I take it home, stew over it, get depressed and can’t sleep. It’s really bothering me, I feel a shadow of my former self here now. I have a one year old son and wife and feel like this is impacting my time with them. It’s now all I can think about and I can’t stop feeling angry with this guy how he just gets away with this like nothing happened. 

I have savings in the bank to float me for a couple of years out of work too if needed but don’t feel like I should have ti quit because of idiots like him and go through the awful interview process again. 

Any advice?

17u9956,A whole new career in finance,"

I (42M) am looking at starting a new career in the finance sector. Friends and colleagues who work in this sector believe I should do well but I don’t know where to start with my skill set.

I have no education beyond graduating high school, I have 10 years experience in retail, 10 years experience in Business development management and 10 years experience as a General Manager in a maintenance company.

Where should I begin?

It should also be noted that I live in Australia (if this makes a difference or not).

17u8t32,Need advice,"Hello, I'm 28 years old and new to my job. My co-workers are friendly, including the managers and supervisors. However, I'm not enjoying my job as a Quality Assurance professional at a manufacturing site. I tried this job, but I feel like I can't perform it well because I don't fully understand the processes. Although my manager guides me, it's still not clear to me. I feel like I can't do my job properly because something is missing, and even though my colleagues are nice, I sense some disappointment from my manager and supervisor because they have high expectations of me due to my previous experience in Quality Control in manufacturing. They've also given me a higher salary. I've realized that there's a significant difference between QC and QA, and I struggle with documentation and using the right words. My English skills are weak, and it takes me a long time to create reports without templates. I also feel pressured because on my first day, I was bombarded with about ten group chat about quality concerns, and I was expected to handle all of them.

Additionally, I don't understand why I'm acting differently. I used to be confident, cheerful, and approachable with managers, giving ideas without hesitation or anxiety. I had excellent communication with the people I worked with in my previous role as a QC analyst. However, in my current role as QA, I've become very shy, and I even stutter when speaking to colleagues, especially those in higher positions. I'm embarrassed about this change in my behavior and the first impression I've given them. It feels like my initial impression has had a significant impact. What should I do? Should I leave or stay, as this is challenging for me?",BestDealsAndMore,1,1.0,0,1699875611,2023-11-13 11:40:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17u8t32/need_advice/,11,2023
17u7jgv,Should I put my (3 month) notice in before getting a new job?,"Hi, I’m based in England and have been in my current role since January 2023.

Since starting I’ve had trouble working with my boss, we get on but there have been quite a lot of issues. At first she would introduce me to people as doing all of the jobs she didn’t want to do, she never gives positive feedback, and has the frustrating trait of micromanaging but never responding to my work emails (or taking literally months) and hardly being present or available to speak to due to her constantly overworking/packing her schedule too full. A lot of this is brought on by her ADHD, which is quite severe, but even though I keep this in consideration, it has had a knock on effect on my confidence in my role. 

We are an incredibly small team (4 people), who are all really busy but she only notices how busy she is and it’s the main thing she’ll talk about. She can be very harsh with her emails and the way she talks to me and others, and it’s taking it’s toll on my mental health. 

After she was almost arguing with me about people having time off at the same time over Christmas, right before I was off for the next 5 days I decided to get serious about applying for a new job.

Due to a potential employer contacting her she now knows I’m looking for work and has said I need to decide if I’m leaving as she’s going on mat leave in the new year and will need to recruit (it took a long time to find me for the position). She’s been nice to me since but there is also the odd snide remark which I’m not sure but could be referring to me taking issue with her communication. She feels it’s down to her ADHD which it may be, and I don’t take issue with that, I’m not trying to call her out on it, but I can’t help how it affects me.

I’m fairly confident about finding a new job. Obviously I don’t know who else is looking for similar things, but my work is quite broad (senior management, operations, finance) and there are a lot of options in my area. I put two applications in and got interviews for both of them so far.

Problem is I have a 3 month notice period which I feel is incredibly long and may put off potential employers. 

So long winded story short, I’m hoping someone may be able to share experience or advice on any or all of the following:

- is 3 months excessively long, and has anyone else experienced it being a problem?
- how risky is putting in my notice now and hoping by the end of the 3 months I find something? I have savings that could last me around 6 months but I’d love not to use them as it’s my savings to buy somewhere. 
- The job is really taking its toll on my health where I’m considering sick leave, but worry about future consequences of this with new employers, does anyone have past experience of this?

Thank you to anyone who can relate and share some thoughts on this :)",KayBeets56,1,1.0,6,1699870138,2023-11-13 10:08:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17u7jgv/should_i_put_my_3_month_notice_in_before_getting/,11,2023

17u5cck,Miserable and out of work for far too long.,"Man this is so frustrating.

I live in a small area. Not a ton of potential employeers. So that means I've practically applied everywhere I could think off.

I've even reached out to thouse places that are supposed to help you find a job. No dice. It was just a request for information but I got nothing. 

I've tried college three times. It went worse each time due to mental health. But when I spoke with a therapist and a psychiatrist they basically said they didn't see anything wrong. Just prescribed me something for sleep and pushed me out the door. 

So uh.. yeah. That's about it. I ran out of ideas a while ago. I'm trying to avoid a bigger episode then a year ago but I also don't want to stay with my parents anymore. 

Don't even get my started on that. It's a bad situation that I tried for years to make better. I moved out when I was 16. During COVID though I had to choose between being homeless are moving back in with them. I'm starting to feel like I made the wrong choice. 

I'm looking for specific advice. Anything generic and I'll probably feel like I've already tried it. Try to keep in account I currently live in a fairly rural area as well.

17u3usk,Dental Student Graudating Soon,"I am really conflicted on what to do. Brief background about me. I am a 26-year-old male about to graduate from dental school in May 2024. I will be graduating with 160,000 in debt at 5% interest rate. The amount of debt I will be graduating with is a lot but compared to other dental students, I am extremely lucky and thankful. I was recently presented with this wonderful job oppuritunty but do not know what to do.

1. The first opportunity is in my home city, a dentist mentor of mine wants to partner with me on his second office. Me and this mentor has done business with each other in the past and are currently partners in another dental related business. The partner promised me a base salary of 200k or half of the profits the office produces. Currently there is an assocaite working at his second office but that associate is getting ready to move due to family. I have seen the numbers he produces, the overhead of the office, and the patient base. After doing some basic calculation, I belive I can take home close to 25k per month which is about 300k. On top of that the dentist would expect me to buy the office from him in 2-3 years and I think I can include the real estate since he owns it too. This is truly a great opportunity but I am afraid to jump in since 1. I will be the only dentist there which would not be a big problem but I feel like I will get pigeonholed and only do bread and butter dentsitry since I would be afraid to do more complex cases. This can hinder my clinical skill success in the future. The other downside is I want to leave the city I live in. The city is great with a population of  800,000, cost of living is not that hight can prob live of 30k a year since I am single I want to live in a bigger city. But I do intend to come back to open an office here and live here but just want to take a break
2. The second opportunity is to move to a bigger city, this city I know alot of people that live there and I can be more outgoing and experenice life more. The pay would not be that great prob close to 180k starting or 30% production. I would not want to live here permanently due to the cost of living being higher and more competition, but it will be funnier for me. The cost of living will prob be 50k since I would want to live in a nicer apartment, go out more and enjoy being single. The pros about this place is I will be able to live a fun life and do what I want to do without stress of running an office. Yes I will not make as much money or be able to pay down my debt in a year. I will also be able to expand my clincial skills by looking for an office that have senior doctor I can work with.

Conclusion: I feel like I am exhausted and just want to have fun and move to a different city, but I also know that the first opportunity is once in a lifetime and I should just man up and take it.

17tzh35,Risk of leaving “bonus” on table by resigning position to provide expected 4 weeks+ of notice.,"Hi - looking for practical advice for the following situation:

I met with the owner of my company (50ish employees) at the beginning of the year as part of my annual performance review and to discuss my compensation (became privy to how underpaid I was). The owner couldn’t offer a raise but did offer a significant percentage of my client’s annual incentive bonus which has always been paid 100% to my company (never me despite me doing all the work). This percentage was going to be significantly higher than the raise I requested so I accepted and it was included in writing at the end of my signed performance review. 

Fast forward and I have a job offer I have accepted with a start date in early January. My current company sent me an email that I will be paid the incentive bonus at the end of this month. 

My position, per employee handbook and general industry expectations based on the leadership role I fill, is to provide 4 weeks notice. If I wait until early December, that would be providing 3 weeks of notice as we close the last week of the year. 

My spouse thinks I should tell them this upcoming week and if they renege on the bonus that it’s wage theft as I have a written agreement about me receiving this bonus, and the agreement does not state that if I resign I forfeit the money. And because it’s wage theft, hire an attorney. 

I don’t want to burn a bridge with my employer by only providing 3 weeks but also don’t want to not be paid this owed compensation. The amount is just shy of $10k. What would you do?

17tz7rz,"Nearly 8 years with the same bank, and finally need to make a move","About 8 years ago while I was working retail I managed to land a job as a Relationship Banker. Since then I’ve gotten married and we’ve had two kids, so as far as I’m concerned banking is locked in as my career. However, I have really made the most of this bank, and have managed to get a good variety of experience while I’ve been here. I started as the Relationship Banker, and from there went to a Small Business Relationship Banker, then to Mortgage Loan Officer, and now to Assistant Branch Manager. 

(Edit: In hindsight, you can probably skip these next two paragraphs and still answer my question.)

Here’s why I feel now is the time to make a move… I kinda started as a Mortgage Loan Officer just as rates started increasing post-Covid. Even though I loved that job, since it was exclusively commission, it was just not possible to get myself established and find any success. (Our bank went from 7 MLOs in our area down to 2 during this time. Just for some context, and to show I wasn’t just bad at the job) So I reached out to my old Regional Manager and was told to come back to the branches as an Assistant Manager. He said within twelve months he’ll get me my own branch. Branch Manager was never something I planned on pursuing but after the failure of the Mortgage job, cost of living going up, having our 2nd child, and the desire to purchase a home of our own in the near future… desperate times call for desperate measures. 

Fast forward 11 months, and our bank announces they are closing a handful branches in the area… While my branch is not one of the closing branches, I am still being put in a bit of a pickle. There are now a handful of existing Branch Managers looking for homes. I was told specifically not to apply for any BM roles “while they try and find homes” and “until the smoke clears.” I get it but BM positions do not post often and they are only going to become more infrequent, so this is a little frustrating. The icing on the cake is, in an attempt to save some BMs they are creating a BM position at my branch… the one I am essentially already managing… but I will not be able to apply for… And the cherry on the icing is that this also means we will not be in need of an Assistant Manager. I don’t know exactly what this means for me, but best guess is I will be bumped down to banker with a bit of a pay cut.

So that being said, I’m thinking it’s time to cut ties.  What brings me here is, I was wondering if anyone knows of any unique positions I should seek out/pursue where my experience may make me a solid candidate. While my current bank is a National Bank, it doesn’t have a major presence in my area. Therefore all the jobs they offer are pretty exclusively in-branch, and when looking at competitor job postings I’m a little lost and not exactly sure what (if anything) I qualify for.

Something I’d like to reiterate is that I LOVED the mortgage job. I loved being able to hone my focus in on essentially one product. I loved working on each individual application like they were projects, trying to figure out which route to go and what they’d qualify for. And I obviously loved my ability to do a lot of this from home and the freedom that came with that. What is stopping me from just pursuing that again, is the uncertainty that comes with the commission. 

I am basically trying to find out what kind of jobs I should post for where I may not have to start at entry-level (I unfortunately cannot afford that) with my banking experience. While not ideal, if that just means branch management at another company, then so be it. If there is anyone here with a banking background (or any comparable background) and has any ideas, please share!

TLDR: 8 years banking experience across personal banking, business banking, mortgage lending, and branch management. All under the same company. Looking to move on, and looking for ideas of what my experience may make myself a solid candidate for.",Gingerhead14,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1699838210,2023-11-13 01:16:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17tz7rz/nearly_8_years_with_the_same_bank_and_finally/,11,2023
17tykhc,"Mid-50s crossroads, currently stagnating in the fitness/wellness industry.","Currently in my mid-50s, residing in Canada. Edu/work history - dropped out of university after 1 year (little family support, buckled under the pressure of school and work), spent my early to late 20s making decent coin as retail management in the fitness industry before I got sick of/burned out from it. Rudderless for a some time until I decided to go to school for shiatsu massage - turned out I was quite good at it. A few years later I acquired my yoga teacher certification, self-studied like crazy in anatomy, biomechanics and pain science, then got into movement study, which has allowed me to take my practices in a more therapeutic/rehabilitative direction.

For the past decade, I've been running my own small business, which includes offering these modalities at a home-based studio, being contracted out to other facilities (wellness centres, gyms, colleges, etc), and the occasional in-home client. I absolutely love helping people this way, my regulars will sing my praises til the cows come home. That said, even though I make between $40 (lowest paying group class) to $150 (in-home private) an hour, it's never earned me more than $30K/year.

Just when I was starting to make some headway (invites to multiple workshops, held my first, successful, destination retreat), the pandemic hit. I'm mostly recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but far from where I'd like my earnings to be. I'm tired of poor returns on the constant promotion that's required and trying to compete for exposure on social media. I know that's the nature of entrepreneurship, my partner has suggested that after this long, perhaps I'm just not cut out for it.

While I'm fortunate that my partner both earns considerably more than I do and recognizes the value in other contributions I make to our household, I don't feel good about my current station. The problem I have is trying to decide what to do next. We have some funds that could be used in a number of ways, I want to ensure I'm not wasting either money or time.

Options currently on the table:

- Massage school: A big issue with shiatsu is that it generally isn't covered by benefits. My partner thinks I should pay $25K and take two years to get my RMT designation - that way, I can still offer shiatsu, but can also write insurance receipts. Thing is, I don't know that I want 2 more years of massage training and really don't want to practice as an RMT (not everyone who would come to see me would want shiatsu). That sum would also be a lot to shell out for us, and I simply don't know that the returns will match the required expenditure and effort. Shiatsu currently makes up about 1/3 of my earnings.

- Personal training: A relatively inexpensive certification, obtainable in a short time, and like my yoga cert, something that will make it possible for me to expand my services and get in at other gyms and similar facilities. I honestly don't give much credence to its usefulness, aside from most places wanting you to have that piece of paper before hiring. And while I don't mind helping people to learn to use circuit machines and do lateral deltoid raises, my real passion is in teaching people to move better. My yoga and movement study sessions (private and group) round off the remaining 2/3 of my earnings.

- Hiring a marketing specialist: I have long considered hiring someone to help me better reach my desired clientele. I do feel I'm in somewhat of a unique position - I'm in fantastic shape for my age, can move better than people decades younger than me, and am highly skilled in working with an older demographic. You know, the ones who currently have most of the money, and after lives spent sitting at desks in offices, are increasingly focused on their health. Concern will be finding the right company/person for the job and working with a somewhat limited budget.

- Stay the course and find other part-time work: I've put the feelers out for sideline work as a copywriter and proofreader (I've done all my own copy from the get go), but without formal training, it's pretty sparse out there. I'd like something less physical than my already very physical life, but if I'm going to keep doing what I currently do, then whatever it is will need to somehow wrap around my existing schedule, which varies day-to-day, week-to-week, and month to month. Have looked for part-time, remote work with flexible scheduling and there isn't much to be had.

- Retrain: Accounting (I'm decent with numbers and keeping the books straight)? IT (I'm good with troubleshooting software and hardware issues, don't know that I have the aptitude for coding)? A trade? At my age, what can I train for that I can earn from for the next 15-20 years that won't wreck me physically? And yes, I plan on working that long - retirement in the traditional sense isn't part of the landscape and I'm o.k. with that.

Long one, thanks if you've taken the time to read it. I guess this is as much for me to put some ideas to paper (screen, as it were) as it is to see what the Reddit hive mind might have in the way of suggestions or similar experiences that could help me find some clarity and a sense of direction.

17tw66d,Looking to Transition from Logistics to SaaS 27F,"I have no degree. I've been working in logistics (primarily with 3PLs, one year in SaaS) since 2017. I've done sales, sales engineering, customer success, and onboarding/solutions with the bulk of my experience being in customer success. I've been a director since 2020. Previously I've worked at smaller companies and help built them up, I specialize in starting departments from the ground up and am very familiar with start-up environments. I am hoping to transition to larger companies though, I'm now looking for more stability and more of a work-life balance. I have been fully WFH since 2018 and will need to remain that way for medical reasons.

I did a full stack developer coding bootcamp as well. I wound up taking a job before finishing the course and as a result sort of neglected to do much with the cert after completing it. I don't really have a good portfolio and I don't plan on pursuing a career as a software dev, but I do really enjoy technical work and working with engineers. I'm also interested in cyber security and wouldn't be opposed to getting a few certs if it would help, it's probably info I'd pursue just for the heck of it anyway. I also really enjoy robotics and have built/programmed a few for the fun of it. I don't dislike logistics as an industry (I actually really enjoy it), so working at some sort of logistic SaaS company appeals to me. There are just a TON of layoffs going on right now so I'm hoping to expand my horizons and wind up somewhere with more security, the logistics industry itself can be kind of small. 

I've heard several times now that the ability to translate between engineers and customers is very valuable skill, but I'm not sure how to translate that into a job. I could see myself doing sales, customer success, or some form of solution planning/sales support role. I need to be making between $100k-$130k starting out based on my current expenses, and I would want to shoot for a role where I could end up making $150k-$175k after a few more years of experience. So where do I go from here?

17tum4j,I (M34) have a meaningless/pointless job and I like it.,"Without giving too much away, I (M34) work in a corporate structure at a general/regional type management position. People report to me, I report to people. I make salary of around $75k a year and can earn up to $10k in quota-met bonuses , have very good benefits and quirks (good healthcare coverage, 10 days of paid vacation, 5 sick days a year etc.) And I can say with certainty that my job is meaningless. Out of my 40hour work week I have to do an average of maybe 3 hours s of work a week, 2 hours of meaningless tasks handed from corporate that could be done by any of the people above or below me plus an extra hour at the end of the week simply reporting what the employees under my “management” report to me. And that’s all I do, report it, I can’t change it and if it’s company financials I can’t even read it (someone in corporate simply analysis the financials that have been reported to me and tells me whether or not we’ve hit company quotas). And I know for a fact that I make zero effect on the people I “manage” and their work performance, I don’t give them the quotas, someone from corporate gives each of them there quotas individually, I don’t assign them their tasks, someone from corporate does that too, nor do i ever have to sort out office conflicts or morale because someone from HR does that instead. My typical Monday will be completing whatever my weekly task is, in less then a morning and will then do what i do for the rest of the week, take a call or two from corporate and simply sit in my office and either spend my time reading something or finding ways to make my office or desk nicer. 

Now yes, on occasion i do have to do a days worth of work, i.e. performance reviews, hirings/firings and other every now and then tasks. Other times i have to do some unexpected work, i.e. attending meetings with corporate and holding meetings with employees if quotas aren’t met, presentations to potential clients/attending meetings with potential suppliers and other circumstantial but  easy enough work. 

And I love it, i love being able to focus almost exclusively on my personal life not having to ever stay late or worry about things that happen in the office plus my compensation is more then comfortable plus Im only in this position while i wait to be promoted to corporate (I need 3 more years of management experience) in which i’ll be paid a lot more and have a lot better benefits, so it doesn’t feel future-less. The main thorn is firing people, which i’ve had to conduct quite a few times since getting the job just two years ago, more then my former boss had to do in five mainly because my company, like many post pandemic has had some restructuring which resulted in a lot of job cutting, and having to tell people their position was redundant while knowing mine is exactly that too wasn’t the easiest thing. This is really the only major hinderance for me though, other than that i largely enjoy it. But if I ever hear someone else talk about being in similar situations they hate it because it makes them feel unfulfilled or worthless etc.

17tukbi,Derivatives career paths,"Good evening everyone, I am a 23 year old finance student. I recently took a course on derivatives (futures, forwards, options) and I was very passionate about the topic. I therefore wondered if this curiosity could also be transformed into a job opportunity. I read all the various threads that talk about the careers that can be undertaken working with derivatives: excluding trading, I found the roles that involve the creation of the instruments or the hedging of risks through them interesting. I have the following questions to ask:  
1) My studies in finance are not very quantitative, obviously I have taken courses in econometrics and financial mathematics, but nothing overly complex. Since I know that these are very quantitative jobs, does this preclude me from entering the sector?  
2) I will soon have to start writing my (master's) thesis, do you have any suggestions on any topic regarding derivatives that I can then exploit working-wise?

17tu8gm,Possibly overqualified for the job. What to do?,"I have been in this job for one year and I feel I might be overqualified for it. There are many tasks that we do that can be automated and do not require a lot of thinking. In addition, the department in which I am lacks a clear strategy, documentation on the things that we do, etc. In summary, everything is kind of a mess.

Since I took this job, I have done some work in the direction of automating the silly tasks that we have and documenting things. I have introduced modern technologies to the group and new ways of working. All this things I am trying to do not have the primary goal of increasing productivity. Rather, I just want to have a job in which I can use my full brain and not only do silly tasks. tasks

So far, all of these efforts have been done in spite of my colleagues and my boss. In their speech, they are very supportive of modernization and they say that they want to learn the new things I am introducing. In practice, all the changes I introduced were met with a very strong criticism, even though some of them were really embraced by the teams after a while. I have also tried to organize weekly training sessions with the rest of the team. They took part in some of them, but after a while, they simply did not attend them anymore. 

Even though I work at this nice company, and there might be good opportunities in the future, I am starting to get tired of this set up. I have given my best, also some free time hours, to try to make my job a more pleasant environment with a more fulfilling work. My coworkers say that they would like to go in this direction as well, but their actions contradict this. At this point, I think I am overqualified for this job and should just leave for another opportunity. Right now, I feel burnt out, not because of the effort that I have put, but because of the very little impact it has had on my colleagues and the way they see our silly. I am also the newest one in the office, and I feel this might play a role, as sometimes I am treated as a kid. 

I would like to get some opinions/advice on these things:

1) Am I missing something? Like, is there something wrong in my behavior towards work and my colleagues that does not make sense? Like, am I the weird one and their behavior is justified? 

2) Is this what being overqualified feels like? 

3) Should I keep insisting on this job?",Ok_Total3646,2,0.75,1,1699824408,2023-11-12 21:26:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17tu8gm/possibly_overqualified_for_the_job_what_to_do/,11,2023

2. Employer retains the right to search personal devices “if needed.” This was in the confidentiality section, so hopefully this wouldn’t happen, but the idea of a random dude scrolling through my personal photos and private documents makes me a little sick.

Grades are great, I’ve been a practicing RN for over 13 years in varying specialties-school nursing, hospice, pharmacy prior authorizations, PCU, and IMC. Most recently, I have taken a job as a house supervisor at a lovely critical access hospital outside Las Vegas, Nevada and it’s an awesome job. The downside is that the facility is tiny and the ability to network for preceptors/clinical hours is absolutely zero. 

My school requires 175 clinical hours x 3 semesters with either an AGACNP or an intensivist and I have no clue how to find those hours, or the ability to pay what I hear are the going rates for preceptors.  The school said they offer a little assistance in finding preceptors, but distance and timing is on the student. 

I also know that I do not have ICU experience. I have PCU and IMC time, which is great, but I know that come clinical time, there are going be lots of things I have no clue about. What I do have is thing, where no matter where I work, somehow, within 2-3 months-I get pulled from the med/surg floor as an RN and get made the charge, Clin Lead, Clin Sup, or now House Sup—even if I was originally hired as just a regular floor nurse.

17tof1s,Considering a remote job offer with significant pay increase,"Hi Reddit community,

I find myself at a crossroads and could use some valuable input. I've recently been presented with a job offer from another company that includes a substantial 20% increase in base pay, along with an enticing profit-sharing structure ranging from 5% to potentially 13-17% based on performance targets. Currently, my role is hybrid, but the new offer is fully remote, adding another layer to the decision-making process.

After discussing this opportunity with my current manager, they countered by matching the base pay of the new offer (this does not include profit sharing). I've been with my current company for a while, consider myself a top performer, and appreciate the culture fit. They've also hinted at future career progression opportunities for me.

I'm torn between the financial benefits of the new job and the comfort and potential growth at my current workplace. As someone who values social interaction and is uncertain about the remote work lifestyle, I'm grappling with this decision. There has also been many companies that have issued RTO policies recently… I’m not sure this would happen at the new company because the whole department is remote but it is still a possibility. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation or have insights to share? How did you weigh financial gains against a good cultural fit and potential career growth? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

17to1tg,Internship unrelated to my major,"
Hi, 

Im currently an economics co-op major at a university in Toronto. I got offered a final round interview for a role as a buyer intern for 16 months starting in May. The pay is decent and it’s at a big company. However, this role dosent really align with my career goals. I haven’t had a lot of luck when applying to other companies. Do you think I should accept this offer if I get it, or continue looking for other internships/co-ops? Is a buyer position a good way to start a career?",Ok-Understanding8850,1,0.6600000262260437,2,1699807329,2023-11-12 16:42:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17to1tg/internship_unrelated_to_my_major/,11,2023
17tnuh1,Opposite directions from my boss and his boss,"I have a strong relationship with my manager's manager. Before my manager joined the company, my manager's manager was, for all intents and purposes, my direct boss. He taught me a lot about how to do my job and helped me improve my performance and competence a lot in a short amount of time. 

Right as my manager joined the company, I was given a new assignment by my manager's manager, and he subtly hinted that I should be taking on a leadership role in that new assignment. 

Seeing as my boss was too new to the company at the time to contest this, I went ahead and attempted, over the course of a few months, to direct the work of my peers along the lines of the strategy I came up with. 

My peers, of course, did not like this, and this resulted in some minor complaints about me to my new boss. As a result, he told me to take a step back and be present to coach and advise, but not to make any specific directions. So this is exactly what I did. 

Last week, my manager's manager asked me to explain the lack of progress in my new assignment. I explained that I, as an individual contributor, was focusing solely on my own work, and that attempts to guide my peers in the right direction were met with backlash and complaints. I did tell him that my boss gave me a different direction and I was following it. I also told him that my peers were upset and not willing to follow my strategy. 

The day after this, he sent a message to me (with my boss cc'd) that he does not have any confidence in my peers and he would like me to step in. Shortly after, he had a conversation with me where he told me explicitly to ""direct"" the work of my peers. When I explained that my boss had a different arrangement in mind, he told me to talk to my boss and tell him that he was making a mistake. I got the impression that he and my boss talked about this before I was approached (I am 99% sure this conversation happened). 

It is clear that my boss and his boss do not agree on this topic, and each has given me a different directive.

I feel that defying either would be considered insubordination and would result in me getting in trouble for not listening. 

My current idea is to talk to my boss and figure out what his orders are. I am hoping to tell him that he and his boss need to work it out and then tell me what they want me to do (because this current situation is very unfair to me). If this doesn't happen, I feel that I'll be forced to apply for another job in the same department.

It took years for me to realize: the true currency for change wasn't ability, but trust. Trust that I personally destroyed by tactlessly trying to change the habits and rituals that my new colleagues built their lives around.  
  
To earn this trust, you must act to provide value by:  
  
\- Showing that you’re willing to actively assimilate into your new environment  
\- Showing the desire to provide assistance without being prompted  
\- Showing appreciation for others' work  
\- Showing interested in their personal ideas and concerns  
  
Only then did I earn the currency to effect lasting and meaningful change.  
  
Good luck!

17tkr40,How to negotiate for a higher salary as an engineering consultant in the Netherlands?,"TLDR: Looking for advice on how to negotiate a higher salary as a mechanical engineer in a project management and engineering consultancy in the Netherlands

This December I have the annual talk with the company about the increase in my salary. This is my second job ever in the Netherlands (and elsewhere). The first job was a Ph.D. where the salary increase was fixed with no scope for negotiation, note that I did not finish the PhD. So I hope someone can give me some advice on how to formulate valid arguments to present to the company to reach the salary goal I have set for myself.

**Some background :**

I am a master's graduate in Mechanical Engineering from TU/e (one of the 3 top universities in the Netherlands). I did a 2 year stint as a Ph.D. researcher, realized research was not for me, and craved something more practical and joined an engineering consultancy that advice/builds factories around the world, where I am a ""Junior Project Engineer"", and I manage supplier packages within the overall factory project in a specific area of the factory.

1. I currently earn 3650 euros per month, 8% holiday pay and a variable bonus scheme which depends on the company's and my performance.
2. I recently secured a permanent contract with the company. I have been employed by them for 10 months.
3. I have 3 years of experience (if you count the PhD, if not then it's 1) and various internships, and thesis projects in companies.

**My expectation :**

I am looking for a pay increase to 4500 euros per month. I know this is a huge leap and the only reason I came to this number is that my friends and peers are now getting paid this much at this point in their career (although they did not leave a PhD in between).

1. So my first question. How do I find what a realistic salary expectation is, specifically in my field?
2. How as a consultant can I match data to my salary expectation? I take sales as an example. If a sales manager makes 20% more sales that year, that can be used to leverage higher pay. What are similar metrics in consultancy? Note that I do not drive clients to the company I only advise on engineering and project management for the projects that are assigned to me. I now manage \~50% of the suppliers in the area, and at one point was interim area manager (so in charge of 100% of the suppliers) when the area manager was on paternity leave for 1.5 months.

Some arguments for higher pay I have thought of so far:

1. Ask the company to match the market salary range for my age and experience (but I am not sure what this range is). Looking at DAF, Philips, and ASML, (some of the top companies in the Netherlands) I feel my ask is not too high. However, these companies do not represent the industry I currently work in, except maybe DAF.
2. Look at the pay scale and ask them to give me 100% of the salary in my grade. This will bring my pay to 4200, which is acceptable.
3. Look at inflation statistics and make an argument based on that, which will however only give me around a 7% increase, based on the personal inflation calculator from CBS (statistics organization in the Netherlands) and taking an average of all the months.
4. Make an argument that over the span of 10 months, I manage as many suppliers as the area manager, which means I do more than an average Junior role and deserve to be paid more.

17tjwxp,Which of the 3 options is the best in terms of departure time at my internship place (software developer)?,"Hi everyone, I'm currently a vocational school student of the study software developer and also a intern software developer at a software development company approximately 20 kilometers away from where I live but I'm confused about something. It's my first software development internship in my life. The requirements of my school in terms of the hours are that I've to make 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week and 1000 hours in total which officially means that I've to be at my internship spot from 09:00 (The opening time of the company) until 18:00 because the lunch break of one hour doesn't count as worked hours according to my internship spot but I already got permission from the company to stay until 17:00.  
  
The internship spot is 12 minutes walking away from the nearest bus stop towards the station and there are also firstly construction works going on at the railroad so that means at least 15 minutes extra travel time (Normal travel time is between 50 min and 1 h), secondly the roads are very busy around 17:00 (also due to rush hour I guess) which causes the bus towards and from the train stations come late every time and arrive late at where I need to exit the bus which overall causes me to arrive later than expected home.  
  
My question is which of the following options are the best:  
A: Just stay until 17:00 no matter the circumstances on the road and with public transit  
B: Leave at 16:00 so I can arrive early at home  
C: Determine what I'm going to do every day and if I did that go home no matter what time it is.

I have two Bachelors Degrees (Sociology and Communication) and I used them toward my corporate job after graduation as a trainer for 5 years. I was laid off (company structure) and shortly after had major health issue in 2020 which led to 3 different surgeries. I was able to get temp work for a few month before my  2nd and biggest surgery of the 3 that year. It took me a year to recover from the surgery.   
Shortly after (1 year after my major surgery), one of my parents had a stroke. I became her caregiver to help her recover. I’ve been 100% focused on her health with doctor’s appointments, therapy and anything that’s needed.

Current role:  Been there since April 2021, in-house government, diverse work, high profile/State-significant work, great culture, limited career progression for the next few years, salary $116K plus retirement contributions (11%) (no scope for salary increases over the next few years).

Prospective role: In-house government, diverse work, slightly less high profile/State-significant, culture sounds good but it’s hard to tell from the outside, salary $152K minimum (salary range is up to $165K) plus retirement contributions (11%).

I’m keen to earn a bit more money and I think that’ll I’ll need to leave my current role at some stage anyway due to the career progression opportunities.

My current work involves implementing large government funded studies, managing ethics for multiple studies, managing data for multiple studies and analysing data to develop manuscripts. I have worked the academic position for about 2.5 years now and need to decide whether I should be applying for a PhD in Epidemiology or if I should move into the industry. I had never thought of pursuing academics as a career but it’s not off the table just yet. I do want to make close to 200k (ideally more) a year eventually and am wondering whether I can get to that point with my MPH or if doing a PhD will get me further. My question to the community is what type of factors should I be considering to make this decision? What questions should I be asking?

I’m sure this has been asked before so if people can link other posts with similar discussions I would also be happy to go through those, thank you for any advise/help/opinions, much appreciated!",Cofeeinateacup,1,0.5,0,1699779528,2023-11-12 08:58:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17tgcdp/to_do_a_phd_or_to_not_do_a_phd/,11,2023
17tgb2b,Should I contact HR within my probationary period to ask for a job transfer?,"I did an internship at a big engineering corporation (200,000+ employees), I really enjoyed my time there. I recently graduated and applied for two different jobs at this company. The first job was slightly related to the work I did during my internship. The second job was in a different field, but involved more R&D and therefore seemed more challenging and interesting to me. I got an offer for both jobs, and proceeded with accepting the second job.

After a month of being at the job, it turns out the second job involves almost no engineering and concerns setting up R&D projects, but not carrying them out. It's more related to projectmanagement than engineering. At the same time, I have heard from former colleagues that the first job actually builds on top of some work I have done during my internship, which makes it much more appealing to me. 

Since i'm feeling a bit miserable at my current job, I thought of contacting HR to see if I could transfer to the other job since it does not seem the position has been filled yet. However, I am scared this will lead me to having no job at all since I am still in my probation period. I feel like I can grow into the job I have accepted, but currently it's really depressing and unchallenging. Should I contact HR? Or should I wait until my probation period has passed?

17tdy6a,Which career to pick?,"Currently in my 2nd year as a group health benefits consultant for a large broker firm in the US making $55k plus commission (I sold around $100k this year and will be seeing around $10-15k in commission for around $70k total comp). It’s great with large earning potential long term obviously, and a great team. Never short on resources.  

I also have a job offer to work at a local, niche wealth management shop (handles mostly federal retirement) and they’d pay for my Series exam.. I know the owner personally very well and he’s really trying to get me up there. It’d be $50k base starting with a $20k bonus off the get go for company performance based off of current company revenue, with additional opportunity for sales of course. 

My pickle I’m in is the security of my current job vs (maybe?) higher earning potential and great control of a niche market at this other opportunity. Benefits, etc. great at both. My main goal in a career is making good money and having a life outside of work as well.

For some backstory, my wife is currently wrapping up school and will graduate in May as we buy a house, so we’re buying a house off of my income, which will be doable and friends working at banks say I’d be fine approval-wise to switch if I wanted.

17td9ys,"Company is involved in unethical (if not worse) behavior, and I don’t know what to do","Last year (summer 2022) I joined a local small software company as a part-time remote tech support specialist, handling phone calls from customers, troubleshooting their issues with our software, taking payments over the phone, updating records, assisting the dev team with bug reporting and Q/A testing, assisting with research, etc. It was a great job; when I wasn’t on the phone, I could do pretty much anything (watch YouTube, do Udemy courses to learn new skills, play games, etc.).

My boss had mentioned a while ago the possibility of me eventually moving to full-time, so a few months ago I took him up on that: reached out to him and said I really needed to be working more hours and expressed my interest in full-time. After a week, he said they didn’t have the budget to make my tech support position full-time, but that they had an opening for a full-time researcher and that they thought I would be a great fit. He said he had spent the last week talking around the office and the consensus was that I’m great, that they can’t lose me, that I do good research, etc. He said that in such a small company it’s not often that he has the opportunity to promote, but that he was very happy to get to promote me. So I took a couple days to think about it, and then accepted the position. I was so excited and felt flattered that the company valued me like this. It was later agreed upon that I would start mid-October.

Long story short, only a few weeks into this new role, and I’m apparently getting paid the same hourly rate to do WAY more work than before, I’m having to pull double-duty with the phones until my new replacement for my old role starts (they already found someone and are training her now), my new supervisor is incredibly difficult to work with and contradicts himself, and the main reason I’m here posting today: I discovered that my company is operating in a highly unethical (probably illegal) manner. It turns out that my “research” simply involves me logging onto our two top competitors’ sites which we have subscriptions to, manually copying down their data into a spreadsheet (we are in the job time estimating business), and then apparently my company uses an algorithm that takes our competitors times and spits out our times, that we use in our product. On our website, we actually tell out customers that our times come from actual research on our part, and we even go so far as to bash the official times (as in, the exact ones that are offered by our competitors). It’s all a complete lie, and I now feel incredibly guilty interacting with our customers on the phone, knowing what I know now.

Anyways, my new job didn’t set off too many red flags until a week ago Friday. Before then, I just wanted to impress my boss, and I didn’t really question anything I was being directed to do. But that Friday, I was apparently researching a little *too* well. My new supervisor had me call him, at which point he mentioned how since we’re not doing things “the right way,” that I need to be careful with what I look up on the competitor’s site, because if they look at the search history they could easily see a pattern and we could get into big trouble. 

I couldn’t believe it. My heart sank at that phone call, and I instantly lost all interest in this job. Obviously major alarm bells went off in my head. This is all highly unethical and likely illegal (our competitor’s sites’ TOS of course mention copyright infringement, including using their data for derivative works), and I really don’t feel comfortable working here. At the same time, I need to make money, so this all just sucks. I’ve come so close to just abruptly quitting the last few days, but I didn’t want to do anything rash and wanted to make sure I really thought about it and got some advice. This past week was been absolute hell; apparently I’m doing alright at the job, but I don’t even consider that a compliment. I basically loathe the company at this point, and I feel embarrassed to even work here. I also suffer from anxiety/OCD and hypertension, and this situation obviously isn’t helping that. Part of me is thinking, if only I didn’t know what I know now, and if only I had stuck with my previous part-time job: I could keep doing online courses and applying elsewhere until I landed something good. But there was no way for me to know. I just thought that moving up in my current company made sense.

I’m just devastated. I didn’t think I’d stay with this company for too long, but I still was very excited at the chance to advance my career. As a bit of backstory, I (30) live with my parents currently; prior to all this I was in a different field, having gone to college and grad school out of state for that, and building connections and freelancing in a major city. Unfortunately, Covid screwed everything up for me; I moved back home and realized I needed to finally get a “real” job. I thought that bumping up to a full-time role with my company would soon allow me the financial freedom to get my feet back on the ground and move out. I’m just so upset at how this has all turned out. What a letdown.

The company has treated me pretty well overall; I got a raise in December and a nice big bonus check, and for the most part everyone has been nice. But I’ve never felt I fit in with the people or culture here, and now I feel *incredibly* uncomfortable continuing to work for them. The only good news is I have a part-time contracted gig (though that could of course be terminated/not-renewed), so it’s not like I’d have $0 income if I were to quit in, say, the next few days or week. But at the same time, that doesn’t pay nearly as much as even this part-time job paid, and I have bills to pay (don’t even get me started on student loans). 

Should I quit sooner rather than later? Should I wait until I get a new job lined up, or just leave ASAP? And when I do quit, should I even list this new researcher promotion role on my resume? If I quit before I get a new job lined up, how do I explain the unemployment period/the reason I left my current job? Is it a big deal? Sorry, so many questions and I just don’t know what to do.

Anyways, thanks for reading. I’d greatly appreciate any advice.",Boober_Bill,3,1.0,2,1699766244,2023-11-12 05:17:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17td9ys/company_is_involved_in_unethical_if_not_worse/,11,2023

17tbuu8,Unemployed 30yo w/ MA in Art History Seeking Advice on a Practical Career Path - Should I Restart?,"Hi all,

I'll try to give you a quick summary of my situation (Thanks for taking the time to read!):

I'm a 30yo living in the NY area who has a BA/MA in Art History. I did a (unpaid) curatorial internship at a major museum in between undergrad/grad school for over 1yr. After getting my MA, I moved back to my hometown where I struggled to get interviews for positions even vaguely related to my studies. 

I ended up working part-time for $11/hr as a Visitor Service Assistant at a museum. I (thankfully) soon got a job as a 'Manager of Online Sales' at a small luxury home goods store. It wasn't directly related to my studies, but I was paid $18/hr, and it was full-time. (I felt super lucky, and very indebted to the owners of this small business.)

This job involved a lot of inventory-related responsibilities, shipping and fulfillment, receiving purchase orders, etc. Until COVID came along, I honestly liked many aspects of my job. It was mostly back-of-house, and I didn't have to interact with customers too much (although I did speak to customers through email/phone a lot). I have a history of depression/anxiety, so social interactions (esp. those with a customer service dynamic) can be very emotionally taxing for me. 

I liked that the job consisted of long periods of time working independently. I loved working with my hands, packing and unpacking, organizing, etc. It wasn't where I saw myself, but it was actually kind of fulfilling! However, the job was a whole lot of work, and COVID only made things worse. During the first good year of COVID I practically kept the business going. I was the only person who was working in-person full-time, packing literally every order (and sales increased by 300% during COVID, so needless to say, I quickly burned out.) My dad died suddenly at the end of 2020, and I quit my job about 1mo later. His death was a huge shock to my system. I understand now that I needed to do it, but I still regret that decision at times.

There have been many changes my life since then. My sister and I sold our family house, I met my committed and loving partner, and we moved across state lines together. Now that I feel in a healthier place in terms of my grief, and that we're more settled, I'm confronted with the fact that I haven't worked in \~3yrs. I have little experience in any one field and 2 useless degrees. 

In the time since my dad's death, my priorities in life have really changed. I no longer want the same things from my career. I honestly just want to work by myself for most of the day, maybe with my hands, maybe in-person, or not. It could be in a creative field, but it doesn't have to be. I'd just prefer not to work in customer service, food service, or child care. 

So my question to you is, should I continue to pursue a career in museums? If so, how would you go about it? How could I make my resume more appealing? How should I explain my 3yr gap in work experience?

OR

If not, what new direction do you think I should go in? Are there specific careers that you think might align more with my priorities/work experiences that could be attainable for me at this age? How would you recommend trying to breaking into that field? Should I pursue further education, like a certificate program?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this obnoxiously long post! I'd really appreciate any feedback you might have.

I'm currently a non-commissioned officer in the United States military and work in information operations. (I didn't commission because officers in my specialty are desk jockeys while enlisted personnel travel and interact with foreign governments and civilians. I don't regret enlisting.)

I speak Chinese and have a TS/SCI clearance. 

Lastly, I'm single with no children and love to work. I've been a top-performing employee at every job I've had since high school.

I love my parents and friends but often feel hamstrung by their provincial attitudes toward work. They're satisfied to keep the bill collectors at bay and take an occasional vacation. I have no one to dream with, let alone to coach me how to build a career.

Wondering if you all may have any advice for me- I’m a 24 year old who graduated with an IT degree, has no certs, and no longer any interest in working tech support. I currently make ~63k a year but hate my job/ my field. 
Wondering if a transition to UI/UX design or Cybersecurity would be possible? 
My question is- how do I gain experience to get an entry level job, while still not falling too far behind my current pay rate? 
I’m not sure if boot camps or going back to school for class is worth it. How do I make this transition while still making somewhat of a living? I live with my bf but I don’t want to not be able to do my part, despite him saying I should take a month off and figure stuff out. Anybody in tech made a similar transition?

17t2h34,Should I be concerned with the company changes and management decisions?,"I work remotely as a PM for a procurement company. I started in May and was really excited about the opportunity. In August, we had 1 senior PM, 2 PMS, and 3 project coordinators, 1 Operations. Two of the project coordinators basically managed their own projects without the title. 1 of the PCs assisted me, as I was given the largest custom projects that have an extremely tight deadline to turnaround everything. My boss also had hired a new Vice President of procurement in August. In September, they randomly fired the senior PM. No warning or explanation to the team. I know that you cannot disclose reasons for firing, but a little transparency would have been nice. Word got around that the Senior PM was locked out of her computer and then got a call from boss who said she was not performing to senior Level and was not indicative of company culture. That is all we know. They apparently gave the Senior PM a months worth of salary to give her some time to look for other opportunities.  
  
They never replaced her position and her projects were dispersed among us. In October, there has been lots of talk about restructuring the company's processes and core values. My bosses along with operations went on a secret meeting in Colorado and worked on these processes. We started a process committee and have been meeting once a week.  
  
On Monday, they sent out meetings to all the project coordinators for Wednesday. By Wednesday they promoted one to PM and laid off the other two, including my project coordinator, and gave them ability to work until dec. 1 and they will provide a letter of recommendation. Management scheduled a meeting with the team that still remains, and mentioned that they got rid of the coordinator lower experienced role and only want PMs. I am obviously concerned, as I have the most demanding large projects, and I will be getting another early next year. My boss mentioned on the meeting we aren't ""broke"". I am not sure where she got that. They said they will be hiring another PM in December & also a marketing/business development role. We already have ton of projects, with about 20 proposals already out. It seems like they are just cutting costs and expect to put more work on everyone.   
  
I have caught wind that the other PM (only 3 of us now), reached out to the old director mentioning how our boss wanted to promote her to senior PM soon but she didn't trust that would happen and asked if he was hiring. It seems that we have all lost confidence in the company. I also just cant help but feel like I am going to be let go if I cant live up to this new demand and work around the clock to keep up. It makes me sad they let my coworkers go right before the holidays and yearly bonuses. We are all being retrained in January as well. I don't mind working late, when I believed in the company and saw growth. But now I don't want to slave to meet the deadlines and I feel like my job is not secure. I feel like I could get fired without any warning, just like my 3 coworkers.   
  
I guess what I need is some advise on how to get through this, as I need to make it here at least a year to put on my resume. I know this will require me to change my attitude. Also just want overall thoughts on this.   
  
TLDR: Small company has got rid of 3 people since September and going through a restructure. No longer have faith in the company and the direction it is going. I also don't feel secure in my job. Need advice on how to get through this until I have been here a year.",ispyagemini,2,1.0,2,1699732865,2023-11-11 20:01:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17t2h34/should_i_be_concerned_with_the_company_changes/,11,2023

17t0hsq,Would you trust/take this opportunity?,"Basically I’ve gotten my first “job” at 22 while still at uni. It’s a sort of sales jobs that I do in a small call center.  I’ve been here for 2/3 weeks and people have been noticing me. The person that trained me has already recommended me for my first small promotion. My work ethic and results speak for themselves.

Yesterday we had a drink with the company and there were some higher ups there as well. I talked to them and they seemed to like me enough. One of them took a lot of interest in me, the top d2d salesman, because we had similar ideas about discipline, ambition and necessary pain. He talked about how it’s easier to make good money than you think it is. And how the top salesmen at this company make at least 10k a month (commission based). I got intrigued and he kinda pushed on that idea more by stating that some bought cars  with their first pay check. We shared phone numbers and he told me he would let me join his top salesmen to let me see how it’s done and to see what I’m made of. 

Told the regional call center manager about this and he’s mad about it because they’re trying to steal someone from him and he already has a shortage of staff plus I’m basically one of the best already. He also stated that it’s unethical of him to try to bribe me with potential salary. And he told me that I shouldn’t think about the money. 

First job is slow but steady, has a lower but hourly pay. And the highest position is regional manager. 

Second job potentially has more money but less stability. 

I would choose the second job in a heart beat if it wasn’t for the people aspect that is triggering me. The first job feels more like a family and the relationships are real. The second job, especially the guy that I shared numbers with, feels more fake and shallow. I think he might think I’m just naive and is lying about the numbers but my manager kind of confirmed it.

If I go to the second job I’m leaving/betraying this group for people that don’t care about me but I’ll get a higher salary for sure and potentially I might actually make 10k a month. If it fails I can’t go back to them without feeling like an ass. If it works out I’m set. 

I think the smartest course of action is to check whether the numbers are accurate and then check how realistic it is for me to make those numbers. 

If he didn’t lie I’ll pick that job and make money. Climb my way to the top and improve the company from there.

If he did lie I’ll stay here and climb my way to a higher position without his help.

I have received an offer letter for a summer internship from a FAANG company and was wondering what to expect from here on as I can not miss this opportunity since it is really hard to get internships in my field. 


PS: I have checked my transcripts and everything looks fine and nothing suggests that I will be graduating soon and my school does not provided expected graduation date.",ColdNefariousness721,1,0.33000001311302185,3,1699712803,2023-11-11 14:26:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17svhc0/what_happens_if_i_graduate_before_my_internship/,11,2023

Rather than post the position online,  my boss trusted this recommendation and hired both contractors . One of the contractors had very little work experience . 21 years old , very young and no degree . It felt very off to me . 

Fast forward a month later , I have found out that both of these new contractors and the daughters of the woman that recommended  them as her employees . She lied to us , the contractors lied to us and they have continued to lie to us . 

They have been getting information funneled to them by their mom to make them appear like they know what they are doing .

17ss010,Does anyone else feel like people are thinking that you are not capable?,"To start off, I know that I am a very capable person and I don't think that I have imposter syndrome. But I think that whenever I work, people around me think that I'm not a ""big deal"". I really do work a lot but sometimes I don't feel seen.  I am an ambivert. I am normal and great with teamwork. I am friendly. But sometimes when my energy bar is low I am reserved and quiet. I used to be super introverted but after dating my bf who is my complete opposite, his extrovertedness rubbed off of me and balanced me. Thus, I am an ambivert. So i can communicate well but sometimes I am still shy and anxious in social situations. Some people say I am funny and I have dry humour. but I am never the ""look at me"" type because I hate attention.

I work in the creative industry and I am a woman nearing my 30s. I want to be in a leadership role one day but I honestly don't know why I never get one. My work performance is great and I always love to listen and learn from my colleagues. My workplace has given me awards like employee of the month / employee of the quarter from time to time. I am confident and I know I am skilled and talented but I think I am doing somsthing wrong with my image. I want to be more ""seen"" as someone more capable without getting attention.

I think my voice is a big factor. A co-worker said she couldn't take me seriously because I have such a sweet and kind voice and I look nice. She was being honest btw and I appreciate that. Everyone is telling me to toughen up when dealing with customers but I believe I am already tough. My communication style is very polite but firm. There are times when I can be quite bossy, but I always listen. Whenever I act this way I think people think I'm a b*tchy. But whatever, I don't care. I want them to take me seriously! But I think there is something wrong with how i portray myself. I am just confused about what it is and it is now becoming an insecurity. 

Does anyone feel like they are doing well but are not really recognized? / taken seriously?

17srm9f,Which job to take!?,"39m, young kids.

Job 1 - Been with existing company for 17 years. Manager on £60k per year, 10% bonus, working from home. Maybe 1 meeting per quarter. Boss wants me to reject job offer externally. Very flexible job but workforce will half by 2030. That said, high performer at grade so should survive reorgs.

Job 2 - New company with gvmt contract to 2040. Offer of £75k per year with 10% bonus. Culture from interviews feels similar but its 2 days a week in the office which is an hour away. So 4-5 hours a week travelling.

It feels like a decision on lifestyle and if i want to step up to a more professional level. The £15k prob becomes £5k after car deprecation and diesel.

Genuinely no idea! Love working from home but i do get too comfortable and a bit lazy on days so no idea if i’d regret moving or if its the kick up the backside i need.

Any advice or thoughts?

17srau1,I need help choosing a career path,"I’m a 29 year old woman from the Bay Area, CA who currently works in a factory. It’s very expensive to live here and the money I’m making is not enough even though I work full time getting paid $30 an hour. 
I left an abusive household when I was 18 and was too busy worrying about trying to survive on my own rather than going to school. I worked at fast food jobs, Amazon warehouse, ikea, and now manufacturing. I want to go to community college in order to get a better paying job so I don’t have to worry about money anymore. The problem is I don’t know what I want to major in and I know it’s going to be tough working 12 hour days 4 days a week and taking classes. I don’t have the option to quit my job or switch to part time. I also don’t have the option to live with family/parents for free. My parents abandoned me when I was a child. 
I feel like I’m running out of time to get my shit together. All I do is work and it’s still not enough. My rent is almost $3k a month but I pay $1300 for my share since I live with two other people. I always get sent into a panic when I think about what’s going to happen when in the future. 
I need to try to pursue a degree that will get me a job quickly and pay more than my current job. I don’t need to be making a crazy high amount or working over 40 hours. I want a job that I won’t regret getting stuck with. I know some people have jobs that are high stress and long work days. I’d preferably like to avoid all that. 
Business and sales don’t interest me. I couldn’t handle being a nurse. I guess I would say it’s easier to eliminate the ones I don’t like so I can narrow it down a bit. 
I would love to find something that only requires or prefers an associates degree because I want to get started as soon as possible. I don’t know if computer science would be a good route for me. I have social anxiety and not really good at small talk. I like to help people but the less interaction the better.

17sqccf,Tips for working with a bad manager,"31F, in middle management in healthcare.

I have a horrible manager. He’s relatively new to the role, but is rude, aggressive and it feels like he has a very old school style of management, basically get this done and if you don’t I’m going to tell you off and make you feel crap. 

As a manager myself (a good one) I know that my team do not respond to that and that they perform so much better if I actually support and motivate them. He doesn’t get that. 

He has made comments about people being off sick due to disabilities which has rubbed me up the wrong way. He sends me emails about my team saying they aren’t performing. He doesn’t actually know whether they are performing or not because he hasn’t asked for the data, he’s making assumptions. 

I like my job most of the time. I do not like him and I am struggling to cope knowing I have no support, no one I can ask a question to, and that if I slip up or my team does he’s going to respond aggressively. I am a high performer! Always have been! But I am very different to him.

Has anyone got any tips about how to deal with a nasty manager who hasn’t actually stepped over a line (I did speak with HR) but is making my work life miserable?

17sqbdn,Social work degree a bad choice?,"Before anyone thinks I'm going for a social worker I am not.

I'm thinking of the social work degree because it's more universal than most people think. My end goal is to be a counselor. A social work degree will get me there and I can choose various types of counseling I want to be in for a career. If I end up not liking it I can go into the administrative field or case management and so on. Per what amd academic advisor has told me.

I am introverted but am very emotionally intuitive/ intelligent, as well as empathetic and experienced from my own traumatic events so I understand people better. 

I'm an easy person to talk to from what I can tell because people would open up to me without me even trying or saying anything. I'm a very good listener and can listen for hours on end and can tell when someone is off or is having a bad day. I don't interrupt and only offer my thoughts when someone is having an opening vent session to me and ask for my thoughts. I don't judge people either and I am soft spoken and was told I have a soothing voice. (Idk if that matters)

I like listening to people's stories and past traumas and letting them vent or help come up with suggestions that may help them, hence why I was always passionate about counseling/psychology.

17so73k,"Really need help — realized I very much dislike what I’m currently doing, what to do?","Hello everyone, I have been very lost when it comes to choosing a career, please guide/help me.

First, here’s a little background about me:

I’m 23 year olds, from Canada, in my last year of my BBA - General Management degree. I went into BBA because I thought it was the best option after graduating high school since it seemed more open ended since i felt so confused on what I wanted to do after high school, but now that I’m about to finish it, I don’t see myself being happy working in the Business world especially because I have a lot of people close to me in that field and the stories I’ve heard online, I notice how much networking, connections, climbing up the ladder, kissing ass, jumping from company to company there is. Since I am in my last year, I can still choose a different Major in BBA such as Finance, Accounting, Marketing, Supply Chain, Human Resources, but none of these really address my concerns above. This past year has been really heavy for me as I just turned 23, and feel behind compared to everyone else my age, even though I’m aware most people don’t have a set lifelong career this early. I know what I want, and what I don’t want, and am willing to do a complete 180 so I can do something I enjoy and is rewarding for my whole life.

I would love a career in which:

- I can be mostly in control of my work/life balance, by being able to decrease or increase my hours and workload.
- I earn above $100k CAD when I start, regardless of how much student loan debt I’m in.
- I have the opportunity to be my own boss by following a step by step process, rather than luck and connections. 
- Being able to do my career regardless of my location (my career not being strict to a region).
- Where the process to becoming successful is a simple step by step process, regardless of the difficulty, as long as it doesn’t require luck, kissing ass, and making connections to climb the ladder. 

I would hate a career that:

- Requires me to have luck, meet the right people, and kiss ass to climb the ladder.
- Have little control over my life, despite how much I get payed. 
- Having to meet quotas and stuff to fulfill company goals.
- Having to jump from company to company for the whole career until I find something good. 
- Having the economy play a big factor on if you’re gonna have a good year financially or struggle to get groceries. 
- Anything primarily corporate. 

I know that is a lot of information, and I greatly appreciate all those who read it. 

Here are my main questions for people in here, you can answer as many as you see fit:

- So after reading everything, what do you think is a good fit for me? 
- Do you guys have any regrets, if so, what are they?
- If you could go back to being 23 again, would you choose the career you have, or something else? If so, what would you choose?
- Do you think your pay is worth the job? 
- And lastly, why did you choose the career you did over other things that are both similar to it and different?

Thank you for reading this all, at the end of the day, I’d like these questions answered by as many people as possible as it will help me get a good grasp on what I should do.",GTA-VICITY,5,1.0,2,1699682220,2023-11-11 05:57:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17so73k/really_need_help_realized_i_very_much_dislike/,11,2023
17so6rw,Looking for guidance for brother,"Background - Normal in studies took PCM in 11,12th and never studied for any entrance exam.Got 70% in 12th, He got a seat in state engineering college (tier 3 college in terms of placement nd all) in CSE.No one forced him to do engineering but he did not know what to do in his life and not he had any interest for enginnering or for that matter anything, so took admission there. He wanted to go outside India(Canada, Australia etc.) so that he can earn in dollars, only to work in some jobs like Security Guard,Delivery Boy etc. which most of our youth is doing.I made him understand that this is not a career path you should be going with.


Then he dropped after 1st year and said he is not able to do engineering( he was saying that his 2nd semester exams went horrible and he will not pass there because he didn't studied for them) and does not want to do engineering and said he just want to go outside India so that there he can earn in dollars by doing some part-time work.When I tell him this is not a good thing,he needs to have some career path,he doesn't listen.
Also, 2-3 of his friends also went abroad which were with him in school time, that maybe has inculcated something in him due to which he wants to go there.

Now when family got to know about this they tell him to do simple bachelor's degree here so that if in coming time he wants to prepare for some exam he would be able to do that so he has now taken admission in an open University(Bachelor of Arts) where he doesn't need to go physically and side by side he is learning stenography and typing.

Note-First reason we didn't sent him abroad was we didn't have enough funds for him to send him there
2.) If it was some course he wanted to do, we might have taken some loan to send him there but that was not the case 
3.) He has never stayed outside hometown for a particular time and I thought better thing would be to let him go outside hometown and then if he wants to go abroad he can go there. But he doesn't wanted to do any course.
Now I am helpless and I think the 3 years which he will be investing in this open University will be a ki d of waste only and want him to do a bachelor's course which will open his eyes and outside his hometown so that he can learn from those experiences.

Which course he should pursue how can we know that?

17so5ir,When to walk away from a good thing?,"I've been very lucky with my current job. I do technical support for the products of an overseas company that sells niche tech hobby products worldwide. I don't make a ton, just around 55K after starting at 40k 4 years ago this coming March, but it been WFH in a LCOL area. It's all very low stress and I have enjoyed it immensely. Despite this, I am fairly vital to the company, being the only real subject matter expert in the whole tech support team, and I get glowing reviews from my boss and everyone within the company.

In the last month, the company has decided on launching phone support, when we were email support only until this time. As the leading expert, they tried to strong-arm me to take up responsibility as the sole phone representative. I could not be less interested and have turned down other higher paying jobs to keep this peaceful life and flexibility, they know this, yet without offering a raise or promotion they wanted to take on an extra 8 hours per week of responsibility and making me a verbal punching bag.

Thankfully I talked them down to a compromise, but this sort of *""I have altered the deal, pray I do not alter it further""* stuff made me realize how vulnerable I am. I have no degree, and there are zero jobs in the same field as this anywhere nearby. So, I started applying elsewhere, if nothing else to get some bargaining power if I decide to stay. One Job in a very HCOL area responded within the week, and I just aced the interview and was told to an offer next week.

The position would be union, enjoyable/fulfilling, and pays 20k more than I make now and have features like tuition reimbursement, 401k matching, more PTO, good health insurance and a pension if I really stick with it long term. I'm assuming that I'll not really be making any more in reality since it costs so much more to live there, but if my peaceful job is coming to an end then it's an ideal choice that has long-term prospects.

I just... don't ever see myself having a peaceful job like my current one again. If they would just let me do what I've been doing for 4 years I would stay for another decade, but it sort of seems like the trust is broken.

The responsible move would really be to move on, right? I really don't want to I may not be lucky enough to score a solid replacement so easily the next time.

**TLDR:** My current job has been amazing for years, but just tried to add a lot of responsibility with no raise/promotion despite acknowledging that I have been doing great and they have no complaints. I talked them out of this, but it seems like a sign of things to come, and I applied & will soon get an offer on a higher paying job in a higher cost of living area with better benefits across the board. It largely cancels out any additional income given the extra costs, but I could be about the same financially in doing so.

I never intended on working in supply chain and I sorta just fell into it over time. I went to college to become a doctor which never panned out as didn't have the grades I needed to get into medical school. Cue working dead end jobs for the next four years where I did manage to work my way up to becoming a supervisor at the time, but ultimately I knew I had to get out as the career wasn't going to get me anywhere substantial in life.  
  
Basically I had taken this job because I was desperate for something new in a field that offered actual potential and wasn't so dead end. My job is straightforward enough. Placing orders, running reports, answering emails/phone calls, etc. The work-life balance at my office has been very good as I rarely need to stay late and I'm not expected to answer phone calls/emails when I'm not in the office. I'm making the highest salary I ever have in my life with decent benefits. Yet, I'm thoroughly unhappy and unsatisfied with what I'm doing.  
  
I don't even how to explain in detail why I feel this way or what exactly the issue is. The simplest way I can put it is... I'm bored. I'm genuinely bored out of my mind. I literally don't care whatsoever about my job. I'm very unengaged and apathetic towards everything and I've grown to loathe the office life. I've been hoping there would be some sort of spark of passion that would inject life into me and make me care about the work I'm putting it and I just don't. I don't want this coming off as a whiny post, I genuinely don't know specifically what the issue is and why I feel the way that I feel.  
  
So as the title of my post says, when did you realize supply chain was the right field for you?

Our recent financial forecast doesn’t have us turning a profit until Q3 2024. I’m worried because getting a similar job (that also pays the same) is very few and far between. In addition to this, I am still too green to get intermediate jobs in my field, but I do not want to accept another entry level position that does not allow room for growth. Should I ride out this company for as long as can until I’m either apart of the layoff/ we make it out of the hole, or do I jump ship to a lower level job that provides more stability? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",Icy-Key9074,5,0.8600000143051147,4,1699667855,2023-11-11 01:57:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17sk0rv/should_i_leave_my_failing_company/,11,2023

17sj8lw,When to move on to the next job?,"I switched to a new career in finance and began at a startup with 150 employees. After working there for 1.5 years, I got a promotion to lead a team within 8 months. Despite enjoying the work, the company faced financial difficulties and went bankrupt, so I moved on to a different company.  
I landed a new position in a similar field but with some differences. While I find the work fulfilling, I don't see myself staying with the current company for more than another year, given that I just hit my one-year mark. The company has 4000 employees, and I'm content with my pay.  
Looking ahead, I'm unsure whether I should explore opportunities in a much larger corporation, a company of similar size, or maybe even go back to a startup. I'm also wondering about the ideal duration to stay in my current role. Thinking about leaving after 1.5 years seems like a good balance between gaining enough exposure in my field and making sure I'm well-prepared for future challenges.

17sipwj,"Performance question, argue to the end?","My boss used to be pretty chill. After a recent messy project where he thinks I'm under-performing, he's been sending me emails. And I respond with facts to correct where he may be misunderstandings.

The latest email he sent me is about another project he thought I was working on for weeks. I told him I haven't started, and reminded him that he should already know this from a different conversation him and I had. So it shouldn't be a surprise that I haven't started yet.

Then he changed the subject to say that this week there wasn't much done. I'm prepared to reply and list to him task A, B, C that I did. But I'm sure he will say these tasks could be done in a few days rather than the week.

I would ignore this and just do the work he wants. But since he's been emailing me, I feel forced to argue this to end, otherwise I'm admitting implicitly what he writes is right.

My partner works so I have no pressure to keep this job btw so am not afraid to keep on challenging his perception.

I love research but I hate the lack of feeling like I’m actually making a difference and I hate the risk that career path has (publish or perish , over saturation of qualified individuals, the chance of making shit money doing repetitive work). I often describe loving research like an abusive relationship, I love it but it doesn’t treat me right. And this is how I feel only after 1.5 years of academic research experience. 

On the other hand, I’m interested in aspects of health careers like dealing with people , seeing the fruit of your labour and lower perceived job risk, however I know the training is no cake walk and I’m not sure i have enough passion for it compared to pre-meds I see.

17sbh4z,Been Self-Employed for the Last 4 Years and It’s Time for a Change. What am I Qualified for?,"Background: early 30s man in the Mid-Atlantic, USA

The last few years, I started a catering company and food truck with two family members. It’s been great, it’s been successful. We got some nice local awards and accolades. We’ve done hundreds of thousands in net profit and it’s been a lot of fun doing, especially since it was a passion project for us. 

I, personally, am the chef de cuisine; I do all the ordering of products and do the food preparation and serving with a small team of 5 part time employees. I do payroll, scheduling, managing my team as well as coordinating all the event scheduling and menu planning. Don’t get me wrong, I do plenty of the dirty work of dishwashing and cleaning our kitchen and cooking spaces. I track and manage the finances from all our costs, payroll, and general accounting of both aspects of the business. 

Previously before starting the business, I’ve did a bit of everything. I went to college for media and business. Afterwards I went and worked in wine and spirits sales, was a line and prep cook, brewer for a brewery, tended bar, did freelance audio/video technical work, music venue sound guy, and ended in beer wholesale before finally starting my business. 

At this point, I’m really just looking for something more white collar. I’m burnt out from working sun up to overnight everyday. My girlfriend who’s been with me the entire time is tired of me working so much and not making nearly enough to support us to grow our future. I miss being able to take time off to see my friends and family. I don’t like the fact that I’m not saving money for a future or have health insurance or even have a chance to save for a retirement account. 

My one business partner is completely hands off besides occasionally finding events/gigs and throwing out business ideas and the other is more hands on between working catering and the food truck. Both of them do this part time while working full time in construction management. I know they wouldn’t be upset if we scaled back the business if it meant I get to succeed a bit more and move us into a part time space. My staff knows how I feel and I know they’d support any decision as well. 

As for what I see myself for the future, I think my background and experience gives me a lot of flexibility. I was thinking maybe parleying into something like supply chain management, project management, accounting, restaurant food/equipment sales, alcohol sales, or something at least pertaining to management or sales.

17s8nv2,Resume and career advice,"Resume and career advice

I’m a 26M who wants to start a career in sales. I don’t have a degree yet but I recently went back to school part time at a community college. I’m about 3 part time semesters away from completing an associates in Business Administration and will be transferring to a state school to complete a bachelors in Business management. The problem is I won’t finish til my early 30’s as I have to work full time. I currently work a blue collar gig at a trucking company(loading dock) that pays my bills. Before I worked for my current employer I worked for my dads landscaping and lawn care solutions business. I do have some sales experience from that of my main roles for him was going out and quoting and selling services and projects and  developing and maintaining relationships with customers. I have even have done some D2D while I worked for him and did sell a few services(not many but not bad for no real training just instinct). I want to transition to an entry level sales job to gain experience and bulk up my resume. The problem is that these two jobs are the only jobs on my resume besides some short pt restaurant jobs I picked up during slow season while working with my dad. Is it acceptable to leverage my experience with my dads business on my resume? My current job would add no value to my resume for a sales position. I also need to make about 65kish to keep my head afloat while I work full time and go to school at night or online when I can get it in. But I also need to start building experience.

I've been with my current employer for a year now, and I've already had four different managers.

 (First manager was part of layoffs, second manager almost immediately went on maternity leave, third manager was made director-level for my team so didn’t have much time to worry about analyst position, 4th is a coworker turned manager but is tactical.)

Recently, my performance reviews have been less than stellar—an average annual review and a poor one in July. It's tough because I'm frequently called out for mistakes. I understand the criticism is often justified, but it's becoming a regular, embarrassing theme. This is my first serious job post-college, and I'm trying to navigate these challenges.

When beginning assignments, I’m ready to put my best effort forward. But to do my best and receive criticisms anyway is beyond frustrating.

For reference, I’m currently working in the GRC field. Very detail-oriented which I’m realizing isn’t a strength. I’m told to “own” my projects and start taking initiative, but when I try, I’m told that I need to expand more. While I understand that these call outs are fair, I’m having a hard time thinking how my managers “want” me to think. 

Ultimately, I’m just asking for advice and encouragement.

And if he ever wanted mine since I have been on more than one account (not super common - most people stick to one) to let me know. 

I was trying to take some initiative and mostly just wanted him to remember my name next time I see him, honestly. 

He responded a few days later with a super nice message saying he would love to hear my perspective and if it was urgent could meet sooner, but could talk to me in December. 

I responded back and said it was not urgent at all. And December sounds great. 

I feel really dumb and anxious. I do have thoughts after being on VERY different accounts he oversees but I’m having extreme imposter syndrome about this meeting. I have heart-racing anxiety when I think about it and wish I never messaged him.

17s4glc,Navigating the Future: Top Strategies for Entrepreneurial Success,"In the fast-paced and ever-evolving business world, entrepreneurs must equip themselves with a toolkit of strategies to ensure survival and thriving in a competitive landscape. To illustrate the effectiveness of these strategies, we'll use the experiences of Roberto Boligan, a successful Internet personality. Boligan's journey showcases how these strategies can drive entrepreneurial success, emphasizing innovation, market analysis, customer engagement, and sustainable growth.  
  
**Innovation: The Catalyst for Entrepreneurial Success**  
Innovation is the cornerstone of entrepreneurial achievement. It's the force that propels businesses forward, enabling them to outpace the competition. For entrepreneurs, embracing innovation isn't merely a choice; it's a necessity. It means thinking differently, finding creative solutions, and breaking free from the confines of the status quo. The remarkable journey of Roberto Boligan is a testament to the transformative power of innovation.  
Boligan, a serial entrepreneur, found his footing in the tech industry by establishing multiple software companies. His ventures demonstrated how creative thinking can lead to the development of groundbreaking solutions that address real-world challenges. These solutions have not only addressed market needs but have also left a lasting impact.  
  
**Market Analysis: A Prerequisite for Success**  
Understanding your market is a critical aspect of entrepreneurship. To navigate the complex business terrain, entrepreneurs must conduct thorough market analysis. This entails researching the target audience, studying market trends, and identifying gaps and opportunities within the industry. Roberto Boligan's software development journey is a prime example of the importance of market analysis. His ability to identify market needs and tailor his software solutions has been instrumental in his success.  
  
Boligan's ventures underscore the value of staying attuned to the market and addressing consumer needs. Through keen market analysis, he positioned his software products effectively, making informed decisions that have driven his businesses forward. Market analysis is not a one-time task but a continuous process that enables entrepreneurs to adapt and evolve.  
  
**Customer Engagement: Building Lasting Relationships**  
In the entrepreneurial world, customer engagement is more than just transactions; it's about cultivating lasting relationships. Successful entrepreneurs understand that customers are at the core of their businesses. They engage with customers by listening to their feedback, providing exceptional service, and addressing their unique needs. Boligan's success as a social media influencer reflects the power of effective customer engagement.  
  
Roberto Boligan's ability to connect with his audience goes beyond traditional business models. He actively engages with his followers, building community and trust. Entrepreneurs can learn from his approach, understanding that fostering customer loyalty is essential for long-term success. Building relationships and delivering value are the foundations of customer engagement.  
  
**Sustainable Growth: Planning for the Long Term**  
Maintaining sustainability is a crucial element for achieving success in entrepreneurship. Although rapid expansion may appear attractive, entrepreneurs should direct their attention towards establishing a sturdy basis for long-term and sustainable development. This involves careful planning, efficient financial management, and scalability. Boligan's experience in founding and managing software companies exemplifies the importance of building a sustainable business structure.  
  
The story of Roberto Boligan's entrepreneurial journey demonstrates how implementing these strategies can lead to remarkable success.   
In conclusion, entrepreneurial success is a continuous journey. These strategies provide entrepreneurs with a roadmap to thrive in business. Through innovation, market analysis, customer engagement, and sustainable growth, entrepreneurs can confidently steer their businesses toward success, regardless of the challenges that lie ahead. The entrepreneurial path may have its share of challenges, yet equipped with the appropriate resources and tactics, entrepreneurs can surmount these difficulties and realize their entrepreneurial aspirations.

17s42hc,QA Lab Tech trying to build skills for future remote work,"Hi!

At some point in the future, I hope to be able to work either fully remote or, at the very least, hybrid. I was curious if anyone had any suggestions on skills / career paths that I can work on at my current job (QA lab tech @ a large brewery) could potentially set me up for this - my day to day is pretty much a choose your own adventure in terms of how I spend my time.

Background:

* Dumb B.S. in general Biology.
* I collect large amounts of analytical data by running different tests on beer. I make both routine and non-routine process decisions based on data. This is the bulk of my job.
* My current data analysis skills basically boil down to: look at data on a control chart. Does it look 'weird', does anything stick out, etc? I'm interested in learning more about stats/data analysis, but I kind of suck at math and I'm not sure where to go with this. I mess around with Python sometimes, usually just messing around with spreadsheets. Very basic stuff. I have access to PowerBI but I haven't gotten very in depth with it.
* Try to suggest and implement process improvements based on data but also common sense. I'm currently trying to figure out how to spin the things that I do into specific 'projects'. So uh, I guess I conceptualize and implement projects.
* Do bullshit 'chemical management' work.. I catalogue chemicals we use in the lab, submit stuff to safety for approval. I'd like to flesh out our training and write some SOPs but I don't care that much and our document control is a mess.

My current career progression is Lab Tech to QA 'Scientist', which is basically what I do now but for $4 more an hour. More project work, meetings, less daily testing. If that doesn't work out / I end up hating it, I have no idea what to do. I just know that I'd be happier if I could work hybrid or remote but I have no idea how to frame my experience, or what my career options would be.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

17s3bww,How did you know that your career was right for you?,"Ngl, job anxiety has been a big part of my life since middle school. 

They always told us to think about it in school, and set up charts with plans and the like. I grew up probably upper lower class, it was mostly a single income for four people and that wage came from a bus driver. 

For that reason, I always took having a career seriously. SO seriously, in fact, that it made me completely terrified of making the wrong decision, and wasting the time/money, and now here I am, almost 10 years later, with no degree (no college debt either, but I've applied four different times just to get cold feet at the last second), about to have a baby, and essentially supporting a three person household by myself off of a CNA certification. 

I understand that I'm not always going to love a job. Even though I've been working since 15, its all been entry level stuff, like retail and fastfood (I moved laterally in both areas, but absolutely hated the type of work environment). Being a CNA was my first ""real"" job, and I've been milking that for about three years. 

I know I need to step up, because my body cannot physically handle this job much longer. I was going to take this year to explore other types of jobs, and maybe network that way, but then I got pregnant, and seeing as.CNA work pays relatively well in my area, I decided to stay put for a while to maintain the financial stability I've created over the years. 

I know I just need to do more, but I'm relatively unskilled and want to be passionate about the work I do..which is funny, because I have little to no experience doing much of anything, even as a hobby. 

I've been waiting for this windfall of an epiphany to hit me, basically since I backed out of college the first time...and it's just not happening. I've wasted a lot of time, and now everything is going to be a level harder than it was before. 

What am I able to do, realistically, to bridge this gap? I was thinking about getting an accounting cert, but fear that the job market will be tanked in the future due to automation.

17s1atx,Restructure Demotion Advice,"I’m after some advice on a situation I’ve found myself in that I’m struggling to cope with.

My company recently went through a restructure, with my department losing around half of its personnel.  As part of this restructure I’ve been demoted from being the supervisor of 7 engineers, back to an engineering role myself.  I now report to a supervisor that was previously one of my peers, let’s call him Bob.  There were 5 supervisors previously, now only two with some minor contraction of responsibilities.

Despite repeatedly requesting feedback on why this decision was made from various managers absolutely nothing has been forthcoming.  I have a long list of reasons why I would be the more logical choice, based on many aspects such as the quality of my work, the spread of my responsibilities, the way I managed my people, my knowledge across all areas of our department and all of our products.

Bob is fine, but he’s just a placeholder in the org chart and brings nothing special to the role, whereas I feel I was the obvious choice.  Even though I’m highly introverted by nature, I related to and led the other engineers well. All I can see that Bob has going for him is that he never disagreed with our former boss.  Bob also confided that he was surprised, and expected that he would be let go as part of the restructure.

I’m a better engineer than Bob, and capable of fulfilling a number of roles in the much smaller department - most of which there are now no other personnel capable.  (My former boss is quite petty and let go of people he couldn’t work with rather than people we could do without.)  I believe I would be a better supervisor than Bob, but also that he would not be capable of doing the tasks that I’m now covering in my engineer role.  (I’m also now overloaded, trying to do the work of four engineers.).  I feel like I’ve been hard done by, and am filled with constant low level anger at work.

How can I stop being angry at the situation I’m in?

What are the chances that my performance is going to be evaluated fairly?  What can I do to improve those chances?

I really like the work, but if I can’t get past the anger I’m not sure if I should give up on this department (or company) and look for a position elsewhere.",AnywhereEfficient169,2,1.0,1,1699612703,2023-11-10 10:38:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17s1atx/restructure_demotion_advice/,11,2023

17rzsh7,"Mechanical Engineer, 2 years post graduation, feeling incompetent in role. Any advice?","Hello everyone,

I graduated with my BSME in Aug 2021, alright overall gpa of 3.02, major gpa around 2.8-2.9.
Took quite a while to hammer out my study habits, was also working internships that last couple years in school. School was not easy for me in the slightest, however as I moved into higher classes I really began to really love the subjects I was taking (though I was very much struggling with them). All in all, I genuinely felt as if I had a pretty decent grasp at the concepts.

Fast forward to now. I am a ME/Design engineer in defense, been in this role for about 1.7 years.My role is described as a generalist. I design brackets, easy right? Yes and no... Here's how it goes. I look at the thing I need to mount (some sort of module, computer, etc), design a bracket to fit based on how I *visualize* the bracket reacting under our static and shock loads, and pass it to our FEA group to do the analysis. I see the design through from concept to production release, including drawing review with engineering specialists. If FEA fails, I beef it up enough to pass, though most do pass on the first run, probably from over engineering it, but no one has raised any red flags in that regard.

I've received good marks from my lead and my manager; however, it feels like I have no idea what I'm really doing. I see hand calcs mentioned a lot in here and other subs but I have not done a single technical hand calc (or really any calcs) in my role at all besides a single tolerance stack. When selecting materials, I look at what is commonly used at my company, and will refer to legacy designs when available and go from there. Same for fasteners. To be completely honest, I have no idea how to even start something like that. I'm ashamed to say I don't believe I can actually apply what I learned in school (machine design, mechanics) appropriately.

I know imposter syndrome is a real thing, but I genuinely cannot tell if that is the case or if I am actually just incompetent in my role. Given my apparent lack of fundamental mechanica application, I don't feel like an engineer anymore, I feel like I have been faking it. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? 

My role had no introduction or training, no real mentor. Just trial by fire and hit the ground running.

Thank you.",TheMellophonist,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1699605585,2023-11-10 08:39:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17rzsh7/mechanical_engineer_2_years_post_graduation/,11,2023

17rzewo,"Been working 24 hours, 3 times a week. I’m about to go nuclear on my boss, his boss and his boss’ s boss. How bad an idea is it?","TLDR: Badly managed work schedule is making me question my sanity and I want to complain to my manager’s manager’s manager. 

I recently lost my job and started working for a large conglomerate. I’m a data analyst with 7 years experience. This is context. 

The system (redshift systems via dbeaver) I’m using is an absolute mess. Simple queries like a count(*) sometimes take 30s sometimes > 1 hour. 
It’s highly unpredictable and even after optimizing queries. The team is poorly managed, requirements for reporting change on a daily basis and my boss doesn’t or won’t give clear timelines. 
Last week he asked for a report in 24 hours as urgent for a call specifically the next day. 
I sat all night completed it, then the next day when I asked how the call went he said the call is NOT that week but next week. 

Prior to that he changed the requirements to extremely granular, when I asked him the rationale he said the report/deliverable is  needed in that format.. it took me much longer to complete it but I did and this dude THEN asks for a dashboard, he didn’t mention he needed a dashboard before I ran the granular reports,I told him this size data won’t load on the platform on account of its size and he said “okay then just run aggregates and upload it on the platform”.

I joined the company recently (less than 90 days) 
I have one peer who doesn’t show up to meetings I schedule for clarity on tables and the data dictionaries are old( the schema and table names have changed and there is no effort to update the DD). 
Also I’m Indian, my boss is Indian and my peer is Indian and my boss’s boss is Indian. 
I’m about to write my resignation letter but I want to complain against the work streams to the head of the division, that would be my boss’s,boss’s boss, so 2 managers above me.

17rzcsl,Company trying to make blue collar worker become salaried with required overtime as an exempt employee?,"Hi guys! I am double posting because we really need advice and any clarification you might have. So, I am pretty sure they can't do this, but my husband's (H) employer (E) came to him with a weird offer this week. The offer is 70k salary with at least 45 hours a week as an *exempt* employee and his bonus that was taken away when he started looking for new jobs would be given back. 

IF the offer were 70k salary with at least 45 hours a week *non-exempt* he would totally take it (at least until finding something better which would be more difficult than replacing his current average of 45-50k a year). We don't believe H qualifies as an exempt worker given how much his duties are comprised  of repetitive, manual labor.

This offer comes after H went to E a few months ago and asked for a raise. E told H in that meeting a lot of unprofessional things I wont get into and told H that he should look for a new job if he feels he isn't making enough. Unbeknownst to us at the time, he also took away H's quarterly bonus all the managers get at that time and didn't tell him. (Is he even allowed to do that?)  H has worked there many years and earned multiple promotions and earned a relevant degree in that time as well. This is a family business (leaving it at that for privacy but not immediate family). H does not make a competitive wage at all for the industry and it is no where near the cost of living. Over his years there his raises haven't even slightly kept up with inflation much less his promotions and added skills, tenure and degree. However, now a few months later after realizing what it would mean to lose DH and his skills, they are making an offer to keep him.

H is a manager but spends a LARGE portion of his day running his own machine and also manages his entire shift, but again most of the time he is actively running a machine that he's solely in charge of because they don't want to hire anyone else. Do you believe he could qualify as exempt? Obviously, $70k at 45 hours a week is still better than $50k at 40 hours a week but I am really sick of H being taken advantage of and I fear if they make him exempt 45 won't just be 45. We have a meeting to speak with E and would love any advice on how to bring up that H doesn't qualify as an exempt employee?

Also, just because I think it will be asked: We know he needs a new job and the work environment is toxic. The only feedback he's been able to get from companies that haven't hired him is that it makes them nervous that his entire work experience (albeit a long one) is only at this one company. So now being loyal to them is really hurting him and keeping him there.",karmaisagoodusername,1,0.5,2,1699603590,2023-11-10 08:06:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17rzcsl/company_trying_to_make_blue_collar_worker_become/,11,2023

They talked about opportunities they were going to give me take on more of leadership role to be better prepared for next time. I can’t read people’s minds but I honestly think there’s more at play here given that I overheard the hiring manager say she’s strongly considering another internal candidate who I personally like as a person but who also has no managerial experience and is definitely not as strong as me on the technical side.

I’ve decided to explore options elsewhere. After speaking with multiple recruiters it’s realistic for me to receive a $15K to $20K increase by switching companies. Right now, I’m scheduled to receive my bonus of about $8K in February.

17rtni4,Master’s in Human Resources (HR) is it worth it?,"
Hello!

I am a senior at Michigan State University studying human resources & labor relations. I applied to MSU’s Master of Human Resources and Labor Relations Program (MHRLR).

This program has an outstanding reputation in the HR world, and many top companies such as Honeywell, Microsoft, GM, amazon, BP, delta, GE, and more recruit students from this program. There are always 98-100% internship and full-time job placements in this program.

I just got accepted for spring 2024. I will be graduating with my bachelor's this May and can dual enroll in graduate courses and pay the undergraduate tuition rate for these classes for next semester. (I need to take electives anyway).

For this program, they usually only accept 50-60 students for the fall and 15-20 for the spring. The program costs about $30k per semester.

I don't know what to do. I am so grateful for this opportunity, and this seems like once in a lifetime. I have completed a few hr internships and was a research assistant and am currently completing another one for the fall and potentially for the spring, but I am so conflicted.

Is this a worthy investment for me? Is getting your masters in HR worth it? I am applying for so many full-time roles and am getting rejections left and right.

17rs1lm,Should I quit this job? Medical office,"I just recently was hired as a front desk/medical assistant for this group practice. The group practice has 3 clinics, two of them have NPs as providers and the other is an ortho clinic. I didn’t get hired by the provider I’m going to be working for, instead they had the other clinics interview.  I have about 4 months phlebotomy experience and have worked in some medical offices. Im currently training in the next town over about 30 minutes away. The job I will be doing is called a Medpod and it’s a new thing that is being introduced. It’s telemedicine and you can actually take blood pressure and vitals on the machine. There is headphones or speakers involved that will be for the patient and provider. The provider works in the town I’m training in. I would be helping in the town I live in. They only hired me to work alone as a front desk/MA.

 When I first interviewed I was told I would train 2 weeks in that town. 1 week front desk and the next week medical assisting. Well it’s been 4 weeks now in the next town and so far I’ve only trained 1 week as an MA. I’m not totally confident in my abilities as an MA. I can take vitals just fine, but I have no experience in giving injections or EKG. I start next week in my town, it just seems very confusing and not organized at all. No one can tell me when I’ll  start working in my town. The MA clinic I trained at has a Nurse practitioner as the provider I will be working for. She is very particular on charting and I think I’ve been doing a good job, but this clinic is not very forthcoming to me on what they think.  I get a sense that they are bothered with the fact that they even have to train me. They are not going super into depth with training me. 

A clinic cannot run with only one person and I feel its a dangerous plan to have an inexperienced MA running a clinic. I forgot to mention I am a wife and mom so I do have those responsibilities so it would be hard for me to take a day off if I’m the only one in town.

Basically, I had a recent meeting with my boss in which he told me to set up time to present a project to a group of people who have already seen the project. Like, numerous times.

There are a few layers to the project and the people invited are from different areas of the business, but everyone has access to it. A few of them even get automated alerts for certain portions. There are other parts that are not relevant to a large chunk of the invitees. How do I know? Because they told me so when I showed them the project a few months ago. No updates have been made since.

I mentioned to my boss that everyone has already seen the material (in fact, he and I presented a part of it last month) and that group X is not interested in certain info. But he said something like “well we need to make them aware of our capabilities” but…. They do? 

Anyway he insisted I schedule the meeting. This is an ongoing issue I have with where he seems to ignore things I say. Then I’m so baffled and worried about being combative that I comply (my fault, I know). 

I just know that people are going to find this meeting a waste of time. Funnily enough, our company announced a “meetings with purpose” guideline due to complaints about the amount of time spent talking about things that could have been an e-mail. Hell, my boss’s boss has even asked me to cancel a weekly meetup series I had set (also under direction of my boss) that were always short and about non-crucial info (he told me to make them an hour long lol). 

I’m currently looking for new work and have a decent lead on one, so I hope I get an offer before this meeting occurs and I can just cancel it.

The plan was to ride out the assistant job to make some money and then begin her master's in nursing in January 2024. However, she has done a great job, and her boss has been extremely impressed by her and has extremely high praise for her.  
30 days into the job, the manager has offered her the position of Assistant Commercial Property Manager and she'll be making around $70k to start with full benefits, and has a good chance of becoming a Commercial Property Manager the next year.  
Now we're both lost on what to do because these are two different careers, but money and stress are a huge factor, and while I don't know a lot about nursing, I've heard various accounts of not being paid enough relative to the stress of the job or other accounts of the job being very fulfilling.  
Nursing would've been an easy choice had she not been offered the promotion, but now the new salary is similar to, and in some cases may even exceed, nursing salaries, and there is large growth for her salary if she moves up.

My goal going in was work in the financial world (Banking, Corporate Finance, etc.) and that's probably what i'm going to do post-grad. However, I kind of made the late realization that Finance isn't really what I am passionate about. I recently discovered that I really like the Research & Public Policy elements of Economics. So I'm mostly wondering how at this point I can shift my focus towards Economics and research.  
I was thinking after I work a few years I could try to complete an MBA with a concentration in Econ. I think that'll give me leverage into high finance positions if I wanted, but not sure about how viable that is the Economics world.  
I'm also not sure if I should do a straight Masters in Econ. Do they prefer Econ BA's to Finance BA's? I've also read that you should try to get a PhD in Econ if you truly want to become an Economist, but I'm not sure how deep I want to delve into Academia. (Although maybe thats just because I'm more used to corporate settings and I'm just not really familiar with it).  
Just trying to plan this out early and get ahead I guess so I can be prepared. Let me know.",zerolove__,1,1.0,1,1699574051,2023-11-09 23:54:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17rqt20/finance_into_economics/,11,2023
17rqsj3,Career move ?,"So I’ve been approached by a very large, very influential company within my field of work. They are one of the top 3 companies within Australia in my field. The position I have been approached for is the exact same position I currently do at my current place of work. The only problem is, I started my new job six months ago. The people at my current job are great and I love what I do but I often think about my career progression. It’s very limited within my own company and I’m unsure where to go next after I reach a certain level. 
The bigger company is offering more money, a large bonus every year and more on top of that. 
I’m so tempted to follow through with the offer but I don’t want to leave my current company due to the relationships I’ve gotten, the effort they’ve gone into to train me up and other things. Morally it just feels wrong but I know if I do leave, it’ll be one of the best career moves I’d ever make.

I want to finish my degree and go to school full time like I did before. Obviously, this will require financial aid and sacrifice to study hard for 2 years, maybe even 3. I would pull out the retirement I did make so far to help live off of and pay for tuition. 

If I get my degree I can be in the field I always wanted and make more money an hour and maybe even double my salary in a few years down the road. 

My mom keeps telling me to go for it as she hates seeing me miserable and sick to the point of fainting in front of her. My fiance and another friend of mine also encouraged me to do so, especially if it will take only 2 years if I go full time.

17rnnqx,"PhD in Philosophy, out of Academia, currently HelpDesk. I want a more fulfilling career, what should I do?","Hello everyone,  
As I mentioned in the title, I feel strongly in crisis. My background:  

- PhD in Philosophy  
- Due to various conflicts with my advisor, as well as a form of depression that I need to take care of, I did not pursue an academic career.  
- Unemployed from the age of 28 to 32.  
- Started working in vaccination centers during the COVID emergency.  
- Transferred to the IT department of the healthcare company, providing helpdesk support to employees.  
- I currently work there, as a freelancer (self-employed) for 18 hours a week, earning very little and burdened by taxes, and my contract expires in December.  

Skills:  
- I know how to conduct research (which is not highly valued in this country).  
- I speak English very well, I had a C1 level a few years ago.  
- I'm proficient with computers, considering the work I do.  
- I don't write code, but I'm studying to learn.  
- I am skilled in using Linux.


I need to requalify, but I'm not sure what to do. I have an interest in the field of information technology, but it's a very STEM-heavy area, and even though I have some programming knowledge, I don't think I have the right skills for that industry. Additionally, I don't want to completely abandon philosophy. It's a field I've cultivated for many years, and I don't want to give up the intellectual side of my personality altogether. Are there courses, academic programs, certifications, or anything that can help? I need ideas; otherwise, I risk falling into depression again.

17rmz4g,Coworker is making me question my dream job,"I have been working at the same company for over 7 years, but in many different departments. I started in a laborious entry-role role and have since worked my way into a corporate Program Manager position on an amazing and impactful team. I love the team I work on and the work that I do, I always dreamed of being in this position working on projects that actually help people. However, my partnership with a coworker has me regularly questioning this team and thinking about quitting.

  
Some background... When I was initially hired onto the team, I was told I would be managing a small group (2 direct reports), all assigned to the same project. I would have say on who works on what, long-term roadmaps, etc. However, after a reorg, we lost a headcount for the team, dropping the total team headcount from 3 to 2 (including myself). Around the same time, a coworker was hired who has worked in a corporate position for 5+ years. My boss was really impressed with this coworker, and made the decision for the two of us to tag-team the program instead of the coworker reporting to me. While no one was able to predict the re-org, I include these details because I feel this plays a part on why I feel so uneasy about the working relationship with my coworker.

  
""Uneasy"" is putting it lightly. I can't stand working with them. I was designated as ""Team Lead"" between the two of us, but I'm not leading my coworker in any way. They go to my boss instead of me when making decisions, they don't keep me informed on what they're working on, they don't invite me to meetings they have with stakeholders. They never miss an opportunity to call out something I could have done differently, for better or worse. They are not reporting to me, and really only working through my boss on the project we are supposed to be working on together, ignoring my requests when I ask them to complete tasks and only informing me on small details of what they are doing when I know there to be a much bigger picture.

  
I make a really conscious effort to include this coworker in my work, make sure they're included in meetings that I don't need them to be on. We've somewhat settled into separate areas of the project, but I still feel like they are so critical of all the work I do and try to ""one-up"" me at every chance they get. Since I am technically the ""team lead"" I am in charge of writing and presenting most of our material, working with senior-level leadership, and owning the roadmap for our program, all of which I feel they are very resentful of me for.

  
I am very frustrated with this situation for a number of reasons. I love my job, I love the work I do, and this role is the best chance of getting a promotion in my field, which I am really motivated to accomplish at this point in my life. I really don't think I can find another role in my company where I have the same impact and ability to get promoted as I do in this role. I can't talk to anyone on my team about my frustrations because we are such a small team that I don't want to risk it. Nothing my coworker says or does it technically unprofessional, but it is the underlying tone to all their actions and how they seem to treat me compared to my other coworkers and managers.

  
I've considered setting some time with the to discuss our working relationship, but I don't even know what to say or how to approach the issue. I can't go to my boss because nothing I have to report is unprofessional behavior or constructive, it's just interpersonal issues. I feel like I'm stuck in this position and it makes me grow very resentful every day.

  
How do I move forward? Any insight on how to handle this would be most appreciated. ",throwawayworkperson,7,1.0,2,1699563817,2023-11-09 21:03:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17rmz4g/coworker_is_making_me_question_my_dream_job/,11,2023
17rm0wg,Do I accept the offer?,"Backstory: Asked my professor if he knew of any job opportunities as I didn’t have much luck in the job search, and he told me to try applying to company x as they might start recruiting. I then sent an email to their director who was friends with my professor and they invited me in for an interview, and later in the week they offered me a job with a pretty decent salary (around the median according to the Riba salary guide)

The same week I got an interview invite from another firm (let’s call it company Y). Y is a big international firm which would look really good on my resume.

I’m really grateful for the opportunity but at the same time I don’t know what to do now - should I accept the offer now? But what if Y gives me a better offer? But at the same time I don’t want to go back on my words because 1. The people at X are really nice, 2. If I say yes then I’m really gonna commit to the decision I don’t want to be someone who doesn’t keep their promise, and 3. My professor recommended me so the situation would kinda be awkward. 

And I really have to make a decision these couple days, so it’s not like I can see if Y offers me a position then decide afterwards. But at the same time I’m a pretty greedy person, I AM really thankful for the offer now but I really don’t want to (potentially) miss out such an awesome opportunity to work at Y.

Where I work, there's a Software Developer who was asked to create a website over the course of about 2 years. The Developer can auto-generate about 90% of the code needed for the website in about 2 weeks though. So, in reality it would probably take the Developer about a month to create the website. So, the developer is basically  not doing anything at work because he knows he can create the website with little effort and its 90% complete anyway. Also, the person asking him to create the website isn't technical. So she doesn't know anything other than if the site has been created or hasn't been created yet.

17rltnt,Black mold at the office,"So I work at a company with an old-school mindset where we have to come into work in-person every day. Recently a coworker became very ill and it was found to be caused by extremely toxic levels of black mold in his office. My company did some testing (maybe 1/4 of the offices) and found A LOT of mold. Their solution was to move people who were in offices with very toxic levels of mold into offices that were not tested. When asked why they did not test each office they said that it’s because it’s “costly.” They then went on to say that the mold in the office of the man who now has autoimmune issues “wasn’t that bad.” However, they pulled back the walls and they were covered in thick black mold. The levels were off the charts and he is sick for the rest of his life. 

The company will not allow anybody to work from home despite all of this. They said that it is the employees’ fault that there is any mold in the first place because we “track it in on our shoes.” They’re downplaying it and trying to get us all to be quiet about it.

Oh, also, my company removes mold as part of its services (construction industry).

Even though I’m not ill from it, can I report this to the health department or something? Should I reach out to a newspaper? I don’t know where to go, but this is really messed up. I shouldn’t have to work in unsafe conditions. I live in Ohio and can’t find any info on OSHA about this.

17rlmb8,Midlevel to M.D. - Advice?,"Hi all,

  
24F here, currently in my final year of my Master's degree and lately have been spiraling regarding career options. Fair warning, I am pretty green/naive in regards to financial planning and would really like some insight to inform my decision making. I apologize if I come across as stupid, but am genuinely trying to information gather, I have tried learning things on my own but tend to not understand the concepts/language used so if things could be explained simply I would really and truly appreciate it.  
Here goes:

1. Am currently on track to get my first job in a mid-level field (cardiovascular perfusionist) by April of 2024 (will be 25 at this time).
2. Starting salaries for my field are now 130k-170k, however, shortages and older perfusionists retiring have made the current job market and salaries very favorable. If I choose to work OT and be involved in some ancillary procedures, I could clear closer to 200k+.
3. In 1-3 years my experience would also allow me to pursue travel contracts. Advertised salaries are between 4500k-6500k/week (\~220k-310k annually).
4. Projected debt at the end of my schooling will be \~ 120k (including undergraduate debt). I am eligible for PSLF.

The dilemma:

1. Am considering going back to school to pursue an M.D. however I am unsure if this would be a financially sound decision. I would most likely pursue IM (primary care) and become a hospitalist/an ""easier"" medical speciality as I am not a strong test taker. Seems like most hospitalists I've talked to clear close to 250-300k on a 7-on/7-off schedule and since it is shift work can pick up more (400k+). Would probably aim to do so on occasion to clear more.
2. I would be 26 given I enter school on my first cycle of admissions, thus, 33 when completing given I pursue a 3-year residency.
3. Debt would be \~300-400k after the first four years depending on the school in addition to the 120k previously mentioned. Up to 520k assuming higher tuition rates. Will be PSLF eligible.
4. Residency pay \~50-70k for the final 3 years.

Questions:

1. Could anyone help me figure out at what point would I financially catch up given the debt and delayed earnings of the M.D. route? 
2. Is this financially reasonable to pursue or would I be better off putting in the amount of work (80-100 hrs/week during residency) towards my current position and growing professionally and financially there instead?
3. Would I have a fairly equal earning potential given the opportunities in my current field? I'm a bit lost on how to assess this.

  
Ultimately, I know I would be happy in both positions but have really been considering the M.D. route after being inspired by the surgeons and other physicians I work with. I am drawn to the level of involvement, autonomy, patient interaction, and leadership involved in their jobs which I don't feel as though I have as much of in my current position, though I do love my job. I choose perfusion due to wanting FI earlier and I very much value being able to enjoy my earnings at a younger age, however, I also feel I may regret not pursuing an M.D. Would really like some insight and financial advice as at this point I'm trying to consider the numbers/if it is financially reasonable to pursue in the longterm.

At certain age, once you have everything you desired or hope. You feel that proud moment like I made it finally in life. You feel satisfied and people finally acknowledge your hard work or success. Because when you're young, get constantly brought down, judged, criticized and so on. Then you sorta believe in that dilemma. I already regret wasting 3 yrs in community college because I still have no clue what career path to pick. Still working here and there dead end jobs with no sign of improvement. Still living in fear & anxiety. I'm literally just failing and getting behind in life day by day.

17rl356,Which of the 2 are the best path to hold myself over financially while going back to school?,"So I'm at the rock bottomest of rock bottoms in my life. My work history is sketchy AF because of various random health problems with manual labor jobs, and random life changing events when I'm doing indoor work. I really just want a career, and right now I'm trying to get into IT. I'm self studying to get certifications but I'm quickly finding that's not enough, I need to go back to school for the official degree, and an internship for experience. I've tried to get into internships/IT entry level jobs for several months and I just can't get anywhere. I've also been applying to other things because I need an income again FAST, but nobody will fucking take me. Not even starbucks wants me. But I don't want another string temporary jobs to make my work history look worse. I feel the place I pick next I have to stay at UNTIL I can get schooling done at least, which brings me to my question.

Should I apply to be a mail processor or an amazon delivery driver to hold me over? From what I can gather, working for amazon *might* give me a good work-school balance, but the work overlaps the only times in the week I can participate in any of my hobbies. On the other hand, from what I've gathered, it's damn near impossible to go to school and working for the post office, but then I don't have to give up being me.

17rku3z,Should I change career paths again?,"Hi reddit! I need some advice right now regarding changing careers. For some background, I (24F) come from a low income immigrant household. I decided to go back to school recently after dropping out of nursing school in 2020. When I originally started college I was 16, I attended a local community college that offered certain college students a program that allows them to graduate with an Associate’s degree and High school diploma. I graduated with both and I decided to go into nursing. Looking back now, I realized my decision was made out of a lot of societal and family pressure. I got burnout badly because my whole life was healthcare. I was working as a CNA and attending nursing school and taking care of my family. This burnout lead to me having a bad health scare in the end of March 2020 (right as the pandemic hit). I ultimately had to drop out of nursing school. My family was not happy about it. Afterwards, I felt like I was in a weird limbo state for the past 2-3 years. I job hopped a bit, but felt directionless. I was in therapy at the end of 2022 and for most of 2023 because my mental health was not good. I decided to go back to school because having a degree is something I have always wanted to accomplish.  
  
So in the spring of this year, I decided to back to college. I knew I really wanted to study Anthropology. I had taken some intro classes in Anthropology at the community college I went to. The field spoke to me a lot, because it is very interdisciplinary and intercorporates so many things. I knew this is what I wanted to study and make a career out of. I decided to study out of state on the East coast (I am from the Midwest). I will admit I thought studying somewhere completely new would be easier than I thought. I was overconfident and naive to how hard it would be to for me to start somewhere where I did not anything (people and local places). I have struggled a lot to find my footing. I do have my boyfriend out here (was one of the reasons behind the move) but he lives about an hour away and is in his last semester of college himself. I do not want to solely depend on him as my support system, it would not be healthy nor fair to him. I was able to make a small group of acquaintances, but they commute to school and I live on campus.  
  
Most my main concern right now is my financial situation. I recently had to decided to move back home, because the cost of tuition and living where I am was too much for me. I have a lot to pay in regards to tuition and dorm since I am out of state (basically double the cost for an in state student). I also used all of the money I was able to save from my previous job. I tried and tried to find a job here, both on campus and near the surrounding area. I applied to nearly 100 positions and only got a handful of call backs and interviews. Every interview was a bust, they wanted someone with complete flexibility, they wanted full time. I could do either, I only have classes 3 days a week and during the week so I thought it would be easy to find something, anything.   
  
So here comes in my dilema. I know will have to get a Bachelor's and even a Master's to get where I want to for my career in Anthropology. But I simply do not feel like I can financially afford it. My parents do help me, but they do not make even to help me cover the costs of everything. And I do have a younger brother that they have helping with school too. Scholarships are not guaranteed and financial aid only helps cover a percentage of the costs. I also have some debts aside from college that I need to pay off.   
  
How I feel is I need a practical career/job now and then I can study what I want. I weirdly have been seeing a lot of people on here and on other socials about data analytics and UX/UI design. I know it is something vastly different than what I have/am doing. But it seems like a decent paying job option and something I can accomplish in a year. I know that my family will not be in full support if I make this change and honestly it is something that I just recently started considering. Any advice is appreciated! Especially from those who have made a big career change or work in the field",omgitsdyc,1,1.0,0,1699557967,2023-11-09 19:26:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17rku3z/should_i_change_career_paths_again/,11,2023
17rk71q,"Should I move to another city with no job lined up just to take risks? Unemployed graduate here, seeking advice.","I’m 22, just graduated from a university in Southern California in May. Because the on-campus apartments at my university required to kick all students out at the end of the school year and my parents really wanted me back home, I moved back home in the Bay Area. Since then, I still have no luck in securing a job in SoCal, which is my desired location to move to. I am looking to relocate to a city in that area since there are only a certain amount of jobs in the field I am looking for (I want to work in the film/television industry). I can’t live at home anymore due to personal and family reasons, as it seems like my parents are manipulating me into staying at home by saying, “You can’t live alone down in SoCal by myself or else I’ll get kidnapped”..or they also tried talking me out by saying, “your parents are getting old, what happens to you and your sister if we both die?”

Anyways, I have recently been turned down for two interviews for these wonderful jobs that I was extremely qualified for, in which both of the managers basically said “We are only holding in-person interviews for this position and prefer someone who is currently local to the area (as we need them to start right away)” even though I feel absolutely certain to still pack up and move and start right away upon job offer…because I’m so desperate. (I’d be planning to get an airbnb or stay with a friend temporarily right away before looking for an apartment long-term).

I’ve been pretty bummed about this and losing hope as I feel like not being a local is ruining my chances of an interview. I've been applying to jobs where I fit their requirements but l've either gotten an email saying that they are passing me to find another candidate or no response at all. I’m not sure if I should just take a risk and move and keep applying to jobs after that because I do not want to move without a job secured especially in a city with an extreme cost of living.

Has anyone moved to another city without a job secured to take risks, and eventually ended up getting one? How should I improve my job search?

17rinpy,How do I handle this?,"Advice needed, finding applicants for my current role in shared Outlook? No communication from employer. 

Lurker sorry for any formatting issues. 

I've been at my POE for 7 months, without diving into too much detail, my boss has actively commented on everything I am/do(?), my car down to anything I wear including my shoes. 

These comments are just enough of a sing-song with a smile and backtrack for me to leave and cry/want to cry on my way home because I realize only shortly after that I'm being talked down to. For most of my day with being being treated in a way that just makes me uncomfortable, like the weird kid at a lunch table. 

I don't wish this person(my boss) any ill will, but I have found them to be a person I do not enjoy- 
 as I do not cherish any memories of having an authoritarian mother, which my employer seems to enjoy stepping into that role as much as possible.  (On top of being ableist af without a care) I do my best to let this roll off my back, because I'm part time, they need(ed?) me and I need the income. 

Well as of recently, I have found the same interview questions printed and just left in the printer for me to find, this is not common as printed items are generally grabbed immediately. 

Since finding that my employer has now accidentally showed the download of a resume, which I think they think I missed somehow on the 48-in screen. 
(I'm dyslexic and she ""forgets"" this when she's annoyed and telling me ""I know you know this, you should already know this"" I need a moment to actually read???  But I certainly can at an average rate) 

I've now also found somebody's application information/files in our shared inboxes. 

The two resume items have happened in the past 2 days, are there any actions I should take, are there any actions I could take?? I don't even know what documents I should be saving for myself. 

Quite frankly, I am fine not being miserable all the time having my current job. I'm pretty sure that while I have already been continuing to look over these past 12 months for employment, I will be happier on unemployment looking for something with at least a hint of camaraderie for general existence / being a normal person. (Which my employer also has a hard time showing our clients, and they can tell.)

17rinlc,Which shall I go with: Offer 1 or Offer 2?,"For context, I'm in the field of finance and accounting and I haven't been working with a corporate company for a while. I was looking for a good transition and this seems to be the time. Both jobs are full-time, one-year contract in Canada.  
  
  
Offer 1: This company is well known in Canada, but maybe not so popular outside Canada. All (2) the interviews are done. On-going security checks. The first day is likely to be in a few days. However, has not yet received the offer letter. Since I was out of touch, the job is slightly entry-level. The interview experience was great, good energy from both the interviewers and once asked about being a permanent employee, chances are very high as they offer permanent positions to contract employees. Payment is much below what I anticipated.   
  
  
Offer 2: Very well-known company, very likely to be well-known outside Canada. 1 of the 2 interviews is over. 2nd interview is scheduled (maybe by the time, I'll get the offer letter for offer 1). Not an entry-level position, but my previous experience in the industry really counted. The interview experience was okayish (One of the 2 interviewers didn't show up on time). I needed to put up a lot of energy to keep the interview going, however, I was able to leave a great impression at the end. Overall not so not-so-great vibes. One of my much-experienced kin who has been working there doesn't have a good impression of the hiring manager, with whom I have my second interview. Not so well known for offering a full-time position, All though they do it, most of the time, they only extend the contracts. From what I understand, they moved some professionals to an upcoming project, hence few positions are open and I have a feeling, this will be offered as a full-time position. Regardless of all, the position is very compelling, the nature and exposure of the job are very well and offer slightly better pay than I thought.  
  
  
My take: My heart is with offer 1 but rationally I think offer 2 makes more sense. Even though my gut feeling is to go with Offer 1, I might be biased about the things I already know about Offer 2. It will be a big L, if I'm deceived with offer 1. One more point, I know few people who I know from both my personal and professional setting in Company 1, which is a little off-putting in my own terms.

1. People on my team were scheduled to work 40 hours a week. Sometimes I would work about 15 minutes extra if a client seemed to really want my help. I think one of my coworkers disliked me a lot for this. Since, I think it appeared to him that I was being an overachiever. I would never stay over 30 minutes longer than my scheduled time. Also, one time I asked the director about me doing this and he said ""That's great! Keep doing that. That's the type of culture we need here"".

2. Whenever there were events outside of work I pretty much never attended. For example, a dinner party. I kind of think this is the worst thing I did probably. Since, it probably comes across as not caring about being part of a team.

3. I had a work profile picture that wasn't too professional. I was wearing a t shirt. The dress code of the company allowed people to wear t shirts though.

4. Whenever someone was more than about 20 feet away from me and I needed to ask them a question, I would usually send them a Skype or email. Unless they weren't busy or it seemed like something complicated to explain over text.

I’m currently making $70K as a nanny in NYC. I didn’t like my job at first but it’s been running smoothly more recently. I’ve been applying to marketing/social media/consulting jobs for a year now with no luck.

Just came across an opportunity to interview for a social media/content creator job that offers $40-45k. It’s a fashion brand, on the smaller side with opportunity for growth. They sell at some of the big fashion retailers.

I’ve been aiming to make more than I currently do, but in this job market it seems like going for a more entry-level position is what I’ll find.

I admitted that I had f'ed up and I determined to pass the PIP in 3 months. However I did not realisee that moving to different country and mental health disorder really took a toll on me.. thus while some areas I improved, others did not. Therefore after nearly 3 months, I was told that they had to extend the PIP. 

That news + family situation (sucks lol) triggered my anxiety and depression. The company doctor ordered me to have an extended sick leave.

FYI, I live in Europe. The country where I live in has a shortage in medical professionals, so I have not yet been admitted to therapy until I get a slot. I am on waiting list, so I have been with a mental health worker for a while. That being said, my health seems to be stable and I feel ready to try returning back to the office. There is a reintegration program that allows me to test the water at work before working 100% full-time. Note that reintegration time is not one size for all, some has it 3 weeks, some I know needs 1 year to reintegrate.

Even though I don't have a 'tool-kit' from therapy yet to manage my mental health, I want to go back to office so that I could utilise the reintegration program, in order to avoid from letting my anxiety take a full grip on me and my work. However, I am fully aware that PIP is waiting me when I am on 100% capacity.

Need your advice if staying at the current company is a sensible shot to take, or is it a terrible idea? Any thoughts or opinions are welcome.

17relwj,How Did You Make It Out of Sales?,"I (35 M) have been in sales since I was 16. I went to school (MBA) without a plan just with a “get a degree and get a better job” mentality. I was a Personal Banker for several years for a large bank. Now, I work for a large telecom company as an Account Executive in the B2B Mid Market space. Both roles sound more prestigious than they actually are. My base is below industry average for the AE title and especially for the Chicagoland area. I didn’t mind the AE role because I initially made pretty good money with my commissions. My department closed down in 2021 due to supply chain issues in the international markets I was selling into. As a top performer I was offered to move to another channel of the business (same title just selling different things). 2 years later I am extremely burnt out. Within my first 6 months everyone on my team of 8 quit. I was instantly the veteran. My manager had been in role 1 year more than me and was still getting acclimated. She left soon after. I was bounced around a few times to other teams. Needless to say I have really struggled to ramp up and perform. I have been on and off of PIPs and now I am always stressed (even when I’m not at work). This company has truly killed any aspirations I had to remain in sales elsewhere. I am ready to move on!

Those of you who were in sales for a long time and made it out: 
- How did you do it? 
- What did you transition into? 
- How’s your stress/happiness levels now? 

Any recommendations or feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance for your time and help!",GDMFB1,3,1.0,1,1699541374,2023-11-09 14:49:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17relwj/how_did_you_make_it_out_of_sales/,11,2023

I’m thinking about quitting my full time job and focusing on learning an online course . Money is not a problem as I’m willing to spend how ever much on an online course . I’ve been purposely saving to do something like this and I think it’s time . I also have a level 3 diploma in creative media production.

Is an online course going to help me apply for a creative role? If so what type of course?

And have been wanting one for a while now. They found one that has 240,000 km on it, and most probably changing the engine, transmission and suspension is not an option for them since they don’t care about that stuff. Even so, is it worth changing the engine?

Also they most probably won’t sell the car later on, so reselling it with that amount of mileage on it is not a problem.

(We live in Cyprus and it was either this car or another one with 220,000 miles on it. But they don’t like the interior or the color of the car. That’s why we’re struggling.)

17r96ur,How to figure out what to do for loving,"I always was A-type. I valued myself through academic success and how well I performed. I did everything ""right"". I had business degree and networked to make myself known. I
I was very active in Linkedin and had millions of views in my posts, hundreds of comments, dozen messages and I went out for lunch and or had coffee with recruiters and other people in my industry.

It was hard to get any job. I applied to like 60 jobs in a year, basically everything that was available and got interviews for each one I applied. I was always the second out of hundreds of applicants. There was always a reason why I wasn't selected, I had too little experiences.

I thought I would be wanted because I am very talented and knowledgeable. I did my training in a few international companies. During my studies I did account receivable/payable and when I graduated, I got a job as financial controller. I loved the job but my boss was abusive and I got ptsd from it. That is why I looked for other things. I had my last job end of last year. I worked as accountant which was okay. I hated the workplace and my interest was always in finances, so it wasn't that great place either. My peers belittled me, left me out of things, talked bad behind my back etc. 

There was many personal tragedies and changes I experienced last year. Which made me question what I was doing. I have autism and adhd. I have all my life tried to fit in, be normal and hide my true self. Last year, I got sick of hating who I am. I knew only way to accept and love myself was to admit that I have these things and there is nothing wrong with that.

I also realised that because I am smart and gifted doesn't mean that I have to give 200% all the time. I felt awful when I always aimed for more and I got more I could chew. It felt like I couldn't breath.

Because of my wonderful spouse, I was able to put work search aside and focus on me and my mental health. I started new hobbies and tried to find ways to give meaning to life besides working. Now I feel like I want to start working but I don't know where to start.

I don't think I want to get back in my industry. I hated how fake and competitive everyone was. I am very bubbly and full of emotions. That's not very accepted in my industry. I also felt like there was too much pressure and rush all the time. Which doesn't work for me.

I am open for everything. I can definetly study but I wouldn't want to do another degree. Not at least in university. I am not looking for high paying job and I am sure I cannot work full time. So it could be something I can do few times a week or few hours a day. Something that is not too demanding.

I just don't know where to start. I have thinking some office job like secretary could be good fit for me. But I don't know how to approach it.  I don't know what kind of CV I should do. 

I don't want to explain why I am not pursuing career in finance and I definetly don't want to explain why there is gap when I have done nothing. I kind of want to start fresh but I don't know will anyone even consider almost 27 year old with no work experience.",winterberrymeadow,1,1.0,0,1699521794,2023-11-09 09:23:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17r96ur/how_to_figure_out_what_to_do_for_loving/,11,2023

17r80or,"I feel so anxious about my future career and I don't know what to do (F,24)"," I've been working in an export sales department in a mid-large company. The company belonged to my uncle and he was the one offered the job to me. At first I was indecisive about working in export sales but then after working there, I got to be in touch with people all around the world & travel abroad few times for exhibitions. It was honestly a dream come true because I was always so passionate about english and being in touch with people from different nations.

After a couple of months, my manager started to say that he thinks that I have a potential & started giving me extra work load. At first I could manage it but then after 5-6 months, it got out of control. I was doing export sales, export operations (customs,transportation,tracking,informing clients etc.), responsible for an insurance bank operations, arranging the design companies for up coming exhibitions to construct the booth, sometimes getting involved with import as well, and the list goes on and on. But truly, I had a motivation because I really loved the fact that my job was international and offers great opportunities.

Then suddenly, he asked me to stop contacting with clients & only get involved in operational side. This decision really effected my work because I couldn't find any motivation.

After 1 or 2 months, my uncle told me that he wants me and my father (which was also working in the same company as a local sales manager) to transfer to a local & a very small company that they work with. The company shared 60% of the company to my father so he was the new owner. I had to make a decision and my father wanted me to work with him so I had to leave my job at my uncles company and moved to the new company with my father which only works with local companies.

I've been working here for almost 4 months. There is only 8 people working here and I'm the only person who is preparing the price quotations. But on the side, I'm dealing with everthing from accounting to social media. We obviously don't have any export sales at this point. I literally cry on my way back to home everyday because I didn't want to do this at the first place & I truly don't have any motivation or see a future in this company but I also don't want to leave my father as well.

I can see that my father is also not happy & I can tell that he isn't passionate about improving the company. He stays at the office during the day but he isn't interested with what is going on or work in general. So I feel extremely lonely and trying to fix things & start export sales by myself with such little experience. I really can't see any future in this company and think about my old job and travels all the time.

What should I do? Should I talk to my dad about this? I don't know how he will react.

17r5qdc,Career advice for girlfriend,"Hello,

I am 24 (m) and my girlfriend is 25. We just moved to New Orleans 8 months ago as I took a job promotion. My girlfriend is a school psychologist here as that is what she went to grad school for. She does not make much money here in that profession and is having a career crisis because of it. She has always had the desire to go to law school and become a lawyer. Not sure of the type of law, potentially family law, but has a strong desire of now making this commitment. 

The tough part about this is that this would be her third degree and she has accumulated well over six figures in debt with interest rates ranging from 8-12% on each of the student loans. Adding law school debt to the mix would certainly make the total debt quite overwhelming. 

Now, I am in a tough spot as a boyfriend because I want to support her with everything she was to do in life but want to make sure she makes smart decisions that don’t set us back. 

There is certainly risk in going to law school outside of just debt because she may not like it enough or it may not make that much more money than she is making now (~$50k salary).

17r5lem,How long do I need to stay in my current job for it to look good on a resume? (General advise stuff),"Posted on another sub, Apologies in advance if this is rambling- tldr at the end. 

I graduated from college (art school) in may, and somehow managed to land a job in design- jewelry design more specifically. I’ve come to realize that I absolutely HATE this job, and I want out ASAP. I hate office culture, I hate the things I make, I hate getting dressed up and talking to my coworkers, I hate the bogus “9-5” (actually 9-6:30) Tuesday-Saturday schedule. I hate all of it.

I know a lot of you will suggest looking for remote work, but I’m pretty burnt out on design right now and seriously doubting if it’s the direction I want to go with my career. I need a break. I honestly think a blue-collar job will be a better fit for me.

 I used to work as a cook in high school and during the summer in college and I’d like to go back to that for a while while I figure myself out. I don’t plan on that being a long-term career prospect because my dad is a chef and I’m well aware that the pay and benefits (or lack thereof) aren’t very good unless you’re in the more upper echelons of cuisine and I don’t have that kind of passion for cooking to work my way up.

As a possible long term career prospect I’d like to try getting training for welding (any advice from people who’ve gone down this route would be very welcome- I’m really not sure how to start) especially since there’s a training program near me that’s 8-2, and I could work that with a kitchen job schedule.

All that being said, I know I’m very lucky to have found the job that I did. Especially since it’s in CAD, which my degree was not for, and having CAD experience can open a lot of doors. Art school degrees are notorious for being useless and I have a lot of pride wrapped up in the fact that I managed to get a “good” job in my field within six months of graduating. I don’t want to have gotten my degree for nothing, and I’d like to have the option to go back into this field later on if I do end up missing it once I’ve had time to figure myself out a bit more.

I’ve been at this job for just under 3 months, how long do I need to stay for it to look decent on my resume if I decide to take a break and come back to this field later?

TLDR: I got my first design job (CAD) out of college and I hate it. Considering trade school/apprenticeship for a job in blue collar field (welding) and missing old line cook job. How long do I need to stay at this job for it to look decent on a resume should I decide to go back to this field down the line + am I making the right choice?",distressd_hausplant,8,0.8999999761581421,14,1699506319,2023-11-09 05:05:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17r5lem/how_long_do_i_need_to_stay_in_my_current_job_for/,11,2023

17r58du,Biggest decision I'll ever make?,"I will try to keep this short, I am curious to hear what other people would do in my situation.

I'm in my late twenties, I currently work for a sales organization making about $150k a year. Our average top line commission is somewhere around 3% give or take. WE PAY OUR OWN TRAVEL EXPENSES and have to be in the office or on the road from 8-5 Monday through Friday. In 15 years when the principal retires I would be first in line to take over due to the age of the other reps. However, the principal and other reps I work with are all much older than me and VERY old school. I'm the ""young guy"" and sometimes we don't see eye to eye. Essentially because of the age difference and how technology has changed the sales landscape. Still, this job is extremely manageable and I exceed at every aspect in my role. The principal has a MASSIVE account they do almost a billion dollars of business with a year.(Yes, $1B) This account generates about 90% of the organizations revenues. I'm positive the principal is netting over $1 million per year in commissions after taxes and expenses of running the company are paid. The chances of this account going anywhere are slim to none and I would be the 4th generation partner who called on this account if I were to stick around. So I have confidence in the amount of risk I would be assuming.

On the other hand, I have an offer from a company for $200k a year base, plus 1.5% top line commission on new business. I would be working remote from anywhere in the Western US with ALL TRAVEL EXPENSES PAID. The catch is that I would be a sales manager vs a sales rep. I would manage other organizations and reps this company has contracted to represent them, rather than working for the organization that represents the vendor. This company is new to the US market and I really believe in their product and innovations they have made through technology advancements. They have the largest growth potential out of any company I have seen in my experience in this industry. It would be an easy path for me to move into an executive role (Director, VP or President) after 5-10 years with my track record and how new this company is to market as well as the age of the other current executives. I don't see the salaries for these positions ever being over $500k at the highest level(President) seeing that the CEO and owner are related to one another.(Family owned company) These folks are a lot more laid back and much more fun to be around. They are also older than me but the way I describe it is completely opposite of the old schoolers at my current job. It's like hanging out with your Dad's friends for the first time once you turn 21 vs hanging out with your grandparents. 

Both jobs would have pretty close to equal comp plans in terms of retirement and health insurance so this isn't really a factor.

I'm stuck with a decision, 15 years of sitting in the same office and being on the road constantly in trade for netting over $1m a year well before the average age of retirement? OR working from home and living wherever I want, managing people, all travel expenses paid, while still getting paid a commission and working for a group that is a lot more fun to be around for what seems to me like a lot less money by the average age of retirement.

I don't want to hear ""This is a personal preference, and a decision you will have to make for yourself."" Because I could ask ChatGPT and get the same answer. I'm curious what decision you would make if you were in my shoes.",yungscarab,1,1.0,1,1699504994,2023-11-09 04:43:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17r58du/biggest_decision_ill_ever_make/,11,2023
17r51jx,Might fuck around and become a teacher,"For context I’m a 26M mechanical engineer with only 1 YOE. I’m married to my wife who is a 25F and is on her second year of being a teacher.

We live in MA and I get paid 85k and she gets paid 55k and we have no kids. 

The idea of getting home at 3pm every day, having 1-2 weeks off for Christmas, 1 week in February, 1 week in April, a bunch of other holidays and days off and 2-1/2 months in the summer sound super appealing.

Of course, our total salary would go from $140k to about $110k but that’s not even bad imo. There’s ppl making less and working more. The ceiling would also be lower but at this point, I’m only gonna be alive once. What’s the point of making a ton of money if I don’t have time to spend it?

Having the summers off to spend with my wife traveling and doing random shit sounds amazing. Plus it’d give us time to work on other side hustles and what not. Ideally, I’d wanna teach high school. 11th grade honors math would be my sweet spot.

In addition, I’d wanna coach track or something after school. I’m an extrovert and so sometimes working as an engineer just is not it. I think I’d find fulfillment in teaching.

17r3zo7,Should I stay or should I go,"I'm in need of some career advice. I currently hold the position of Director at a company that I'm deeply proud of and have worked diligently to reach this level. I play a crucial role within the organization, effectively holding several critical components together. However, with the recent addition of new higher level hires, I'm uncertain whether they fully grasp the extent of my previous success given historical challenges. My boss is the cofounder and absolutely love working with them. I have a strong affection for my team and thoroughly enjoy collaborating with my boss and cross-functional teams. I genuinely let love the work we do and projects I take on. 

The challenge I'm facing is the heavy workload, requiring me to put in 65-70+ hours per week, even on weekends. It’s affecting my mental health and physical health which includes future family planning. The workload has become unmanageable, stretching our limits. It feels like there is no understanding coming from our CEO. There has been a shift in the last year as we brought in investors. It appears that they prioritize financial gains over employee well-being, particularly since it operates as a private equity company. I'm concerned about how the company is being lead and the risk of being negatively affected. I have become increasingly aware of potential red flags and the responsibility of having a team report to me is terrifying if things were to go south. Many people are worried and considering leaving the company for the same reasons. Im scared if things crumble that my team will be too and that responsibility will fall on me. I understand that my departure would have a significant impact on the company, which complicates matters further, given my deep respect for my boss.

Is this something I need to be up front about? Never speak of it? I'm afraid of running into the wrong person and they tell someone to check into me more. Being in a right to work state, that gives me the fear of just losing my job one day. On the flip side it was 13 / 14 years ago.

Current team situation:
- I’ve been on this team for 4 years and get strong performance evals
- my project got moved to a different country and they assigned me to an area I’m less passionate in
- my new role is a title promotion, I work with senior managers to set strategic direction which feels like a good opportunity 
- my scope is very large which seems like an opportunity but also I’m juggling a lot (maybe 6 projects at a time). This has caused me to work long hours, sometimes 12 a day
- I’m burned out and so is practically everyone on the team, morale is low
- the org is dysfunctional, many directors leaving, a lot of politics
- my manager is new and isn’t able to provide me much help, I’m on my own and sometimes coaching him how to do his job. I like my skip manager though
- since I’ve been on this team so long, I’m very aware of all the politics and I’ve given up trying


New team situation
- it’s back in the area I’m most passionate about
- the team is well established and doesn’t seem to be quite as dysfunctional (I could be wrong here). I’m naive to the issues so I’m not immediately cynical like on my current team
- the manager just got headcount and helped people get promoted, a positive signal about their capabilities
- the new work seems interesting but also a bit stressful in terms of being ambiguous

My manager took out her family problems on me last week and our hybrid work options keep getting slashed. The management keeps bitching about new grads being shit and ungrateful. And yeah, sure, we get cute little mental health 101 seminars after someone offed themselves over overwork again and it went public. But my workplace still hasn't fired a client whose staff keeps verbally abusing us and causing a ton of unnecessary overtime bc the contract is too profitable. So, yeah, I'm ready to put in my two weeks.

But so far, the only offer I have is from the nice little place I interned at before. Yeah, it'll be a pay cut from this prestigeous place I'm at but their management at least isn't radioactive and the hours are sane.

The annual pay cut would be about $6k pre-tax (which works out to ~$150 per paycheck after tax). I live in a low-cost area and this still wouldn't fuck up my household budget. There will be a pay bump after I finish the remaining half of my professional exams and year-end bonuses.

I'm 26 (my names not really Jared, but you can call me that) and have never had a job. I feel like an absolute loser. I have coasted by on student loans. Up until maybe a year ago, I struggled with significant mental health problems, recently broke out of a freeze trauma response from a really tough childhood, and have zero familial support, so loans were the only way I knew to stay afloat, as online university is a breeze for me (I'm a wiz academic in anything not math-related). I'm a massive introvert, but I'm actually really good at talking to people, and most people think I'm nice and sociable.  
   
If I'm going to be completely honest, I'm terrified of getting a job. I've tried getting a real job before but have always had difficulty landing anything (you know) and used to have painful reactions to rejection sensitivity. I don't want to talk to people all day, as I don't have the bandwidth. I can't work in IT or sales (not a good fit). Every attitude or personality test says unanimously that I should be a therapist, and I've gotten feedback from people saying I should be one. I am considering finishing my MSW to become an LCSW and practicing, but it takes a while, and I feel like I should be a little further into recovery and healing.  
   
I'm so stuck and lost. I don't know what job I can get. I hear entry-level work is scarce, and how would I get a job with no experience? I'm open to internships, as I'm currently in an MPA program. I feel a little doomed and scared.  
   
My enneagram is type 9 (the peacemaker), my MBTI is an INFP, my undergrad degree is in public health (graduated in 2019), and I'm two classes away from an MA in Sociology, a year away from an MSW, and five classes away from an MPA.

17r19op,How to voice concerns to your boss about burnout/lack of confidence,"I work as a PM for an agency, and I've been with the company for a little over 2 years. I was fortunate to be hired during the strong job market amidst the pandemic. I have prior experience in project coordination and customer service, and in my last job I did have a PM title, but wasn't really a PM. Because of that, I initially struggled with imposter syndrome when I started.  
Fast forward to today, and that imposter syndrome feeling persists, even though I've gained experience and grown in my role. Managing budgets, Gantt charts, and stakeholder management are all new to me, and it's been a steep learning curve. Sure, I may have brought more knowledge than I give myself credit for, but i'm feeling so stuck and unsure of myself. Things have not been going well in my projects, leading me to question concepts I thought I understood. Even after two years, I'm asking really basic questions and have gotten to the point where I'm too afraid to keep asking.  
Recently, I approached my boss with a budgeting issue, but I felt like he may have brushed me off unintentionally. This has reinforced my belief that I shouldn't ask questions or should know better at this pointl. I'm second-guessing my every move, becoming increasingly frustrated and overwhelmed.  
While I do have a substantial workload, my lack of confidence in decision-making is significantly impacting my ability to think critically, and perform well at work. I'm incredibly depressed and am obsessive overwork even when I log off.  I work remotely, and it's become common for me to find myself in tears at my desk almost daily. Fortunately, being full remote allows me this privacy. The smallest hiccups can trigger an emotional response. Smallest inconvenience? Tears. Someone is doing an informational presentation and it doesn't resonate with me/I don't get it? Tears. It hasn't helped that I haven't taken a day off in months and I've been working 2-5 hours each weekend on top of a 45-50 hour work week.   
In the last few days, I learned that I'm being assigned a substantial project with a significant budget, which could be a valuable experience for me.  don't feel excited about it; instead, I'm overwhelmed and constantly anxious. I haven't even been able to properly dive into the project yet. I had drafted an email to my boss expressing my concerns about my workload and stress before this project landed on my lap, but I hesitated when he sent me a somewhat negative-sounding email, deciding it wasn't the right time. The news of the new project has only heightened these feelings over the last few days.  
Now, I'm trying to refine this email, but I'm apprehensive about how I'll come across. I don't want to appear helpless for admitting my lack of confidence, but I feel it's necessary to convey where I am and acknowledge my uncertainty in my role and ability to handle this new project. Unfortunately, there are no other options available, as no other PM has the bandwidth to take it on.  
My boss is generally reasonable and genuinely a kind person. I believe he'd take on more of a coaching role rather than react with anger if he knew about my situation. However, I'm still concerned about the best way to broach this topic and what I should avoid saying.

17qy318,ITSM job is disappointing,"
Unfortunately, I'm in a total dilemma.

 I looked for a job for a long time and eventually I took a SAP MM course.  And found a job straight away.  The first few months were cool.  I was involved in a cool S4 migration project.  But after that I was put into two boring projects.  There is almost nothing to do in one project so I can't even invoice it.

 There's a lot to do in the other project but I'm not interested in it.  Instead of doing SAP MM, I'm in an it service management project.  I.e. always create some documents.  Accompany tickets (not redeem them).  Invent some unnecessary new process and sell the customer how great you can optimize the work.  This is not SAP or IT!  But IT third level support.

 I've been at the company for 2 years and the job is getting more and more boring.  I'm not learning anything new!  Nothing about S4Hana, nothing about Fiori or MM.

 Why do I stay?  It's comfortable.  The company pays okay.  I am allowed to work 100% remotely.  My equipment is paid for.  And I never have to travel.


 Should I just get out and look for a real challenge?  My problem is I can't leave it around.  Benefits are fine.

17qx5mq,Leaving $1.5 million on the table for new career,"I'm highly considering moving into a new position next year in Technology Sales (offer has already been signed but I can rescind by June 2024), starting at $80k with an income potential in 2-3 years to make $150-200k. It's a sales development program with a F500 Tech Company, a direct path to field sales.

When I did the math on my cumulative income potential in the next 10 years, on the conservative side accounting for projected raises my income should be around $1.5 million cumulatively. I'm very much so a money driven person, and I excelled academically in Math and Science which is what drove me to my career currently.

But I did not realize until I had a lot of dental work done in the past 3 years (root canal, fillings, braces) that I have a deep interest in dentistry. Before and after every dental procedure I had done, I love researching and watching content on the work I had done. I enjoy chatting with my dental professionals (general practitioners, endo, ortho) to learn more about their day to day as well as what exactly my procedure will entail.

TLDR; I can forgo the career in front of me and lose $1.5 million in the next 10 years to go to dental school. But in doing so I will have to go back to undergrad for pre-reqs then dental school and possibly residency (I'm thinking about ortho), while taking out about $500k in student loans.

17qwsg4,What do I do when I'm so terrified?,"
Hi.

I'm 16. My birthday is this Saturday, and I don't look forward to it. As I write this, my face is red and eyes full of tears. People say its okay not to know what you want to be when you're older, but nobody talks about how absolutely terrifying it is to be in sixth form and choose terrible subjects that are too late to change.

I picked BTEC Applied Science, A-Level Sociology and A-Level Psychology. I should've replaced that stupid BTEC with A-Level English, and should've scraped sociology too. I picked useless subjects. I admit, sociology was on me. But BTEC Applied Science was because of my parents.

They wanted me to be a doctor and for that you need Science based subjects. I couldn't pick sciences because of my 4 in math. So, I went for the BTEC because, out universities accepted it to do biomedical science. Later on, I learned that biomedical and medical science is different, I began hating sociology and applied science, and my parents kept asking what the hell I'm doing with my life.

And honestly?

I don't know anymore.

The funniest part is, I'm amazing at English. I got 9 in both lang and lit, plus a distinction in my speaking exam. I did perfectly. But they pressured me into being a doctor despite knowing I don't want to. I've always wanted to go into criminology and become a homicide detective, or just work for the army. Being a homicide detective is my dream, but now? My parents have essentially abandoned me and told me to do whatever the hell I want but then constantly ask what I'm doing to my life, they absolutely hate the idea of me going into criminology, they think I'm a failure for not wanting to go into medicine and that I'm ""settling for less"" because its harder, when actually I just never liked it. But when I say that, my father's quick to say I always said I'd be one when I was 9. Freaking NINE. Obviously I said whatever the hell they wanted me to be! Yes, this is how early they started implementing that in my head.

Basically, I don't know what to do anymore. My parents have made me feel worthless for the last few months and just confronted me yet again a while ago, which is what made me desperate enough to make an account on here and ask for help. Am I really worthless if I don't become a doctor? 


More importantly, what job can I get now that can pay me well? What do I do? Is my life over before I even began it? I'm 17 soon, and it'll be my last birthday as a kid. Everything's happening too fast, and I've never felt more worthless, scared and alone. I know it seems trivial, but my culture is just.. Well, I'm sure you understand the likes of it if you've read this far. I'm just so scared. Please, I rewlly want advice. Real advice. I'd be really grateful if you could spare some time to help me out, and thank you for taking,ING time out of your day/night to read this.

17qvkal,When should I negociate when I am offered a job?,"I am currently interviewing at a company where it is 4 days in office + work from home on Fridays. There's a good chance I will receive an offer since they asked for references 2 weeks after my final interviews and scheduled a 5-15 min call. My last job was remote so I have pre-existing days where I was planning on working out of town. When I was interviewed by the recruiter last month I disclosed the days I would be out of town on the assumption I would work remotely because my last job was 100% remote. I have since added an extra week for the Christmas holidays since who knows how long these processes take and if they would even hire me.

  
Besides negotiating salary, is it possible to negociate to be able to remote work for the extended 2 weeks? Also do you try to negociate after you hear the offer but before the usual ""let me think about the offer for a couple of days"" tactic? Or do the negociate when you call back to tell them I'm going to accept the offer?

17qunc0,How do I phrase asking off for a mental health day?,"I had a breakdown at home getting ready this morning and decided when I got to work that I need to take a day asap. I was going to take Friday but the thought of going back in tomorrow not having a breather from the things that I'm struggling with is sending me into an anxiety spiral. The day *needs* to be tomorrow.

The problem comes in that I don't get sick days and I'm about to go out of town on vacation for Thanksgiving (but travel =/= rest). So taking tomorrow means I plan to be back on Friday. I really think I'll be fine with that. Most of what I need is time to not be at work and time to take care of the things at home that I'm neglecting to make my routine actually flow instead of constantly fighting it and actively making it worse everyday. I feel like I'm living in a sinking ship.

But if it were Friday I was taking off I could plausibly have a lil stomach bug and be better by Monday. But we've had a ton of people out with covid lately and if it's Thursday that I take... what do I say? At first I was thinking that I could say I had an appointment that got moved (which is not untrue if I don't give details and the appointment is with myself and prioritizing my health) but most people don't take a whole day for that and I don't want to get questioned.

My shift ends soon and I'm just trying to figure this out because either way I'm not coming in tomorrow, I can't. Do I just leave and call in in the morning, citing something? No doctor's note will be needed. Or do I say something before I leave, and what do I say? I've never done this before and my anxiety isn't helping a thing. I also don't feel like I work in a place conducive to the straight up honesty of ""I need a mental health day, I won't be in but I'll see you Friday."" It just isn't the culture or climate.

I checked with my manager and coworkers. 3 out of 5 members in the team have gotten the same email for this afternoon. My manager was not informed of any layoffs within our team but several other members from other teams have been let go overnight. So it's safe to assume I'm getting sacked today.

I'm livid since this is not a performance issue or any fault of my own. I have gotten 3 awards and cash rewards for my 'excellent performance' in my 2years here. I'm trying not to think too much into the reasoning behind the layoffs. I think I just got unlucky.

I'm trying to evaluate my next steps. I am looking into applying for the state unemployment benefits(I live in Florida, for context). I have a lot of questions like, is the unemployment check worth it? Is it going to affect my future job in any way? Do I have to pay a lot on taxes later?

Without my income, our household will definitely take a hit as I was making the most. My husband still has his income. So if we cut down our expenses to the bare minimum like mortgages, bills, and groceries we could survive on 1 income for a while.

With that said, I have been applying to jobs for 2 months now(I have been planning to leave the company anyway) but haven't had much luck. I work as Data Engineer. The job market is very rough right now. 99% of my applications get rejected. So odds are, it could take 3-6months to land a decent next job with comparable pay to the current one. Do I keep looking for jobs in my line of work for a good salary or do I look for something short term like an hourly wage job to fill the gap?

Any advise is appreciated. I want to plan ahead and prepare for the worst.",anonymousposter_2023,2,0.7599999904632568,8,1699466420,2023-11-08 18:00:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17qrgdx/just_found_out_im_about_to_be_let_go_in_a_couple/,11,2023
17qr1o4,Do I make the 500 mile move for a job that only guarantees 6 months of employment?,"I have my masters degree in physics and it has been nearly impossible for me to find a job. I finally got my first offer in over a year of applying for jobs. It is at a national lab in health physics. It’s a lower level position (technician), but I could grow into it. I am excited about the prospect of working at a national lab and how good that would look on my resume. But I don’t think I’ll want to stick in health physics for my entire career.

Additionally, this is only a 6 month term of employment. There is a possibility of extension or promotion, but it’s not guaranteed. It is possible that I would get stuck with a year long lease and become unemployed halfway through. 

I am also still in my 20s and my current job pays poorly. So I don’t have much money saved up. I live 500 miles away from this lab, so it would be quite a journey. And the cost of living in this new city is very high. To put a security deposit down along with first months rent will nearly obliterate my entire savings. I also don’t have anyone to help me move, so the logistics of even getting there would be extremely challenging. 

At the moment, the only way I’m getting there is to live in my car until I make enough at the new job to find an apartment. Is this even worth it? Is it reasonable? I would need to make this move by December 1st, so I don’t have much time.

17qqska,Contemplating between becoming a Software Engineer and a Surgeon,"Hi everyone,  
Before I proceed and ask for career advice, I need to tell you a bit about myself and my contemplations.  
  
I'm 23 years old and have been exposed to programming since I was 12 years old. I started a Mathematics and Computer Science degree and completed the 1st year, but I stopped due to bad grades, despair, and a lack of passion. I then found a programming job, but I came back tired every day with a lack of desire to do anything. I lost my passion for even working on personal projects, and I haven't programmed for over 6 months now.  
  
On the other hand, I've been passionate about fitness, designing workout plans for friends, aiding in their post-injury recovery, and even offering my non-professional insights into their conditions. I've invested time in studying sports injuries, observing surgeries online, and continuously expanding my knowledge of the musculoskeletal system.  
  
Additionally, I have a genetic disorder called ""Familial Mediterranean Fever"" (M694V) and take daily Colchicine to manage it. I experience attacks every 6 months or so, but a healthy lifestyle has significantly improved my condition.  
  
Considering my interests and health condition, I'm contemplating a career shift to medicine. However, this path would necessitate improving my high school grades and an extended period of study. My options include pursuing Physical Therapy or Orthopedics Surgeon Specializing in Sports Injury. The transition seems daunting, and I'm concerned that my medical condition and medication could pose challenges.  
  
As an alternative, I'm considering pursuing a degree in Bio-Medical Engineering. This field would allow me to explore both medical and technological aspects, and I could decide whether I want to pursue a career in medicine or technology. I'm aware that there are 4-year medical degree programs available for those who already have a BSc, so I could potentially become a doctor if that becomes my goal. I'm also thinking about studying Physical Therapy and then pursuing a similar program to become a surgeon.  
  
In essence, I'm at a crossroads and not entirely sure about my next steps. I'm also concerned that my experience in the programming industry may not have been representative of the entire field, and that my fascination with medicine might be more about reading and watching related content than actual practice.  
  
I would greatly appreciate any advice or insights you may have regarding my situation. Thank you for your time and consideration.

  
TL;DR:  
I'm at a career crossroads at 23, contemplating between pursuing medicine and programming. I have years of mainly personal experience with programming, and have a strong passion for fitness and helping people with injuries. Thinking on shifting to become an Orthopedics Surgeon.

17qpwvv,Ideal Career after Environmental (Law) Master,"Hey,

  
I’m (30y/European) soon to finish my masters in (international / EU) environmental law. I will start my master thesis in the beginning of next year and I will have to decide on a topic in about a month. Ideally, I would like to use the thesis as preparation for the field I will be working in later. However, I don’t know yet what that should be. Things will probably develop quite dynamically, and it can be difficult to plan where one will end up job-wise, but I want to start in the right place. This is why I would like to ask for your insights and advice.

  
I have worked at least part time most of my life, but the different jobs have never been streamlined in a specific field (General Assistant in a Employer Branding Start Up, Working Student in a Data Scientist Department \[No actual programming skills, just excel etc.\], Internal Sales/Customer Service, Kindergarden, Law Firm Internships, various physical labor jobs). Before the masters I have studied German Business Law (Mixture of Economics/Business relevant legal fields). I will also have lived in 8 countries for at least 6 months, as it has always impacted me positively and become a personal measurement of a “good” life to experience new mindsets, environments, anything.

  
The kind of occupation I am looking for is one that offers a working routine which will not completely stay the same day in day out, financial stability, reasonable working hours. Furthermore, a career that allows mobility is desirable, since even though I will most likely settle down at some point, I prefer not being bound to just one country for multiple reasons. In that regard, the prospect of remote work seems great. While I feel like I have been capable for most “white collar” jobs, a reappearing knack in my life was the interest in optimizing processes to make things more efficient, or generally “better”. 

  
Currently, my short-term plan is to apply for a WTO internship (low chances) for next spring, and a EU Blue Book Traineeship (good chances) for the fall after to expand my resume and get a better feeling for what I want to do while experiencing interesting work environments. Nevertheless, I also want to start applying for long-term jobs soon and I would ideally already dedicate my thesis to that field. What do you think might be good options? One thing that I heard of is ESG, although I´m wary that it might be tailored to much into an accounting kind of direction. Would that be correct, or does it potentially offer much more? Another idea could be in the direction of emission reporting, as I was thinking it might be interesting to write about scope 3 emissions regulations, but again this field also seems potentially quite “dry”. Am I wrong about “accounting” in the environmental context being similar to regular accounting at for example a tax agency? I am not at all against working with data, but I want to at least work out insights of value and ideally transform them into actions. I feel like a consulting role might be great, but its hard to tell before i start with it.

  
Hope this was not too much blurry information. Sorry for my limited knowledge! I am grateful for any input!

17qphf3,What does a square peg do for work in a world of round holes?,"Ever since I graduated college, I've struggled to sustain a job. I've had several that I genuinely liked, and for the first couple years I performed well and got promoted quickly. Then I got bored and miserable, and I had to find something new. There have been other jobs where I only lasted a few months before being fired. I went through a 2 year period when I lost 5 jobs. At 45, I'm tired of starting over. 

Tried self-employment for about 10 years and loved the independence and challenge. But I had difficulty focusing on a direction for the business and never made enough money to support my family. I have gained a lot of experience and business sense in the 8 years since then, but my wife is very opposed to the idea of a new business, and I understand why. 

I worked in outside sales for 5 years, and I did moderately well. Customers loved me. Bosses wanted bigger gains, but I'm just not that aggressive. Quit because supply chain delays made it into a nightmare customer service job. I could go back to it for the right company. 

ADHD is a likely factor, as I was diagnosed at 16, but couldn't tolerate the ritalin. All of the symptoms fit. I don't consider it a ""disorder"" but more a set of evolutionary traits that don't fit in the modern workplace.

17qpgw0,MechE vs. Medicine? Are my experiences irrelevant?,"Hi r/careeradvice,  
I'm currently in my second year of college studying mechanical engineering, and I'm grappling with the idea of pursuing a career in medicine. Engineering has been a passion of mine since childhood, and it is something that I am really involved in - I'm on an engineering team at my university, and will be working this summer at SpaceX - it's pretty clear that this is my ""thing"".  
However, I've always had a strong desire to help people, and I believe that a career in medicine, possibly as a surgeon, could be incredibly fulfilling. I'm volunteering at a hospital this winter break to explore it further, and hopefully I will get the chance to speak to/shadow a couple of doctors/surgeons. I also think the idea of understanding the human body, and all of the fundamentals (bio, chem, etc.) that go into it is really cool.  
My dilemma arises from my diverse range of interests. I find rocket propulsion and GNC fascinating and that's why I chose to study mechanical engineering. Additionally, I'm intrigued by electrical engineering, computer science, and computational fields. I would love to apply machine learning and algorithms to areas like radiology and medical imaging. On top of all that, I'm drawn to the idea of becoming a surgeon because of the daily engagement and hands-on work it entails.  
I'm really at a crossroads, uncertain about the best course of action. If I applied to med school right out of undergrad, and took premed courses during my remaining undergrad years, I feel that all of my ECs (engineering team and internships) are somewhat irrelevant/pointless to med schools. Sure, working at SpaceX is cool, but how relevant is it to applying to med school?  
I have also considered completing my MechE degree, working as a rocket scientist for a few years, and then pursuing medical school. But is this a practical plan? Again, I face the same problem of my ""experiences"" (aerospace) being irrelevant to medicine, and how would I even go about getting the necessary pre-req coursework done?  
Also, even though I am interested in both MechE and EE/CS, I feel like I see more application of the latter to medicine, and am really interested in things like radiology - there is even a professor at my university who works on this, but would it make sense for me to work with him as a MechE major?  
In summary, I'm in a bit of a life-choices limbo, given my wide array of interests.

17qoalm,Thinking of going back to my old employer.,"I'll try to keep this simple and short.

I left my government job 8 months ago for another government job at the State level.

My old employer has a vacancy in the position that was above me and is basically begging me to apply for it. I left my old job mainly due to the toxic environment the guy who now left created and the pay was below what I should be making for the work I do.

My current job pays fair, really good benifits and is super flexible. I can work from home and create my schedule for the most part. It is part of the same retirement system as my old job so things just transfer thankfully. The current job is horribly understaffed and the work load is insane. The team I am on is supportive but we really are on our own for our respective positions. Salary is currently 63k.

Job that wants me back would be a supervisory role. I could jump back in and not miss a beat as I was basically doing the job before I left. Not a WFH job but I think I could argue working from home a day or two a week. The job has a lot more responsibilities and is definitely more work. It would be a 25 minute commute one way. Salary is 71K. 

Idk if I'm just getting cold feet and overwhelmed with my current job as i am still pretty new. I am with my dream agency but it's definitely not all roses and rainbows like I imagined. The flexibility is amazing especially with young kids. 

I'm tempted to apply for the job at the old job and make it clear I'd need more flexibility, my benefits up front and honestly 75K would be at least what I should ask for.

I've never negotiated these things before and not even sure if I should waste my breath because my experience is things are pretty set in stone with government. I am hoping someone can give me some thoughts or any experiences you have had when trying to make these decisions, especially if you worked government or left a job this quickly after starting?

I should note when I was at my previous job that I am thinking of going back to, in a different role, I was making 55k. Effectively leaving and coming back would make me at least 16k more a year. I just don't know if it's worth leaving a busy but flexible job. There is room to move up where I am at but that would be several years away.

17qnfj9,Got two verbal offers in the span of 2 days not sure how to handle it.,"So I've been interviewing at two starts up. Job A I've been interviewing at for the past two months went through four stages of interviews and after the final stage of the interview about a week and a half ago they told me they would get back to me by the end of the week. They never did and I continued to interview with Job B and they gave me a verbal offer at the beginning of the week after raising their initial compensation to match what I get paid now + bonuses. Once I got the verbal offer from Job B I let the recruiter know from Job A I got a verbal offer which seemed to expedite the process.   


In my head before I got the second offer I told myself I am most likely taking Job B unless Job A blew me out of the water in terms of compensation. Well they definitely did their offer was 35 percent higher than Job B and what I make now not even including bonuses. Even got the potential start date. Both jobs were aware throughout this process I was interviewing elsewhere. The issue is Job B is unaware I now have a verbal offer from Job A and I know there is no way they would be willing to match it based on the numbers I heard from the recruiter of what their limit was for this position. Job B called today just to let me know the offer should be coming soon and I didn't mention the verbal Offer from Job A. Not sure if I am handling this correctly my instinct is to wait until I get a written offer before informing Job B of the other offer because on the chance Job A offer doesn't materialize. I just don't want to burn bridges with Job B because they are under the impression I am going to sign the offer once I receive it.

I started out as an hourly entry level employee and have worked my way up essentially to a CEO type role, although my official title is General Manager.  The company is 50+ years old and was sold to a private equity in 2019 after being family owned and operated since its inception.  I have a great relationship with the private equity who owns us now, and they are very hands-off, allowing me to do my own thing.  This past year, I have exceeded almost all targets and goals put in front of me.  My next focus will be to grow top line revenue and expand into new markets in different states throughout the US.  At this point, I have become indispensable to the company and am the most tenured on the staff.  I answer to nobody above me in my role other than the PE who owns us.  I have been coached by a former CEO of a billion-dollar company for the past several months, who has told me he is surprised I have not been offered equity at this point.  We are currently an 8m company, and I have been here since we were a 1m company.  I make a 125k base and this year should get a 30k-50k bonus depending on how the rest of this year plays out.  I have aspirations to first get us to 25m and eventually get us to 50m at some point.  I would not be surprised if we were to be acquired by a bigger fish in our industry, although the PE has assured me they have no plans to sell our company for the foreseeable future.  So I know I have some time.  Equity ownership is a new territory for me, and I am not sure how much equity I should aim to negotiate/ask for?

That being said, I want to continue some role in early childhood education or ABA. I have a Bachelor’s in Psych. I DO NOT have a teaching license which seems to be a requirement for most jobs in ECE that actually offer decent pay. 

I would consider RBT/ABA, but the field hours are typically inconsistent and I tend to burn out. I found one opportunity, but seems like it won’t offer health benefits. I feel like I’m right between overqualified for the minimum wage jobs, but under qualified (licensure wise) for the higher paying jobs. Do you have any recommendations? Should I get an emergency teaching license? Follow the alt licensure route? Stick to RBT and suck it up? 

I want to go to school eventually (something education related), but I’m still paying back my loans from undergrad and I don’t want to go back to school until I’m debt free.

Joined a company in April, company went through a rebranding shortly after starting and to keep it short I really hate working here.

17qlpiy,Is it worth taking a 25% pay reduction to not work at a job you hate.,"I work in the healthcare field. Emergency basis. Stabilize patients and ship to a higher level of care. The system is broken and I usually can’t find anywhere to send my critically sick patients. On top of that I usually cannot even keep stable patients at the local facility because of staffing issues. High level intensity stress for 12 hrs. Headache when I drive home. I spend some of my days off in bed all day, dreading going back to work. I am irritable with my family and I don’t do any of my old hobbies. I have an offer to switch jobs. Much less stress but will work 4 more days a month. 7 days on and 7 days off. At my current job I sometimes work one off one and never get 7 off unless it’s vacation. This new job will have great health benefits, money of continuing education, and will qualify for student loan repayment. But will have approximately 25% pay reduction. Pay can also go up or down based on productivity and quality. I grew up poor and always dreamed of having a high paying job. As I’m getting older I realize money isn’t everything.

17qlmyh,I feel abused and taken for granted. do I wait it out for the “promotion”?,"7 months ago, I accepted a job offer / relocation to a new city where I know no one, to continue working for a company that I’ve been with for 6 years. Without getting too much into my job, the work involves live music operated by a very large corporation. 

Previous manager was fired so I took the ‘temporary’ role of “acting general manager” in an industry requires a wide array of unconventional hours, busy season is from sept-dec and workload lightens in the summer.

Stupidly, I agreed to keep p my pay the same because my housing situation was desperate (moved from a lower COL city, to a very high COL city) under the premise of “let’s see where this goes in 6 months and then we will promote you”

what I didn’t know, walking into this was that this would be the most challenging job site I’ve ever worked due to an abundance of intolerable reasons. 

I have zero support staff (should have an assistant manager) although my boss says we keep looking to hire — resulting in me having to do multiple jobs to keep the operation running, resulting in 14 hour days and 70 hour weeks. 

At my most recent one on one where I was told that in my 7 months here, I’ve generated the company $250k more than the past manager’s entire 2022 YTD…getting loads of praise…yet I just had to sell my vehicle because I couldn’t afford the payments anymore. 

I make 55k. After research, somewhat-similar competing jobs titles are starting at 72k. Told this to my boss and keep being told, “hang in there—it’s coming.” And “we have to make sacrifices to work in this industry, we’re lucky to have this job.”

I am so burnt out. I’m angry. I don’t even want to see the building because it makes me see red. I’ve noticed an uptick in alcohol consumption, and I overall just feel like crap. Averaging about 4 hours of sleep a night because my average day is 9am - midnight. 

I don’t regret moving to the city because I’ve met great friends and a partner. I think I would choose to stay here but I feel insanely overworked and underpaid with this looming “promise”’in the future. 

I USED to love my job—it’s very hard to get a foot into this industry, I’ve worked in for a decade. I don’t necessarily want to find something different. Should I play with leverage? Wait it out? Or am I just being stupid.",Secret-Special-6127,1,1.0,11,1699450083,2023-11-08 13:28:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17qlmyh/i_feel_abused_and_taken_for_granted_do_i_wait_it/,11,2023

17qla37,Career Problems as a Plumber,"I started a plumbing, apprenticeship at 29m. I worked really hard and was determined in my first few years my apprenticeship and was recognized for that and recruited into a union. In my first second and third year apprenticeship I saw that many people were getting hurt and injured with back and knee problems.  The last commercial job I worked on, I ended up having a terrible neck injury that had me in extreme amounts of pain for eight months. I also ended up working for the worst boss that I’ve ever had the misfortune of having to work for. I was looking for a way out, and I found a plumbing maintenance job in a hospital that allowed me to finish my fourth year there. I have currently been there for 10 years, and while I’m not bad at my job, I have not learned the skills that I need to call myself a real plumber in my opinion.  Recently, the experienced plumbers in my job have quit because of stress and to seek higher pay elsewhere.  I am in the same position of being overstressed in my job and somewhat under qualified. I want to get back into the field and learn because I do enjoy plumbing but, I have a journeyman ticket, I’m 40 years old, and I need to be taught again the same way a second year apprentice is taught. I originally took the job in plumbing maintenance to save my body but now it’s looking like I may have to get back into the field and risk my body in at 40. i’m really stuck on what to do since I already have my ticket and people out in the field would expect me to know what a journeyman should know, but I don’t.  I’m willing to, but I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard spot. My job doesn’t pay very well for a plumber, but I have health benefits, a pension, sick time, and many other benefits. The problem is my lack of knowledge and the increased amount of stress that has been put on this job that I don’t think I can handle anymore.

17qive7,Torn between pursuing fashion or completing my undergrad degree,"Hi. New Here. I’m a 19 (F) and I'm feeling lost and could use some advice. The story isn't much, but I don't know where to start. For context, I'm from South Africa.  
  
I have a strong interest in pursuing a career in fashion design, but unfortunately, my mother and grandmother are not supportive of my aspirations. I recently made the decision to drop out of university because I was feeling overwhelmed and unhappy studying a degree that I didn't have any passion for. As expected, they were not happy with my decision because they were not anticipating such an abrupt change in plans. I have always been a well-behaved and obedient child, which probably made this decision all the more surprising for them. They accused me of making this decision out of a desire to please my peers and to follow their lead. To provide some context, some of my friends had taken a gap year in 2022 to retake their exams and improve their grades to pursue their desired careers. Therefore, my parents assumed that I was following in my friends' footsteps by taking a year off, which was not the case.  
  
I explained to them that I needed to take a year off from school because I was exhausted. I personally hoped that by taking this time off, I would forget about my dream of becoming a fashion designer and feel refreshed enough to return to school. For the first six months, I was completely drained; mentally and physically. I felt like a zombie and spent most of my days cleaning, eating, and sleeping (probably recovering from last year’s burnout.) During the next six months, I realized that if I didn't apply to at least one fashion school, I would regret it. I didn't want to go back to my old degree program, which made me miserable. I applied to one school, not expecting much, but I got in. I also reapplied to my old degree program just to be safe because I can’t afford to take any more gap years.  
  
Today, I had a conversation with my mother about changing my degree and studying fashion. However, she, along with my grandmother, did not react positively to the news. It was a similar scenario to the one that occurred when I dropped out, but this time I decided to remain quiet and let them speak their minds until the situation eventually calmed down.  
  
I am seeking advice because listening to their comments regarding my situation is making me contemplate giving up on my dreams. I am almost at the finish line as I just need to apply for funding, but at the same time, I am also on the verge of giving up and going back to university. Their objection isn't about fashion itself, but rather they want me to pursue something financially stable and then pursue fashion later. I understand where they are coming from, but I want to do it the other way around. I want to pursue fashion first and if things don't work out within the fashion industry, I can give up on my dream and get a stable degree knowing that I tried my best. Ideally, If I would become successful in the fashion industry, then I would stay. I am aware that fashion is a risky career, but I want to give it a shot. I do not want to go back to university and complete my undergraduate degree because it made me extremely unhappy, but if I am unsuccessful in the fashion industry, I would not mind returning to university, knowing that I did my best to chase my dreams.  
  
My mother has decided to cut off my financial support unless I finish my undergraduate degree. Of course, this is a soft spot for me because I am completely dependent on her for financial assistance. I am worried because I applied for a bursary fund (to fund my fashion studies) and the organisation conducts interviews. However, I haven't received any response from them yet and I am concerned that I might miss the opportunity to attend an interview if they decide to call me due to me having no money to attend. During the last six months of this year, I tried to get a retail job as I planned to buy study materials like a sewing machine. However, it has been challenging to get a job with no retail experience. Despite this, I have been trying my best to secure a job. This entire situation is making me feel like I am being ungrateful for all my mother's efforts to provide me with an education for a better future but that is not the case. But how do I convince my mother and grandmother that I want to pursue fashion design? It doesn't matter how many times I tell them that my undergrad degree was making me feel miserable and it felt like I was wasting my time by constantly changing courses, they won't listen.  
  
Now I'm torn between pursuing fashion or completing my undergrad degree. If anyone who has been in a similar situation as me could provide advice or just anyone who can provide me with a bit of rational advice because it seems that I am thinking irrationally at the moment. I would be grateful for your advice.",Latter_Fact_7911,1,1.0,3,1699439750,2023-11-08 10:35:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17qive7/torn_between_pursuing_fashion_or_completing_my/,11,2023

17qh1nx,Australian Maths/Stats/Data/Research/Coding/ML,"Calling all Australian engineers, data scientists, ML engineers, statisticians, mathematicians, quants.

I’m a 24 yo data scientist with a stable job that will see me earning around $120,000+ within 5 years, but I find myself being bored at work. I went into data science after a maths and stats undergraduate followed by over a year working as a software developer. I made this move because I was just maintaining an ancient, uninspiring piece of enterprise software. I thought data science would offer me the chance to use my degree and let me do the stuff that I find exciting: machine learning, regressions, applied statistics, statistical/mathematical modelling, etc. Unfortunately after 2 years in my ‘data science’ role, I have spent less that 5% of my time doing that kind of work, and the majority of my time has been spent ingesting/collating horribly formatted spreadsheets and creating basic graphs. I don’t mind cleaning data but I rarely get to do exciting things with it after.

Looking on the internet, I get the impression that the majority of ‘data science’ roles are probably a lot like this in Australia - particularly since I don’t live in Sydney or Melbourne. Is that pessimistic?

It seems as though the work that interests me is more likely to come from research roles. Am I right to think that?

Under the common guidance that more/better skills will lead to more opportunities, I am considering going back to uni to pursue my honours in applied maths / stats and potentially a PhD. However, I’m concerned that my opportunities will be similar even if I relocate to a big city.

What further complicates things is that I don’t want to work for oil&gas, defence, advertising or betting websites. Am I asking too much?

I’m looking for interesting, inspiring work and I’d even considering changing career for it. Does this job exist out there somewhere?

17qguz1,Going through long term job hunting for third time in eight year career - how not to feel burnt,"I’m going through my third round of long term job hunting and I can’t do it anymore. To say I’m burnt out is an understatement. It’s impacted my mental and physical health. I’m 30, so the blow of feeling nowhere near established is hitting me really hard. This will be a detailed narrative, so take it or leave it FYI.

General milestones have never been easy for me. It took me 4 years to save for a car (couldn’t get job as a teen thanks to the 2009 recession), so I remember always scrambling to find transportation. I paid my way through college after working full-time while going to school full-time for 5 years. I didn’t have a dating or social life due to exhaustion. I was a commuter and transfer student, so I didn’t have a “traditional” college experience. It was some of the loneliest times of my life.  

During and after college, I worked in the entertainment industry as a film PA while side hustling in customer service jobs. It was unstable and left many employment gaps in my resume. I attempted to make some pivots to find stability, which included taking on assignments through a few temp agencies. Many of these “jobs” were bottom of the barrel in the sense that they had toxic leadership and little to no workflow systems in place. I experienced types of workplace bullying I naively thought didn’t happen in the 21st century. Overall, the employment gaps continued to widen and the lack of niche internships made it hard to find even the most entry-level of stable work. Recruiters and hiring managers were arguably more selective than they are today.

I finally had a break when I got hired for an admin role right before the pandemic hit. Though the benefits were great, the wage wasn’t. My boss had lied about a bonus pay, so I worked a side hustle in restaurant to make rent. I eventually lost this side hustle when lockdown hit, but still worked the admin job in office through the mandatory quarantine period. Between the declining working conditions and hostile behavior from my boss (ex. She followed my colleagues and I around the office to make sure we were staying 6 feet apart and retaliated by threatening my job security multiple times), I walked out. I worked another restaurant side hustle and was laid off a month later due to a COVID resurge. I lost 3 jobs in one year. I lived in a small city/state, so there were little to no resources to assist me, including a very broken unemployment system. I nearly went homeless twice and contemplated suicide.

Fast forward to the next year when I was hired for a freelance management role that was salaried. It ended brutally when I was physically assaulted by my boss (long story, not for today). 

Right after, I was hired for a full-time salaried position under an executive team who would call me names, swear at me, and humiliate me nearly every day for the 6 months I lasted. Due to the build up of everything that happened in such a short time, I had a nervous breakdown that lasted for 7 months.

Now, I’m working part time at a restaurant going on almost year two to find a salaried replacement. Nothing is worse than feeling like you’re finding upward mobility, only to be thrown from grace and lose everything. I’m living with my parents, and I’m so ashamed. They’re losing patience with my career and financial instability.

17qf6jm,Things I can do on the side as an emergency operator/dispatcher?,"I'm about to finish training and join the team this month. Shifts are varied, morning, evening or nights, including holidays. Not mad about working big holidays or nights because I get paid more. However, because the shifts will be different month-to-month, I cannot commit to a second job.

I used to be a cook but I'm going away because hospitality is a terrible field to work in where I live. I've distanced myself with almost everyone I know in the industry, so I don't think I can find someone to give me odd hours for weddings etc (or want to).

It will be very difficult to stick to something when I work 3 nights and one evening on a week for example. If I only had one type of shift like evenings I could stick to finding a morning job, for example, but it's not possible.

What are some things I can do at my own pace whenever I'm off work to make some extra money?

17qdwgv,What career paths involve self-research and/or coaching/teaching?,"I’ve worked in mobile sales for all of my adult life. I’m currently 28 with a 3 year old and purchased a home with his mother, my fiancée. 

I’ve just come to realize, well truly long ago, that sales is not for me. I get no enjoyment, fulfillment or anything out of it. I feel like I’m wasting away my life but can’t just up and leave because I can’t find another entry level job with the same pay. 

I know the one thing I enjoy the most in life is learning. My late grandmother always told me, “If you don’t learn at least one new thing a day, it’s a wasted day.” I lived by that motto for so long and I truly enjoy furthering my education. School always came easy for me and I always went out of my way to learn more than what the teacher could teach us. 

During my senior year, I went to school 730AM to 830AM and worked a full time job at Best Buy after school. I did attend college for a semester, but I was already accustomed to work life and having my own income. From college, I started commission based jobs and I’ve made $25-$30 my whole life. Unfortunately, I spent it as fast as I made it and don’t have much saved up. Less than $5,000. 

I always dreamed of being a teacher, I want to feel like I have a positive impact in life. Whether that be furthering discovery or teaching young adults/teenagers how to set themselves up for success. I know.. a bit ironic as I didn’t even set myself up for success. But that’s why I want to help others.  I shied away from this dream my junior year when my history teacher told me it wasn’t worth it. She had been teaching for many years and, looking back now, was probably just burnt out. She complained of the forced curriculum and severe lack of pay.

What career paths do you guys enjoy that incorporate consistent learning, self-research, self-education? I worry to go back to school because I had to fork out nearly $10,000 in debt for just a semester. It set me back quite a bit and I couldn’t imagine going $60-80k in debt and ending up not enjoying or utilizing my degree.",Sea_Bandicoot2310,1,1.0,0,1699418119,2023-11-08 04:35:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17qdwgv/what_career_paths_involve_selfresearch_andor/,11,2023

Complicated work background makes me feel I shouldn't reject it, unsure what to do!","for some background, I have a BSW, MSW and not much experience in social work field outside of internships due to graduating undergrad during covid and the struggle with the job search and having gaps in employment due to health issues. For these reasons alone, I feel more than others that I need to just take a job that is offered to me because I should be lucky to be offered anything due to lack of a lot of post-grad experience.  
The job was a bachelor level position, it is in a residential SUD treatment center completing assessments, treatment plans, and case management, the interview was great and got along well with the employees, it seemed like a dream! Then I got the offer: $15.75 an hour. I was crushed. I still haven't replied to the email. I don't know what to do!  
But, since moving (moved back home with family due to sudden ended engagement) I have been having FAR MORE success with getting job interviews compared to where I lived before with my ex where I got barely any. Also making a decent amount (at LEAST 40K) would help me pay off my credit card debt I accrued during Grad school.  
Should I....  
A) reject offer and lose opportunity to do a job I would like and would look good on my resume for long term career goals  
B) Accept offer and panic apply to other jobs and hope I get another offer before this one starts  
C) accept job and plan to stay a year even if the pay sucks to build my resume to show some reliability on my resume (remember I said its spotty from resume gaps due to life events)  
  
I would love any guidance because I feel SO LOST and am stuck in a circle of over-thinking.

17q9l4t,Side step or promotion? Restructure looming,"My manager said he is looking to move me to another team as a secondment (no pay rise i presume) because I came back from manteirty leave and I’m doing very random tasks (they don’t have much work for me). The organisation is currently going through a reorganisation so there is a small risk I could be let go at the end of it. I know conversations were happening in the background (with my manager and managers from other teams) however I have not heard anything since last week about the opportunity. My manager did say the opportunity in the other team is still available.
I noticed that in his KPI’s he’s got a ‘retention’ kpi and I have now just realised he likely did not want me to quit but instead shift me to another team. That would be a side step (not a promotion… I’m at a point where I should be promoted as I’ve already proved myself over the years). 

I found another opportunity in the organisationthat I would be interested in applying for. Should I tell my manager i plan to go for the position especially if the first opportunity falls through ? If I apply for this other role And not tell him, he will find out. The opportunity would be a promotion, having said that I don’t feel confident I’d get the role though as they listed that they want particular experience in business which I don’t have. However I tick all the other boxes. 

I’m unsure what to do. I feel like I shouldn’t be having career development discussions when there is a restructure looming. I only say that because I don’t want my two-up manager to think, ‘oh she’s going to get another job anyway, let’s get rid of her’

17q93lx,Is it to late for me?,"Well, to begin, I'm 32 years old. I feel like I've wasted a large portion of my life doing jobs to just get by and pay rent/bills. When I was a teen in school and they had career days, I never knew what I wanted. 

Up until recently I have realized what I have a high interest in, but I'm not even sure how to get into a field. 

I dropped out of high-school in my final year (I'd rather not explain why) I never got my ged but I have some great qualities and achievements. I've owned my own business, I was in management at Dominos for 2 years and won GM Rookie of The Year from Corporate. 

The downside is what really interests me, isn't what I've been doing for my ""career path""  

I've been absolutely loving caring for my reptiles and fish. (6 fish tanks and 5 reptile tanks) and I absolutely love dinosaurs, fossils and ancient animal life. I've also really wanted to be a paleontologist but I feel like I couldn't do it 😕  (partially because I don't know how to get into the field..)

I'm not sure what fields could be based around these above things. I've tried to apply as a free volunteer at the national aquarium, but someone with more experience was picked. I'm not sure how to gain more experience and knowledge. I'm just hoping it isn't to late to get into a career I love and am passionate about. I know I probably have to get my GED first. 

Any suggestions? How would one approach getting into a career with animals? I can't go to a college.

I work as a project manager in the pharmaceutical industry, we're going through some changes and it's looking like a good opportunity to leave. I've been with the company for a couple years now. Work/life balance is decent, but career growth is halted for the next few years. Currently on site everyday with minimal commute time. 3 weeks vacay, DCPP (4% employer, 3% own), mediocre benefits, potential for bonus. 

I have the opportunity to accept a 2 year contract project manager position in the public energy sector for ~17K more pay. Work/life balance seems better, commute means getting to Toronto 2x a week. Contract so no DCPP, pay into benefits, no bonus. Potential permanent position within 1 year. 

Accounting for the differences between the 2 jobs, gas, Benefits, RRSP/DCPP contributions, I'd still be up 10K jumping ship.

My role is essentially Apprentice ii, the next promotion would be into a junior role. The only reason i know i wont be promoted further is because im in graduate school, limiting the on the job training i can recieve. BUT im still getting some level of training (learned the basics of a new specialty today even) and am doing work beyond my position if only by a little.

Despite all of that, i recently discovered that out of all the people in my role im payed the least. Even the person who was hired a few months ago, that i trained, and only does the most bare minimum grunt work, is payed more than me. I won't lie, I'm fucking furious, but i also know my boss is a bit of an amateur manipulator and frankly someone who obviously knows the bare minimum of the trade and lies to hype himself up.

17q8upp,Bad management,"Im needing advice for a contractor role im in. Just completed a project with a horrible manager with no previous APS experience. The whole team is contracting and we were all working on a time sensitive project. This manager micromanaged and gave no support throughout. All the advice they actually worked against the team because they weren’t qualified for the role. 

The whole team started at different times and this manager who started first did no prep work to help the team. But when the team muddled their way through and things went wrong, placed the blame on the team and was passive aggressive. Most of the team did long hours due to approved overtime but the manager did not do anywhere close to what the team did. 

My contract is finishing over the next few months and have offers at other departments. Do I raise the issues I’ve seen with this manager so upper management is aware? Or do I keep quiet and not rock the boat and possibly be branded a troublemaker which could follow me to other jobs? 

I feel like it wasn’t fair that this person skated through on other people’s work and was very toxic (backstabbing colleagues, passive aggressive, no help/direction = negative environment). I feel like I should protect my peace and draw a line under this experience but my sense of fairness is niggling at me about this whole situation.

17q89yl,"30F hit career rock bottom, is my situation salvageable or am I unhirable?","I'll try to keep things as brief as possible, but long story short, I am a 30 year old woman who has been working full-time in my field for about 11 years. I was diagnosed with ASD and ADHD in my late teens and I have always had challenges with interpersonal relationships, emotional regulation, and time management, but I got a STEM degree from a top 10 University and published 3 first-author peer reviewed papers before taking my first industry job at my mentor's start up. It was a great company where I was able to be super hands-on taking on a lot of really interesting problems both technical and strategic. The entire 11 person company was full of introverted, friendly nerds and even though there was major crunch time periods, I always felt like I had the freedom and the support to excel at anything I wanted to do. I stayed for 4.5 years before we were acquired and half the company got laid-off. 

After that, I've spent the last 5 years floundering in every corporate and start up job I've had. I stayed at 1 company for 3 years under a sexist manager who pawned all his work off on me. I left for a more start up culture in the tech industry only to get in an argument with the CEO, get placed on a PIP, and then quit after 6 months. After a few months of unemployment, I found a job at a mid-sized company that started off great until my manager and I started having personality conflicts, again landing me on a PIP, and quitting after only 1 year. 

At this point, I am feeling like I might be unemployable. I know that I am decently smart and capable, but I don't know how to be successful in traditional corporate roles where you have to play politics, market yourself, and generally be a consistent worker. I feel like I have the potential to be reasonably successful in my field and I've put a lot of time and effort into working on myself, but at this point, is my resumé completely radioactive?

17q8929,How do I handle a coworker who acts like a manager?,"To give a bit of backstory, we’re both very grown adults, but this person is about 20 years older than me. This person has also been at my current company about 10 years longer than me. Important note: we are in different departments and this employee is not a manager or supervisor.

At my workplace, people often leave at different times, and there’s usually about 3-4 of us left on our floor of the office at the end of the day. This employee will go around the floor 15-20 minutes before our office closes and loudly tells everyone on our floor to “wrap it up!” and “let’s go!”. Another important note, she’s also not the one that locks the building up or sets the security systems. That’s someone on a different floor’s responsibility. She will stand impatiently and wait at the time clock for every person to leave before she clocks out. It pressures everyone because oftentimes, we’re all working on something that can’t just be stopped when she wants.

The only responsibilities we have when leaving are to turn our computers and lights off. If this employee does randomly choose to give up and actually just go clock out, she will always tell me in particular, in a very frustrated/tired tone, “don’t forget to turn off your computer or your lights.” Now this is strange to me. Like I said, I’m a very grown educated, skilled, tenured adult who has never left anything on in my office, but this person oftentimes leaves heaters and other devices running in her office on accident. The irony of that baffles me. I have actually managed retail stores before, being responsible for far more than cutting a computer off or turning a light out. The infantilization is demeaning. I’m sure she takes my “uh-huh” as someone being passive in this situation, but I’m quite honestly at a loss for words in that situation because who acts like that?

What do you say (professionally) to someone like this to make them realize they’re talking to capable grown adults? Though we don’t work in the same department, we do have to talk to each other, and I’m not trying to cause a weird office drama.",ImpendingBan,8,1.0,6,1699400907,2023-11-07 23:48:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17q8929/how_do_i_handle_a_coworker_who_acts_like_a_manager/,11,2023
17q759y,I (21F) Want to Work Everywhere,"Hey everyone, I am in a bit of a tough situation!

  
This is so long because it's also me organizing my thoughts on all of this. Sorry for the novel! Putting my TLDR at the beginning

  
\*\*\*\*TLDR; I have a career in an industry I love set up for me after I graduate college in the spring. I have a couple of other careers I think I would enjoy as well. Do I need to stick with one for a good few years to build ""credit"" that allows me to travel or can I stay for just enough time to transition from school life to work life and then start pursuing other things I'm passionate about?  
I am a senior in college and am on track to soon get my English BA with a certificate in Editing and Publishing and begin my career in the publishing industry. I love it! I think I would really, really love that career for many reasons, hence why I chose to be an English major.

  
However, there are a couple of jobs/careers that I also really believe I would enjoy and honestly, I want to actually do them as well. The most important ones to me are being a flight attendant and joining the Peace Corps, or just helping in places that desperately need it.

  
I have always loved traveling. I am incredibly privileged to have been able to fly on two international vacations with my parents and older sibling growing up. Contrary to like, almost the entire population, my favorite part was the airport experience and flight. I absolutely loved being in an aircraft filled with people who were going to the same place for either the same or completely different reasons. It just gave me so much to think about! I took one more flight with a group for a school trip before I turned 18, but after that, I got to experience the massive joy of flying by myself. (I should note that by this time, I had a full-time summer labor job that paid me WELL, and living with my parents in the summer while I worked during my college years has given me the opportunity to do these things!) Anyway, stepping into the airport and just being able to feel the excitement and wonder of people waiting at various gates to go to wildly different locations, I loved the energy. I've flown by myself multiple times a year since then, I even had a meet-cute where I sat next to a guy on my way home who I thought was attractive and we ended up talking the entire flight. He then asked for my number and we went on a date! It went well, and if I were emotionally available and he wasn't in a completely different stage in life, it probably would have worked out. Overall, I've had a ton of good experiences and was never bothered by the bad. I want to be a flight attendant. I want to be part of people's journeys and make it as special and magical as it can be. I'm not afraid of respectfully and professionally sticking up for myself in situations where it's needed, so I'm not really worried about insufferable people. I know not every person is flying for a good reason, so I also would like to provide people with compassion and care during those times. The universe knows having to pay for a flight you weren't expecting or didn't want to purchase sucks and can really make you act up, so I get it. I want it so bad, but not for my entire life.

  
For the next one, I haven't considered it as a job or career but rather a week or two-long volunteer excursion I could eventually find time for. Now I'm considering it long-term. I want to go somewhere in the world and provide humanitarian aid. I have always wanted to. When I was 13/14 we got Global Leadership Adventures brochures sent to my home. They basically just detailed a bunch of volunteer abroad opportunities for teens and I begged my parents to let me go. They didn't, which is understandable and fine, but it just shows how long I have thought about it. As of recently--you all have seen it--everywhere in the world there is so much suffering and destruction, and not just in places from the news. And I get to sit here in my city apartment and go to school to land myself a career that will set me up for life if I let it. If there's an emergency, it will be handled efficiently and thoroughly without much worry about funds or discrimination or something physically holding me back. Nothing changes in my day-to-day life whenever there's another news story of a group of people being targets of violence. There are places in such poverty and in need of humanitarian aid and I haven't done anything about it other than donate what I can (which at the moment is not much), educate those around me and vote. I recently had an argument with my dad and it ended up with me in a borderline breakdown of babbling like 'Why do people die when I get to have fun every day?' and 'Why does war have to be the answer?' and all that. I still feel that way, but I was REALLY feeling it that night. When I got back to my apartment, my mom texted me a link to the Peace Corps and said, ""I feel your passion and empathy for the human race. I hear you when you say you aren’t sure what you want to do with your degree after graduation. Maybe this is something you could think about. You want to travel, see the world and this way you can give back."" Since then(about two weeks) it is almost all I can think about. I want to do this so, so bad but I feel I shouldn't do it or I should wait. I worry if I wait, I'll never get to it. I worry that every time an opportunity comes up, I'll still feel like I have to 'wait' and all of a sudden I won't be physically able to anymore and I'll regret it. I also feel if I do it too young, it could somehow mess up the chance for me to prosper in my end career(publishing industry). I don't know how competitive it is. Will my GPA and degree be enough if I take a break? I am completely at a crossroads with this because my friends all have one career they want and no others, so they don't really know. I dont know anybody with diverse career, and I also don't want it to look bad that I jump careers. 

  
I just want to do it all! Help! What is the best way to go about this?

17q6n5d,I got pushed into a manager job. What should I do?,"I’ll try not to to ramble but I (28m) have been the acting manager of communications for a large organization since the summer. My old manager quit and I got pushed into the position. Before, our team was three people. Now, we are two. My only other team member has been out sick since last week. That leaves only me to meet the comms needs of the entire organization. It is starting to feel a little overwhelming. I’m thinking of changing jobs. 

Some other things, I applied for the actual manager job about a month ago. So far, I have heard nothing. Internally, I hear hr is understaffed, but this is dragging on now. 

Also, the organization represents a specific group of people of colour. I am white. I have gotten some shit for this. Most of it is pretty subtle, once it was quite overt. I feel like I am taking up space as a white guy and that is uncomfortable. Ideally, the people who the organization represents would be reflected internally.

17q64s8,"How do I effectively communicate the challenges I've been facing at work without being written off as just ""making excuses?""","For context I work as a service writter for a rapidly expanding repair business. Our shop in particular has had significant challenges over the last few months. It started with having our production cut 50% in the month of August, and two weeks in September due to having a signifigant piece of equipment replaced. (We had two, but with one down, that left us with only one operating.)  This left us with a signifigant back log of work. 
Then at the end of September our best writer was promoted to a different shop with one week notice.  At this time I became the most experienced writer and took on the high profile account this person left.  I had a week of PTO scheduled middle of October, and contracted Covid on my way back.  I missed two additional days and then returned to work at significantly reduced capacity because I was still very sick.  

While I was out they assigned my work to a new person who had no understanding of the processes required to close files.  So the workload I came back to was a full workload, plus fixing and completing all of the work from the previous week and a half that had been done very wrong.  There were lots of angry emails about the overdue billing from corporate, so that was my focus.  It took a week and a half to come out of that hole.   Then comes beginning of November I'm almost feeling better from covid, but I somehow come down with the flu.  I havent missed any additional time, but I am working with a 102 degree fever and I'm miserable.   This job is impossible to do well at anything less than 100% productivity. In addition to my being out, we've had one of three techs out multiple times due to illness, and another writer (there are three of us total) out for a week sick. 
There is no ""backup"" built in to this business model. If we're short on staff we just have to figure it out- which in my opinion is the real problem.  

I'm going in to a weekly meeting regarding this high profile account I took over, and I know I'm going to be reamed for the state of things.   I care about this job and the quality of my work.   However, one of upper management's favorite phrases is ""that sounds like excuses.""  

I have not missed any other time due to being sick in over a year and then it was one day when I had shingles. (I'm 35, it was an unusual case.)  

How can I communicate better in this meeting , so as not to be ""giving excuses?"" Or how can I respond if that feed back is given.  While I am very intelligent, verbal communication has always been a challenge for me, and I often receive the feed back from leaders that I am too direct.  Not sure if its relevant but I am female and less than 5% of non administrative rolls in the company are held by women.  All leaders are male.

17q5pra,How to address interview questions about leaving a job due to toxic environment and bankruptcy?,"Hello, thanks in advance for the advice. 

I am looking to leave my current role ASAP, even though I've only been with the company for 8 months. 

Reasons why:
* toxic coworker who bullied and harrassed me to the point that all communications are filtered through my manager; the coworker was not fired or disciplined in any meaningful way.
* our parent company has filed for bankruptcy and has laid off the entire workforce in another city.
* brand new CEO is inexperienced and being influenced by Board members to make decisions based on finances, and not based on the reality of our project.
* I expect to be laid off anyway by the end of the year.
* my manager may also leave (of their own accord or get canned), and they are the only person I want to continue working with.
* my job duties have not actually been what I expected or was promised in the interview.
* the job has been terrible for my mental health. For the first time in 7 years, I have had panic attacks due to my job. 
* I am being expected to perform at a level far exceeding my experience level.

That afternoon, I emailed the hiring manager (let's call him Tom) a thank you email.  He responded before end of day, ""Thank you I will keep 'Daniel' advised of our next steps""

""Daniel"" is the recruiter from the staffing agency who posted the position and conducted my initial phone interview, then scheduled the in-person interview.

The following Wednesday, October 25th I hadn't heard anything, so I emailed Daniel, ""I wanted to express my continued interest in the role at \[company\] and inquire about the status of my application.  I feel that Tom and I had a productive conversation on Friday that reinforced my enthusiasm for the position.    
Could you please share any updates or insights on the decision timeline? Your response would be greatly appreciated.

""I have been excited to give you feedback. I requested an answer from Will and Tom several days ago but nothing. This morning Tom assured me he would have feedback and an answer for you today. If the answer is yes, how quickly can you start?""

('Will' is another higher-up in the company who I have not interviewed with or spoken to, but I assume is part of the decision process.  He was CC'd on my interview invite but did not attend the interview)

I responded with a thanks and some information about starting dates.

I didn't hear anything by Wednesday, November 1st, so I emailed again asking if he had received any feedback.  I got a response almost immediately (within minutes), ""I just spoke with him. They are interested in hiring you, but will need some time before giving you a strong offer. I will let you know as soon as that happens. Thank you again for your patience and I look forward to working with you.""

I responded back, ""Thanks for the update. I'm excited to hear that they're interested in bringing me on board. I'm more than willing to wait for this opportunity, but the delay may change the possible start dates that I gave you earlier.  I want to make sure to give an adequate notice period to my current employer. Could you please keep me posted on the expected timeline for the offer? It will help me plan accordingly.

To preface I'd like to provide some background into my time with my current company. 

* Month 1-6. I worked as a procurement admin (the goal being to learn the product before transitioning into a sales role).

* Month 6-24. I was re-assigned to a sales role to oversee all admin aspects of a launch in a new market (this included handling everything from logistics, and scheduling to sales admin and specification support. While in this role I displayed some initiative by learning the ins and outs of our ERP system and constantly making minor/major improvements to existing processes. During my time in this role the launch was a success and as business developed the workload increased to the point where additional staff members were required. I established some strong working relationships and was seen unofficially as the 'team lead'. (I'm fully aware this means nothing - but documentation has been issued throughout the company referring to me as such - it just had 0 impact in terms of my renumeration package).

* Month 24-36. Following the departure of the companies project lead I was asked if I'd be interested in filling the role (we had a new operations director at the time who seemed impressed with my initiative and interest in the company). My first project was the implementation of a CRM system for the company. I was successful in this task, and the operations director assigned me a series of projects to cover my next 1/2 years. (My new role was only recognized in the form of a new title following the successful implementation of this CRM system)


* Month 36 - Present. I continued to work on projects both assigned to me and ones I chose for myself. I was rewarded for my efforts by the operations director and was given a clear path of progression within the company. Then about a month ago, this director took me for a cup of coffee and told me he was leaving the company (his own choice). I was handed over his workload and advised by the MD not to apply for his role (which was now open) as I wasn't ready for it. I continued to work on the projects I had been assigned and the ones I had inherited from the operations director - with one project being the focus, and I was making good headway until today, out of the blue, the MD instructed me to call another individual in the company who told me to pause my focus project until further notice. I was given no reason for this pause, and found it quite embarressing to suddenly halt a project I had been working closely on that by all appearances was set for a successful launch within the next month. 

My question is - should I be concerned? My wife and I have just had our first child - and given how odd my progression has been in this company outside of my time under this one operations director - I am worried that none of the progression I've made is recognized by any of the remaining leaders. Many of whom appear to be unsure of my responsabilities - many of which remain from my previous roles.",TF-Brick,1,1.0,0,1699384484,2023-11-07 19:14:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17q1x20/should_i_be_worried/,11,2023
17q1sr2,Not sure what to do with my life/career. Need some guidance!,"Well, to begin, I'm 32 years old. I feel like I've wasted a large portion of my life doing jobs to just get by and pay rent/bills. When I was a teen in school and they had career days, I never knew what I wanted. 

Up until recently I have realized what I have a high interest in, but I'm not even sure how to get into a field. 

I dropped out of high-school in my final year (I'd rather not explain why) I never got my ged but I have some great qualities and achievements. I've owned my own business, I was in management at Dominos for 2 years and won GM Rookie of The Year from Corporate. 

The downside is what really interests me, isn't what I've been doing for my ""career path""  

I've been absolutely loving caring for my reptiles and fish. (6 fish tanks and 5 reptile tanks) and I absolutely love dinosaurs, fossils and ancient animal life. 

I'm not sure what fields could be based around these above things. I've tried to apply as a free volunteer at the national aquarium, but someone with more experience was picked. I'm not sure how to gain more experience and knowledge. I'm just hoping it isn't to late to get into a career I love and am passionate about. I know I probably have to get my GED first. 

Any suggestions? How would one approach getting into a career with animals? I can't go to a college.

17q0oyp,Marriott/Ritz-Carlton job offer,"I recently got offered a sales manager position at a Ritz-Carlton property. I have adjacent experience, but not direct hotel sales experience and definitely got a low ball offer. 

For the first time in my career, I pushed back,  but also realized the director basically lied to me. She offered a salary that was too low based on my state’s minimum wage. When I asked if I misunderstood and that it was actually a hourly position, she responded that no, it was salaried and she “got authorization” to increase the salary to a couple hundred dollars over what would be legal for an annual salary. The offer is also not exactly what I was hoping for, but there is the potential to earn more. 

I am really interested in this position, because I think there is room for growth, but it put a bad taste in my mouth to have my potential new boss lie, unless she was unaware, but that doesn’t seem likely.

17q0ame,People in tech management jobs: is a PhD a bonus?,"Hi all, 

I am looking for some advice for people who have a few year of experience working in high tech.

I am in the middle of an unfulfilling PhD and I am in a constant debate whether I should push through it or just find a regular job.

By now it's clear to me that I am not so much into research and the project has gone into a direction I have zero interest in. My work environment is nice, and my supervisor believes I will be able to graduate the program (I think he is overly optimistic or just doesn't care).

When I discuss my thoughts to give up the PhD with my peers and superiors, they all seem to disagree with this decision. They mention that it is very important if you want to climb in higher management positions 20 or 30 years from now. But almost none of them has actual experience in industry and they have spent most of their life in university or research centers.

Unfortunately I am in a bubble, and don't have many contacts with people who work in industry. This is why I hope to find some input here.

17q02an,Feeling lost and overwhelmed. How do I choose a career path that I will stick to?,"Hello, I am a 31M who has worked in retail and dropped out of college twice. My first time in college I switched my major from Electrical Engineering to Entrepreneurship. I eventually left due to mental health reasons in the second semester of my sophomore year.  
  
I worked in retail in various positions and places for 5 years or so before being given the opportunity to live with family rent free and attend college once again. This time I was pursuing a degree in Accounting. At this point I'm working full time while also attending school full time. I few semesters go by and I start to panic about my choices and if accounting is really for me or if I just chose it because it was a safe option. I leave school for the second time, move and begin working for another retail company.  
  
A few years go buy and a family member offers to let me stay with them while I sort out a new career or go back to school. I have a hard time finding anything interesting or accessible to me which leads me back into another retail job that I do not enjoy.  
  
I am m getting to the point where I want to settle into something and start building my life. I just have so many interests, and those interests are often changing or fleeting (I get hyperfocused on something and then burnt out on, rinse and repeat). If I were to go back to school, I think that I would want to pursue something in wildlife biology and conservation. The only thing that I know I truly enjoy is organizing things and problem solving within that realm. I have mild interests right now in cooking, wildlife conservation, and logistics.

17pzvyh,My starting salary is significantly lower than the starting salary for the team now. Can I request a salary adjustment?,"

I apologize in advance if this is really long I just need the detail in here to make it all make sense. 

I am about to have my yearly review with my boss this week and I am looking for a salary adjustment but I am not exactly sure if what I am planning to present to him is a valid way to receive an adjustment. 

For some background: I started with my company in 2018, at the time my team was just 2 people (me and one other person) and the team was a completely new team to the company. The team was in a trial period and because of that I was offered a very low starting salary which I accepted because the company is an amazing one to work for in my industry and I saw the potential in this position if the team passed the trial period. Its probably also important to note the person who was on the team with me when it started quit after a year so I am the only person on the team who worked for it with this low starting salary. 

Within the first 3 years I single handily guided my team through the trial period and got the team to an established one and mandatory on all projects at our company. I wrote all training material for my team and new hires and worked with other teams to draft and execute all current workflow standards for our team and how we currently run our work on projects. 

Now that our team is established we have hired many more people on and I became the manager of the team and received a promotion for this title based off my starting salary in 2018. 

The current starting salary for my team now is actually about 3-5k less than the salary I received for my management position when the team was removed from its trial period and we started growing the team and hiring people on. I have received some small yearly raises since getting that title 2.5 years ago so I am currently only making about 6-9k more than our starting salary for someone with zero experience. My management position requires years of experience and extensive knowledge of the programs our company uses to be performed properly, which these starting members cannot possibly have and never do as it is a very specific and not common job. My boss has flat out admitted that he cannot imagine if I left because I am the only person in the company with the knowledge and experience I have for this specific team/role. 

Is it valid for me to explain to my boss that I would be making around 30k more if I had been hired on at the current starting salary and received my management promotion from there? If I was to change roles (which I’ve received offers from other teams in the company many times) and one of my team members took on my role and received the promotion I received that is what they would be making, but because I started with the team when it was brand new and started with such a low salary I am making significantly less then I could be/what they would be.

My boss has always been very pro “you take on more work you get more money” and not very pro “I want more money because my experience and current work deserves that.” But my current workload is maxed out, I do not have the time to take on more work for a raise. On top of managing my entire team and all the other management work I am expected to do, I currently have the most projects out of anyone on my team because my boss requests I take “the hard ones” because I am by far the most experienced. 

I truly do love my job and I am extremely proud of myself for growing my team to the point it is at, but I am extremely disheartened by the fact I make only a few thousand more then the people reporting to me and the people with far less experience. I spend about half my day walking these people through how to even do the job seeing that it is so specific and no one comes in knowing these specifics just having done a semi similar job in the past qualifies you for it because it wouldn’t be possible to expect this hyper specific experience from someone. Because of this I just want a salary adjustment to 1. Reflect the experience and workload I have, but 2. Because I find it extremely unfair that just because I started when the salary was significantly lower I receive promotions based off that salary while everyone else on the team started close to my promotion salary and now receive promotions/raises based off the higher salary. 

Is this an appropriate reason to argue a salary adjustment? I feel that it is, but I have never had this happen to me at a job before so I am questioning myself.",x-trekk,8,0.8999999761581421,16,1699379160,2023-11-07 17:46:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17pzvyh/my_starting_salary_is_significantly_lower_than/,11,2023

17pyr61,Not sure what I’m looking for,"I’m not really sure what I’m looking for here but any advice would be appreciated. Apologies in advance if this gets long, I am just having one of those days lol. 

I’m 25 with a bachelors in informatics (concentration of cyber security) and a minor in comp sci and I am a project manager at a technical services company. I sort of stumbled my way into this job. I was hired as a contracted project coordinator for this company right out of college and was in that role for about a year and a half. In July 2022 I was presented with the opportunity to be promoted to a PM and I’d be hired full time. I accepted and immediately moved into my new role even though my title was still project coordinator and I was still contracted. Long story short: it was like pulling teeth to get my company to hire me full time. I had to get an offer from another company to get my company to agree and sign all the necessary paperwork. It took 5 months for all of this to get resolved. I kick myself every day for not just taking the other job at the other company but hindsight is 20/20. 

I don’t *hate* my job but I definitely don’t love it. I am very respected within my company (even coined the nickname “boss jr.” my boss being “the boss”. I have become her right hand woman of the sorts). I have one of the most profitable contracts within my team. All of this but I just feel so…unfulfilled. I definitely didn’t see myself becoming a PM and I don’t necessarily want to be in this role forever. I don’t have my PMP and I don’t have the money right now to take the test (my company won’t cover this. I’ve asked). I don’t have the certs for information security (where I want to be). I feel like I don’t have enough experience to get a PM job at a different company, and a PC role won’t pay me enough. My favorite part of my current job is working in excel combing through spreadsheets for billing, forecasting, etc. I LOVE excel and I look forward to my monthly billing activities. I’m not sure what I could do with this skill/interest though. What I don’t like is being the sole-decision maker. I don’t really like being customer facing all the time. I’m more of a “behind the scenes” gal. 

Should also note that this has been a fully remote job since I’ve started and I don’t drive either. I have some anxiety about going back into an office (if I ever had to do that) but I know id get over it eventually. Since I don’t drive, id have to rely on my partner to drive me and pick me up from work everyday. He said he doesn’t care and he will do it but I still feel bad about it. I try to limit my job searches to remote or hybrid but those types of jobs seem to be disappearing. 

I just feel really lost and I’m not sure what to do.",savingsydney,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1699376203,2023-11-07 16:56:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17pyr61/not_sure_what_im_looking_for/,11,2023
17pymh9,What would you do if you were in my shoes? (take a risk or play safe),"Hi everyone.  
   
I am glad I've found this subreddit. I am currently struggling with a crucial decision, and maybe, in some context, some of you could share valuable POV for my decision-making process.  
   
I am a 29-year-old female who comes from nothing. I had no parents and many brothers. We were lucky to have been raised by wonderful family members who assumed the role of our absent parents.  
   
The thing is, I am currently having a hard time deciding what should be my next step. Just to be clear, it is not about having some pressure to change; I just believe that it is what I want. However, making a decision seems harder than ever.  
   
In 2020 and 2021, I was accepted at Cambridge. Due to my inability to secure funding, I could not enrol. I am from a South American country, and last year I got a job offer in Germany. My plan before accepting that offer was to keep fighting for scholarships or get a loan. However, the job seemed like a bigger risk, and I went for it. Most of the great things in my life have happened because I have taken such risks.  
   
But things are different now. I would like to work in this position until I accomplish the two years, which will be next year. For reference, it is a special type of contract where I can only be hired for 3 years with a potential 1-year extension. There is no possibility of promotion or a substantial salary increase. I believe that I have already given everything I can to this job, especially because it is not challenging at all. However, leaving Germany and risking losing the chance of getting a second citizenship could also close some doors for the future.  
   
Why do I want to study masters? It could open important doors for me. It could also be important to learn crucial skills that I have not been able to learn yet at my previous jobs and even do more strategic networking. Finally, I feel I kind of need a break from all the work life.  
Therefore, I have thought about two potential scenarios.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. Staying at the job and accepting the extension. The contract will end in 2025, but I can move it until 2026. With that time, I could do an online, part-time master's at an outstanding university. Just for clarity, I have no possibility of taking a sabbatical due to the nature of my contract. The risk is not dedicating enough effort to the uni for work commitments.
2. Quitting and studying the programme I want the most at the university I want in the UK, risking losing my residency progress in Germany. The risk is that I support financially dependent family members, so I will have to get some part-time jobs or side hustles.

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I work as a project manager in the pharmaceutical industry, we're going through some changes and it's looking like a good opportunity to leave. I've been with the company for a couple years now. Work/life balance is decent, but career growth is halted for the next few years.

I have the opportunity to accept a 2 year contract project manager position in the public energy sector for ~17K more pay. Work/life balance seems better, commute means getting to Toronto 2x a week. Contract so no DCPP, pay into benefits, no bonus. Potential permanent position within 1 year.

17pyj2a,You know what the worst part of having lost a job is?,"Actually two things:

1. Having to choose your ""forever job"" based not on what company is the right fit, but based on whichever toxic, small, shitty family business is the first to be desperate enough to hire you, an unemployed loser, the lowest form of life in America. Now you have to be loyal to this job for 3-5+ years for the sake of your resume, reputation, and ethics. Most likely, a much better opportunity will end up in your lap soon after accepting this shitty job, but you'll have to tell them ""sorry, I'm already taken.""
2. You have to be a doormat and walk on eggshells the remainder of your career, or at least for the next decade or so. Society seems to give a pass for losing one job in one's lifetime, so long as you have a logical explanation for what you did (or in the case of a RIF, why you weren't adding enough value to be kept). Losing a *second* job in a lifetime, or at least within a decade or so, would mean the **absolute end of your career.** So going forward, you have to be a simp and a doormat and do whatever the fuck your new employer tells you, and significantly adjust your expectations around your quality of life to make sure *you don't lose a second job under* ***any*** *circumstances, no matter what*. I work in IT and this year will be joining my family for Thanksgiving via Zoom just like in COVID times, because I will be doing system cutovers over the holiday and unable to travel to be with family. I'll never get that family time back, but you know what? I owe it to my employer to do whatever they ask without a fuss or any pushback, because I can't lose another job or my professional reputation will be ruined forever.  
(Also we do not get PTO at all - it's branded as ""unlimited"" but I had to beg and plead for a single hour to visit the dentist. A vacation is just so far out of the realm of possibility with this company that I canceled my Southwest credit card since there's no point (literally))

17pyd3n,Transportation designer need some help TL;DR,"  
In 2017, I came to Canada to pursue my Master in Industrial Design, specializing in marine transportation. Following graduation, I worked as a visual communication consultant for a multinational company while actively searching for opportunities in industrial design.  
Unfortunately, I faced a series of setbacks, including a job loss that led me to take on roles like car washing and night shifts at Walmart. The COVID-19 pandemic added another layer of complexity, culminating in a missed opportunity with a defense industry company due to delays in my Permanent Residency and challenges in obtaining international security clearance.  
Subsequently, I found myself in a challenging living situation, temporarily residing in my car for two weeks. I eventually secured a job at the airport, but it necessitated a strenuous 70km commute each night. This position was short-lived, as an unexpected encounter with a deer left me without transportation and jobless.  
Faced with adversity, I made the difficult decision to return home. However, a significant turning point occurred when I unexpectedly secured a contract to design fiberglass fishing boats, ultimately delivering about 150 units to a satisfied client. This achievement spurred the establishment of my own small company, where I continued to design, manufacture, and deliver boats.  
Simultaneously, I pursued opportunities in Canada, even earning an interview with an aerospace company. Although I successfully navigated three stages of interviews, I ultimately lost out to a candidate with more aerospace experience.  
Throughout this journey, I dedicated myself to building innovative boat prototypes, including a 15ft electric luxury boat, a 22ft bay runner, and a 30ft Search and Rescue boat. I was skeptical about my designs, so I returned to Canada for two months, presenting video samples and brochures to dealers who expressed genuine interest and positivity.  
Now, with another dream job opportunity on the horizon, this one aligning with my childhood aspirations, I'm eager to rise to the challenge. However, the past challenges in the job industry have left me grappling with a loss of confidence and an intense fear of rejection. And my business is growing rapidly back home, I am in dilemma, but my last wish is I want to serve Canada as a Canadian.  
I'm reaching out for advice and guidance from this community. How can I regain my confidence and effectively navigate this new opportunity? Your insights and support would be immensely valuable.

17pxrsq,"Former Teacher, In a New Career, Struggling to Shift to Something with Potential","I left teaching (Montgomery County, MD) after returning from the COVID-19 lockdowns. Returning to an in person environment was nice at first but the good feelings washed away and I had to leave teaching for my mental health. My district is an absolute mess from the top down of the organization, leaving school level administrators and teachers to fend for themselves.  
I landed a job with a government contracting corporation and I run trainings for federal government agencies. The job is easy to the point of boring, and that has been fine for the last year and a half, but my prospects are zero at the moment. The money is just below comfortable for us but it essentially precludes me from being able to support a family, which my wife and I were hoping to start. My company has little room for upward growth and I feel even more lost as I navigate the job market (which I understand is very difficult for most folks at the moment).  
On top of 10+ years in the classroom (4 of which I served a dual-role on leadership) I have a degree in Secondary Education - English/Language Arts, so my written communication skills are exceptional and I have developed a broad leadership capacity.

17pxo28,I think I was tricked into getting a job I wasn't qualified for,"Hello, I wanted to start this off by saying I'm only 19 and I decided I didn't want to go to college. At least not right now, so I don't have ANY type of degree whatsoever. I have been working fast food for three years now, and I needed a change. I had been volunteering as a receptionist for some time now at a women's clinic so I had the experience.

 I was looking for reception jobs for a long time, but alas I never got a call back or response to any of my applications. I found a job on Indeed that was for reception work at a law firm; answering phones, filing, talking to people, scheduling appointments. All things I was technically qualified for because of my volunteer work.  (Not that anyone can't to it you don't need a degree or anything, XD but I had the experience needed.)

I go into the interview, and he explains the job ""answering phones, filing, talking to people, scheduling appointments."" It was perfect for me. The only difference is this time in the interview he said it was a secretary job. I didn't think anything of it because it's very similar in nature. He even asked me how I should respond to anyone asking me for legal advice. I laughed and said I would tell them I can't help them because I wouldn't know what I'm talking about. He smiled and said good because you can't. 

I've been working here for about 3 weeks now, and I am doing WAY more than answering the phone and scheduling appointments. I've been writing up legal docs, like deeds, wills, etc. and if I make a mistake he just marks it and gives it back to me.

17pwcue,Should I give up one of my businesses?,"Hi Reddit,

I'm running 2 businesses and have 5-month-old twins. I feel like neither will take off until I focus solely on one.

First is my role as a mortgage loan officer (not true self-employment, but close). Second is my handmade decor business. 

I've managed to pull in low 5 figures from my handmade business, so I know it's something I can scale. I love that it's truly mine. I answer to no one but my customers. It's more mom-friendly in terms of schedule and environment. I have lots of different channels to pursue when sales slow down. It's something I can better control. 

My gig as a loan officer (LO) is wearing me thin. You have to fight for business. My branch manager is a fantastic dude who's been great to me despite how little time I've been able to give him since the twins came; he'll let me hang back on cruise control for long time. When I do close loans, the payouts are substantial--like $2k-8k a pop. And I do need those payouts. But the wins are few and far between. I've closed one loan since January with maybe one more closing before the end of the year.

There's talk of getting a junior LO on to help take some tasks off myself and other LOs on my team. I worked really hard for the license and put so much time and money into this role. But I still can't shake this feeling I'm losing money by splitting the little bit of working time I have in two directions. And we do plan on having more kids within the next 2 years.

I'm thinking of giving it til March to see if the junior LO thing pans out. Am I making the right call or wasting time?",VibrantVenturer,1,1.0,1,1699369739,2023-11-07 15:08:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17pwcue/should_i_give_up_one_of_my_businesses/,11,2023

17pvssq,"Please, STOP IT! ✋ 5 myths in recruitment!","Recruitment is an intriguing field, and like any fascinating domain, myths tend to emerge. I've observed these misconceptions gaining prominence on LinkedIn, often propagated by individuals who lack experience in recruitment but may be promoting products to job seekers. It's time to set the record straight!  
Myth 1️⃣: ""Recruiters Only Focus on Skills."" Not true! We genuinely value you as a person. While hard skills can be taught, we prioritize your personality and soft skills, as we aim for long-term success in the business. 💼  
Myth 2️⃣: ""Bots Reject CVs Based on Keywords."" False! No ATS system rejects candidates based on keywords. If they did, nobody would use them. 🤷‍♀️  
Myth 3️⃣: ""Contact the Hiring Manager, Not the Recruiter."" While reaching out to the manager for an introduction is fine, don't expect it to expedite the process. Managers are often too busy to manage the hiring process; that's why recruiters exist. Bombarding the manager with frequent update requests may work against you. 🤔  
Myth 4️⃣: ""Apply Only if You're 100% Qualified."" You don't need a perfect match. Typically, a 60-70% alignment with the job requirements is sufficient, except for entry-level positions. 📝  
Myth 5️⃣: ""Salary Negotiation Involves Who Presents a Number First."" For each role, there's an approved budget. Your recruiter should transparently share this, as it reflects the appropriate market rate for the position. The salary is determined by evaluating your experience against the job description, rather than who initiates the salary discussion. 🤝

17pvs46,When to put in my application for permanent position ?,"Hey there. I’ve been in a part-time interim position for about a year in a fairly specialized (artistic) field. It is a Director level position so apart from the artistic skills, also involves administrative tasks and management of departmental budget and contractors. My quarterly reviews have been great and overall it seems that everyone is pleased with my performance: management, coworkers, and clients alike. Part of my recommendations as the  interim was to go through a thorough discernment and search process as the expectations of the position were out of line with current reality. I’m proud to say that they did and the results really made a difference. 

Now the search part has started. It is in my contract that I am eligible to apply, and have been encouraged to apply by someone who was a part of the discovery process. I will go through the same interview and hiring process as anyone else. 

My question is, should I apply now, early in the game or wait until the end? There is a time certain posting period of a few months, so it’s not like they would make an immediate hire. There is also a skill demonstration, an audition of sorts, that would happen if accepted as a candidate. I’m not sure if they’ll do those as they come or wait until a slate of final candidates has been identified. Interested to see what you all think. 🙂

I hate the apprenticeship side to my job. It feels so tedious and it’s not enjoyable.

I have a degree and after I’d left university I was struggling to find a job, hence why I have gone through an apprenticeship.

17puhe2,Unexepected Program Manager Interview - What to Expect Next,"Hey fellow Redditors,  
I wanted to share my recent interview experience and get some insights from you all.  
**Background**: I have 7.5 years of experience, with 5 years as a Scrum Master and 2.5 years as a Project Manager. I recently interviewed for a Program Manager position, which was unexpected as the email for interview clearly stated technical project manager position  
Interview Rounds:  
**Round 1**: My first round was with another Engineering Manager, and I have to admit, it didn't go as well as I hoped.  
**Round 2**: Surprisingly, I received a call for the next round, which was scheduled as an F2F interview.  
**Interview Experience**: Upon arriving, I realized that it was actually an interview for a Program Manager role. Originally it was scheduled for 1 hour, but then we had a 75-90 minute discussion with three interviewers, and we mainly talked about managing multiple teams and what my approach would be.  
**Waiting Game**: Now, I'm eagerly awaiting the results. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but I feel like the second interview went well. The questions were insightful, and I believe I provided solid answers.  
Honestly I don't want to think too much about it.. I try to distract myself, but then get drawn into thinking about it. I am applying for other positions too.. But with the holiday season approaching I don't see any new jobs getting posted on any platforms. So I try to study some new concepts such as about Project Management or Program Management  
What to Expect?: I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Has anyone else been in a similar situation, where the interview process took an unexpected turn? What can I expect in terms of next steps or potential outcomes?

The frequent bathroom breaks you take are a must in which you can briefly escape from the mundane existence of being ""employed""-half the time not even needing to relieve one's self.



Modern day slavery. No advancement opportunities. Working beside men who have been there for years and still getting paid the same as you. Trapped with mortgage payments children and car notes. Nothing to aspire to become. No room to breathe much less dream. A neck tightening system.

17prst2,Feeling lost,"Hi,

In need of advice as I figure out next steps in my career. I moved abroad shortly after graduating from a (for what it’s worth) law school that ranks within the top 6 to work in human rights law. I then gained a bit of experience in employment law and business immigration law before my fixed contract ended. I then transitioned to work in PR/comms for a few months because I needed work and was still very new to the legal profession so there weren’t many options for me outside of the US. I’m now moving back to the U.S. and trying to figure out what I want to do next and what makes sense to do given my career path so far. I dont know if I want to transition back into practicing law because I really did not enjoy it and found it had an extremely negative effect on my mental health. I did enjoy PR/comms but it did not pay nearly enough and I think I want to use my law degree a bit more.

Does anyone know of any legal adjacent roles or maybe even legal roles that make sense for me to pursue? Or does anyone have any advice in general? Just feeling a bit worried and want to know that things will be ok and that I can end up in a fulfilling career despite it not being straightforward so far.

17prf5t,Remorse to what I have done during job application,"Throwaway account

My education background is a university dropout. Recently I have applied to a tech job that requires a degree. Out of eagerness, I applied to the job using my university academic transcripts but ommited the details that I discontinued my course.

A few days later after the interview, HR informed me that I was shortlisted and on track to receive the offer. Out of guilt, I told HR the truth about my academic credentials. Fast forward to a few days later, the hiring manager called me, and told me that he wanted to hire me as he needed my talent, but because of the dishonesty, HR is unlikely to proceed my application.

I feel very remorseful and decided to write an apology letter to the hiring team, and haven't receive a response from them yet. Through the conversation with the hiring manager, I realised how kind hearted he is, and I really want to work for him. But at the same time, the guilt and sadness has been eating at me, and I feel I don't deserved a 2nd chance.

TLDR, if I want to have a chance to work under the hiring manager, what can I do to make amends? I am aware that I had make a regrettably mistake and ready to accept any consequences of my conduct regardless the outcome. Thank you.",Throwaway_repenting,5,0.7300000190734863,14,1699353338,2023-11-07 10:35:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17prf5t/remorse_to_what_i_have_done_during_job_application/,11,2023
17pqdxf,"Electrician, Army, or both?","I 18F am currently doing my first year of schooling to become an electrician. I don’t mind what I’m doing and can see myself doing this 20 years from now, yet I keep finding myself being drawn to the CAF even though I know it isn’t a long term option. I just feel this need to discipline and prove myself.

Problem is, I have an apprenticeship offer that won’t come around again, 7on/7off, 3 weeks paid vacation, great pay and benefits, opportunity to grow within the company, and is close enough to home.

 I could serve in the army for 4 years then restart my apprenticeship, but I know I would feel out of place being a first year apprentice as a 23 year old and likely won’t find another apprenticeship opportunity as good as the one I have.

Another thing Im considering is joining the forces for 4 years AFTER I become a journeyman, but I just don’t think I would be able to get a job as an electrician if I serve after. Going 4 years without doing electrical work? Doubt I would get hired by anyone.

I also thought about applying right away, serving for 2 years then requesting a voluntary release, that way I will only be 21 when I come back and restart my electrical apprenticeship. But still, I would lose that job opportunity. I have no idea what to do.

17pq9b0,Should I go back to my old job?,"I’ve been in my new job for just over 3 weeks now but I pretty much realised on day one that it isn’t a great fit for me. It was a much better opportunity career wise and salary wise but the actual workload is very few and far between and I’m used to being very busy in all my previous roles. I hate sitting around looking busy but there is little else I can do in this new job; an 8 hour work day feels like 15 hours because I’m sitting staring at a screen with nothing to actually do. I don’t think it’s just because I’m new either, my coworkers don’t seem very busy a lot of the time and spend a lot of the day having chats, not to mention that my manager did suggest that it can be a bit ‘slow’ between projects. My coworkers also tend to ignore me and don’t seem keen to help me or get to know me at all. I’ve been so miserable since starting here and I cry almost every day because it’s making me depressed thinking that this is what I’ll be dealing with 40 hours a week for the foreseeable future.

When I left my previous job, I was told that the door was always open for me to return - I had a vital role there that I know they are struggling to replace. This previous job had its bad points though; it was short staffed, underpaid and there was no opportunity for growth, but I genuinely enjoyed the work even if it was stressful, I got along with all my coworkers (even had a work bestie) and I felt like I was a vital employee that people depended on. My coworkers and manager were all so proud of me getting this new job and I feel like it would be embarrassing and a bit shameful to ask for my old job back now, especially after I had a whole leaving ceremony and they all gave me leaving gifts. I have to drive past my old job to get to my new job and every day I feel so much regret for leaving.

Another point that is holding me back is that the daughter of one of my old coworkers is one of my current coworkers who helped me get the job, and I feel like it would be a bit of a slap in the face to just turn around and say ‘sorry but I didn’t like it’ and just return to my old job after she put in a good word for me. Though it’s strange because she is one of the people who tends to ignore me in work even when she helped me get the job lol.

I’ve looked for new jobs but there isn’t really anything suitable at the moment. At this point I don’t think I really care about taking a hit in my salary because I’m so miserable and I feel like my mental health should be prioritised.

I’m stuck deciding whether I should go back to my old job, losing a lot of benefits and taking a cut in salary but being happy, or suffer through this new job for a bit longer until I can find a new job of a similar salary.

I guess I’m just asking if anyone has faced a similar situation and did you go back or did you stick it out?

17pmhoc,Laid off and rethinking my life. Any advice?,"26M from Canada here. I recently was subject to layoffs and now have little known idea of what 2024 will look like. 

I was doing Technical Support at a decent company for $53k a year and this is the most I’ve ever made from one income stream. 

The job market is tough and similar jobs are only paying $17-$19 hourly. I’d like to find a similar job working with a product and salesforce, not being bombarded with dozens and dozens of calls a day along with emails like most frontline CS work. Ideally I can make the same and work remote but Im worried nothing is out there to replace what I’ve lost. 

I don’t have any formal education. Just 10 years of customer service and 5 years call centre experience. I was working with data, logs, doing basic troubleshooting for the companies software/platforms on windows. I previously worked for Apple doing phone support for iOS and MacOS. I’d consider myself tech savvy and smart but suffer from ADHD. 

I’d like to expand my certifications and qualifications and make more then I did at this company in the future. I’d consider myself really good with creative tools like photoshop, and graphic design, resume building, etc. Updating LinkedIn and Resume and that stuff will be the easy part. 

My rent is $400 a month so basic employment assistance will get me by for now. People have told me Comptia A+, Data+, Network+ but I’m really not sure the best action plan to follow. I’m also open to other career paths that eventually pay 70-100k a year.

Here is my tricky situation, and I would love to hear your thoughts on it.

Context

* I'm currently 6 months into a 1-year contract with Company A (a large US based-MNC) 
* Company A has a good culture, growth opportunities, and bosses to work with, and I have been getting good feedback.
* However, the company's financial performance has been declining over the last few years, and they have started drastic cost-cutting measures (no large layoffs, yet)
* My hiring manager could not confirm whether they could extend my contract or, ideally, convert me to a permanent employee.
* I got a permanent position offer from an even larger, fast-growing Company B with good growth opportunities.
* I'd love to stay in the current company if they offer me a permanent position, but I might not get an answer in another 3-4 months. However, opportunities from Company B are also very rare in my specialised field.

If you were in my situation:

* How should I persuade my boss to decide whether to convert me to permanent ASAP (without affecting our relationship)?
* If my boss could not confirm what will happen after my contract, what would you do?",AshamedSubstance5608,1,1.0,1,1699328316,2023-11-07 03:38:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17plhgf/using_a_potential_offer_to_pressure_my_current/,11,2023

17pif9j,Not sure what direction to move in. Need advice.,"Little background information. I’m in my mid-twenties. I’ve been in and out of college for the past 4+ years with still no degree because I’ve changed my major multiple times. I struggle with my mental health (depression, BPD). I have no savings and I live with family for free. With that said, I haven’t done much with my life so far and I’m starting to feel the weight and regret of my decisions. 

I have just over 15k in student loan debt. I have no degree yet, I could probably finish a general associates in 2 more semesters for an additional 8k.

Here’s the thing. As of recently, I thought I wanted to work in veterinary medicine. I have worked in clinic for just shy of 2 years and enjoyed it. I’m one semester into the 2 year program. The degree is 28k. The average licensed veterinary nurse salary is just over $20 (mid/upper 20s tops) an hour. Average career length is about 5 years. Seems like a bad choice, huh? But the truth is, I don’t really see myself doing anything else at this time. Or I’m not sure I have the motivation to pursue anything else at this time. 

I was making $19/hr as an unlicensed veterinary nurse before I went back to school. There are options to work unlicensed, somewhat limited, but there’s options. 

I’m just here looking for advice. Should I drop out of school completely and start paying off my student debt? Should I finish my associates at least, would it be worth the money/anything career-wise? Would it be unwise to continue on my current education path of veterinary medicine for the amount of additional debt the degree will set me back/limited career growth?",Heather1455,1,1.0,0,1699318948,2023-11-07 01:02:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17pif9j/not_sure_what_direction_to_move_in_need_advice/,11,2023

I currently work as an executive assistant, and make enough to get by, but I am definitely not well-off. More importantly than the money, this job is extremely unfulfilling. 

I have a bachelors degree in biology, and took a job as an administrative assistant after college with the idea that it would only be temporary, but of course the need to make money is not temporary. 

Honestly, I regret my field of study and don’t want to go into the field of biology professionally. I wish I had went for something in the realm of math, statistics, actuarial studies. However, I’m worried it is too late for me to pursue that, and my background doesn’t really illustrate my interest in those areas. 

I also feel that if I do not go back to school, I may be pigeon-holed in this “assistant” career path for the rest of my life. I have made it clear to my boss that this is not my long term goal, and he says there may be opportunities for advancement down the line, but I’m not so sure.

Also, when there was days he did show up he would do things like talk long lunch breaks, leave early, or show up late. He wasn't fired until about 2 years later.

Another time, I worked somewhere where I didn't feel like I was contributing at all really. Like, someone without any experience could probably have done as much as me. At this job I was never fired. I just chose to leave after about 2 years because people seemed unhappy with me mostly. Which led to feeling like I was in a bad environment.

17pfq0x,Changing Jobs,"Hello everyone! Wanted to get some opinions on this...

I'm in my mid 40's with 2 kids in school. I'm working at a senior management position now, been here for about 2 years. WFH, pay is good, and have autonomy and freedom to work as I need. I actually love my job. I finish everyday with a feeling like I accomplished something. The rules are very lax, sort of a ""start up"" feel. It's been getting busier now as the company has gone through 4 rounds of layoffs so works shifted around and there are less people to do it. I have my hands in a lot. The downside is as I mentioned layoffs, and general unease about the future. People are still leaving left and right. The markets are kicking our ass and the stock price is in the toilet. 

I got called to interview for a Director level position at another company. I interviewed because the job looked interesting, and the salary range was a nice bump from where I am, and also why not? The job is building our a process and department in the same field as I am now, and running that team. I'd be the point person to liaise with an overseas team and running the entire US spend. I have a call tomorrow, and it sounds like they are going to offer me the position. 

The salary bump could be anywhere from 9% - 46% above where I am now, with a more financially stable company. The downside is likely added responsibility, scrutiny and policies in place, which means less freedom and autonomy. I've worked for a large corporation before and I didn't care for it as much due to that rigidity. This new position sounds ambiguous as the new organization is huge and undergoing a lot of change to make it more cohesive. I generally don't love ambiguity. I like a direction, but I hate feeling like I'm pushing paper around, but for that much more money, I'm sure I would find a way to handle it. I don't think I'd make the move for an add 9 - 10%, but if they offered 30-40%, I'd have to consider. 

Does anyone have any thoughts they'd be willing to share? I'm curious what others think. Is it worth leaving something that I enjoy for possibly more money but less freedom?

17pfe3a,"Considering job offer, worried about start date","I was extended a job offer, and I'm still considering it due to multiple factors but the biggest thing I'm worried about is the start date and wanted advice. I applied to this job back in August, got my first interview in September, had a second interview a couple weeks ago in October, and was offered the position today (November) over email and voicemail. I haven't discussed a start date with them at all yet, but I have a couple reasons that makes me anxious to speak to them about it - I'd want to stay long enough at my current workplace to help find my replacement, which shouldn't take too long, but I also have two different week-long trips planned between now and the end of the year. Do you think requesting a January start date is too far in the future, as it's 2 months from now? Or would it be better to consider a December start date as long as I communicate that there are multiple times in the same month that I'll be out of town?

🙃 I mean not knowing where to start learning programming.  
  
This is often asked by programming beginners, and it seems quite natural to more experienced people when they answer ""There's a lot of free content online that you can check out."".  
  
But that's part of the problem.  
  
Much free content available is inversely proportional to clarity in which of them to follow.  
  
The most frequently taken path is to start by learning a programming language: syntax, data types, arrays and lists, etc. But programming is more about providing solutions to problems.  
  
🚦 You could follow these 3 simple steps:  
✅ Algorithms  
✅ Programming language  
✅ Solve a real-world problem

17pf550,"I really burning out, but I dont know my direction","Is my Career Path in engineering right?

Im (25M) currently working in a substation equipment manufacturing plant as a testing engineer earning about 40k roughly where we test HV panels and relays, Ive been here for about 1.5 years and im beginning to lose motivation and dread going to work as it is starting to move away from my original plan of project management or sorts. Initially my plan was to get my hands dirty and gain the technical experience for about a year or so in the field which will be useful when I jump to the design and stuff. But I am now stuck in the department as we lack new or experienced people to perform well in the department. 

Now I feel like its starting to get restricted in that department and I cant move around anymore as initially planned. Im stuck. Other departments are filled. Im also starting to want a slight change in path where I want to get into more renewable energy projects or sorts. I have been applying to other companies as shifting departments is probable not an option anymore. Recently with the digitalisation of the panels, the higher ups need me to learn from the third party testers on how to program stuff and the IT and networking stuff, which I am very capable of learning and am able to catch up fast. But I am the only one putting an effort to learn and my team doesn’t bother to learn as they know that I can do it and refuse to know about it. Then there was a point where I had to go for a surgery and they kept calling me to ask about it. Absolute mayhem at the factory I had to guide them through video call.

 The current company is decent and the most of the colleagues are good including the bosses, but its the very petty inspectors that I dread the most. They really get on my nerves and every time theres an inspection there is a threat to fail if there is a tiny mistake like a spelling error which can be changed in 30 seconds. Then doing designs for them is such a hassle with multiple inconsistencies and changes every project. 

After 1.5 years and counting, im getting burnt out in the manufacturing line where it gets very hectic very fast and for long periods. Ive been taking medical leaves and half day paid time offs to cope with the burn out but its always temporary. I am starting to get my footing back together but its going to take a while. As mentioned earlier I kinda want a change of direction and goals which is renewable so I have applied and interviewed with a few places, i found a company which I find suitable to what I am trying to achieve. I am yet to get a reply but I am really hoping for one. 

My questions are
1. Is my career path a decent one or do I have a wrong mindset
2. Im afraid that is I stay too long in that department I wont get the necessary experience that is needed in the market and I will be lagging or wasting my time and energy
3. Im slightly burnt out and demotivated, Expecially when dealing with the inspectors and doing the job. How do I fix this and change my mindset.
4. After graduating Im tired of needing to learn at a fast pace again in the manufacturing line and I dont have the stomach to come home and learn about work as I want to keep work life balance and not burn out too fast again. How do I address this.",2024mj,1,1.0,4,1699309857,2023-11-06 22:30:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17pf550/i_really_burning_out_but_i_dont_know_my_direction/,11,2023

1. For example, If you see a job thats paying $50K to $100K, the last $10K is untouchable. Meaning thats only a buffer for promotions and keeping a distance from your managers salary. You will never get the full $100K.

2. The salary range you see is the range for the full career at that position. Meaning if you negotiate and ask recruiter for $70K then expect the annual raise to be smaller percentages up until it hits $90K. Aka the lottery example, take the million dollars now or small payments every year.

17pcuwt,Looking to transition careers,"Hello all, I’m 24F and have been working as an engineer for 1.5 years. I have came to a place where I am not interested in continuing this career. But I’m not entirely sure what opportunities are out there for me?

I guess to start. I no longer want to pursue engineering because I have realized it’s not for me. I don’t enjoy the technical and troubleshooting aspect of my job at all. And I don’t think I’m utilizing any of my strengths. I have also experienced a lot of issues with my mental health with this position and really need to leave. 

As a kid, I really enjoyed designing and creating things. I loved creating rocket ships with legos, or drawing out some Invention ideas I had in my head. I always like designing stuff. With this in mind I thought engineering would be a great career path. 

When I was in high school, I did participate in a 4 year engineering program. And really enjoyed the CAD 3D modeling classes, and also using revit. But I disliked anything that was heavy in math. 

My junior year in college, I got an internship but it became virtual due to the pandemic. I was tasked with designing a research and development product from my home ( I couldn’t go into the office since I lived over an hour and a half away). 
I didn’t really enjoy it as much as I thought. I didn’t really design things on CAD, but rather played around with more physical components and circuitry. I didn’t like it at all. 

Also When I was in college, I told myself if I didn’t pursue engineering, I thought it would be cool to pursue something business related or in entrepreneurship. I joined the entrepreneurship society at my school for a bit and was really interested. I did take a class my last semester but didn’t really pay much attention as I should have ( since it was online and I was focused on completing my senior design project which took up most of my time) 

My first job out of college was a contract. It was more of a customer service role. It was really exhausting but I gave my best and really enjoyed helping people. That was the most fulfilling part of the job.

All I know that I would be interested in currently is probably a designing things( maybe clothes and products, apps and websites)  and possibly business ( maybe economics?, I took a course in high school and liked it), and entrepreneurship. And something that could help others! Providing a service or just making something that could help them in life.

17pc3zo,Working remotely and the stress of my job have ruined my mental health (M 26) and I don’t know what to do. I feel so stuck and need some outside perspective.,"Hello I’m a 26 year old remote worker in marketing. I am in a complex and frustrating situation. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know who to talk to about it.

Here are the details:

- After COVID, I lost my job in a big city and my SO got a job in a rural city where she makes double the amount I currently do (~$50K).
- My SO is unable to find the same opportunities in a big city and generally stands to make more money, so I moved in with her and found a remote job. 
- This rural town is across the country from where I lived. I don’t have any job prospects, family or friends here, I’m not very well integrated in my community even 3 years later. 
- There are no jobs available for my line of work in this rural town.
- I got a remote job working for an ad agency. They pay fairly well and my coworkers are all very nice and friendly people. I’ve never physically met them but they all know each other from before COVID.
- The downside of this remote job is the insane amount of work. We were bought out by a larger tech company that went through multiple rounds of layoffs in the past year and now my agency is about half its original size. My workload has doubled since March.
- I am constantly behind, constantly fucking up, and making clients really upset. I care a lot about doing a good job and the stress of not being able to deliver has completely burnt me out. I have developed a nasty drinking and marijuana habit. 
- The stress is seriously impacting my health. I wrecked my lungs this month smoking weed through COVID. If i don’t smoke weed, I’ll wake up in the middle of the night in a panic with my heart racing because of an e-mail that didn’t get sent or a deliverable I missed.
- I have spoken to my supervisors several times and told them that I cannot manage my current workload. They keep giving me more clients. I currently am managing 17 separate accounts. 
- I’m not really being developed in my career. I am in associate level position and am not training anyone or really doing anything but being given more work that I cannot do well.
- I am alone 24/7 with exception of my cats and SO when she’s home. I don’t have a car.
- My SO refuses to move unless she has a job offer somewhere because she doesn’t want to take a gap in her resume. I took a gap in my resume but am not making the same amount of money. She says we’ll move to a bigger city soon but it’s become a couple years worth of kicking the can down the road. This puts me in a spot where I don’t know if it’s a good idea to pick up another career if we’re just going to move months later anyway.

I have a meeting with both supervisors tomorrow that I set up sort of out of the blue. I hit my breaking point this week after basically missing a month of reports across my accounts and getting intensely sick (and causing it to be worse). There are some clients that i haven’t been able to deliver work to for months. I am not infallible but I’m starting to get to the point where I feel like this situation is antithetical to me being able to deliver good work.

What do I say to them? How do I communicate what I’m feeling? Should I be looking for another career entirely at this point so I can be in-person? What are some ways that I can work myself out of this rut?

17p9spr,"Based on this info, what career would you recommend for me?","I'm having the hardest time figuring out something to do. Here's some info about me. Any career suggestions would be much appreciated!! (Sorry if this is all over the place)

College major: psychology 

I really love the subject of psychology and find it very fascinating. I love understanding why people do the things that they do. I would have ultimately decided to pursue my PHD in psychology but I don't want to spend that long in school.

I love being creative. I like to model and do my own and other peoples makeup. I also enjoy being in front of the camera as well as behind it.
When I worked for a marketing company in the beauty space, I really enjoyed the creative direction aspect of my role but not so much the admin and analytical side of marketing. I've looked into creative director roles but it seems like more of a managerial role than a creative role.

Doing something I love is definitely my priority but money is VERY important to me.

17p9glt,New job “buyer’s remorse.”,"Hey all, I recently (like, six weeks ago) started a new job. It was a big upgrade for me in terms of title and pay. A former beloved co-worker from the organization I just left moved to this org in January and informally poached me. She really talked it up as being a great place to work and good for my career. 

But so far, if I’m totally honest, I’ve been hating it. The people are all nice enough but the place is so disorganized and so poorly run, I honestly feel like I have whiplash from the constant pivoting and mismanagement. 

My manager is lovely but is open about having ADHD and you can tell. She has the memory of a gold fish and communicated information poorly, such as changes to timelines etc. you’ll go in to speak to her for 2 mins and get trapped into a 90 min meeting where she just talks at you. No one else on the team seems to really respect her as they’ll tell you in a private message to ignore her and do another thing. And they are always right! 

I’ve basically had no on-boarding at all and have had to figure my stuff out myself - and keep being assigned work I don’t even know how to do yet. 

Long winded way of saying, I regret leaving my last job a lot. I’ve cried every week and almost every day. I don’t feel like I fit in at my new job at all. My last job had some big issues but I left more for lack of growth opportunities than how I was being treated etc. I had really outgrown my role a lot. 

To clarify, I don’t feel intimidated by the role, just exhausted from the constant pivoting, and what feels like a lack of support. I’ve asked so many times for support and I never really get it or only get it halfway. The amount I need to clarify is honestly ridiculous.

But then I don't know if doing an MBA would be worth it. I am sceptical about taking an education break for 2 years and a hefty education loan to finance it.

17p8bx8,Career vs relationship,"Hi guys, hope you all are doing well!

Needed some serious relationship advice.
I am 30M in love with a girl who is 27. We got to know each other at work, we work from home and were in the same team, and we clicked and started talking to each other and I fell in love with her. Also, it’s a long distance relationship which sucks, which means I am able to see her only once in a while. 
Now this has started taking a toll on me as well, and I would want us to be together and around each other always and marry her eventually.
So the thing is that she comes from an extremely rich background, and I am kind of middle class as of now. Even if I would want to move to her city, or even try marrying her, I need to get stable in life, in terms of job/business and make shit tons of money, to afford to do that.
Although, I stay away from her, and I am working towards my own career advancement, it still feels overwhelming for this uncertain future if I will be able to do it or not and feel kind of pressurised due to which I loose focus on my own things as well. And also she is missing out on things in life because of me, since I am far, which probably she would have done if she had someone in her life living close by.
It’s been one year like this and I loose focus from my own track every now and then and it feels uneasy and with lots of overthinking and stress.
We decided that I will go away from her life for 1 year, to lock myself in my room and work on things and become a man of her dreams, which I know I will become and then show up to her once I am there, and in the meantime, she is free to see anyone, or wait for me, which is totally her choice, and at that point of time, we will see if she has something for someone, if yes, then obviously I would back off.
**TL;DR;** Is this the right path to follow? Please suggest. I want to make a sound decision.",ApartmentSad3053,1,1.0,1,1699292575,2023-11-06 17:42:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17p8bx8/career_vs_relationship/,11,2023
17p87dd,"I'm 27, have no career prospects and haven't finished college. I feel very stuck and would appreciate any career advice for my situation?","I started college later than my peers at 20 years old. My family was very supportive of me studying whatever I wanted or felt passionate about. I've always had a variety of interests and it was difficult for me to choose a major.

  
My academic advisor told me about their Interdisciplinary Studies degree so I stupidly chose that as my major. It's basically a liberal arts degree, where my major was split between three ""areas."" I chose behavioral/social sciences, art and minored in writing and rhetoric (basically publication essay writing) and thought this degree was a great way for me to explore multiple interests. The introductory course did a good job of convincing me that interdisciplinary studies is the future, blah blah blah.

  
When I was around 23, I was one year away from finishing my Bachelor's degree, but then the pandemic happened and literally at the same time as lockdown my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. So I moved back home to support her and put school on the back burner (she was my only parent). She was sick on and off the last few years and then passed away last year. Not mentioning this to make anyone feel bad, just explaining how I got into the position I'm in.

  
Now, I'm 27, still haven't finished my undergraduate degree, which I also now see as a total sham and am filled with regret about. I don't have any promising career prospects, don't think my degree provided me with any really valuable skills, and don't know if my degree is even worth finishing. I don't know if I should just finish it and try to apply for a master's program to become more specialized in something or if I should change the major altogether for something more likely to provide me a good income. I've only had burner jobs and one job at a newspaper for a year. I got a real estate license a few months ago, but haven't had any luck so far and where I live there's an oversaturation of realtors.

17p81ml,Need some advice,"So to first sum things up, I’ve been teaching myself frontend web development for just under 2 years (for the most part pretty consistently). Recently I applied to and got an interview for a junior developer position in my state. It’s about an hour and a half from where I currently live, fully in person. The reality is that I would have to commute (for at least the short term until I can get an apartment) basically 3 hours a day 5 times a week. 

Excessive mileage and wear and tear on my car aside, my dilemma here is that I currently work for the federal government, making about 45k a year, hybrid (2 days in office. Also have a condensed schedule to where I work an extra hour a day essentially and get every other Friday off). Everything I’ve researched about this company I’ve applied to says that junior devs make around 100k starting. So I guess my question is, would you leave the cozy, low stress (but also low paying) government job, for a small company with potentially more stress and longer hours but much more pay?

The hard truth of it all is that I just turned 30 a week ago and I’m at the point in my life where I want to make very substantial shifts (buying a home, getting married, etc). This might be a little doom and gloom, but I feel like I’m running out of time to do those things.

17p7lfl,Been out of school for about a year and a half. Degree is mid. Don't know where to go from here.,"TLDR: Graduated with a BA in Computer Systems Administration. Looking for some kind of certifications that can help me find find a job but I don't know what kind of job I want. I like programming.


Full Story
I graduated from university a year ago. After a bit of an uphill to get a grade changed because of a mistake I made that the professor was kind enough to fix.

After that I tried to find a job but I had no luck. A friend suggested to me that I still had a degree I could find something in the meantime that was close to what I was looking for.

So I took a job at a private company teaching Python and Vex Robotics for elementary students. Originally I was only going to stay for their summer program but then they wanted me to coach two of their robotics teams and started rewriting their python curriculum. So I kind of hooked myself in. But it's not what I want to do.

While yeah I have enjoyed teaching, it's very enjoyable. I love watching the gears turn in their head as they slowly understand the material or when they understand it right away. But I don't like the dealing with the other side of teaching. The discipline, the controlling the classroom, the parents. Teaching is not for me I'm sure.

But now I've been here too long I think. And a coworker suggested to me that maybe I could do some certifications while I'm still here but that I should look up and see what I want to do and what certifications I'd need.

But I don't know what I want to do. Programming is fun and cool and I enjoy putting the pieces together and watching it all come together. But as for a general focus I don't have any, I can't even come up with a side project because I don't have any kind of vision or ideas for stuff. I went through university just following others ideas and was happy with that.

So what do I do?",Ultraempoleon,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1699290679,2023-11-06 17:11:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17p7lfl/been_out_of_school_for_about_a_year_and_a_half/,11,2023

17p6xxk,When should I switch jobs to qualify still for maternity without messing up my career path?,"I am 24f. I was working as a COO for a bank contractor for 3 years until a few months ago when the CEO stole a bunch of money and the company went under and everyone was laid off. I happened to be the whistleblower that saw what was happening so I got to keep all my connections to the board and higher ups in return. 

I didn’t have a great savings so I panic applied and got a job in funding management at a similar but 8x as large company, on the operations team, the same day I lost my job. So I had zero gap in employment and paychecks, but dropped level and role, but also am now at a much bigger and well known org. I’ve been here 3 months and have already been given a performance raise, but the growth potential is limited.

I’m planning on starting a family with my husband in 2 years, so kids best case scenario in 2 years and nine months. 

Well, I just found out this company doesn’t have a maternity leave policy. Through some office gossip I actually discovered the first person here young enough to want maternity leave was the last person in my role, who quit because of how awful she was treated when asking for maternity leave. 

So I’ve decided I want to switch jobs and use the connections I have. My problem is that’s as far as I know. I want to be able to switch back into a higher level role, and I want the pay back to match it. I don’t want to be thought of as a job hopper, and am willing to be methodical if I need in when I leave- this job isn’t miserable, just not a long term fit, so I’m not rushing to quit.

I want to be sure to plan switching when I’ll still qualify for maternity leave at a new company. I want to be able to excuse my career path with the lay off and taking a job that’s a lower level (I think it’s better it’s a bigger company).

I don’t really know what to do from here. When should I plan to switch that makes me look reliable but also gives time to switch for maternity, but also if staying longer at a lower role looks bad I’m willing to apply and shift sooner, so when?

I graduated in 2021 with a mechanical engineering degree, started a job as an MEP engineer in May 2022. I really disliked the job, found it incredibly boring and felt like my company didn’t train me properly (felt like I was considered dumb, people would expect things from me that were out of my scope of knowledge and then complain to manager), I was also extremely underpaid for my VHCOL area (68k- could not reasonably move out from home - due to this was forced to have a 2+ hour commute and constantly stressed to repay student loans) and a combination of these things made me desperate to leave. I knew I didn’t want to be anywhere near the construction industry but could not get interviews anywhere else outside of construction, literally every single application outside of my industry was a rejection although numerous people told me my resume was great. 

By a stroke of luck, I got a job as a project manager in healthcare bc I knew someone who worked at the company. However, at this job, my boss is very overwhelmed and basically has given me no work (I’ve been here for 2 months) and I feel like I’m rotting away. This job uses none of my technical skills too (which is expected in PM I guess) but I just feel like I’m not learning any skills and that I’m just going to be a useless worker once I get fired or laid off for being useless. Part of me thinks I should go back to engineering but this job I have now actually pays me very well (im super overpaid lol) and it’s WFH so I kind of want to stay but this hump where my boss is extremely micromanagey and at the same time too busy to give me work is not really working out. Even if I went back to engineering, I still have the issue where nobody wants to hire me outside of my last industry. 

I don’t really know where to go from here. I feel super dumb as an engineer and am not sure I could do any technical role. At the same time, I don’t know if PM is for me. I’m just really lost and confused 😭 I know this is long but if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement I would appreciate it. I just haven’t found my place in the corporate world and have no clue where to go from here.

A medical laboratory role seems like a somewhat natural direction, but I’ve been strongly considering something in environmental. I have a bachelor’s degree in biology, but was curious what other things (e.g., education) I might need to transition to a role like that (medical or environmental). Are there other opportunities that I’m not thinking of? Very open minded in my pursuit of happiness.

I’m late 30’s, married and have 3 kids. So access to a six-figure income and good benefits (which I have now) is extremely important.",No_Damage9904,2,1.0,3,1699284744,2023-11-06 15:32:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17p5dbi/want_to_transition_away_from_oil_gas_industry/,11,2023
17p4pl8,Almost 30 years old. Making less than £30k as an Engineering Technician. I'm burned out and ready to quit. What careers are available for someone with an Electrical & Electronic degree?,"I am currently working as a technician for a civil infrastructure company, within the traffic signals team. In layman's terms, I design where traffic signals are placed at traffic assets. I have been working in this sector for the last 8 years, while attending university for a Higher National Diploma in Electrical & Electronic Engineering and later, obtaining a Bachelor of Engineering in the same field. I must be honest: I do not do anything closely related to my degree in my current employment. There were open-ended promises of possible electrical design work coming from other teams within our sector, but that never happened.

  
Honestly, I am not sure where my future is taking me. I am not enjoying my current employment one bit and am finding it hard to find any jobs that are associated with my degree. I am 28 and have more or less forgotten almost everything that I learned from my degree. I still want to be in a technical/engineering role, just not in civil infrastructure anymore. I am wondering what job roles I should pursue.

  
I have also attached my CV and university transcript to help with the details.

17p4fry,I have a possible job offer dilemma. Love vs. Opportunity. What would you do?,"I’ve had two interviews and a test with an editorial house, and the interviewing team congratulated me. Although I haven't received a job offer yet, I'm 70% sure I might get it. It would be my first corporate job and a significant salary increase. However, the job requires relocating to my home city, where my family lives so I could live with them with the price of my mental health. The position allows 3 days of remote work and 2 days in the office. 

My dilemma is that I have a boyfriend whom I love deeply in the town where I currently live. We discussed the situation, and he suggested he could find a remote job and visit me eventually. I’m not sure how this would work as his family lives in the city next to ours. I'm hesitant about a long-distance relationship, as our current city is smaller and more relaxed. I'm considering turning down the offer to stay with him, as I can't imagine being apart from him every night.

In-between being fired and being re-hired I was able to somewhat find what I enjoy and what I'm passionate about (gaming and all things gaming). I coached friends and friends of friends and made educational content, I'm not the best but I am well above average in the games I play and loved making content for them in my time off.

Now I'm back in the office, I realise how much I hate it and how little free-time I have due to commuting and working odd hours (half hour extra at the start or end of the day). That sucks the most. Honestly makes me ask if this is supposed to be my next 60+ years then what is the point of going on.

I'm not sure what career I want to go into. I love IT but this role is boring and not what I want to do and I believe I won't be able to go into a different role unless I go to uni which I also don't really want to do.

17oygfm,"Boss quit, need advice on how to proceed.","This is not your typical boss quit situations.

My boss randomly quit recently, without any warning to anyone. I am still new at my company, but I am the only one holding a similar title as boss. My boss never really trained me for the position that I've been at for over a year. Feels like he sabotaged me honestly. Boss never wanted me doing any of the technical work (paperwork) and placed me out on the shop floor to deal with continuous improvement and data gathering. I've never been part of any of the meetings he's had with other department heads, ever.

Now that he's gone, the company wants me to approve projects and things that my boss was responsible for. I was initially told that I'd be trained to fulfill his duties, but it appears as that was a lie. Last week a bunch of papers stacked on my desk, waiting for me to review and approve. I know very little about them or what exactly they want me to do, so last Friday I sent out an email to upper management asking for training, stating that I didn't feel comfortable signing those documents.

Now I'm kinda scared that they'll let me go for failing at something I'm unfamiliar with. There's literally no one lined up to fill my boss' shoes. I know how to run the shop floor, but not of any approvals or projects he had going on with other departments.

I realized back in early summer that I may be in a sticky situation financially after I got laid off and denied for unemployment, so I had no option but to enroll in a 2nd masters program just to get the refund check. This was $6000, disbursed in September. MsBA in Real Estate. I have two more disbursements coming one in January 2024, and September 2024. 

It is November and I only have $400 in my account left. I have two bills coming up on the 13th that total $210. Another one on the 21st for $150. Then I’m good until December 1st, Rent=$800 and Bills=$360, same dates as above. 

One source of immediate income I have is driving for Uber Eats, however the money is so low. $30 a day, and I can only drive evenings on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Of those days if I have a real estate event to go to it cancels a day out. 

I do have a job that I interviewed for, and got, as a property inspector for homeowner insurance companies, it’s part time, $21.50/hr., 20-30hrs./week. However, before I can call onboarding, I have to do the training. The training is 7 sets of 40-60 PowerPoint slides with the quiz at the end of each one, a final test, then you get your certificate, and you can call on boarding to start the hiring process. Who knows how long this will take given my other obligations? Also, what if I do the whole thing and they put me on a waitlist to start because they’ve onboarded too many inspectors? I got the email to do the training exactly 10 days ago, but I didn’t realize it until this past Wednesday. I emailed them back and said “Will do!”.  

Other important information: I don’t have access to credit. I stopped paying all my CC bills July 2022, can’t file for bankruptcy because of my profession. My student loan debt after this program will be maxed out of the amount federal unsubsidized loans give you in a lifetime, 150k. I do have a lawsuit pending and I hope to get 13k from that.

How can I build a career as a therapist while working another job FT

So the title is pretty self explanatory. Since I was younger I was always interested in emotions and why people react the way they do. I was always the friend that gave the best advice. I decided to study psychology in college thinking I would go down the route of becoming a therapist or a social worker but a school counselor told me it wouldn’t be worth it in the long run because of the money you make.

I have always had to finacially support myself so I played it safe. My counselor said to get a job in HR and they will pay you to go back to school. So I took the advice and have now been in HR for 4 years (post grad 4 years). My counselor was right and they will pay for me to go back to school. But not for therapy it needs to be related to the HR profession. 

Now I’m kinda stuck because although I do like HR.. it doesn’t make me feel whole. I feel like talking to people and being that sounding board is where I am meant to be…. But how.. how do I even get started. I’d have to work full time in Hr and I heard to get your therapy/counselor degree you need to do clinicals. If I could prolong this and do a long term program that I could do on the weeekend at night I’d be open. I’m just not sure where to look and honestly will it be worth it.

Well I’m moving onto a third and final round interview thats more so a meet and greet with the team with a local big university as a Graphic Web Designer so I feel pretty good about the chances of landing the role BUT the job doesn’t pay as well. It’s 55k - 58k. But during discussions with the manager there’s tons of growth opportunities let alone the amazing benefits like after 10 years of service my student loans could be partially taken care of. 

Well.. at my old company a job has opened up for UX and I have an interview setup. But I’ve heard from a colleague that the company is not doing so well and it’s only a matter of time before it goes down. Which makes me so nervous because I don’t want to be laid off again if I can help it. This has been one of the darkest times of my life. But obviously it pays so well. I’d be back to around 90-100k. 

So I’m torn, I literally get knots in my stomach at the thought of being laid off again. But obviously the pay gap is huge. 

I feel as though the university position would pay off in the long run because of the advancement opportunities as well as the security. 

Whereas the other one I risk going back to being laid off.  I loved my job and loved my team and manager but I really despised the CEO and big suite executives. They don’t take employees feedback seriously and gaslit everyone through multiple rounds of layoffs.

I don't have any promising career prospects, don't think my degree provided me with any really valuable skills, and don't know if my degree is even worth finishing. I don't know if I should just finish it and try to apply for a master's program to become more specialized in something or if I should change the major altogether for something more likely to provide me a good income. I've only had burner jobs and one job at a newspaper for a year. I got a real estate license a few months ago, but haven't had any luck so far.

17or5vm,Is this really what an office job is like? I’m depressed,"I’m a recent college graduate.  Graduated with a general business degree, got a salary job working with forecasting and data visualization about 4 months ago, which I absolutely loved doing in my college courses.

I was really excited to start my career, especially at this particular employer because I’m passionate about the field.

However, this job is slowly sucking the life out of me.  There is such little work to do, it’s insane.  I ask for work and projects, and they’ll assign me something that takes an hour.  And then there’s nothing to do.  There are other people in my role who have the bulk of the responsibilities, and even they are almost always chatting or on their phones.

I just stare at the blank screen all day.  I make noises on the keyboard so it sounds like I’m busy.  I feel my brain cells rotting away in my head.  It’s mind numbingly boring.  It’s also 5 days a week in person 9-5.  So I can’t just dick off at home.  I sneak time on my phone, but I feel bad doing so and there’s only so much I can do on that.   

Idk, man.  I feel so empty.  So unfulfilled.  I miss my monotonous warehouse job.  I’d rather be physically exhausted than mentally exhausted.  Depression is at an all time high.  Im in a crap mood and the weekends are barely enough time to regenerate the mental energy required to survive the work week.

I just don’t know what to do.  I need the money, and like the money, but at what cost?

17opu36,Received and accepted an offer but worried about employment verification...,"So, a brief background: I graduated with a BS in May 2022 at the top of my class and have had three jobs since. 1st job was a tiny startup that missed multiple paychecks so I left after two months. 2nd job I was at for 7 months, was a well-paying decent job, but I felt it wasn't suiting my long-term career goals (""I'm young, take a chance and live your dreams!"", I thought). 3rd job suited my career goals and aspirations, but I was getting severely harassed by my boss (it was a small academic lab group). I left it without notice and now am doing temp work.  
Obviously, this is completely my fault. I should've made more calculated moves and now I've set myself back for years career-wise. I kick myself every day for this. I should've stayed at the startup and given them a chance to get the payments right, and if not, I should have stayed at the well-paying second company.  
At any rate, I've put out resumes with all three of these jobs included, and have never received a callback with it (for good reason). So, I decided to take the first job out of my resume, and I've since had a decent amount of interviews.  
Fast forward to today, I have a job offer in hand, pending a background investigation. They require three years of complete employment history. I don't know what to do. It seems like I have three options: put this omitted job in the background check and hope for the best, let them before entering it, or just withdraw my application to save myself from getting blackballed. I've looked on The Work Number, and it's in there so leaving it off the BG check isn't an option, unfortunately.

17ooc32,Reference Dilemma - Seeking Advice,"Seeking advice from this community on a recent career shift.

Unfortunately, a combination of burnout, misalignment with my supervisor, and challenges stemming from insufficient staffing, turbulent HR matters linked to shifts in company direction, and a persistent lack of resources led to my recent termination. Despite earnest efforts during a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), the situation concluded a couple of weeks later, marking my first experience with termination—a departure from my usual commitment to exceeding expectations.

Now transitioning to the next phase of my career, I face a reference dilemma for a 6-month role. Although my former supervisor, who terminated me, offered to provide a reference, her reputation raises concerns. Considering this, I'm exploring listing a collaborative colleague who reported to me for a potentially more reliable representation. Despite having references for my other roles, I am reluctant to remove this one from my resume as it represents the highest career role I achieved.

If anyone has encountered a similar situation, how did you manage tricky reference issues in your career? Your tips, stories, or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I have a wife and a newborn, and I am worried about how little I am able to be there for my family, and also, I want to make more money as we are just making enough to cover our bills.  

I wish I would have gotten a different degree in a STEM field, but I have what I have.  Are there any certificates that I could get that are not terribly difficult, that would help my ability to provide for my family?

I don't have that much time, as I work so much, but I could set aside about an hour a day to study for a certification test.  

I have seen that radiology techs need a certification in certain states, but I don't know what else is required.  Are there jobs that just require a relatively easy certification to obtain plus a bachelors?

I realize this likely will take a very long time and my resume isn’t extremely competitive. I don’t have many projects, no internships, and really just don’t have much motivation to do much else besides do well in my classes. My GPA is decent (3.5). However, it’s really been weighing on my mind recently that so much of my time is spent wondering about and watching things related to mental health, psychology, therapy etc. i also have my own battles with mental health which obviously makes me more interested. I was originally a psychology major but switched to info systems because I figured I was already accumulating a lot of college debt and couldn’t afford grad school. But now I’m at a point of wondering if I even care and if I should just do what interests me more. I’m looking at 70k debt out of undergrad. Postgrad would be minimum another 30k I believe and it would probably take 4 years from now minimum to become a therapist. I’m just wondering if anyone has any perspectives on if this is even remotely worth considering.

17olzvu,taking a job vs pursuing a masters,"Hey ya'll I'm at a crossroads for what I want to do with my career so I thought asking random people's advice on the internet would help.

I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science but I'm not sure what job I want. I did an internship as a software developer and found it okay but I don't really see myself being a developer in the future. Currently, I have an offer for a data analyst position at a finance company. I don't have much experience with data analysis although I am more on the analytical side so potentially it could be interesting. However, I have no interest in finance so I probably won't be that interested in the work content. 

My other option is pursuing a masters in Computer Science. This would take two years and be funded although I'll be getting paid basically minimum wage so I would earn much less than the data analyst position. I would be specializing in Human-Computer Interactions and be researching something in that area. During my undergrad I had a concentration in HCI and it is the area of computer science I have some interest in. I was thinking I could potentially pursue UX/UI design if I take this route. Though I would have to do extra work on the side to build a portfolio since doing a computer science masters doesn't directly lead to UX/UI design although I would gain some relevant skills. I previously did summer research in HCI and found it not bad, I like being in a learning environment and being around people who are doing interesting work. However I'm not a great writer and research involves a lot of writing. I also struggle with the ambiguity of research a bit and had difficulty deciding the best direction for my summer research. But I do like the idea of being able to research something I'm interested in. 

Overall, I'd say my strength is problem-solving and being analytical and my weakness is my social skills . I draw in my free time so I am more interested in design which is why I considered UX/UI design but I know it's also more heavy on the soft skills so I'm not sure if it's the best fit either.

17oks4l,"Looking for advice, do you think it make sense to be a sales agent in two different industries at the same time? Or should I spend time focusing on one industry I care about and stick to it? Context below","TLDR:

So my over all question breaks down into three parts:
1)  Should I take the insurance job for the training even though I know I'll leave in like 3-5 years?

2) if I have the opportunity to work both insurance for the training and real estate for the experience does that even make sense ? 

3) should I just spend my time instead looking for an industry I'm more excited about and invest my time there instead of doing insurance period?  

Looking for the best use of my time . 


Context: 

I'm young (25M) and I know I want to work with sales (and marketing). However,  I only have theoretical knowledge of the craft thus far and I'm hungry to get some practical real world experience. However,  I don't want to waste my youth either.

Right now I have the opportunity to work for an insurance company but in the interview they said they're looking for someone really long term (30+ years) and are giving me the weekend to think about it.  I believe i can get the job done because im not scared of rejections or objections or any of that stuff. But I can't see myself sticking to selling just insurance for the rest of my life because it's not an industry I'm particularly excited about. 

If I work with the insurance agency they provide training on the job for both sales and insurance knowledge. I'm considering taking it for the training aspect, because not only will it hive me real practical experience,  but also I'll be around ppl to guide me to improving.  But like i said before, im not excited about insurance. 

I know that while im there, I'll also still be looking for sales work in an industry I would be more excited about (real estate probably), but where I live, I haven't found a single real estate company that does sales training with it's staff or guides them towards improvement. 

So I'm wondering if it makes sense to do the insurance for the training (even though ik I won't stick there long), could I do insurance for the training and apply it over to real estate?

17ohwiv,How do I even make sense of this?,"I was recently hired into a company at a position higher than an employee who has been there longer. The said employee naturally took it very hard. Privately I told them I would be more than happy to advocate for a promotion for them and provide a letter of recommendation.

Then things started getting very weird... this person reached out to me asking about my qualifications and started sending passive aggressive messages of how hurt they are. I felt empathy and responded with kindness. They then mentioned they hoped people would start questioning workload as this is a matter of 'equality.' Being naive, I thought they meant the manager would come to me asking me if they were worthy of a raise based on their work/effort (of which I would have happily said 'yes'.)

After I was hired on, my team collectively took vacation at the same time for a span of multiple weeks leaving me as the only person showing up for work most days. I suddenly was being questioned about my contributions and my efforts by multiple people who were not my manager (the same people who previously lauded/praised my hard work.) Even with the reduced staff, I was expected to carry the entire team even showing up while very sick. If I asked for help, I was often shamed and treated poorly. I was also publicly blamed for issues I had not caused.

Around the same time, another new person of the same demographic was hired within my team for a different role. The first week, I saw he was being isolated and set up to fail by the person meant to train them. He was being treated with the same curt responses, iced out, and shamed for asking for help. 

I have since moved to a different team as my mental and physical health started to suffer. I hate calling out sick, but I had to go to the hospital due to my blood pressure spiking into the 180's. Still the old team lobs work on my plate and appears to actively obstruct the work the current team is doing. My previous team member even publicly reported to upper management how our project was not going to deliver on time (I had been there less than a week at this time) and attended our planning session suggesting my presence was hurting the new team. When I have defended myself, people have reported that I have made them uncomfortable and made them feel 'psychologically unsafe.' Previous teammates have gone to my boss when I mentioned I could not attend their meetings due to it interfering with my current work (which has a very tight high priority deadline.)

I am so beyond exhausted, but it seems management is doing nothing to help.

Yes, the other person of my demographic was eventually fired or gave up. Yes, the person who has not been promoted has a history of harassing other 2 other workers for the same thing (something I only found out later from my boss.)

I do not have any direct evidence of anything concrete as far as discrimination-- just coded language and really shitty behavior.

TL;DR- after being hired, I've experienced repeated, unrelenting poor treatment.

Doable?,"Hi, im a 22 yo M, I’m currently on my 4th year Software engineering (which made me miserable, burned out and go through depression), I’m planning to make a career switch to architecture since im more of a creative type person, love creating things and have a background on graphic design which I love and naturally talented on ( I know architecture is not just design, but its the closest thing I can think of of what I want to be in the future especially after shadowing an architect and seeing the day to day things he does, I knew its what I want) . 

My question is: while studying I do run a small design agency which requires me 3-4 hours work per day. And im concerned that If i start studying architecture I’ll have to make the sacrifice and stop the business that I spent a lot of time and energy building since architecture is so demanding after what I heard.
 
So I would love to know if its doable to do both? Or if their any countries abroad where they are flexible in schedule for people who work part-time?

17offe2,Do I let my supervisor know I am pursuing a Masters Degree?,"I have been doing some career planning and think that I've found a niche where I'm excelling and want to expand my qualifications. I'd like to purse a masters not only to increase my personal competence but also to make myself more marketable and open the path to higher paying positions in the future. 

I've been with my current employer for just over 6 months. I really enjoy the work I do and I feel a high degree of stability - my direct supervisor has laid out a very clear path for progression for me and advocated for me a number of times as I've proven that I'm overqualified for the position I am in. I have also taken on additional duties that have high visibility at the CEO & management level and received consistent praise on my performance and work. 

After putting in an internal req. for a newly created lead position in my department (which I was below the required YOE to fill) I did receive an interview. Following that, I had a 1:1 lunch scheduled with my department VP where I was told that I was passed over at the moment due to lack of company experience (at the time 4 months) but that my performance was impressing many people and there were going to be internal opportunities opening in the beginning of the next FY which were laterally aligned with the role I applied for. After this, my supervisor worked with me to develop a plan for additional ""on paper"" qualifications I could get under my belt like certifications and trainings. She advocated strongly for me at every step of the process and made it clear she would support me in advancing.

I haven't looked elsewhere since I started this job, and to be honest, if they do invest in me and compensate me at competitive rates moving forward I don't feel like I would need to look elsewhere. My ideal situation would be to progress in my current role while getting a higher degree, and then move internally to a higher role within the company. This is because I am actually passionate about the industry that I am in, and because the benefits and culture of the company are ideal for me.

My concern is that by letting my supervisor know I am pursuing an advanced degree, it will be seen as me preparing to leave the company for other work. While the company will offer some amount of tuition assistance, I don't necessarily need it (though it would be nice to have). The tuition assistance provided does have to be repaid if I leave the company within a certain period. I understand there should be healthy skepticism when it comes to dealing with employers, but I would like to accurately weigh the benefits and risks of this decision.

Any advice, opinions, or informed perspectives would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",opiwv,1,1.0,0,1699201269,2023-11-05 16:21:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17offe2/do_i_let_my_supervisor_know_i_am_pursuing_a/,11,2023

I am quite interested in Engineering as it would fit me well, I've got a pretty solid understanding of physics and maths and just generally prefer engineering more over other career options I have.

I do have a few questions I'd like to put out for Engineers in this subreddit:

-What are some common qualifications required by any given engineering job? (Academics, University/College degrees, Bachelors, PhDs, Doctorates, etc).

-What are some desirable/needed skills or traits? (Art skills?, Problem-Solving skills, Creativity? Endurance?)

-Generally, what should you know to be an engineer? (I know this is an odd question)

-Do you find your job enjoyable or atleast, tolerable without any strong negative emotions about it?

-Is the public perception and media potrayal surrounding engineering on themes such as safety/risk, atmosphere and whatnot at all accurate with reality?

My entire life has been somewhat unconventional. I entered community college with, in essence, 0 high school education. It took me several years to eventually transfer as a premed. I graduated with a BS in bio, earned a Masters in Health Science, and finally at the age of 27, I matriculated into med school. My dream was becoming a reality. However, due to many factors my mental health rapidly deteriorated. I took a couple leaves, and eventually had to leave med school altogether, with no prospect of returning. 

For the past several weeks I’ve been deeply considering my options. I’ve been accepted into an accelerated nursing BSN program, but I’ve also been considering going the biomed engineering route. Both are decent careers with stability, and I know that both would provide me satisfaction.

17odam7,Career Advice,"I am not entirely certain if this is the appropriate forum to discuss my dilemma, but unfortunately, I really need to express my concerns somewhere, or I fear I may soon become overwhelmed. For the past eight years, I have been employed by a civil infrastructure company, specifically within the traffic signals team. I began as a trainee technician in 2015 and have remained a technician within the same team and company. Throughout my tenure, I completed a Higher National Diploma in Electrical & Electronic Engineering, achieving a Merit, as well as a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical & Electronic Engineering with First-Class Honours.  
  
However, over the last three years, I have encountered performance issues in my team, culminating in my being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) during the final year of my university studies—coincidentally, at the height of the COVID pandemic, when redundancies were rampant across various industries. You can imagine the toll this took on my mental health. Moreover, a year after successfully completing my PIP, the HR department continued to scrutinize my performance excessively. My efforts on multiple projects since the PIP have been criticized by my team for the quality of my work, and these criticisms were magnified tenfold by HR. In hindsight, some of these criticisms pertain to errors that many engineers in my field make, yet they face no repercussions for similar performance issues. This has indeed been a tumultuous journey with my employer. For the past three years, my personal performance goals have remained unchanged due to a ""lack of opportunity within the team"". My primary responsibilities involve creating drawings and designs for junctions and pedestrian crossing traffic signal arrangements, and recently I have been tasked with delivering over 10 submissions weekly for a London-based client, working exclusively on the CAD aspect of the projects. Unfortunately, I feel that my efforts and improvements are not duly recognized or appreciated by my senior colleagues or the company at large.  
  
The primary reason for writing this is to seek guidance. I have resolved to leave my current position, but I am struggling to find roles that align with my qualifications in electronics and digital engineering. My experience with civil infrastructure has been disillusioning, especially with the unfulfilled promises of engaging in more electrical design work within the traffic signals and street lighting teams. To be frank, these prospects dissipated rather quickly. Additionally, my interest has been piqued by the burgeoning field of machine learning within the industry. I am at a crossroads: should I continue to pursue a career in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, or would it be prudent to transition into machine learning before it is too late?",msaglam888,1,1.0,0,1699195164,2023-11-05 14:39:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17odam7/career_advice/,11,2023

I use to work at a facility that I was super comfortable in, knew everyone, worked very well with everyone and was respected. But I felt there was a ceiling to my opportunities I could obtain here and felt I needed to make a jump to another hospital but easier said than done I've come to realize.

I reached out to a former coworker (,first mistake I think) about his position and his hospital. He said the pay was great and the benefits are great. Ill get to train in specialties ive never trained in before which will grow my knowledge as a tech and it's a union, you get annual raises, time off. Something that first bothered me though was I wouldn't get 12 hr shifts like I have at my old hospital. It would be 8. I thought okay I can get over that. I applied and they immediately accepted without a in person interview, just phone. They went off by my old coworkers referral and I wasn't expecting it. I honestly wish I could have seen the hospital first and thay the process was slower. They immediately hired me and gave me a start date.

I put in my two weeks, was very sad to leave but figured onto better things. But that wasn't the case. Going to this new hospital hit me hard, the people are much much older than me, the patient population is different, the system and how they do things is different, everything. The 8 hour shifts are hard to get use to. And being the youngest there by ten years is pretty mind numbing. My old job had people of all shapes and sizes and ages. This one everyone is significantly more older than me. Managers seem annoyed that i'm new to the system. And I just miss miss my old job. It's been a week and I can't help but feel ashamed and.sad that I left a good job that I was comfortable in for four dollars more, union, and possible pension (even though my plan was to never stay in this hospital for more than 2 years). I'm scrambling to decide what to do, wait it out one more week or call my old manager and say I've made a mistake and if I could not come back to that specific hospital but another one under the same name that would be closer to me. But there's a chance there wouldn't even be possible.

17o7kfb,Should I give up my current job for a lower pay position within the company?,"The title sounds pretty stupid but hear me out.

My current job is pretty decent- good work life balance, the salary is ok, and the job is somewhat easy. The downside it is not very challenging. Career growth for someone in my position is limited. I can either become a manager or have a number added to my current title. Pretty much a dead-end for what I want to do . I have been trying to break into the AI field and  have been spending my free time obtaining the skills. However, it’s been pretty challenging to get a job since my background is in physics and my experience in software/computer science is all self-taught. 

Long story short, there is an intern position in my company for what I want to do. There is a really high chance I get it if I apply since my personal projects/skills are pretty much what they’re looking for. The downside is the pay might be 2 bands lower than my current pay. 

My heart wants to apply for it but my bank doesn’t.

17o56q1,Raise promises,"Hi all. 

Long story short, I have asked my corporate for raise on march 2023. They made millions of excuses why they can't do it now but promised a raise on September. The condition for this was to prepare my individual development plan. I have spend plenty of time to prepare it properly and goals were very realistic, traceable and measurable. Before September I have received several great offers from other companies and told to our HR manager about it. I asked is it possible my company can provide me equal conditions. And she sweared that on September they will launch the process for my raise and it will be much better than my current offers. That's why I thanked the companies for their offers but refused. And now my compony offered me a raise for 10%. I know that may sound good by the money from these 10% will be enough to by food for only one week in my country. The offers were like 2-3x from my salary. Of course I refused from this raise. The HR asked me for a conversation and said to me that I have no a very important position and without me their production will not drop drastically. That's true because my job related with quality of products. I understand that they may face problems with company's global quality management but nobody will stop our local company's production because of huge money loss (all this world only about money). Now I don't know what to do and very depressed. I have no job offers currently and can't change job now. The HR told me that the maximum I can expect is 15% raise (these % are worth anything only when you current salary is huge, otherwise it's literally 1 bottle of milk or something). No idea what to do with this. I trusted to much in company and this is my mistake.",konsvir,1,1.0,1,1699162133,2023-11-05 05:28:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17o56q1/raise_promises/,11,2023
17o413l,Negotiation beyond 2 weeks notice,"Hello,

I am currently leaving my position as an operating room nurse because I have been recruited and signed on for a contract that fits my family schedule and pays more. I have turned in my 2 week notice. Current employment is with a very small group and there was only 1 other operating room nurse there as well. I did not know that on the day I turned in my 2 week notice, she had to urgently move out of state for family issues and was gone. This puts the small hospital in quite a bind. My new contract has some built in breaks and I have offered to work some days. I am wanting to ask for my PTO being paid out (only 22 hours) and possibly a raise in exchange for staying on/ working a bit on my breaks. I want to help them, and not extort them. Any tips on how to word that request? I had casually floated the idea of me helping out and the manager was agreeable, but we did not go into details.

&#x200B;

Additional details so timeline makes sense. Last day at current job: 11/10. New job starts 11/13. Work for 1 week, then off for the week of Thanksgiving. Plan to offer to work at old job 2 days of the Thanksgiving break- whatever days they need me most. Then I have a long period of time for xmas break. Plan to offer to work 2 shifts/ week over xmas break.

17nymia,"My new boss is targeting me, I’ve developed anxiety.","For context: 

I’ve been a top performer at this company for 2 years, the only one in my department with a 98/100. However, I think my nationality holds me back. Still, I’m well liked and respected my all colleagues and always chosen for big projects. 

My direct manager has never been supportive towards my growth, but has also been pretty laid back and at least gave me autonomy to do my job because she heavily depends on my work ethic. She went on maternity leave. It was communicated to me that I’ll step in to temporarily lead in her place. 

Since then, the new senior boss in my department (who’s well respected) has taken a sudden dislike for me. During our initial 1:1’s I felt he only wanted to talk to me about personal things (what kind of jewelry do I like?) where I felt taken aback and brought the subject back to work. There were instances where I emailed/messaged him and would not get response for weeks or would get “we’ll chat tomorrow” everyday, and bail. I see him staring at me, and then avoiding to even sit in the same meeting room as me until others show up. I’m very uncomfortable. 

He is still receptive during our catch ups, but completely rips me apart in meetings with clients and other stakeholders. He nitpicks everything in public, and behaves nonchalant when I ask him privately. He doesn’t bother giving feedback directly so I have a chance to improve. The team leaders who used to have my back also have backed off. 

I’ve also been told my HR to me less “me” … less energetic and less “overwhelming” because I’m the complete opposite of my new super boss. I don’t consider this true and have taken feedback from my previous bosses, all agree I’m adaptable and extremely capable. But my weak point may be that I may not know diplomacy too well. 

I’m so depressed, the job market is not promising. And my self doubt is torturing me to a point I am becoming conscious of myself.

The role I am in now is always hectic and not in a field of  expertise that particularly interests me. I love the city I am in though as it is small and cozy.

I was looking at internal roles, and none that I would be interested in are ever in my city or within a commutable distance (as the city is not a huge metropolitan).

I saw a role that looked quite interesting however it is in a really busy city I am sure I would not like living in (been there to visit briefly before).

Looking at the processes, it seems like it would all take a minimum of 5 months (2 months application and interviews, and then 3 months notice from my current role). Assuming this all goes as is, I’d only have about 10 months till I have been with the company 2 years (the plan was to always leave shortly afterwards). Given the time to learn a new job, that is like only 6 months of actually being settled in the job

I know barely anyone in this new bigger city and thus I don’t know if it is worth it to even apply for the job. It is still on my mind because I am thinking there could be the option to work from my city and not have to relocate.

I don’t know if I should just stay in my current position or pursue an internal move. There are a lot of other divisions that are more aligned with my long term interests but career wise I am planning a total shift anyway in the next 5 years so not sure if it even matters.

I don't want to work in development or helpdesk because it's soulcrushing to me and I'm also long outside the field. I have some experience managing people, delivering results and training people. I have a PSM1 but have not been an active SCRUM master for any team as of now.

17ns96x,I'm potentially losing my job. Should I (f30) take a chance and move to be with my boyfriend (m36)?,"Hi Reddit. I really need an outside perspective on this sudden dilemma I'm in. 

I'm in a fairly new relationship. I met my boyfriend about 6 months ago on Tinder while he was visiting my city. We met and I quickly learned that he actually didn't live here, but pretty far away, on the other side of the country. He had wanted to move in to the city where I live for a long time, but can't because he has shared custody for a little child. 

We both said to eachother that this is probably going to be difficult, but let's meet again, why not. We really hit it off, talked a lot, on the phone and text. I went to visit him. He visited me. I visited him again, and so on and so on. I feel really comfortable around him, have opened up about vulnerable things, we laugh a lot, he is so easy to talk to, open minded. I feel like we have a connection that I don't think I'll find too often in others. I fell for him and he feels the same way, despite the difficult situation.

Things have happened pretty fast. We have talked about the future, how a long distance relationship isn't ideal for any of us, but at the same time kind of accepted that we can do this for a while and see how it goes, plan trips to each other, take our time. Meanwhile I have met his parentes, his kid, he has some stuff at my place. It's become serious. 

Then I'm hit with a curve ball at work. I have an okay job that I've liked so far. Last week management told us that they would have to let go of nearly half of everyone in my department. All of us got an offer of leaving ""voluntarily"" and recieve six months pay. If we choose to stay, we're still at risk of being let go, but without the six months pay. I could gamble on staying, but I don't feel safe. I have a few days left to decide. 


If I leave, things would be considerably easier relationship-wise. I'm considering trying freelance work, something that is pretty normal i my field. I already work some freelance on the side. I have connections and think it could work out. While it will be challenging, it could be a way to grow and work on a wider range of projects than I do now. Potentially letting go of the stability of a steady job (at least until recently...) makes me nervous though. I could live in his city and really figure out if we are a good fit, something that is challenging while doing long distance.

I'm at a crossroad both in my job and my relationship. I don't think the relationship will work if I choose to stay. I want it to work, but I'm afraid of jumping into the unknown. I would have to move, at least to some extent. I'm imagining working in both cities (I already own an apartment where I live now), at least until I feel more secure. There is definetely a chance it won't work out anyway, but at least I know I've tried. If it doesn't work out I can fly back to my city and apartment and continue freelancing or look for a new job.

So Reddit, should I leave with my 6 months pay and move cities to be with my boyfriend?",excuse_me_where_is,1,0.3799999952316284,8,1699123463,2023-11-04 18:44:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ns96x/im_potentially_losing_my_job_should_i_f30_take_a/,11,2023
17nrkah,Resources for transforming from a blue collar manager to a white collar leader?,"After 15 years of being on the front lines of a blue collar industry, I've recently been promoted to part of the senior leadership team. We're a smaller organization, so our SLT is small, and we wear a lot of hats. This promotion was given knowing full well that while I'm a subject matter expert in my industry, I'm lacking in high level business analytics, financial reporting, and some of the other finer details that one would expect from senior level management. 

While I've found and am utilizing resources for the technical knowledge, I'm hoping that someone might be able to point me in the right direction for becoming a more well rounded business leader. 

I still very much struggle with getting out of the technician mindset, and it can be difficult for me to keep up in high level strategy and growth discussions without reverting to that which I've always known.

This involves a variety of this such as envisioning what you’d want to be written on your tombstone, or how you would like to be remembered. It’s a really easy to implement technique especially if you’re finding yourself getting carried away with your daily goals and tasks.  
Some of the helpful tips involve the use of mentors and the relationships you’ve built with people over time. I broke this down in depth here to share with you - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T3jULhj4nE

17nqias,Unsure how public (LinkedIn) to make my plan to change career,"Hey,

I've had a career for about 10 years now in one industry, but for a couple of years now I've been training and studying to do something totally different.

I think I'm now ready to make the change - and I find myself unemployed at the moment so it's a good time to go for it. But, I'm worried that if I go for the new jobs and don't manage to get one, I'll need to go back to the old career while I continue to train and study further. It's a skills-based thing so I just need to 'get good'.

Mainly I'm worried at the moment about changing up my LinkedIn account to be all about my hopeful new career. At the moment it talks a lot about my old job and nothing at all about what I now actually want to do. And all my connections are related to my old industry too.

If I swap all of that to the new industry and then don't get a job anytime soon, I'll need to change it all back again - that feels like a bit of a 'climb down' and like something I really don't want to face.

Anyone have any experience or suggestions with something like this?

17nq5u2,Unsure what to do.,"Hi there, I’m 27 year old male In Bc Canada, my background is 6-7 years of landscape construction experience and 9 months as an aircraft mechanic apprentice. As a landscaper I worked my way up to forman and running my own crew, I enjoyed the job. Yes it’s very labour intensive, have to work outdoors in the elements. But it’s relatively stress free and I liked building landscapes. Obviously didn’t make me rich but at a forman wage around 35 an hour it’s not bad. I spent 2 years in aircraft mechanic school and now I’m 10 months into my apprenticeship (still 12-24 months left). I didn’t expect to come out of school and make 20 bucks an hour but here we are. Even once I complete my apprenticeship and pass my licensing exam my wage will only go up to around 32 an hour. Pay is a part of it but I also am not enjoying aviation. It’s a very high stress environment and it’s hard not to bring it home with you. All I’ve been thinking about lately is how much more I enjoyed my old job then I do this. Yes I regret spending the tuition money but I still learned lots.

17np0td,Am I A Bad Leader?,"Hi,  
  
A few weeks ago, I wrote about an employee on my team that I was having friction with and the overall advice was to not trust this person so much and contact HR. I have done both and I appreciate the advice.  
  
However, this week, I learned that I have upset someone else and I am wondering if I am a bad boss and leader. My confidence has really taken a hit and I am hoping for some perspective here.  
  
For this new situation, I am a champion of two other women for a very complex, critical, time sensitive project. I learned on Wednesday that something I said two weeks ago made one of them feel diminished and de-motivated.  
  
What I had said was, ""We are near the end of the year and the need to execute and deliver results is increasing. This is not a stretch assignment for me and I want to really get laser focused on what the most immediate next steps are and the people responsible for those steps and focus on just getting the deliverables done over the next month. Do you agree?""  
  
Well, this woman took my ""this is not a stretch assignment for me"" comment to mean that I didnt value the work she has done up to this point. I think she is phenomenal and it was not my intent at all.  
  
Also, on Wednesday, she shared that there were two times over the past three months that I interrupted her. I apologized right then and there and then I said I was open to any other feedback she may have and I would just listen. I sat quietly while she named the management style of other leaders in the Company that she likes better than my style and told me that I was not ""giving her room to spread her wings and fly"".  
  
I simply nodded and said I was so grateful that she was comfortable sharing with me and we proposed that going forward in a moment, she could always say ""safe space for feedback...it bothers me when you do or say XYZ"". I was a little choked up and misty eyed to think I could have hurt her and she saw me having that reaction.  
  
Well, today, Friday, I learned that she went around bad mouthing me and crying to much more senior people in the organization. My boss is a pleaser and not a loyal or supportive person and one of the leaders shared that this woman had cried about me. My boss has told me to take a major step back , not offer any suggestions and to trust that the more senior person's belief that this woman can get the job done without my championing and support.  
  
I am three levels above her with 15 more years work experience and she has acknowledged that ""the tactical execution is not as fun and engaging as brainstorming and doing ""What if"" discussions with others"". I am genuinely concerned that this woman doesnt have the experience or ability to get the work done. We manufacture medical devices and our work truly does help save lives and make lives better. This project will hopefully have a good outcome and help others.  
  
I am hurt, scared, worried for my reputation, worried that I am jerk to others and just don't see it about myself. I am feeling like I just dont belong in this environment. I am the one feeling devalued. I think she is picking up on my direct style and a close relative has told me previously that I have a way with words that can make her feel she isn't doing as much as I am. I dont really think that - I think this relative is amazing, but I wonder if my style is simply lacking or is it the new generation of people in the workforce and their expectations that is the problem or am I just having bad luck with work issues close in time to each other?",nola_gal_61506,2,0.75,8,1699114433,2023-11-04 16:13:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17np0td/am_i_a_bad_leader/,11,2023

I want to be onboarded full-time into the company, which I have been told will happen eventually (6-10 months). The job is decent. It is WFH, with good hours, and a lot of independence.

I gave it a week and then thought maybe she didn’t see my email. So I emailed again and then called and got sent to her voicemail.

She emailed back saying she was so sorry but it’s been really hectic and the boss had an emergency so she’ll give me a call in a few days but she is still wanting me to come in.

Well I waited for a week. Still no call or email. So I emailed a brief follow up.

I’ve been waiting a week since I sent that last email and want to send a follow up but I checked their indeed page and sure enough the job position has been taken down.

17nkj42,"50F, in soul destroying nonprofit job. No retirement savings, preparing for 2 surgeries. Looking to start applying for new job while recovering. Seeking advice.","30th year in nonprofit & university community education & partnership work. Earned PSLF June 2023. 

Over the last 2 years: 
• Due to severe perimenopause symptoms at 48, while on 6 week FMLA was invited to apply for a former colleagues position. Was heading into 8th year of job, 7th year of homeownership, just starting to get settled. Applied for colleague’s job just to see my situation in our market & was offered job. Almost doubled my salary. Took job but wasn’t a good fit, quit after 8 months. Unemployed 6 months, decided to take job offer in hometown & sell home. 

Now: 
Began new job April 2023. Same salary as job I left at year 8. Shitshow job. No support. But now, I have no savings (took out 8 year job retirement savings to pay off debt & help parent with home repairs - I am living with one parent). Other parent lives in city where former jobs were. 

I am so mentally & emotionally defeated I don’t know what to do. Add that now I am having 2 surgeries within the next 6 weeks to address perimenopausal issues (both are minimally invasive & each should have 1-2 week recovery time). 

The job I have is Deputy Director. My boss, Executive Director, is going on sabbatical (planning for Dec - April & no one in the entire org from board to staff is prepared). I no longer care. 

I know one isn’t supposed to leave a job without another lined up. 

I do not want to work in public service anymore. I am thinking to try to apply for remote positions, maybe with colleges & universities in some form of admin role but there is so much I do not know how to do. 

Maybe I should suck it up through full recovery. Even so, I have realized I have made poor decisions over my whole career accepting being paid so much less than what I am worth to be used as a work mule with no further professional development. 

What are next steps I should take (assuming the main one is stay in current job until full recovery & start applying now for whatever seems best). I know I will have to work full time the rest of my life no breaks. That’s fine: I have no significant other, no kids & no prospects. I am prepared to do whatever I need to take care of myself because I have no support. I am simply wondering how to do so with less stress so I can maybe enjoy some of the life I have left. 

Serious replies most appreciated. I am a real person & this is not a AI post. DM me if you need more info to give solid actionable advice.

17nin58,Moving from operations to HR?,"I've been thinking about moving into the HR field but I have some thoughts on this being income realistic, based on where I'm at in my current career. I'm ***open*** to a pay cut but not drastically so (probably would settle for $90k base min from a current base of $120k). I've been in operations for some time and have been progressed a good bit; from starting entry-level, to being a director, and serving as a corp consultant. 

My idea to transition into HR is to get SHRM-CR and DEI certified. I also have a bachelors that compliments HR. I'm looking into HR as being something that could invigorate more passion. The grind of operations isn't terrible for me but it has been my bread and butter since I could work. I have never explored out of it but have been in roles where a HR skillset plays a part every day (talent managing a team, recruiting, providing org health, etc. It speaks to me.)

Does this sound feasible? If so, for HR professionals, would it be realistic to aim for HRBP roles as a starting point?  I feel there could be a win here in having a lot of built-in credibility day one with the prime audience that HR caters to - operations and business people in general. The certs I'm looking to get I feel are a good counter to the lack of direct experience with HR experience with everything else considered.

17nhpo3,How to not ruin the job opportunity of a lifetime?,"How to not ruin chance of a lifetime?

I did it, I worked my way up to an executive position through a sales path. Something I think I always wanted. Hopefully it’s what I hoped it would be. 

I just accepted a job as National Director of Sales at a semi established startup company. It’s in a field I am very familiar with after working in sales for 10 years. I have 20 years of outside sales experience in healthcare and 10 in my specialty. I have bout 14 months of actual hands on sales management experience with a team of 8. I grew a lot over the last 14 months but I fear it is not enough. At my new company I will report directly to the CEO/BOD and am tasked with possibly doubling revenue in a year and scaling the sales team from 8 to 20. I would also likely hire a layer of management in the next year. I am worried I am going to run into the Peter Principle and rise to the level of incompetence. 

I have the whole month of November off in between jobs. Having this kind of time off is a first for me. My question is, what can I do to best prepare myself for this high pressure, high travel, high work load, and fairly high paying job during this time? What books should I read? Classes I could take? Gurus to follow? Business coach to hire? What routine should I try to create now and carry through into the job?

I’m weak at executive function, organization, memorization, and handling difficult personnel conversations. 

I excel at industry knowledge and GTM strategy in this specific field. I am a creative problem solver, a bit of a workaholic, a good consensus gatherer, a good communicator, and I hope a decent leader.

17negdk,Navigating Career Challenges in a Small IT Company,"I'm a bit puzzled at the moment. I've spent nearly two years working at a small IT servicing company where I've primarily undertaken projects for modest-sized companies and clients. The technology stack in use at my company is a dated ASP.NET framework, and the development practices here are rather questionable, lacking both unit testing and a version control system. I've been actively seeking new job opportunities since last December, but the recent layoffs have likely complicated my prospects, I did manage to get job offers since past 9 months but they are very questionable companies with very bad reviews, I also need to improve my leetcode skills.

  
To improve my resume, I decided to explore r/EngineeringResumes. I noticed that many people with less than 2 years of experience have significant projects, complete with specific metrics outlined as bullet points on their resumes, such as ""increased business by x%, resulting in y% profit growth,"" and so on. On the other hand, the websites and applications I've worked on have been relatively small in scale, and I've received minimal feedback beyond ""the app is functioning as expected after deployment."" I'm concerned that this lack of measurable metrics may hinder my job search. Interestingly, some of my friends face a similar situation on their resumes, and when I question about it, their responses tend to be rather vague, like ""I received it from my team lead,"" and so forth.

17ncdd7,Career Advice: CFP?,"Hey there,

I’m a CPA with one year of tax prep experience at B4 in Chicago. It is a very fast paced work life and it seems like even in non-busy season times there is no break. The clients are incredibly larger than I could have ever imagined, and I am not helping out everyday w2 friends and family type clients and businesses like I envisioned I would when joining tax. I really enjoy tax and understand tax season has long hours but I would like to work somewhere that puts the hours of tax season in its place and offers more comfortable hours the rest of the year, which has not been the case at B4. I love personal finances and would love the idea of helping people with all of the things the CFP exam entails. 

So ideally, I will someday do both financial planning and tax. 

My question is what other options are out there or what do you recommend I do? 

Planning to stay at least another year and a half to put me at 2.5 years as this will ensure I become “senior” first. Then options I’m considering:

-A family friend of mine has a CPA tax partnership and said he would let me join the company and become partner within 3-4 years and he would not make me buy in even. (There is one other partner) This is also guaranteed as he is close to retirement age and we are close and go to church together. Would be way simpler clients, probably a pay cut for the first few years but then the sky is the limit once partner. With this alternative I may not get to do CFP work however so I’ve thought about getting CFP/CFP experience and then joining him and running my own CFP business while helping out the tax side also. 

-Join a fee-based CFP firm and sit for CFP exam. There I would get my 2-3 years experience and fulfill my greatest passion which is personal finances. I’ve even thought about joining the money guy team in TN. I have loved listening to them and it would be a dream come true to be on staff there.

-Join a firm that does both CFP and CPA work. A company of this caliber recently recruited me for a tax position and I loved their company but respectfully declined for now. I could always ask them to make a position that does both CFP and tax work, though currently the company has taxes in a sub company. This way I could do both tax and CFP work. 

-Stay in public accounting and climb the ladder baby.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.",Lmoneymartin1,1,1.0,0,1699066708,2023-11-04 02:58:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ncdd7/career_advice_cfp/,11,2023
17nc5tz,Should I look to move on from IT?,"
Hi everyone, I’m considering transitioning out of IT.

Don’t get me wrong, I like working in IT and I’m good at it. I’ve spent 5 years putting as much effort as possible into becoming as good as I can be. I started as help desk and moved my way up to a team lead on an enterprise service desk all while I finished my degree full time. I’m now a system admin on the support team at a medium sized software company. I’ve went from making 40k to 85k in that time which isn’t bad,(very high cost of living state) but damn did I ever work for it…I have gotten a couple certifications.

For me the most satisfying and gratifying type of work is to create. To make something that was not there before and share it. My hope was that I would find myself designing systems. Sadly after a near tireless effort I find myself feeling more and more like IT is basically just clicking buttons that other people have made for you. 

My recent work powershell has made me feel more fulfilled than I have in several years. Building actually useful tools for my team is awesome. All self prompted to speed up repetitive work I was doing. It makes me wonder if I would enjoy software development more. (Very simple scripts to be clear)

I’m working with my current company now to start transitions into an technically demanding role, but I was not given a timeline. Management has been receptive to it, but even still I suspect I’ll have to push my way in like I’ve always had to before which is frustrating.

Ultimately, I’ve come to realize that after 5 years of professional experience I basically have no real skills I can take outside of IT. Even with my certifications, experience and advanced knowledge on a number of topics I’m just pushing buttons, specifically buttons that Microsoft has made (Maybe Linux world is more fun, but haven’t don’t much work there) or worse plugging in monitors and troubleshooting really boring things…basic end user support.

Another issue I have is all the advanced training I have I had to seek out “almost” completely on my own. There is learning on the job sure, but it’s fairly surface level/functional. I don’t see how anyone would grow out of a role that way and frankly that does appear to be how it works in the real world. Some people regardless of their effort on the job, just stay at the same level forever unless they skill up outside of work. 


This is how I’ve been able to grow technical and get pay boosts, (in addition to working very hard on the job) but improving my skills in a work environment where learning and work is more interconnected would be a huge relief. Maybe I’d start feeling comfortable to watch a movie or play a video game once in a while. I basically can’t do that anymore without feeling guilty for not studying..

Not completely unrelated, I’m interested in mixed reality. I will be experimenting with c++ to start working in unreal engine.

I’m not sure what I’m asking here. I guess:

Is this just a phase that I’ll get to the other side of once I’m in infrastructure proper or should I start considering maybe a coding bootcamp or something?

Has anyone else in IT ever felt similar? 

Appreciate all response.

17n9gqr,Career Advice LATAM I'm Exaggerating? What should I do?,"Hello everyone thanks in advance for your advice. I really appreciate each comment.

I’m currently looking for a change in my career I’m exhausted/burnt-out of my current role.

29M-No kids- Finance degree – Savings 8 months of expenses

My career:

**LATAM based -> 2yr at strategy financial firm including 6 mo internship (-> 2 year at boutique investment bank then in the same firm 3 year in the family office -> 1.5 yr at at a Impact Fund.**

I want a change in my career per the following reasons:

* The relationship with my boss is not good – when we have catch-ups I feel like I bother him and he is just like “tell me what I need to hear and go”.
* He is always like “I’m here to help” but the real thing is that he expects me to send the tasks done and I feel like I bother him with my questions.
* In my previous jobs the relationship with my boss had a like a coaching part that I enjoyed I don’t know if it is normally to not have that part in the jobs.
* We were a 3 people team that carried out the most part of the writing- modeling 2 left and I will be alone while they hire them at the begging of the next year.
* Even tough this job is really interesting from the impact part – we invest to help vulnerable people, I find that it’s a really challenging job as per the following reasons:

1. I struggle and don’t enjoy like seeing behind the numbers in the financial models – when they asked me for a specific detail, trend, change, in a margin or something like that.
2. Presentations to the comitee gave me a lot of anxiety I always think that I am not going to have the answer for every question and that I am not going to express my self with fluent. I'm aware of the progress I've made developing this skill.
3. We need to write memos of +50 pages in English and I found it difficult I don’t enjoy writing them but I’m aware of the progress I have made developing that skill.

I see that financial modelling is a valuable skill that jobs require - I learnt to build complex models because of my experience in investment banking I learnt the hard way however I found I don’t enjoy building/analyzing them worse under pressure.

I think my salary is well for my country USD 37K per year (min wage is USD 6K/year) but I don’t know what do you think?

I ended up in Investment Banking-Funds because I liked the part of understanding new companies/models every new deal it is not monotonous however the pressure for invest is high and I realized I don’t enjoy having that pressure. On my previous job they highlighted my ability to connect with people (maybe commercial) and usually I enjoy listening to the people stories

**Here are my thoughts of possible paths:**

\- Quit and study Python and CFA one level while looking for a job

\- FP&A for relieving for pressure however monotonous day might be boring (this was the reason of quitting my first job)

\- Find a new job in VC-PE funds – hoping find a better leader

\- Strategy in a start-up

\- Corporate development in a company

It potentially suggests that the #MeToo movement and other feminist causes have been effective in stopping men from seeing women in the workplace as potential romantic options.

The amount of couples meeting through friends is also down from 34% to 20% while dating apps now account for around 40% of couplings.

But basically what happened is that I noticed one of the accounts that I work had many technical errors which caused our clients to be billed at an incorrect rate. 

On Monday, I wrote up a whole well thought out email to management informing them of this asking them what to do. On Wednesday I messaged the manager asking for an update and they told me that they will look into it. On Thursday I asked for another update, no response. Yet management is still responding to other people’s email threads and all but just ignoring me. I hate being a bother but the client is very upset and i’m not sure how to handle it.

20yo/eastern europe

hello, guys. i hope at least someone can recommend me anything. any ideas can be useful for me. the problem is: i am around 20 and i have no idea where i can work or study. i dont have any education except school. i dont really have any skills except kinda good level of english and photoshop. can someone recommend me anything that gonna be nice paid? university major or skill that i can learn by myself, it doesn’t matter. i am just so tired of working on shitty low paid jobs with communication with customers always (like cashier or consultant in the mass market shops and stuff) 
i wish my future work could be at least with less communication with usual people.
i am not seeking for some kind of ideal job, i just want a well paid skill that i can develop and that can bring me opportunities which are connected with money. 

in the past i was thinking about studying psychology but changed my mind cause i am not very emotionally stable as well. i am too sensitive and probably gonna be tired of people and their thoughts soon. 
just want something more calm and lonely.

i was doing web design but stopped it cause of the competition and ai development.

i want it to be my profession, not something unserious and i am ready to go to uni if it gonna worth.

Anyway I discovered this position does not actually have any responsibility. I do not actually answer to anyone and I have literally nothing to produce. The previous person essentially reworded emails and asked other people for answers or to do their work.

I think this is one of those positions created because in order to have someone else be promoted , they have the be managing two people under them. 

In all honesty, I think the next four people I work with are doing the same thing and pretending to create anything of value. Even when our director went on vacation for two weeks....nobody asked us for anything. They are all just making stuff up about how the 15 minutes to fill out a form took like 4 hours. 

I could stay where I am. The biggest downside is that if I were to have to move somewhere else or if something better comes by.... I would have been doing nothing and developing no actual on the job skills. 

If someone asks me what I do... It's really difficult to say anything other than ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I feel like I work one or two hours out of the week.

17n21b7,How do I say ‘no’,"

At my company, I have been supporting a team that is separate from my own for over nine months now. My intentions of doing this was to gain experience with this new team with the goal of being able to join it permanently. I have applied for two positions within this team structure And was never given any feedback for why not being selected for an interview. Much of this business structure is confidential, so in some sense there is not the typical give-and-take response as a normal interview process. I just concluded my final week with the team, and with just a couple days before I return to my normal assignment, that team has reached back out and asked if I would be interested in extending for another two months.  

I feel as though I’m in a spot where I am delaying my own personal development with my current permanent position, by spending time with this team, that seems to not be interested in taking me on permanently. 

Considering that I do want to be on this team, but I also don’t want to delay my own personal development.

17myhzy,Am I bad at my job or is too much expected of me,"I manage a small cafe which has become increasingly busy over the last few months. The owner of the business got a full time job, and is more or less unavailable throughout the day to help if anything goes awry. As the manager of the cafe I must oversee staff scheduling, ordering inventory, emailing invoices, managing the email, overseeing cafe operations, training, and overall being an active participant in the day-to-day of the cafe. I am the head barista as well as the manager, and I have been finding the tasks increasingly difficult. It's so busy that the weekend crew, with only 4 hours in the day to do prep, clean, and put away an order cannot complete all their tasks. This has left the cafe in disarray because it simply cannot be done! During the week we have 4 hour line ups. People are calling in left and right. I am so exhausted because I truly feel this is too much for one person to handle, however I am having trouble deciphering whether I am just bad at my job or if it's too much for one person. 

In perspective: we have about 11
 staff, 6 of which are students and the other 5 full time. The students call in a lot for ""burn out"" which is fair but it puts a lot of pressure on the remaining staff to do the work even though it's already nearly impossible with full staffing. Mine and the full timers morale is plummeting and I feel it's impacting the cafe. I need to know if I am justified in feeling this way or if it's a mindset and I am just bad at it lol. I feel bad because the owner is a nice guy but he did get a full time job and isn't as available to help out when possible. The cafe has flooded, the coffee brewer has stopped working, gelato has melted, staff call in, and for he most part I have to find ways to deal with it myself on top of all my other tasks and trying to be a compassionate boss for my staff.  Further, we have special events which I am solely responsible for. Like scooping 400 gelato cups for an event, moving an entire cafe across to another building by myself to set up for a special pop up, and so forth. Its been really hard. Please crucify me I need to get knocked down a peg. I feel like I am invaluable in all the stuff I do for the cafe but maybe I am doing the bare minimum as the cafe manager, and I am simply a narcissist? I need to excel in everything I do and not knowing if I am a terrible employee or if this is just too much one person is really giving me tremendous anxiety.

17mxtn7,I don’t know what to do for a career and I’ve been thinking for so long,"Hello! I need some advice, I’ve been trying to think of a career I want to pursue and I also want to go to college, but I’m stuck, i have a few careers in mind but each had their own drawback that seems like I wouldn’t enjoy it, but I’m not sure, I’d like to make comic books, but breaking into the industry is incredible hard and making my own work would be cool but I doubt it would be stable as it’s own career and I just don’t know if I’d wanna go to college and go through those 4 years for it to just fail, 

animation is another but mainly 2d animation, but most of the work here in the U.S doesn’t really interest me, there’s more than enough opportunities for 2D animation but I wanna work on something action related or something similar, which isn’t very abundant here as most animation is either 3D or for kids, there’s some expectations but I’m much more interested in the japenese anime industry with how diverse the work is and many more opportunities for 2D work that interest me, but getting a job as a foreigner would be hard enough, not to mention the pretty bad management of most Japanese animation companies.

I’ve also been interested in software development or game development, but I have a simple coding class I’m currently taking and I just don’t think programming is for me, it was my dream career but I’m not to sure anymore

Game design would be another one I’m interested in since it would be more creative like making character designs and thinks like that, combining the art and game dream together but I’m still just not sure that it would be something worth pursuing 

CSI work was another but I think all of the goryness would be to much

A bit about me - I am 26, am currently holding a corporate position of a market analyst.
Don’t know how long I can go on for because I find myself crying and shaking from anxiety on a constant basis. I know i’m not a particularly stress-resistant individual but don’t know what I could do to earn living without compromising my mental health. Because of stress, I have hives, eczema, digestive issues and more. 
I can’t handle the ridiculous amount of work and pressure, mandatory overtime, disrespectful communication, low pay and so on…
I am so very tired and want to have a job without having a full on breakdown at least once a week.
Would love to hear suggestions on work positions that you think would work better for me… preferably something I could do from home because anxiety. I am happy to learn a new skill if needed. Currently i hold Bachelors and Masters in analytics.

I sent a text to my manager that I am struggling with a few things and I am getting frustrated with the job.

I don't buy the 'we're busy' excuse. Name me one company that isn't busy. It is not a unique case. Additionally, I am on a fair bit of money, and even more when probation is complete (although suspecting it will fail), so it's not in their benefit for me to do jack.

I am already paranoid I might be let go because they are too busy (yep, makes total sense). However I am still invited to Xmas party, which I have no interest.

17mvyc2,Career/School Guidance,"Hey there,

I'm at a big crossroads in my life and could use some guidance. Here we go:

I've been working in IT at an architecture firm on a temporary internship that wraps up on December 1. I was actually offered a full-time gig at the same place, but I turned it down for a few good reasons. The commute was a massive time-eater, and I've come to realize I can't stand the whole office culture thing. Plus, everyone else at the company is basically my parents' age, so I often felt like the odd one out.

So here's where the crossroads come in. I currently live with my girlfriend, and we've been working full-time jobs since 2021 while I'm doing online school. I just can't bring myself to commit to the whole 9-5 grind. I really want to go to university, but I'm not sure I can handle both work and school. On top of that, we've got an apartment to keep up with.

I'm on the hunt for a more flexible job that lets me work around my class schedule. I used to have a remote job that was amazing for its flexibility, but I felt pretty isolated trying to balance both work and college remotely. Now, working in an office feels even worse. I'm thinking going to university might be a good way to make some new friends.

My girlfriend and I share a huge passion for travel. We've done a few summer trips abroad and can't get enough. But here's the snag – most jobs only give you a measly two weeks or less of vacation time. Right now, we've got about $10,000 in savings.

My girlfriend is pulling in $18 an hour, and I'm making $23 an hour.

So, here's the big question: Do I go all-in on school and chase that bachelor's degree in CS and restart my career later in my 20’s, or do I stick with a full-time job to pay the bills?

I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and advice. Help me make sense of this career crossroads! Thanks, everyone.",capeXV,1,1.0,1,1699020572,2023-11-03 14:09:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17mvyc2/careerschool_guidance/,11,2023

Commute is 90% country roads and would see little to zero traffic. I would lose time in the commute but would actually save money on transportation as I currently put about 20k miles a year on my personal car traveling for work and the prospective job would include a company truck and gas card. Job is with the same company and would be a step into a leadership position. I feel like it’s worth mentioning that if I stay in my current role, I will be eligible for a progression to the next level of engineer in ~1.5 years and the pay would be the same as the onsite job I’m considering applying for, but would keep the hybrid schedule and have Friday’s off (still having to wear and tear on my personal vehicle though.)

A few different construction jobs. Many different factory jobs. My biggest problem is boredom... I know it sounds ridiculous. I've heard it all. "" everyone gets bored at their job"" "" oh your just lazy"" ""thats just an excuse"". I seriously don't understand it's as if my brain isn't supposed to be in this world. The second I start the job it's that horrible orientation. Lasting anywhere from 1 to 4 hours. I nod off from the boredom. And most of the factories test us at the end which I pass and go into work the next day. I'm at work thinking of all the things I could have with a job ( an apartment, food, a vr headset ive been wanting for a while) which from what im told is what im supposed to do to get through the day. Then a few hours go by that feels like days and it's lunchtime. I eat a healthy meal ( salad with eggs and a hams sandwich) which, from what I heard, helps with productivity. Then nearing the end of my break the dread kicks in as I walk back to my station or worksite. And by this point I know what im doing and I'm already bored. The rest of the day get consecutively worse. I do this for either 1 week or 3( I've heard after the third week it's supposed to get easier, it doesn't) I will say the longest I had ever had a job was this factory which switched me spots just around the time I got bored to a new spot to learn. Eventually I learned that whole factory and quit because everything got predictable and I knew what I was doing. Then I quit. I hated being homeless so it definitely isn't some weird moral thing.

17mpa2e,Brand new unhappy team,"I’ve been at my company and current role for more than a year. I manage a team and my team is fairly happy based on the recent employee survey. I really enjoyed the work and fairly happy with my role.

I was recently told that the company will be moving me into a different area under the same umbrella managing a brand new team. More staff. Completely different work. The new team used to have a couple of managers and they  decided to axe one of the managers, combine the team under one manager which will be managed by me. The existing manager will manage my existing team instead. 

Because we’re all under the same umbrella and same manager, I often heard from the other two managers that they are struggling with the workloads and their team. Their team are very unhappy based on the employee survey. 

I’m really shocked about the change. 1.
If two managers can’t manage the workload, I’m worried that I won’t be able to. Pretty much setting me up for failure. 2. The team is already very unhappy. I felt like I’m being put on an impossible task to boost the morale. 

I’m just really overwhelmed. I do want to talk to my boss. But… how do I bring this up. What should I say? I know I’m supposed to see this as an opportunity. But I felt really defeated because I saw my existing role as an opportunity too and worked very hard to build my reputation.

17mmdb6,Felon looking for work,"I wanted to see if anyone involved in Hiring or HR can give me some ""short notice"" advice. I will cut right to the chase. I just got home from Federal Prison a few months ago. I did 18 months on a felony drug trafficking conviction, am currently on federal probation, and am absolutely trying to live my life the right way. I ABSOLUTELY learned my lesson, to say the least!! I know this is a BIG deal, but it is the only thing on my record except for a simple assault misdemeanor for a fight I was involved in about 13 years ago. 

To make a long story short, I had a phone interview for a job working in a foundry today and they asked me to come in for an in-person interview tomorrow. At the end of the phone call, the HR lady told me they would be doing a background check. How should I go about addressing this with my employer? Do I wait until they ask about it? Do I give them a heads up about the incident before they (possibly) find it on their own? If they just type my name in any search engine, they will get all the dirt they need, believe me. It was a big deal locally. 

I read that some background checks are only run on a state level and this was a federal conviction. It's a labor job. I know the felony drug conviction looks terrible, but will that be a big enough deterrent for them to NOT want to hire me? I don't use any drugs or even drink alcohol anymore. I made a huge 180 in my behavior. I am really dedicated on living an honest and respectable life now.

Stuff like ""I think you should be honest beforehand because they will probably find out anyway"" from those who have never even had a job isn't going to help me here. So, if anyone has any direct knowledge of, or advice, drawn from experience on what I should expect or do, please let me know. I respectfully ask those WITHOUT hiring or management experience to refrain from giving me their opinions or ""what I would do"" statements. I already understand stuff like ""being proactive and up front MAY look a little better."" I get it. I would like to know what HR and HIRING STAFF would  like to see and/or are concerned about.

Also, if you have a felony and have dealt with something similar, I would love to hear from you as well!! Thank you!",Electrical-Candle652,1,1.0,2,1698983710,2023-11-03 03:55:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17mmdb6/felon_looking_for_work/,11,2023

17mf8ko,Looking for advice on how to adjust to being an engineer for 8 hours a day as a new college graduate,"Context:

I'm an early 20s M who graduated with a 3.9 GPA and a Computer Engineering degree around 6 months ago, and have been working at a semiconductor company for 5 months.

In college I definitely had very stressful semesters, but the last two years I could basically minmax the effort needed for an A and be able to enjoy what I would consider large amounts of free time to go to social events / workout / get high / etc.

Now I have a 9-5 engineering job, which I am extremely thankful for. I just feel constant dissatisfaction with having so much of my time taken by a corporation that I have a hard time giving 2 shits about. I see everyone around me (especially the more HR types) seeming to care about The Company and apparently being able to easily get into their work and be fulfilled churning it out before the vague deadlines that exist.

I am realizing that if I continue this path I will have to adapt, and I can tell in some ways I already have. Part of me wants to be someone who is able to take on that engineering identity and be an efficient cog in the machine. It is just a different mindset than what I molded for myself in college.

I suppose what I'm asking for is anecdotal experience and just general advice on my situation from those who have experienced something similar.

17mea6b,"[M24] Graduated from college about a year ago, got a sales job, hated it, transitioned to a seasonal role to get away from home and figured myself out now I'm back home, unemployed and the only thing I'm qualified for is sales.","Context:

I graduated from college in December of 22 with a degree in Communications. It wasn't the best degree decision but quite frankly I wasn't in a very good way of thinking in college and needed something easy to get a degree and get out. (I was very depressed and dealing with alcohol and drug abuse at the time, I'm doing much better on that front now). Not that it's a bad degree by any means, it's very applicable, but I changed my major to it later in college and didn't really receive any guidance on how to build a resume with it. So getting a job were I can support myself in the field is extremely difficult in this market. 

Now only to the topic at hand. Sales. I sold mattresses part-time in college and did okay at it. It was a weekend gig and I didn't make much money but I also didn't have to do a whole lot of work quite frankly. Next I randomly got an internship my sophomore year of college in which I got my life and health and did insurance sales for a brief period of time before COVID screwed everything up and I was back at home with my parents. So combined so far that's about a year of sales experience in my professional career. After that I worked in a warehouse part-time for the rest of college and it was a fantastic job, really really enjoyed it and the people that I worked with. When it came time to graduate I figured I would get a real sales role and that would be my profession, my experience thus far had been very educational but I also had to partake in the GRIND of sales before I had more or less just shadowed others in my internship and done a little mattress sales myself in a retail environment. 

So I took a role that was down the street from where I was already living at a copier sales organization and I absolutely despised it every single day. I was doing in-person business-to-business cold calling in an industry that is becoming less and less marketable to small businesses as everything is going digital. I spent the whole day out on my own alone and I really just hated every moment of it. 

But the thing is that I was excelling at the role. Now I don't claim to be some savant or anything because I was only there for four months. But in the time I was there, I was doing really well. I was leading customer acquisition among the group that was hired alongside of me by a considerable amount. I got along really well with the CEO the VP of Sales and the board of directors really really well. They were all very shocked when I quit and I really hated to leave the people that I was growing to really appreciate behind because I really hated my job. There are certain aspects of sales that I like but this particular role was just didn't feel right for me. And I stand by that, I know that leaving was definitely the right move for me. My lease was up on my apartment and I really didn't have any travel experience (didn't grow up in the wealthiest family) so I said fuck it and went and worked at a national park from April to September. It was a great time to get away from myself and just breath a little bit because I'm an anxious stress volcano of a human being. I got back home in September ready to get back on the job hunt and I am absolutely demoralized. I have not heard back from a single company about anything and I've been sitting down almost every day and tweaking my resume, writing cover letters and applying to anything that I'm remotely qualified for and I haven't gotten shit. It fucking sucks and it hurts and as much as I am trying to embrace the struggle and look at this as a hard transitional period that will make me a better person. It's difficult being 24 unemployed and watching all of your friends succeed. 

I haven't been applying to any sales positions though and I'm beginning to think that it's my best bet if I want to have a chance at getting a job again. But to tell you the truth I am absolutely terrified to do so. My parents live in a very remote area, any job that I get that's going to be anything beyond working at Walmart is going to require me to relocate to a city 2 - 3 hours away. And I am scared beyond belief of getting another sales job, moving to a new city, getting an apartment there and then hating it. I'm shaking like a shitting dog thinking about it. It could work out, going back into the field isn't out of the picture but I can't decide if life's telling me that I'm not built for it entirely or that I just had one job that wasn't the right fit for me. 

I don't know who this post is meant for. Maybe there's some sales professionals that can emphasize with my experience or maybe you've been in a position like be at my age where you have absolutely no idea what you want to pursue as a career. I don't really have any family members or older people in my life that can help my either I'm the first member of my family to go to college and I feel like a freaking failure.

17mckxh,Should I Reach out to the Recruiting Director after this Correspondence and 4-interviews with Company?,"I recently interviewed with a company that I was extremely interested in. This involved a total of 4 interview, each lasting 45-minutes to 1-hour over the span of several weeks. Interviews went great, I good tell there was some positive traction and attraction to my experience. The last interview was with the role's director, and went pretty well. For context, there were 2 positions I had applied for (say Role A and Role B). These interviews were for Role B, which I had good experience in, but I definitely felt that Role A was more up my alley in terms of relevant experience. I had made it a point to ask in each interview if these were in fact, 2 separate positions, to which I was told ""yes"" and intent was to fill both.

Unfortunately, I was told that while all my interviewers were impressed with my experience and industry knowledge, I was not chosen for Role B. I was let down, but the response I received was well written/not impersonal, and that's just the way it goes sometimes. I chose to respond back to the HR/Recruiting team email expressing my overall disappointment but gratefulness for the opportunity and all the time that was spent. But I made it a point to express my interest in Role A which I also applied for, expressing that I felt that their decision actually makes sense when you compare my experience in comparison between the 2 roles. I just ended it with, please keep me in mind and I'll make sure to check out future opportunities, etc.. I did not request any further contact or communication back.

The next email that came to me was from the Director of Recruiting who was not cc'd on any other chains or on interviews. They said they would look into the status of Role A and if I had the time to chat on the phone after hours that same day. I replied an hour later, thanking them for the email and provided my availability and I would be happy if they were to reach out or set up a time for that day.

I never received a call, and my email follow up the next day went unanswered. It's been 2-3 days now and I'm left a little puzzled as to why he would respond with that (same day as my email back), if there is to be no follow up on their end. Even if it is kind of a push-off, it makes little sense since I never requested more contact.

I started this summer, and asked for a rate which I got and was happy with. I think other people make more, but with my experience I felt good.

Since then, my monthly costs have gone up in ways outside my control. Things like rent increases and student loan repayments. That, along with insurance through my contractor costing around $400 a month, I’m making a lot less than expected.

I don’t really know where to approach this, whether it would be with the contracting company or my actual employer.

17mbwms,Career shift gone wrong,"Hi all

I recently completed a degree apprenticeship, working four years as an economist in the civil service. I graduated this summer with my degree in economics and joined a grad scheme at a bank.

During my time at the civil service the work I did was always related to things on the news, it was high profile, and very interesting. No day was really the same and it was a very thought provoking job. I also had a great work life balance, and finished at 5 everyday.  However, the pay was very low (23k for four years) and I was focused on getting a higher paying job due to saving for a house and a wedding. 

Now I find myself in a debt financing role purely because the salary was high (55k vs 32k if I was to have got a grad job in the civil service). But despite it not being an investment bank they expect me to work 100 hour weeks. The environment is very harsh, and the work is extremely boring - admin upon admin and reviewing documents etc. 

I’ve only been in the grad scheme 2 months but despite the earning potential being so high I just feel like the work isn’t fulfilling and I feel like work life balance is worth a lot, maybe even more than salary.

Im looking for some advice - is it worth just trying to go back into the civil service and take a pay cut? Or do you think I’d regret that in future, and I should try a bit longer to make it work in the bank (that was super hard to get into)? 

Any advice hugely appreciated",maisie1616,1,1.0,0,1698954309,2023-11-02 19:45:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17mbwms/career_shift_gone_wrong/,11,2023
17mbtse,Looking for Advice Regarding Jobs and Companies I Could Transfer to?,"Hi. First time poster. 

Here's a bit of background before I get to my question(s): I have dual citizenship with the United States and Portugal and hope to live in Portugal at some point. I'm not fluent in Portuguese, but I know enough for basic communication and plan to learn more living there.

I've worked remotely for an American education technology company for the last 5 years. It's time for a change. I would like to work in Portugal, but I recently learned that they won't let me move to Portugal. I don't have a very specific job title, like lawyer or software developer, but I believe I've learned skills over the years that could transfer to something else. I'm just trying to figure out what that is.

In my current job, I take content from test writers (math, social studies, science, etc.) and implement that content online. It goes through a whole content proofing, test building, and test delivery process so that students can take the tests online. I also know HTML5, I'm still learning CSS, and I'm starting to learn JavaScript. I'm self-taught and would love a web development career at some point, but I still have some ways to go until I can apply to those kinds of jobs.

That brings me to my main question(s): While I'd like to call myself a web developer in a couple years and work remotely from Portugal, life doesn't always work out as planned, so I'm weighing my options. I'd like to move to Portugal within the next couple of years, and since my company won't let me, I need to look for something else.

What kinds of jobs and American or Portuguese companies could I look into that would allow me to work in Portugal?

Also, I'm learning with YouTube/Udemy for videos, Odin Project for structure, and freeCodeCamp for practice, but if you know of any affordable training programs that won't take more than 2 years to complete while working full-time, let me know.

17mbrwe,How to advance a career,"Hey all,
I've just started on my BSc in mechanical engineering, and I have a big interest in especially robotics and mechatronics.
My question however is about my coming career when I'm done in a few years time; I'm 22, and even though I've had plenty of jobs in all kinds of industries, and are currently working in a high-end hotel bar and as a supervisor in a small company(30-40 employees), I've never had a ""real"" grown up job. 
I'm wondering if the saying is true, that in order to advance your career you should focus more on personal relations than doing your work properly. I've always had a high work ethic, and when I do something I do it right, but I want some insight on whether or not people get ""stuck"" on the same ladder if they just focus on doing their work right.
Will companies who find you valuable in your current position keep you there? What are some of your experiences?

I was able to get a confirmed job at a new school in the new city (Kenner, Louisiana). I only need to arrive on 12/4 to complete the Onboarding in person.  
  
Our last day before Winter Break is 12/15 with the new semester beginning 1/3. I was planning to type up my Resignation Form tonight and deliver it tomorrow to the Principal.  
  
I asked Central Office 6 weeks ago and they informed me I simply need to inform them of my Resignation once I notify the Principal. They didn't even have a requirement for mininum time to notify them but I figure I give them 60 day notice which should be a decent enough time to find a sub.  
  
I just don't want the Admin to screw me over this. There is a teacher who wanted to quit last week (she barely showed up in recent months) but the Principal won't allow her to be released from her contract. Hopefully, I don't find myself in the same situation.  
  
I figure with the Resignation letter, I'll notify that my last day will be 12/15 and my reason behind it or is that not neccessary? I mean everyone is aware my gf is pregnant. They just don't know that she lives in a different city and wants to be closer to her family.

17m85z9,I’m almost 27 years old & having a crisis of meaning/purpose,"I’m almost 27 years old. I’m having a crisis of meaning and purpose, and I’m not quite sure what to do. I don’t have anyone in my life that can give me any kind of relevant guidance. So my hope is that one of you Redditor's out there have had to deal with something similar and can impart on me your wisdom.  
To start off with I’ll give you a bit of background.   
I was fairly competitive in school. I saw academics as a competition, which it essential is, and tried my very hardest to get into a \*decent\* university and study a \*decent\* degree. When I was younger I had a very limited view of what life looked like after university. All I knew was that I HAD to do well in school. I remember feeling very stressed, because I literally thought my life depended on getting into a good uni and doing a good degree, otherwise I would get a horrible job and life would be over.  
It turns out stress is an excellent motivator. It made me a nasty, irritable person (to my parents), for most of my teenage years, but I did quite well academically.  
I choose to study Mechanical Engineering at university because I least disliked Mathematics and Physics at school. So of course Engineering was the obvious next step.  
I really didn’t enjoy university. I just wasn’t really interested in most of what I was doing. I spent most of my time studying and stressing and really neglected a prime opportunity in my life to join lots of different clubs and meet new people. When I wasn’t studying I was getting dangerously drunk on nights out. Often blacking out. I’m not proud of this. But I was in pain. I was quite depressed on multiple occasions during university but never sought for help for fear of seeming weak. Again the fear of being a failure and \*\*\*not doing well\*\*\* was essentially the only driver. I reluctantly hauled my way through university and in summer of 2020 I graduated with a specialisation in product design.   
As I mentioned I really didn’t like university. However, it wasn’t the learning part that I disliked the most, I love learning, it was the sense of competition. The fear that my life depended on me doing well. The stress of trying to achieve academic success. That’s what ruined it for me. I left with a really sour feeling about the whole experience. I didn’t even attend my graduation as I just wanted to erase the whole thing from my memory.   
(note: there was one module at uni which wasn’t boring and that was mechatronics)  
I did a placement in my third year at a building services company. I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do and most of what was on offer seemed incredibly boring. However, placements were quite competitive so at the time I felt lucky that I could get something. I ended up finding the work very boring. It was a horrible feeling. The sense of being trapped, and feeling like you have no control over your time is not good. I remember just being so damn bored. Constantly checking the clock and finding it hard to keep myself awake. I wasn’t at all stimulated. I was really worried that this was going to be my future.  
During my last year I got pretty into running and did my first ultra marathon. I love running. It was one of the few things I got to look forward to. Being outside and moving my body felt incredible. I was never bored. I would run for hours and hours on end at the weekend. Sometimes the whole day. It felt so so good. At uni all I could think about was running trails in some beautiful part of the world. The last thing I wanted was to sit in front of my computer working on something I didn’t care about it all!   
During the last semester of university I got a little interested in coding. It opened up my eyes to the world of software development. I got obsessed with the fact that I could make a piece of software and I could theoretically distribute it to anyone with a phone/computer. Infinitely scalable and very low or almost no marginal cost of reproduction. I was hooked on the idea. All I had to do was learn software (web) development and I could create a product or service. Then I could sell it to 1000’s of people or more and never have to work for somebody else. I would never be bored if I got to work on my own thing all the time right?   
After I graduated, I learned javascript and managed to land a low salary graduate level job as a full stack developer. It took a really long time (over 6 months) for someone to hire me. Mainly because I had virtually no background in software development. My goal was to work as long as I needed to so that I could understand how to create an entire application. At which point I would leave and create my own thing. This ended up taking almost 2 years.  
When I was working these jobs I was constantly stressing about money. I was over £50k in student debt and I was being payed £23.5k a year at the time. I wasn’t going to be getting any kind of familial financial help when purchasing my first home. I was very afraid that I was going to be stuck in a rental loop for a long time, and not be able to escape until my mid to late 30’s given house prices and the amount I would need for a deposit. After one year I was bumped up to £27.5k. Are you kidding me, that it? I was panicking so hard. I somehow managed to stick the job out for another 6 months until I found another job paying £33.5k. This still wasn’t \*\*\*“enough”\*\*\* but it was a bit better. I stuck this job out for 4 months before the moment finally came. I realised that I could build a full stack application. I could finally make my own thing.  
At this point I was getting increasingly bored at work. I was finding it extremely hard to focus and I was constantly day dreaming about my own possible ventures. I got deep into the whole indie-hacking thing, spearheaded by Pieter Levels. He has become famous in the developer world for creating a number of solo software businesses, promoted largely via his strong twitter presence. His lifestyle seemed perfect. He gets to work all day on things that interest him. He has full autonomy and control over his time. He’s successful and makes more than enough money to live off. If he could do it then so could I, I thought naively.  
So 8 months ago I quite my job and started to work on projects. My thought process was that if I could successfully create a full stack application that I could live off then great! and if I can’t then at least I have an awesome project to showcase. Oh how wrong I was. More on this later.  
A few years ago, during my placement year, I decided to learn a new language and for some reason I made some language videos on YouTube. Some have done well and my channel now has an ok following. I realised that I should create a product for this audience, language learners, so that I did. Unfortunately my motivation for the project waned due to the lack of growth. I’ve only managed to get it $400/month. Nowhere near enough to live off.   
None of my other projects went anywhere and now I’m here. Present day. Running out of time and money and looking for another job / trying to figure out what to do with my life.  
I’ve been looking for close to a month. Some interviews here and there, but nothing has worked. As I mentioned earlier, I naively thought that having made a successful full stack application serving over 50 paying customers would give me some kind of kudos. Nope. Crickets. Nobody cares. Also most of the CV’s are filtered by an HR person and not a developer, so they wouldn’t understand the significance anyway. They are just ticking boxes. Does this person have x,y,z technology skill and this level of experience. I should have seen this coming.   
Now I’m not sure what to do. I’m not sure I actually have the skills (at this moment in time) to tick all the boxes for any of the companies that seem slightly interesting to work for. The prospect of working for X company making X software widget in X industry I don’t care about is really grim. I really struggle with motivation if I’m not interested, and I’m afraid that all I’ll want to do is leave again.  
Now comes the crisis of meaning and purpose. Up until this point in my life most decisions I’ve made have been money oriented with little thought about whether I really enjoy my work and if that work at all impacts the lives of others positively.   
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the topics of purpose and meaning and I think, even if I earn a lot of money, if there is no enjoyment, purpose or meaning then I’ll still be miserable. Well off, but miserable.  
I’m not really sure how important purpose and meaning are in a job as I’ve never had one where I made a positive impact on other people. I suppose if you don’t really like your job, or at points in time it is really tough, the knowledge that you’re helping others can pull you through the rough times. I think ultimately fulfilment matters more than purpose and meaning but I’m not sure.   
I’ve also been doing a lot of research into meaningful jobs via this great website, https://80000hours.org/ . I’ve come to realise that a full stack developer can have little direct positive impact on the lives of others. Never mind saving lives. You’re most likely going to be working on some product or service focused on making some business more money.   
I’ve also been doing a lot of research of AI, and the coming AI revolution. There are so many potential ways that AI can have a direct impact on improving the quality of peoples lives and also actually saving peoples lives, e.g. improving the ability to detect cancers in MRI’s/X-Rays etc.   
I’m almost certain that within 10 years most small to medium sized full-stack applications will be (mostly) built using some AI style chat interface. As long as you can logically articulate how you want something to look and perform AI will be able to make it. Therefore, the role of a full stack developer will be obsolete. You will have a few project overseers and designers (prompters) and that’s it. I think larger more complex full stack applications will need more oversight for longer but AI will eventually replace all human effort here I think.   
So after doing research on fulfilling, purposeful careers which carry some meaning, as well as my research on AI, I’ve concluded that it might be a good idea to retrain in Machine Learning (AI) for the following reasons:   
\- It gives me the best chance of job security over the long run.  
\- Is highly paid.  
\- Can have a direct positive impact on the lives of others  
\- AI  revolution. (Lots of new jobs & potential in the field)  
\- Interesting problems to work on and solve  
The only issue is I am almost 27 years old and I’ll be partially starting over again. It’ll take me at least 3-6 months to learn the basics if doing this full time.   
Maybe a year if I have to work alongside it.  
If I want to be accredited via a university I will have to pay for a costly masters here in the UK and study full time for a year. Or move abroad to Germany or Netherlands or somewhere to get it cheaper.  
I’m afraid that I have wasted too much time already and that it might be too late to change careers.  
So basically I have several options at the moment:   
1. Try to get full-stack position again. Will require a few months of learning to sharpen certain skills and to satisfy job descriptions and interview prep.  
2. Go all out on language YT channel and associated products.  
3. Learn Machine Learning and go all in on AI. I can teach everything I learn on a new YT channel and blog as a record of my knowledge for future employers.  
4. Think of something else to do.   
I really need to take action on something soon. I’m hard working and I know that I can make something work but, I’m really suffering from the paradox of choice. It’s all very overwhelming, but right now I really don’t feel good, and I need to make a change.

17m7879,Pay vs Interest,"Hi all, I'm sure this is a situation a lot of you have faced before but I am curious what insight I can get. Here's the situation: I'm a senior in High school who is very good at mathematics and enjoys learning and doing mathematics. Not sure as a job, but I am pretty good at it. I also have been incredible interested in Marine Biology for most of my life and would love to go into the field, but the pay and location isnt ideal. I'd probably be pretty far, and making substantially less money than say an aerospace engineer (120k/yr), which I also could do. I'm worried that I wouldn't be able to have the life I want on 60-80k/year (I know, i know, but money is important to me), and that even though I might wnjoy it more, that 40k/yr id be missing out on would weigh me down.

17m76wf,Should I Negotiate Salary When the Company Already Gave More Than Budgeted,"Hello,

I received a job offer yesterday. When I originally spoke to the recruiter, she told me that the maximum allowable salary for the position is 75k. 

Yesterday the recruiter called me and let me know that apparently I had interviewed so well that they found some extra money and are now offering me to start at 82k. 

Some of my friends and family are encouraging me to negotiate, and I have done so with every other company I have worked at, but in this particular instance I feel that I may be overreaching and risking getting the offer rescinded if I attempt to do so since they already went out of their way to offer more money.

Also, 82k is definitely a competitive and fair salary for my field, YOE, and the area I live in. But more money is always nice.

That being said, should I listen to my friends and family, or stick to my guns and just accept the offer?",BBdana,2,0.5699999928474426,7,1698941891,2023-11-02 16:18:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17m76wf/should_i_negotiate_salary_when_the_company/,11,2023
17m75b7,Is there a service or company that assists candidates to find jobs (including candidates that need work permit and/or sponsorship)?,"Hi all,  
  
This might be a very stupid question so apologies.  
  
I want to continue my career in the UK or in an EU country because my expertise is on EU regulation.  
  
I noticed there are staffing companies that assist firms to fill-in particular positions. The part of their service also includes screening and finding regular candidates for certains positions. However, what I wonder is are there any firms who can assist me, as a candidate that requires visa sponsorship, to land a job? I am willing to pay any price they charge at this point as it is nearly impossible to find a job on my own as a non-EEA (and UK) cititzen. But I suspect no one will bother with the visa application procedures and spend months during that process.

17m6r6p,Torn Between Jobs,"I started working for a non profit last year. My job was to work with intellectually disabled adults on their programs to improve skills such as reading, math, cooking, cleaning, behaviors, etc. I absolutely loved it. My coworkers were amazing and the clients became my friends and family. I still visit even though I no longer work there.
I was making $14.50/hour and it just wasn't enough. Right before I left, the director managed to get us a raise to $15/hour and asked me to stay, but there's never raises there. That one had been in the works for over 2 years as the company receives their entire budget from the state.

I received an offer for a job at the Crisis Stabilization Unit. Low level, clients can discharge at any point, etc. This job is with a larger company and has places to move up (Like I could switch to case management eventually). I started off getting paid $15.5/hour and weekdays with a $1/hour differential on weekends. My pays about to increase to $16 or $16.50/hour, they're not sure which one I'll be receiving.

I thought the jobs couldn't be too different. Same field, both non profits, both would allow me to help people. But I'm this new position, I can't form bonds with the clients and the atmosphere is just a lot sadder. I miss laughing with my clients, doing their hair, going on outings with them, etc.

My old coworker texted me that the last job is considering asking me to come back. And I really, really want to. I told her to let the boss know I'd come back for $16/hr, but that's pretty much impossible lol.

Here's kinda a pros and cons list:

Old job pros: weekends off, set schedule, paid holidays off, forming bonds with the clients, the coworkers, the upbeat environment, outings, holiday parties/meetings. Our boss would give us little pins for ""employee of the month"" and we'd occasionally have team motivation challenges where we would write down nice things about our coworkers (I know that sounds stupid AF, but with 2-3 coworkers that you're close too, it really becomes heart-warming. I carry these notes and read them when I'm having a bad day. I only had to request a half day off the day before, if I needed a full day off I just had to tell them 3 days before, didn't need to cover my shift 

Old job cons: less hours, lower pay, less opportunity for advancement, no overtime.

New job pros: higher pay, overtime, more hours in general, opportunity to advance

New job cons: sad environment, not close to my team, can't form bonds with clients, actually kinda boring, have to request time off a month in advance, would need to find someone to cover my shift if sick or something happens.

I've only been at the new job since September, so maybe I should give it more time?

17m6pov,Leave a great job with average pay for a small start-up in tech?,"I (M/36) supervise a small construction shop at a university in a HCOL city making $73k per year with annual raises that do not keep up with inflation. There are many benefits that come along with working at the university (paid medical insurance, retirement with Texas Retirement System, lots of time off). I'm single with 2 kids whom I share custody 50/50. I have pretty much maxed out my potential in my line of work and have no formal education. I love everything about my job, the people I work with, my bosses are very hands off and trust me to do my job, lots of downtime to shoot the shit with customers and coworkers. My only problem is I don't see any big raises in my near future, and rent just keeps going up and up. Nearly a year ago, I received a very fortunate invitation from an acquaintance to learn to code from him for free for a few months, and now I'm basically a paid intern for his startup company. It's not a great hourly pay and I only work 5-10 hours a week, but that's not really the point. People pay good money to go to coding boot camps and still no guarantee to have a job afterwards. At some point, he'd like to increase my hours and have me come aboard full time, but I don't think he can yet match my current salary, and cannot offer me any other benefits. I think the closest he can get me to is $60k-$70k. It's a very small company with less than 10 employees, and obviously I don't know if it'll continue to grow, but it could be an exciting opportunity, and at the very least I'm getting paid to learn to code. If I didn't have kids this would be an easy choice, but I feel like it's a little too risky now. What do you think?

Nonetheless I have always justified it to myself by saying things like: we don’t make the actual weapons, I’m only here to support my dad, and you do what you have to do in order to pay the bills. Well, now that there is a war in Israel and the killing of thousands of innocent lives I feel particular complicit in the genocide of the Palestinian people. I am anti-racist, anti-fascist, and I will never stand on the side of the oppressor HOWEVER…I feel like such a fraud working at this company. I am part of a system that DIRECTLY funds and supports the Israeli military with equipment which goes against everything I fight against.

I was hired internally to transfer to another office that is more than an hour closer to my home… back in the middle of September. My old office has been holding me from starting in the new one due to staffing issues, and I understand that, however I am not willing to keep driving this distance anymore as it’s hitting me in the wallet really hard.

I have tried to have meetings with my current manager about it. He brushes it off, says he’ll talk to my new manager, and then I hear nothing. 

On top of that, one of our coworkers was promoted to our supervisor and she started absolutely steamrolling us with new rules and micromanaging. She assigned us lunches without having any conversation about it. She sets the office temp to 74° every day - previously when she was cold she’d use the space heater that we have here but ever since the promotion she wont use it. She harasses us to do our jobs when we already do and have never needed that push before… often times when we have already completed the task.

I spoke to HR today to let them know my concerns. I just feel stuck. I know that we cant leave the office unstaffed but it looks like he isnt even interviewing for my position.

17m4pcm,Tired of Feeling Trapped,"Add me to the pile of existential lost twenty somethings, but this is getting entirely too unbearable. 

For context, I graduated from college with a political science degree with full intentions of pursuing law. I graduated into the pandemic, moved back home, and I experienced a profound reevaluation of what is important to me. I decided to move back to the city and take the first job that gave me an offer- which was a temp job at a claims processing agency for class action suits. I became incredibly depressed at this work from home job and was eventually let go. I decided to take a year to redefine my long term goals and work in the service industry. It has now been two traumatic years later, hoping from bar to cafe to restaurants and I still have no fucking idea what I’m doing. I am so sick and tired of feeling trapped and broke here in this taco serving, mezcal slinging hell. The only bright side of these years were that I found a sense of joy again and committed myself to my art (which is the only labor that makes me truly happy). I have gotten a few digital commissions and have done collaborations with other local artists but I have no technical training or experience to get a job in the arts (in a very art rich city).

My parents and family are constantly asking me what I’m doing and what my plans are- and it’s getting much harder to tell them I still don’t know. My lovely friends are all getting their “big girl jobs” and I feel alone in this financial instability. Some weeks it’s hard to pay rent and feed myself. At this point, every new day is scary and humiliating. 

Recently, my very successful uncle offered me an in at his insurance company- perhaps as an underwriting assistant. I never once in my life have considered myself to be interested in the insurance field but for some reason I am not entirely repelled by the idea. At this point, anything that will allow me to use my brain again is exciting to me. However, I find myself unable to take the next steps and put myself out there. I am terrified of being 25 and incompetent on the job. I am a fast learner and a considerate team member but I still feel this huge internal block. 

I am scared of sacrificing my freedom and sense of self for a job that may bring me nothing else but a paycheck and a health insurance policy, but I can’t keep feeling like a loser every day.

I want to know about their compensation philosophy as I believe the my position “Information Security Engineer” is severely underpaid. I’ve been working in this role for almost 4 years and it just seems like Market Decay is taking effect on my position. 

My main concern that I want to make apparent is professional growth, I’ve grown a lot with this company: I’ve got a bunch of IT related certs, I’m about to complete my degree, I’m about to work on a side project for my director etc. The compensation doesn’t seem to value how much effort and work my peers and I do. And to add, the difference between an Associate and a Staff engineer is only 4 thousand dollars annually. 

Has anyone had a conversation about this with HR? 

I mainly want to ask them:
What their compensation philosophy is?
How do they value professional growth amongst their employees? 
Have you experienced Market Decay in any positions and was it ever adjusted? 
Will my position ever be valued more or adjusted to market rate? 

FYI: I am NOT asking for a raise. I just want to know if there is even a purpose for me to stay at this company. Management is really good here and so is the services and I’d like to stick around if there is any reason to. But if HR doesn’t do anything about our engineers being underpaid I want to leave.",Conscious_Wave7479,1,1.0,5,1698933674,2023-11-02 14:01:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17m456u/asking_hr_about_their_compensation_philosophy/,11,2023

the consumer insights team doing market research at a large insurance company in South Africa. I started as their PA but moved into a junior researcher role. The kicker is they had a consumer neuromarketing lab to do EEG, eye tracking, and other similar methods. I fell in love with neuromarketing and I made it my mission that I wanted to grow in that field. So I would try upskill myself with the neuro methodologies where I could.

One day, we're informed that due to business restructuring they are splitting up the team. Myself and the lab got moved to another department, who a few months later also decided to restructure and sell the lab. My role was made redundant as they didn't want to pursue primary research any longer, rather outsourcing to agencies.

I've since found a contractor position at an agency but I feel so rattled by the events of the last year and a half.

 Wiith the old team I felt secure and like it was safe to fail because we got along so well that I knew they would help me learn with no judgement. And when I wasn't confident in how to do something I didn't feel scared because I felt supported. I had a career trajectory planned out with the neuro stuff. 

Now it's all gone. The job market is brutal and it was tough enough to find this job after 3 months of unemployment. I feel stuck. Stuck because I feel so unconfident in everything I do, and I don't feel safe enough in the new position yet that it feels ok to fail.  I tried so hard to find something in the neuro field where I would at least be interested and passionate about the work to offset the lack of confidence and learning phase.

17m3zg5,What would you do?,"
A brief background: I recently graduated from a well-ranked finance and real estate program at a T50 school. After a short stint in investment banking, I was laid off. My family, immigrants from Ukraine, established an 11-location daycare chain in the greater Chicago area, with 2 more in development. Throughout college, I helped enhance their online presence and streamlined their sales processes. My parents, in their 60s and nearing 70, lack a management team and efficient systems for the business. It's at a critical point where internal redevelopment and implementation of systems is crucial for future growth.

Now, I face a dilemma. I've been offered a position at a commercial real estate brokerage for an investment sales position in Miami, which could mean years away from my family and the daycare business. I'm unsure if the skills I'd gain there are directly applicable to running a company. On the other hand, time is of the essence. My parents are aging, and I could be there for the construction and licensing of the upcoming daycares, implementing much-needed systems. I think I am most worried about wanting to prove my abilities independently, but if I really grew this business it could something great for generations to come?

17m3a7d,New employee at a disorganized workplace,"Hi! I am looking for some advice and maybe some personal stories of anyone who’s been in this situation and how they handled it. I started a new job at a company that’s been around for a long time , however it seems there’s a lack of structure and everyday (it’s been a month so far) I feel more confused than I did the day before . My department is one that’s been newly created my boss has been at the company for 2 years and she’s quite all over the place, she’s constantly handing tasks over to me that she should be doing and it’s things I haven’t been involved in. She’s constantly complaining about the disorganization of the company but it seems she hasn’t been very proactive to implement any structure . She seems afraid to be the decision maker so she throws stuff on me , I guess then she can’t be blamed. 

Wondering if there’s any hope for me haha, it’s hard when it seems the disorganization comes from the top and trickles down to even the managers . Not sure how much of an impact I can have. I am used to being able to adapt and learn very quickly when I start a job so it’s my first time still feeling so confused at a new company.",Kitchen-Pressure9467,2,1.0,1,1698931044,2023-11-02 13:17:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17m3a7d/new_employee_at_a_disorganized_workplace/,11,2023

17m2t6e,Is a masters degree in biology worth it?,Hi. I have asked so many people this question and it hasn't pointed me to a straight answer. I'm an 23 with one more semester left in my bachelors in biology program. I'm not sure what I want to do with my degree but I'm leaning toward research. I am moving to DC in May and I am considering going to graduate school there. There are a few things I'm concerned about. Getting a degree would put me 80kt in debt (I went to a state college so I'm graduating debt free). I'm still not sure what I want to do with my Bach. Degree so idk what I biology concentration I would do my masters degree in. I have issues managing stress and would need to work and do my degree at the same time which worries me. Are graduate level classes drastically more difficult or is it manageable? Is it even worth it to get a masters degree? Does it give you a substantially higher paying job to pay off the debt?,Okayorsomething,6,0.8700000047683716,8,1698929557,2023-11-02 12:52:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17m2t6e/is_a_masters_degree_in_biology_worth_it/,11,2023
17m2r1h,What is the better option?,"I'm 20 years old and really want to get into tech. I have two options and don't know what to do. Option 1 is I go study for a higher certificate in information technology (1 year program) and after graduating, get a job and study further while working in the tech field. That way I would gain valuable experience while studying for a BSc in Information Technology part time. 

Option 2 is that I can go work at an insurance company as a receptionist and start doing courses in insurance to get promoted and have a higher salary. Then I do something completely unrelated to what I actually want to do and I know it won't make me happy. But I will have a stable income and will be able to fund my own studies, whereas if I go for option 1, I will have to make a loan from a family member to pay for studies and rely on other family members to help with accommodation and other monthly bills. My parents are divorced and my dad is not able to help financially. My step mom says she also can't  help, because in a year's time she will need to sign for a student loan for her child. Nobody else will sign for a student loan for me.

I’m a sociology major so there isn’t much to do besides going to graduate school but I dont want to do that.

I joined a career prep program my sophomore year of college in hopes that I’d be able to land a summer internship but I had no luck. My experience is all over the place, I’ve worked fast food, as a Teacher/research assistant, after-school program and i had a job in customer service. 

I used to want to be a teacher because I liked the idea of being able to help kids navigate such a hard time in their lives but after looking at people’s experiences on here it’s made it harder to justify going down that route. I’m looking at programs where you can get your graduate and credentials at the same time since having a masters means you get paid a little more. If I become a teacher I dont think I can do it for all my life. I was thinking maybe I can be a teacher for a couple years and then pivot to something else later down the line but i dont know if that means getting my masters+credentials would be a waste of time and money. What could I even pivot to ? 

When I was picking my major I considered computer science but didnt think I was smart enough for it since I didn’t really know much about tech and I didn’t particularly like math/science so I started off as undecided and ended up with sociology after taking a class and realizing it was stuff I was already interested in since I was in like middle school. I was able to find a online program (2 years long) that lets you get a second bachelors in cs but its fully online and i dont even know if it would he worth it what with how saturated that field is.

I started the google data analytics certificate in hopes that it would help me job wise but i dont find it interesting and it just seems like a lot of filler. 

How can I fix my life so late into it ? What can I do to get a good career ?

17lyldk,"Does university/college just not ""fit"" certain people?","Hey! 

I'm 26, haven't gotten a degree since I finished high school at 18. In this time, I have been working, saving money and travelled essentially. I have studied and gone to school, I did a year long course in film production and I've also spent a total of 5 months abroad studying Russian language courses in Russia and Latvia and can now speak Russian at a high, conversational level (I can get around speaking only Russian if I need to). Anyways, I've kinda just been trailing along. I'm in university right now, but I really don't like it. I'm currently doing a course in International Relations, which is incredibly interesting, especially given the situation in the world (and especially Ukraine - Russia). But I'm really, really not enjoying it too much. I find it to be a drag. I have aced my two last exams, which is cool, but I find the whole environment at uni to be just really boring. I hate reading 50 page academic papers that argue why democratic peace theory is false, and then having to read another 50 pages debunking the other persons ideas. This is my second stint at uni, I started a course in journalism a few years ago, but dropped it quite quickly (While I think journalism is very interesting, the way the course was structured and everything around sucked). I think I'm a more creative person, I like photography and filming and documenting things (which is why I started journalism) but I just can't get over the hump. I have a few different ideas, but I just can't get myself to dedicate myself to anything. Is my mentality wrong? 

I live in a country (Sweden) where it's not uncommon to go to university at 25+ so I wouldn't call myself a failure, as I'm still young, but I am getting older. I just don't feel like academia suits me at all. But even photography and film, which are things I love just feel like a drag these days. Am I depressed? I don't know what's going on really. I'm going to apply to flight schools next year since I've had this childhood dream of flying and already have a few hours of flight time. My ideal life now is getting a pilots license, becoming a pilot and moving to Iceland or some place like that and becoming a tour pilot who flies people around showing them cool things. Or flying humanitarian aid into places ravaged by natural disasters. Which could be combined with my interest of photography/film.

I feel so fucking lost in life honestly. Can anyone give me any tips or advice?

17lxjcs,Potentially job scam.,"So, I applied for this position on indeed.com. right? It said S&P solutions, never heard of them. 
I'm thinking customer service? I like helping customers out cause I genuinely like meeting people and helping people. 

I enter for my interview... Fill out the application, and wait for the next person to get out. I go into the office, we have a good chat, I'm trying my best to impress and surprisingly? I got hired... 

Now, this is all great, till the orientation... 
I was sitting there listening, learning about the product I was selling. A Kirby vacuum cleaner.. 
I hadn't heard of them before, I did a bit of research after going home though. 

And, then I went to the site's referral that talked about it's work.
They're driving an unmarked van, not wearing name tags, trying to sell the vacuums...

I found that kinda shady. So I did more research right? Cause obviously I'm like wtf is going on? 
After doing this research, this woman who was training people, did the exact. Down to the T, exactly what this other lady on YouTube did. Almost exactly... 

Demonstrating the product almost exactly, then I did more research and found that, they've hired shady people... To be door to door salesman. 
I got so wrapped up in the idea of 20 dollars for customer service, I'm assuming I'm working in office only.. but now I have a feeling that, theyre going to be trying to scam me, and everyone else there. 

So I guess my question is.. do I head in tomorrow, tell the others, and leave? 
I don't want them to get scammed. I don't know them. I have no connections to them per say, however.. from what I've seen online? The stories I've read? 
People losing houses, living in cars? 

Hell one of them was talking to me about ""trade-offs"". Aka trading a car for a vacuum cleaner... 
I just dunno. Am I overthinking this? Am I right about this? Should I tell the others?.. the others looked like they got hooked in, most of them that is. And I do not want them to be another statistic or a victim of this, if it is a scam.

17lvyr1,Film degree and no direction..AV archival studies? Editing?,"This is super long but if anyone knows about the film industry or audiovisual archiving please give it a look over. — Am 26F, and at an awkward crossroads/transitional point, like most people who post on these subs.  
  
I have a bachelors of science in “Film, Media, and Social Justice” with a specialization in film studies, from a small private university. Finished school in December 2021 i think? Was super depressed the entire time there, didn’t engage much in clubs/extracurriculars, didn’t help make any student film or any notable projects, so nothing to show besides the degree itself. No internships either. Also had horrible grades and almost flunked out due to poor mental health, so my transcripts look pretty bad. It also took me 5 years plus half a year at a junior college prior.  
  
I didn’t really enjoy cinematography, which was what I went there intending to do. Ultimately, I was kind of interested mostly in the history of film, so since graduating I applied to a bunch of jobs and internships relating to film archives and preservation. Did not get anything. Worked hard on cover letters/making my scant resume look as good as possible. Professor I contacted said I probably needed a masters to do that.  
  
Since then I’ve had two unrelated minimum wage restaurant jobs, including what I’m currently doing. I’m having a lot of success right now with medication and therapy and have a lot more energy and drive now, even though I still feel like a loser for having little money and no career at all despite a higher education, and living at home.  
  
I’m in the process of applying to 4 or 5 different masters and certificate programs related to audio-visual archiving. It’s very niche and there are like less than 10 schools who do this. I’m very knowledgeable about the history of film and I think I would find archive work interesting and rewarding but two things are making me hesitate:  
  
One is the relatively low pay ((see this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/Archivists/comments/yd5w4n/whats\_the\_salary/ ) ), especially considering I’m putting myself in more debt long-term by getting the Masters. I was lucky that my parents paid for the bulk of my college and would probably help with this additional degree but I need to repay all the loans eventually and still owe like $15,000 (?). I’m not even sure. I’m concerned about being able to continue a middle class lifestyle in the future and being able to provide a comfortable/affluent life to my kids if I have any. I've recently realized is very important to me.  
  
The other is that I’m a very creative person and I don't know if archival work would satisfy this. I paint/draw fairly well and am actually good at fiction writing from online feedback I’ve gotten, and generally have a lot of unique ideas, stories, and concepts in my head. I have a good eye for visual aesthetics too. But I also feel like trying to break into script writing or something like that would be very difficult, and I’m not super into the script format and would maybe like to keep creative writing as a hobby and try to write a fiction book on the side. I also feel like working in a role that is actually on a literal film set would be stressful as I’m not a people-person. I’ve applied to some sites to write articles about film and tv a while back and didn’t get anything.  
  
I also took AVID media composer in school and was decent at it so I am also considering trying to get a certificate in AVID to do video editing, but I don’t know how hard that is to break into with no reel or examples of my work.  
  
I’m open to any ideas at this point, and am vaguely planning to move to Los Angeles if I find a solid job there, I’m already in CA.",Wannabe-archivist,1,1.0,0,1698900820,2023-11-02 04:53:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17lvyr1/film_degree_and_no_directionav_archival_studies/,11,2023

17lv2vq,Question about software development from a student,"I want to keep these questions concise as I feel I could overcomplicate something that doesn't need overcomplicating. I am currently an aundergrqd student studying a physics major and I am interested in getting into software development after a few CS courses and tacking some courses online through the Meta backend developer certification. I really like how the internet works and different features of the internet, how it's evolved from Web 2.0 and moving towards Web 3.0. The field seems very dynamic and I'm happy I discovered this interest.

However, the issues I am facing are these: my university makes it impossible to switch into a computer science program unless you were directly admitted to it in first year, this includes the minor. If I take on another quantitative major/minor along with physics I won't have any room to do computer science courses on the side. So I have arrived at a place where I want to try and complete a minor in an arts subject to graduate, such as philosphy or environmental studies etc...

My only hesitation is that since these arts minors are not really tied to computer science, in any specific way, and have some relevance to my major, I'm afraid it might disadvantage me if a hiring manager looks at my resume. I want to have advice and hear thoughts about whether it really would disadvantage me even if it allows me to complete more computer science courses.

17luj01,Can I be fired for giving 30hrs notice for a drs apt that doesn’t currently interfere with my schedule but “could” ?,"
Backstory: 
Physical disability of the spine, my employer is aware of. 
Been employed 6mos and don’t qualify for FMLA, however my transparency of my physical disability should cover me under the ADA.
Missed multiple (3) days the past month due to pain management. 
Informed my employer 2wks ago I was waitlisted to see the dr for different meds otherwise it’d be 6-8wks before I could get an apt. 
My work availability is m-f 8-4 
I’m not currently scheduled to work during the time of my drs apt. However, I’m aware of my availability and let them know as a courtesy to keep me off schedule with 30hrs notice of my drs apt that doesn’t currently interfere with my work schedule for that day. 
Was told by 2 different bosses “your availability is m-f 8-4 and you need to be available in case someone calls in.” 
I’m not being paid to be on call.

Company policy is “schedule cancellations need to occur within 2hrs or as much notice as possible when applicable.” 

I was not requesting to cancel a schedule block. I was requesting assurance that my schedule wouldn’t change so I could tend to my health to minimize future call in’s.

They essentially told me my job was more important than my physical health and if my schedule changed 30mins before I was already scheduled to leave and I didn’t stay to cover that client, I’d face a write up or termination.

They always laid out clear expectations of what to expect (eg. are you available for an informal phone call). Maybe some people are just really casual, but it kind of caught me off guard since it's different than my past experiences. I realized that I don't really know what red flags to look out for, and am hoping to get some tips to help me on my search.

17lsrs2,Would Love Feedback - Laid Off in Mid 30s in Canada after a Decade of Experience….Thinking Between MBA vs MS Computer Science vs Not Doing Anything and Just Finding Another Job…US vs Canada?,"**\*\*Introduction\*\***  
  
\* In my mid-30s, residing in Edmonton, Canada, my role was recently impacted as part of a mass layoff. I was then diagnosed with depression + anxiety. Am taking medication and therapy to cope.  
\* I beat myself down/have regrets around my career/self comparison with others, why I haven't figured things out yet, why am I so lost, feeling isolated/alone, scared, no support system, etc.  
\* As I reflect on my future, I've been watching YouTube videos and doing virtual coffee chats, to figure out how do I move forward.

  
**\*\*My background:\*\***  
  
\* My educational background lies in Bachelors of Science in Biotechnology from a not so prestigious university overseas. I am a first generation university grad from my family and have had to figure things out on my own by stumbling my way through life.  
\* Over the past decade, my career has been rooted in the Canadian telecom industry, spanning various roles, from tech support to project coordination (with a focus on broadband fiber optics deployment) to project management (particularly in program finance operations for broadband fiber optics deployment).  
\* Although I lack a formal background in Computer Science or business, I am thinking the validity of considering the below four major pathways for my next steps and I'd greatly appreciate your insights and please do suggest anything else you may think of. The below is just what I superficially understand (I could be wrong too in my assessment).

  
**\*\*Option 1: Pursuing an MS in Computer Science:\*\***

***\*\*Pros:\*\****  
\* Thriving field with high demand and attractive compensation.  
\* Potential for entrepreneurship, remote work and digital nomadism.  
\* Affordability through scholarships and assistantship possibilities.  
\* I heard about someone who completed both his undergraduate and master's degrees in civil engineering. He wasn’t satisfied with his career and the compensation it offered. Gained admission to a prestigious MBA program in the USA but decided to forgo it in favor of pursuing an MS in Computer Science. As a result, he's set to graduate at the end of this year. This story served as a significant trigger for me to consider what is this CS and the merits of pursuing an MS in Computer Science (prior to this I didn't think much about CS).  
  
***\*\*Cons:\*\****  
\* Math: I understand CS is branched out from math. My perception is there's lots of math (maybe even advanced math) in it. In high school, I felt I didn't have a strong knack for math (even some phobia).  
\* Coding: seems like you are sitting on a screen & coding. Seems that CS program/career path delves on becoming a software engineer and moving up that technical coding path.  
\* Ageism: I think companies like younger employees. Competing with young college grads.  
\* Continuous learning: Need to continuously keep up with new technologies, frameworks, etc. Can become tough as you age.  
\* Not very social: Seems that this career is very siloed. You are working by yourself coding on the laptop screen for hours and hours on end. Limited social interactions.  
\* Starting from scratch: I believe this would involve re-starting my career from scratch at the bottom and then moving up gradually. New field altogether.  
\* Doing prerequisites to even get enrolled into the program, like going through a bridging program for Non CS folks to get into CS and then after completing this bridging program getting into MS CS. Lot of time and effort needed.  
\* I have anecdotally heard that if someone has more than 2 years of work experience, MBA is a better fit as MS programs are usually for folks with less than 2 years of work experience. The MS cohort tends to be in their early to mid 20s.  
  
**\*\*Option 2: Embarking on a Full Time MBA\*\***  
  
***\*\*\*Pros:\*\*\****  
\* Post experience degree. I already have more than a decade of work experience. Maybe my prior experience will be an asset and I may not start at the bottom.  
\* Opens up options: major employment outcomes seem to be consulting, IB/finance & tech ( add-on are getting into leadership roles in other industries).The first two (consulting, finance/IB) seem to be very poor work-life balance but tech (like product management which is something I have been strongly considering trying to pivot into) seems better with less working hours, no travel and can even work from home remotely.  
\* Good for career switch & seems to open up leadership roles.  
\* Network, brand, alumni connections can be valuable.  
\* On campus recruitment/internship.  
  
***\*\*\*Cons:\*\*\****  
\* The high cost (especially of top tier programs) potentially leads to debt. The financial risk/high opportunity cost scares me. I don’t come from a wealthy background but from modest means.  
\* Limited chances of scholarships/stipend.  
\* More disruptive with need to relocate.  
\* Average work experience tends to be 5 years and I will be towards the upper end/even surpass it. Will be studying with a predominantly younger cohort.  
\* The major benefit of MBA is network, brand & alumni but not the curriculum which can be self-taught from MOOCs/books. It’s like paying to be a member of an elite/exclusive club.  
\* MBA is more of a requirement to get into Finance/Investment Banking/Consulting but not much for Tech business roles like product management but is a recruitment pipeline for it.  
\* Based on what I understand, I don't want to do the management consulting grind (travel, 60-70 hrs) or Investment Banking grind (even more hours) and don't currently have much of an interest in finance. Tech seems to be the remaining popular option but I have also heard tech companies don't care much for MBAs and CS background is more valued, especially for roles like product management. Product management seems to be the current sexy post MBA role taking over the baton from consulting/Investment Banking//finance. Maybe there’s more to this than what I know.  
  
**\*\*Option 3: Online MBA (like UIUC’s iMBA)\*\***  
  
***\*\*\*Pros\*\*\****  
\* Cost-effective (like UIUC’s iMBA costs around USD 24k) and flexible to study from home.  
\* Less disruptive due to no need for relocation and can continue to work/earn money (less opportunity cost).  
\* Ideal for those seeking an MBA for knowledge or promotion purposes.  
\* Cohort tends to be more mature with more work experience.  
  
***\*\*\*Cons\*\*\****  
\* Not suitable for career switchers and more of a check in the box program to maybe get a promotion or just for MBA knowledge.  
\* No internship/post MBA recruitment opportunities.  
\* Limited networking opportunities.  
\* May not make any significant impact in my career.  
  
**\*\*Option 4: Executive MBA\*\***  
  
***\*\*\*Pros\*\*\****  
\* Suitable for more experienced professionals with a more mature cohort.  
\* Part time and hybrid program - can work and study  
  
***\*\*\*Cons\*\*\****  
\* Not an option right now as I am unemployed and one needs to be actively working while doing this program.  
\* Not meant for career switch. More for moving up within an existing industry/company.  
\* Limited networking opportunity.  
\* High cost. No scholarship provided.  
\* Employer should sponsor (chances of this I believe is negligible) otherwise you pay the hefty price tag out of pocket. Even if company sponsors, one need to stay there for a couple of years, More of a check in the box program.  
\* No internship/recruitment opportunity.  
\* Can work and earn.  
  
**\*\*Option 5: Do Neither MS CS or MBA and Just try To Find Any Project/Program Management oriented Job (maybe even try my luck at Product Management roles)\*\***

***\*\*\*Pros\*\*\****  
\* Continue with the status quo.  
\* Least disruptive.  
\* Saves time, money and effort.  
  
***\*\*\*Cons\*\*\****  
\* Stuck in career, low/limited career growth and income ceiling.  
\* Not building a new network or getting a strong alumni base or career switching.  
\* Feeling undervalued because I don’t have a fancy in demand high paying degree/skills from a prestigious university.  


**\*\*Questions:\*\***  
  
1. I would greatly appreciate your perspectives on this conundrum. Have you faced a similar choice between an MBA (online, full time, executive, etc), MS in Computer Science, MS Data Science of some of technical field or something else or not doing anything?  
2. What factors influenced your decision?  
3. I am currently doing a free online mini MBA course just to get my feet wet around MBA. Would there be a suggested sample course to get my feet wet to try out CS or something else? Would this be the best way to figure out what path to go for?  
4. What are your thoughts on staying in Canada vs moving to USA? I am a single first generation Canadian citizen and my elderly mom stays with me (my dad passed away), so sometimes I shrug the thought of moving out of Canada. I hear US is better for career growth and compensation but Canada is better for stability. By being in Canada, my mom can continue to stay with me, it’s least disruptive but has high cost of living and less opportunities.  
5. As I try to figure things out, I would love to receive your experiences and insights. Thank you for your valuable input!",IM122,2,1.0,0,1698890405,2023-11-02 02:00:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17lsrs2/would_love_feedback_laid_off_in_mid_30s_in_canada/,11,2023

17lrvuc,Did I mess this interview up?,"So title says it all. Some background… I have been in radio/streaming/podcast advertising for about 5 years now. Started at iHeart Radio as a sales assistant, made a jump into content acquisitions at Audible, and I’ve been at SiriusXm media as an account managerfor over a year and a half. 

Netflix recently started their Ad tier platform ( I’m sure some of you realized your subscriptions increasing lol) back in November. I had been following postings because a career goal of mine has been to jump into streaming TV and from what I’ve read about working there, it’s extremely competitive but the people are awesome and I work the best in that type of environment. I love being the best at what I do, and love watching my colleagues succeed and mentoring younger women in media!

Back in August I finally reached out via linkdin to the director of the team and sent a very casual yet direct message saying

“Hello Xxxxx,

I wanted to reach out and say congratulations on your new role! I have been relentlessly waiting (checking every single day lol) for your team to start hiring for Account Managers. 
So, because I am impatient, I wanted to reach out directly.

A little bit about me 😊 My name is XXXXXX and I have been in the Ads biz for around 6 years now! Starting at iHeart Radio, then moving to Audible, and eventually landing at SXM Media. I currently manage Ad Campaigns for some of our biggest spenders such as Capital One, Peloton, and Carvana across many different verticals such as Streaming, Podcast show level, and Programmatic. I am a 3rd party tag expert, name one and I’ve implemented it, but most importantly I genuinely care about the success of my sellers, peers, and company.

Working at Netflix is my next career goal. I know that is blunt haha, but I have read every article since November about how well the platform is performing and I want to be apart of it.

When roles do arise, I hope you keep me in mind. Nonetheless, congratulations and I wish you nothing but success in your new position!

Best,
XXXXX

Measure MORE, not LESS ( saw that in a Horizon Media Buyers signature the other day…cant say I disagree!)”

HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED …

Hi XXXXX, you have good timing, we are just starting the process of hiring account managers.  Send me your resume to xxxxxxx@netflix.com and I’ll connect you with recruiting.  Thanks for the thoughtful note and have a nice weekend! “


To say I was proud of myself in that moment would be an understatement. 

Met with the recruiter, they didn’t even have a job description yet so I basically told him everything I do in which he didn’t know much about bc he’s HR…didn’t hear back so I followed up about a 3 weeks later when I saw they posted for the position on LinkedIn…cc’d the director  passing along some recent Q4 success I had ( I optimized 500k worth of new biz on one of our biggest spenders which started as a happy accident but that literally never happens for account managers or even senior Ams…but said it more humbling via email)  ( who emailed me after and said if you don’t hear back please Follow up again and let me know) and he said they were just wrapping up hiring the Sr.Team manager and Manager and asked me for my availability for this week( aka today) for an interview with the new manager. 

I prepared with Netflix core values and aligned them with examples I had ..etc etc. 

When it came to the interview… the manager seemed extremely overwhelmed and unengaged. She has zero candor. It was just back to back “ tell me about a time when” questions. My answers were definitely advanced because in my role now yes I’m an account manager and do the normal pre and post sale stuff but this year I’ve been brought on to a ton of higher profile strategic work bc of my capital one win. 

The only response that made me feel like I wasnt speaking a different language was about systems. We both used the same planning system and I obviously said “ salesforce, tableau” and she didn’t respond so I was like what systems other than those would you guys be using. 

SHE DEADA$$ SAID MICROSOFT OFFICE AND GOOGLE WORK

I nicely said oh yes I use those too. 

She said “ any questions I DO have a hard stop in 4 minutes” 

So I said “ you know it’s pretty awesome to be starting from the ground up building the advertising division out!” “ what is your overall goal for building out this the team” she’s like “yes exciting BUT a lot.:.but to answer your question ….my goal is to build out a fully functional client services unit” 

…like no SH*T I felt like I tee balled her something super easy and something that would encourage me to want to work there lmao.

Anyway I left feeling shitty about it, idk if I bombed it, that I have more experience than her, if she was just checking off boxes bc I was referred by her bosses boss and she knows I’m Getting it anyway?

If I don’t get it, do I give the recruiter feedback ? Like that was the worst interviewer I’ve ever had and that I expected more from Netflix?

17lqres,Help TV host bullied/ cornered in the production company dilemna," Im a TV journalist who came back to France after years abroad. In a southern region there has been a new channel opening up with a big international potential. I met with all big staff and they loved my international background my production and on air skills. They talked about having me on air on a morning show, and ended up as a columnist once a week next to the 2guy hosts friends of the producer she hired.
Now the nightmare is starting:
I go see the producer who tells me all themes are already taken (I suggested a lot of different specialty) and after several back and forth we agree on one that fits me.
So I do my 1st appearance on the morning set (I have 15 years experience of TV) and at the end the producer tells me he realizes “My charisma, my experience and personality is standing out so instead of being among all the other columnists around the table on the set” he suggests I have my own segment outside with a cameraman, showing the viewer a great experience (Hotels spas arts exhibit etc.)
So Instead of being 1h on the set next to the hosts, my segment is now 3’30 (Per week!!!) 
The camera guy/editor quit after 3 segments as they were not paying him enough 
I ask for a meeting about the next steps, they also have to validate all my 5-6 themes in advance I was proposing. 
They denied all the subjects i worked for telling me “They are trying to have this guest or this personality on the set so me filming them at their place is a conflict”. Which doesn’t make any sense. 

Wait for it….. They gave me a girl camera/edit who works full time for them on their shows and as she heard the new task with me ALREADY frowned saying “it’s too much for her agenda”. 
I do ONE shoot with her, in a cool automobile collector garage, and she arrived already complaining about the size of garage, the rain, the guy i interviewed which she didn’t like, just almost harassing me with bad vibes when I was finding solutions on the spot to everything to finish the segment and still have good content. 
She leaves the set by telling me “Ok everything was good we just need to make it a bit shorter next time not more then 1h30 on the spot as the producer don’t want me to spend more time on your segment”. I agreed to anything she said “to play along”.  I then receive a mail listing all she didn’t like about the shoot (First time in 15 years i receive a mail from a camera guy/editor being so offensive so personnaly attacking almost a conspiracy to have me QUIT): She mentions she didn’t feel comfortable during the shoot, she didn’t like the guy i chose to interview, we took too long ( She stays 15 min in the garage to ask for a dedicated book for her son…..), and this and this…. 
Im only FREELANCE for this production (Which was sooooo not planned after all the many talks for months with the channel”) so I cannot push the conflict as it’s cristal clear the production will take her side. I still answered a bitter mail stating all the real facts and saying that it is very counter productive etc. 
I go in the edit ROOM to HELP her on the edit and to show that i’m willing to help and as soon as I arrive she says that “There is wayyyy too much clips from my previous shoot with the other guy, that she’s editing, that it took her sooooooo much time that she doesn’t think she can work with me, that’s it’s a personality matter etc. 
I was IN SCHOCK. If i go to the fight with her or if she tells the team she can’t work with me they WILL get rid of me as I could already sense the producer and the 2 hosts are forcing themselves with me, being weird and silent and not caring at all.
I tried to be super nice and we finished the edit in 2h at 90%. She confirms to me the 4 DATES she has open in november to shoot. 
I thought I “saved” the situation, telling her “no problem in the next time we will do less clips and will stick to 1h30 etc.”

FINALE: I just received a mail from her saying “She wants to finish the 2 edits of my segments before telling me what dates in november she is willing to shoot” WHICH PUTS ME TO FAILURE and in the risk of shooting ONLY one segment instead of 3-4 in november and loosing my subjects as it takes at least 2 weeks to organize the shoot. She Cc the 2 hosts + producer and I answered that I CANT WORK THIS WAY and we need a solution to give me reliable dates in advance. 

Now i feel sick to my stomach as she clearly wants me to fail she’s a fucking nobody not even experienced in TV (Ex photographer) BUT old time friend of the producer. 

So here are my last options:
Calling the host or producer to explain this and ask them how to work this way ? Knowing that 2 chances out of 3 they would be happy to jump on this to tell me “it’s too complicated we don’t have any solution” so I’d be stuck with just ONE shoot during the month when and If she wants..
Today walking into the production company reaching the editing room, the co host was there and you could sense there is a THICK invisible awkwardness…. silence.. he ain’t asking me how everything is going etc NADA.

Last option: I have a meeting coming with the channel director and the problem is that she told me in the past that she LIKES A LOT this producer. She said “You ll see you ll meet him his fantastic !!!” BY THE WAY this “producer” has NO experience in TV he used to have free luxury magazines and a local radio. So my goal was to DENNOUNCED how they are treating me AND ask her if there is other shows or productions she can buy from me. But the danger is that she will think IM THE PROBLEM in this team and probably won’t be willing to change anything among this production nor buying me smg. 

It’s so unfair i don’t know what to do. 
This money for these 2-4 segments are important right now that’s why i feel also vulnerable. It was my feet back into TV after years of break. 

Another columnist told me she was schocked how they all try to makes me quit/stop and block me in every corner (Dates , themes, the girl not willing to team work…the awkward silences…) as according to her I was the best of all other columnists (No one they hired is a journalist, they are old friends they know from this region that they brought along). She believes the 2 guys are jealous and fearful I take too much place..

I have rage and anger. It’s the only ENTERTAINING show on this channel so There is not much options to put me anywhere else (Even if the director was willing to)

17lphda,"If applying to job at a hospital, would it make sense to mention your past stay there in a cover letter?","Hi! I'm applying to a data-related job in a major children's hospital in my area. I have actually had an extended stay (2 weeks) there as a teenager because I picked up a disease while vising another country. Through the experience, I received amazing, life-saving care from the hospital staff. I especially connected with the nurses who would always try to keep my spirits up through the ordeal. 

Thankfully, I fully recovered from the disease and proceeded to attend college right after. The whole experience actually prompted me to work in a research lab to study children participants' needs for the past two years. While I have an extensive background in research, I pursued my degree in Data Science. 

So, I have graduated this past summer and was interested in seeing if the hospital had any research positions I could possibly participate in. Then, I came across this data management role and I am excited to apply. However, I am definitely unsure if I should bring up my past history with the hospital or not within my cover letter. I would emphasize that it is what catalyzed me into research but it is not extremely necessary to bring up my background in research either? As such, I would love any advice about how I should proceed.

My interview is coming up soon and I was just wondering if there’s any tips or advice one would give in preparation for this first interview. From my research I believe it’s a panel interview and I know I should be ready to answer some EMT based scenario questions. Was wondering if I should be ready for anything else and if y’all have any specific suggestions on what to review before the interview. 
Hoping I don’t get any questions wrong lol, but does anyone know what happens if you don’t answer something correctly ? Do you no longer get to move forward with the interview process ?

17lpbfv,Internship Advice - Big 4 vs. JPM,"
Hi everyone, I have 2 enticing summer internship offers. One is with PwC, the other is with JP Morgan & Chase. Both are summer internships.

PwC: hybrid - nyc
$37.5/hr + $3500 signing bonus
Digital Audit & Advisory (DAT)

JPM: hybrid - jersey city
$38/hr + $2500 signing bonus
Audit Analyst - Business Track

My goal is to have an internship that provides me with the best leverage and transition into full time opportunities. I have an interest in product management and consulting. I like the prestige of JPM, but my main hesitation is work/life balance and I know analysts at JPM work crazy, BUT they get paid good overtime. PwC has good culture and I will be exposed to more areas. Also would like to experience an nyc internship.

Not sure but would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",Shaheerio03,3,1.0,0,1698880757,2023-11-01 23:19:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17lpbfv/internship_advice_big_4_vs_jpm/,11,2023

Today was just like a domino tower falling. A contractor got denied from visiting because required safety training (coming from process I understand the requirement but no one made this clear to me), i also have been struggle to move things along from a finance side because I have never done it before. 

My supervisor seems almost annoyed whenever I ask questions so I try to avoid but it’s starting to affect my work. Is there a way to bring this up professionally? They are nice when I talk to them and have been telling me I have been doing a good job and figuring things out but I don’t feel like I’m doing a good job when I’m messing so much up.

17lom40,Unexpectedly received a job offer from a job I was rejected from but still interviewing and in the running for another org. Interested in both jobs in different ways,"Back in September, I went through the full interview process for an organization in my city because it's an org I've been a fan of for years and the position itself/the work they do is directly related to my long-term career goals. I had otherwise been applying almost exclusively to remote jobs because of the work I do and the fact that there are limited jobs in the industry I'm in locally (any that do exist I'm either overqualified for or they pay ridiculously low). The starting pay for this hybrid role was the same as my previous job I was laid off from (a remote one) so while not ideal, I know that pay where I live is low due to cost of living so I expected it. The final step was for the internal team to get approval from their board (I didn't interview with the board, the team just shared their thoughts on me were to them). 

My point of contact had been transparent with me throughout the whole process, so when I was rejected it was no different. He said I was rejected because their board didn't feel like I had enough experience managing a team, even though the job description indicated that it was not a requirement, just a nice-to-have. They asked about my experience on it during one of the interviews and that's it. This is one of the few job roles where besides that, I fit almost all of the qualifications they're looking for. The person then told me in what sounded like a disappointed tone that he'd have to start the candidate search over from square one which let me know that I was their top choice.

Because of a combination of the work that the org does (a nonprofit that focuses on specific issues), the makeup of people in my city (most are not interested in this kind of work), the pay they're offering, and the skills needed, I knew that they'd have a hard time finding someone to fit all they're looking for. Their work is going to ramp up in the new year so they need someone to start soon, so I decided to pitch the org the solution of them hiring me to save time and money on the search and to just provide management training for me. I didn't hear back from them.

In this time I was of course still applying, interviewing elsewhere and seeking out client work (I've been freelancing since my layoff). One of the other orgs I've interviewed with is one that would basically be my skills in a consulting role. The clients they work with and their internal values seem interesting and aligned with my own. My would-be manager here was also already familiar with my work from my previous org so she was already a huge fan of what I can do. This job is in the wheelhouse of what I want to do, but it isn't directly tied to my long-term career goals as closely as the other role. 

Well weeks after my email to the rejected job, my point of contact gets back to me. He thanks me for the email and asks when I'm available for a call to discuss a way to make this work. As I predicted, I knew they weren't able to find someone to fill the role. He calls me to pitch a position without team management and I say I'm open to it but that I *am* interested in gaining team management experience. I share some retail management experience I had from years ago when I lived abroad and he says he's gonna pitch me to the board again. He believes in my capabilities and passion for the work but he needs to convince the board that they're not going to find the unicorn they want. 

Back to the 2nd org, I just had my 2nd interview with them and it went pretty amazingly if you ask me. I'm really warming up to the idea of this team, and the pay would be more than my previous job among other benefits. 

Well 40 mins after this interview I get a call from the first org, and the guy offers me a Specialist instead of Manager role with them to basically test if I'd actually like the work (and likely so their leadership team can warm up to me). The plan he lays out is great and all... except the pay is insultingly low. 23% lower than the starting pay they were offering for the Manager role/the salary from my last job.

I've written out the pros/cons to each job already and they're pretty even honestly so I do not want to flat-out say no to Org #1. I've emailed Org #2 about the offer and was transparent that I was still interested (she was also transparent with me about the whole process too). I'm waiting on an official email from Org #1 before I let them know that I've been interviewing elsewhere and that everything is great except the pay (they never asked me about pay expectations nor if I was interviewing and I'd of course word this professionally). 

I guess I'm mostly looking for advice on how to best leverage this offer to my advantage but also if Org #1's board's stubbornness is something I should consider as a serious red flag or part of the territory. My point of contact at Org #1 (the 2nd-in-command) is amazing for advocating on my behalf, but I'm not sure if that & what this org could do for my career is enough considering how much the team needs this external approval to do anything.",anonygirl_0156,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1698878896,2023-11-01 22:48:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17lom40/unexpectedly_received_a_job_offer_from_a_job_i/,11,2023

17ln5o3,Bonus cut without notice,"TL;Dr: My annual bonus was cut significantly without notice after the year had already been completed. What should I do next?

I am on my company's annual bonus program for certain leadership team members. You get assigned a certain number of points and those points are translated to dollars each year based on overall company performance.

I started with the company last year and was given a certain amount of points as part of my offer letter. Bonus gets paid out at the end of the fiscal year and I did get a prorated amount at the end of last fiscal year.

At the start of this fiscal year, I found out that participants sign a document at the start of each fiscal year to confirm participation in the program, whether your points are changing etc. However I was told my document and that of a fellow leader in my department was not ready for us yet because they were fixing an issue.

A couple of times during the year, I asked my boss was going on with signing the doc and was told not to worry, nothing was changing for me etc. Finally I was told that the issue was that my fellow departmental leader was getting less of a bonus than me and my boss was getting that fixed to equalize my fellow leader with me. I supported this.

Our fiscal year has ended and bonuses are about to be paid out. I found out this week that my fellow leader and I were ""equalized"" by cutting my points by over 25% and increasing the other leader by over 25%.

I found this out from the other leader, not my boss. Apparently my boss told the other leader this change had already been communicated to me, so the other leader didn't realize they were breaking the news to me when they mentioned it in conversation.

I wouldn't have been happy if they had communicated the change in points at the start of the year, but I would have at least accepted it. But now I feel like I was scammed since I just completed a year of work thinking I had ""X"" points when I was actually working for less than 75% of the points. This year, that translates into a reduction of over $5k for me compared to what I should be making.

Not really sure what to do next. Sure, like most people, I've had raises/promotions etc not come to fruition, but I've never seen a situation where compensation was changed after the fact.",xstrike0,1,1.0,5,1698875084,2023-11-01 21:44:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ln5o3/bonus_cut_without_notice/,11,2023
17lmxfk,"No raise in over a year and a half, small quarterly bonuses.","I’ve been with my current company for 4.5 years. I started as an intern and am now managing a large development team. I love my team, my client is great to work with (I have extensive knowledge of the products and company), I don’t have anyone micromanaging me and I’m fully remote. 

Q1 2022, I received a very sizable salary increase. At the time I also changed from an analyst to a project management/scrum master role. Since then I’ve grown so much professionally, have delivered projects successfully, obtained my MBA, and have grown my skillset. 

I asked for a raise in May 2023, provided the data as to why I deserve i-  inflation, how I’ve gone beyond my role, coaching, driving business, working over 40+ consistently. The company went through an acquisition a few years ago and are “restructuring the raise process”. This is the update I have been getting for months in addition, they keep calling out my last raise being sizable. To me, that raise was primarily because of the role change. We do get quarterly bonuses but after tax they end up being $600-$900.

Again, I do like my job but I also feel like it may be time for something new and this is the push to do so. I also don’t know if I want to even continue doing project management/scrum master work. I’ve also have gotten a few ageist comments over the years.

 How long is too long to wait for them to provide a raise? Do I need to consider getting another offer?

I HATE being treated as a code monkey. In love tech, but I believe that’s not the only important thing about software development. I care also about process, I care about product and the people I work with.

I am a big fan of Extreme Programming and Continuous Delivery, and I think there’s no other way to create great software fast. This means that when I work in companies (to give an example) that don’t release daily, or never pair program, or just send tickets to devs without any hint of collaboration I get really depressed. Don’t let me get started with big upfront design, useless story points, long term estimations…

At my last company I was the tech lead and I was trying to influence my team to adopt some of the XP values and practices, and it was working well. But then layoffs…

The only way I can think of working around this issue is finding a company that works in an xp fashion or start my own business, which it’s not that easy.

17lj8ki,Career Professional having difficultly navigating corporate politics and how to climb the ladder,"Alright this will be my first post ever on Reddit.
Here's a little background about me for reference.

-I live in Texas and I'm a first generation college student getting my MBA (Fall 2024), my parents raise me in low income class born into poverty. No parents in my life Mom left and Dad died, married (7 Years) , no kids and 1 dog.  I have (1) Homestead Property, (2) Investment Properties. My current net worth 500k and my current yearly income is 115k. I'm a 26 year old Hispanic Male.

I work for a Mid-Size General Contractor Company and my dilemma is that right now In my career I'm 2 steps under becoming an Executive in the company. However I'm having a hard time navigating corporate politics and basically being likeable with Level 8-9 Leadership Personnel.

My co-worker knows how to play the game and it just seems to me that he knows how to kiss-asx to upper management. I push back a lot and stand my ground in my opinions and I don't budge to make my boss like me. 

I know this will eventually result in me not getting a promotion or something. I just can't genuinely be fake or know how to interact with upper management. I'm at Level 7 and I got a few years to correct this but my goal is to be in Level 9 but I'm not liking or understanding corporate politics. I don't want to bend over for leadership I just want them to let me do my way in doing my job. 

I can certainly learn and do the work to be someone higher at the company but I just don't like the feeling of catering or playing corporate politics for leadership to like me enough to pay me more money and get promoted. 

In most companies I have seen the trend that they have to like you and see your potential to give you a shot for upper management. That's what I'm having a debate that I certainly want to grow and adapt but I'm unsure in how people do it. I don't have no one in my life to ask questions as I don't really have a family and I'm the only one that is somewhat successful. Everyone else around me isn't successful or never has climbed the corporate ladder. 

Can someone offer a different perspective? Or ideas in how to climb up the corporate ladder without being a ""Yes Man"" to upper management? It's an issue because I can see my boss doesn't like me because I'm not push over or easy to control. 

I just want to do my work and grow with the company I genuinely like my career I just don't want to be a kiss asx for climbing the ladder.

17lj3dy,Looking for a career or job that's repetitive and has limited social interaction,"Hello I'm an autistic 32 year old military veteran. I have ptsd but I'm trying to get back into the world and do something with my life. I've spent last 5 years since I got out doing nothing but smoking weed and playing video games. I know I need to start somewhere but I don't know where. I've been in therapy for a long time and I feel like I have my ptsd under control and all that's left is the social anxiety. I just recently started taking one college class. I'm handling it just fine, I just passed my midterm exam with a B. Due to my poor financial skills, and decision making I need to get more of an income than what my disability income is going to give me. Repetitive tasks are really soothing to me and I think that would be my best bet in finding a job that will suit me. Any advice at all on what jobs or degrees I can go for that would be repetitive and have limited social interaction would be super helpful.

17lirhu,Manager isn’t allowing any flexibility,"I started at a great company about 2 months ago. The company allows 2 days working from home a week, an open paid leave policy, and many other things I found really great which is why I accepted the job offer. Everybody I’ve met so far has been great and many people have told me to take advantage of the open paid leave because it’s there for a reason. The flexibility of working from home was a great perk as well and the more I’ve been working the more I’ve noticed people kind of pick and choose when they work from home and that 2 days a week isn’t really enforced. My original manager retired and was replaced by another person. This new person, we will call Alice, has allowed me zero flexibility. Alice has taken over and essentially shut down any time I ask about working remote, telling me most people don’t get work done when working from home and it makes it harder for people in the office to get ahold of me (?). She also mentioned that the open paid leave is for illness and not just vacation and that I’m not supposed to utilize it unless I need it (the absolute opposite of what every person I’ve talked to has told me). I feel like a child. Alice wants me to ask her at the end of everyday if I am okay to leave. I usually finish up around 4 but she’s not okay with me leaving until 5, even though we are salary. She has me do work that other people in our department are behind on until about 5, which I find unfair. I watch other departments do what they want, people leave at 3 some days, people are always remote during the week. Alice is here 5 days a week and even works through her lunch hour (we are not that busy so I don’t know what she’s always working on). I get the vibe that Alice thinks she can instill new rules to me because I am new and technically didn’t get the chance to experience the flexibility our retired manager gave everyone so her rules will just be the norm to me. 

I’m new so I’m just stuck on what I can do about this manager. I’m also young in my career but this is a really great company, it’s just one person bringing me down. If anybody has advice or if they think this is an HR issue, please help. 

tldr: New manager is essentially micro-managing me and not allowing me to have the flexibility that other employees have.",LittleSharkzz,1,1.0,0,1698863343,2023-11-01 18:29:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17lirhu/manager_isnt_allowing_any_flexibility/,11,2023
17lilyd,"I am at a complete loss (27, BBA and JD)… where to look?","I’m at a complete loss (27 with BBA and JD)

I have a BBA in Supply Chain Management and a JD from the same institution. I just completed my second full year as an attorney after going straight through undergrad and law school. I didn’t enjoy supply chain, and thought I would like being a civil litigator, hence the law degree. After 1.5 years at a mid-sized downtown firm in a large city, I quit that job to focus on my mental health. 

I have since moved to my hometown and work at a small firm focusing on transactional matters (estate planning, landowner issues, energy law). I am miserable in the position as well. I want to feel like I am part of a team producing something of value, rather than an expert alone on my own “island” preserving wealth. 

Although I have always been service-minded, I cannot afford to work in a nonprofit because I have significant debt from law school. For the same reason I’m not sure how I could restart in a completely different field from the very bottom. I also feel hindered by the algorithms that have pigeonholed me into attorney jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed. I don’t know what types of positions to search for, despite completing some pretty thorough aptitude testing. Long story short, I am at a complete loss on what to do or where to go career wise.

My partner lives in Germany and I am really torn between staying here and perhaps having more opportunities or taking a leap of faith and pursuing something in Germany. If I studied in Germany it could solve my visa issues but if I do not study I think it is super unlikely I can stay in the country as I don't speak good enough German and don't have enough education or experience yet to meet visa requirements (unless I got very lucky).

17lhher,Advice needed: No response after sending availability for 2nd interview,"Hi, 

My partner had an interview last week that went well and was asked on on Monday 10/29 to schedule a second interview session either this or next week (week of 11/6). He responded with his availability but and still hasn't gotten a response (today is Wed, 11/1). 

My fiance and I both have anxiety so I want to be helpful but not give bad advice. 

**Here is the chain of events for reference:** 

**Thursday 10/28:** Interviewed for Job 

**Monday, 10/29, 4pm:** Received email to schedule second round of interviews. 

* Second round of interviews is with about 5 people over the course of 2.5 hours (30 minutes each). 
* One of the people he is interviewing with just got back from her honeymoon this week

**Monday 10/29, 4:45:** My partner responded to email that he would get back to them Tuesday 10/30 with his availability for 2nd interview

**Monday 10/29, 5:50:** Partner figured out his schedule sooner than expected and got back to interviewer saying he can do *anytime* next week

**Tuesday, 10/30, 4:45pm:** He started to get nervous and sent a follow-up (to illicit a response about scheduling), asking what he needed to do to prepare for the interviews.

As of right now at 1:20pm Wed Nov 1 he hasn't gotten a response about scheduling the second interview session. 

**My thought** was to have him email back tomorrow if he hasn't heard back and say something along the lines of ""I am needing to schedule a few other work meetings at my current job and wanted to check in about scheduling the second round. Forgive me if I am being pushy, I am just very interested in this job and want to ensure my availability at a time that works best for all of you."" 

Appreciate anyones thoughts on what they might do in this situation! This is a job he really wants so we don't want to mess it up.

17lc6iz,Overwhelmed with first big job,"Hello all. The title pretty much says it all. I am a new college grad and have my first “big girl” job. It is in a field I’ve worked in before and I am familiar with a lot of the content. However, where I worked prior, there was a chain of command with a lot of leadership and assistance (it was a bigger organization). Now I am handling a lot of things that I was familiar with completely on my own and feel like I am drowning. It is in the education field, and I started a month into school and was met with a ton of unfinished work and errors (think: paperwork, financial assistance incomplete, families confused and not following the procedures we needed to follow). I’ve been here for about a month and a half and feeling like I am expected to just get it all done, but I’m struggling. I’m afraid of making a mistake and getting fired. Does anyone have advice?

Therefore, I began thinking of the idea that I can utilize this time to learn new skills. One of the ideas was to go to school for business administration because that allows for positions to be available such as executive assistant, assistant, etc. my question is if anyone has gone to school for business admin and what do most of the courses require? I did see I believe accounting 101 is one of them and have since been reading up about the basics of accounting.

17l9n76,How to tell my boss I’m having a hard time seeing my future at the company,"This is how I feel, but I know I can’t be so blunt. 

Quick facts for context:
-I’ve worked for the same small company for a few years. I was their first and only hire and we operated as a close team (me and the two owners).
-We recently hired a few new employees because we’re growing.
-During this transition a lot of my work (which was more than a full-time workload) has been divided up among the new hires. 
-However, so much work has been taken off my plate that I 1) lost things I actually enjoy and feel a great sense of pride/ownership over, and 2) losing these bodies of work removed clear paths for my development in the company.

I have a good relationship with the owners and I am 100% certain I am not being let go.

I still have 40 hours + of work but the work is scattered, not focused and not a real body of work. Lately, I feel like I just fill in gaps. Or the one who steps in to put out fires because I’m the only person who knows how to do “everything.”

I saw myself growing with the company. I still want to. I absolutely love the work and the people. 

I have a meeting with my director next week to discuss this. 

What advice would you give in this situation?

Thank you!",ratherbeona_beach,10,0.9200000166893005,8,1698836924,2023-11-01 11:08:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17l9n76/how_to_tell_my_boss_im_having_a_hard_time_seeing/,11,2023
17l93ao,Should I leave my job?,"Since leaving university. I've worked for the same tech company for the last 3 years. I primarily do web development but dabble in cyber security here and there, we're only a small company (< 10 employees) so we tend to do tasks out of our job description regularly.  
My boss is a nice man. It is a family run business he does with his wife. He doesn't believe in corporate culture and the work environment is very laid back. We get unlimited holiday (within reason), he takes us on a trip abroad yearly and they are very laid back if you need to go to the doctor's and will be late in or if something important needs to be done so you can't come in. We also get 2 weeks off at Christmas as the office closes for the festive period.  
While these benefits are great and I have really enjoyed the relaxed nature of it. This job doesn't come without its problems.  
Firstly, because my boss is so relaxed he often floats in and out of company business whenever he feels like it. We don't have a manager outside of him either, usually we just self manage between us all. If there's an emergency or anything pressing he will get it done, but day to day he will just do other things outside of the business. The problem with this is that he often has no clue what is going on and makes presumptions about what we're developing. This can be frustrating as he will suddenly change the direction of our product or start having a meltdown about any problems he thinks it will have when we're already mid development. Things which should've been discussed before we started making it.  
Secondly, he is a chronic people pleaser. To the point where he will offer to make random people at the pub websites and then get us (the dev team) to make them when we are already swamped with other work. To clarify, we are not an agency. We have a singular product which we sell to clients. We don't do custom work generally.  
He also has a habit of hiring semi qualified people he's met at the pub, they then join and have no idea what they're doing and because we don't have a proper manager they don't get any training or guidance and generally just try to learn how to do their job via the internet or they end up helping to build a website for the pub man even if their job is supposed to be in HR.  
For the most part, I enjoy my job and what I do day to day. But the longer I stay there the more I care about the success of the company and it angers me that there is often no one there to steer the ship. And when they are there, they are steering it in random ill informed directions. Sometimes I wish I was managing the company myself or they actually hired someone to manage it full time. But I can't see that happening as the last time we had a manager my boss kept undermining them by overruling their decisions and at one point explicitly told us not to listen to them and to check everything with him first.  
It is making me want to leave and find a company that is ran more professionally and has proper management that lead everyone. I just worry that I will find a new job and dislike it more than my current job. Especially as it will likely not have the benefits that my current job has.  
Feel like I'm at a bit of a crossroads and don't know what to do.  
TL:DR I'm starting to dislike my job due to unprofessional management but I'm worried that I won't find another job with the same benefits.",Turbulent-Magician19,1,1.0,2,1698834692,2023-11-01 10:31:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17l93ao/should_i_leave_my_job/,11,2023

17l6xux,Need advice! It is better to pursue a career I have or should I opt for something else?,"I can’t decide what to do and need some perspective. 
I work as an online tutor with adults who want to learn my native language (not English). I have a bachelor and certificates. I make a good living for the region I live in, I love the freedom this job gives me( I am a freelancer), but somewhere deep down I understand that I resent some downsides that come with it.
Sometimes classes get canceled right before the start, most people treat learning as a hobby, which means that not all of them are consistent. So my schedule changes from time to time, I have to find new students, don’t know the amount of money I’ll make the next month and so on. Whereas I understand that it’s just a part and parcel of being a freelancer in general, I’m not sure if it’s something I want to do in life. I want my job to be more stable and predictable.

I’m 26 and I guess it’ll be easier to pursue something else now, than later when I have a family to provide and more responsibilities in general. However, I have no idea what else I can do.

17l5af5,19yr. old student who doesn't know what to do for a career - Law or PA school?,"Hey everyone, quick background before I dive in; I’m a 19F currently in my sophomore year of uni, majoring in Public Health and minoring in Psychology. I’m a first-gen student and my goal has always been to get into PA school, despite never having had an interest in anything medical. The main reason I pursued this path is because the pay is great, and everyone around me has always said medical school is the safest option; including my strict Arab parents, especially my dad. He has always told me to do whatever makes the most money, and I'm fortunate to say he helps with tuition, so I don't want to let him down.  
Despite this, I’ve always wanted to go into law. I genuinely enjoy law and politics, and my best subjects were always writing/reading & the sciences. The main reason I never considered it is because I have severe anxiety (& mental health issues) and generally never thought I had the right personality for it. I’m not sure what to do at this point. PA and law school are obviously both VERY rigorous, but I’d rather do hard work in something I’m interested in and enjoy. Thinking about PA school and my future just makes me feel overwhelmingly depressed. I just don’t know if I’ll be able to overcome my mental health and anxiety to do law school (though I'm willing of course). I don't want to make the switch and realize too late that my anxiety is too overbearing. I really want to be realistic about my choices.  
These are the only two paths I've wanted to do. Has anyone gone into law school with severe anxiety or any mental health issues? I’d be interested to know how anyone dealt with it.

17l4tf6,Considering a promotion but feeling unsure,"I work for an agency where promoting to a supervisory role is highly competitive. Being able to interview is contingent on a test where the top 10 test takers or so are selected. 

I currently work 8-5 Monday through Friday and recently accepted a lateral transfer to another department that would afford the same schedule but way more work life balance. However, I took the supervisory test on the same day as the interview for this transfer and later found out I ranked 7.. I was planning on interviewing just for experience but then learned that I was one of the best candidates resume wise who tested that high and have a good chance of being offered the promotion.. 

The supervisory position they are now interviewing for is for swing shift with less than ideal work days, however, due to upcoming retirements, it’s possible I’ll have the opportunity to transition to a day shift position in the next year. Doing swing shift would not be great as far as my work life balance and im worried about getting stuck there.

17l4eah,"Hesitant About Grad School Applications, Need Advice","I am going to be graduating after this fall quarter with the last year being my 4th year in undergrad at a University of California school and this current fall quarter being an extension quarter to finish a language GE and two other classes. I have taken the GRE already and received relatively mediocre results with a 162 Quant and 156 Verb with a 5 on the essay. I was an Economics Major but I was very interested in my Data Science and Statistics coursework and I managed around a 3.5 GPA. I do not think my job experience has been that amazing with no internships, only a couple of tutoring jobs that I took throughout undergrad, and a research position I took during the summer of this year that I am currently engaged in.  
  
I feel that my GPA, GRE, experience, and relevant coursework are all not enough for me to get into a good masters program in Data Science or Applied Statistics, as I have not taken any Data Structures or Algorithms classes, and I am certain I have not taken enough of the required mathematics courses to even be considered. I am dreading retaking the new GRE as I feel that I may not get the Quant score that I need to be a competitive candidate, but also feel that even if I do get a good enough quant score, my coursework and experience won't be enough.  
  
What advice can this sub give me as to how to proceed? Should I go to a community college and take some data science and mathematics classes and hold off on applying this year? Should I just retake the GRE and hope that my application is accepted somewhere? Should I just apply to as many relevant data analysis jobs with my current resume and try to find work for a couple of years before trying to attend grad school?

17l2v9a,Leaving for another team in the same company advice.,"
First time poster on this subreddit.
I been in my current position for almost 2 years and lately they’ve hired an external employee instead of promoting me when I did apply for the next role up.
I’ve gotten awards and drove my team to success with the KODs I hit and working with my sites.
I would at least expect a chance to interview. Our team constantly emphasizes growth and being in an open environment yet does not give me a chance to grown within my role. During 1:1s I do express interest to grow and my eagerness for more expose to more responsibilities to help my team and myself grow.
I found the perfect role for my growth within my company it’s just in another team.
I interviewed with the recruiter today and she did let me know I’ll be moving on to the next phase but I will have to speak to my manger about applying.
I’m kind of in a tough spot because I’m afraid if I tell her I want to leave she will retaliate and gossip since she’s friends and hangs out with my co workers although she’s a manger.
Or should I just tell her and be honest I want to leave?

17l2taf,Want to go part time at a company that doesn’t seem to offer part time positions. Do I even stand a chance? Help.,"Im considering cutting back to part time for a better work/life balance, but I enjoy my role at my current company. I’m a WFH new mom at a Fortune 500 company where part time doesn’t seem to exist. 

I’m debating how this should be approached. Would I be better off finding a part time position elsewhere or taking my request to someone within my company?

I don’t know if I stand a chance to negotiate a part time position, and I’m nervous that by bringing the topic up I would make myself a target. I say this because we, like many, have experienced waves of layoffs. 

My reasoning for wanting or needing this change is simply because I’m missing out on my child’s life. Yes, I work from home and my child is typically home with someone else, but I don’t have the luxury of spending time with him during daytime hours. I spend 40+ hrs a week working, and only have about 8 hrs of awake time with my child during the week (I also have free weekends but I need more).

17l246o,Good Jobs w/o Experience Skills Degree?,"
**This question is asked in one way or another at least once a day here. It goes like this:**

*Help me find a career that…*

- Earns good enough money
- In-demand
- Ideally remote 

*…with my background*

- No college degree
- No relevant skills
- No relevant experience
-  ___ years old

**The usual reply answers are:**

- ⁠Trades / Artisan
- Sales
- Business Functions / Analytics / Finance
- Tech / IT Support  
- No you are not too old 

You gain skills with self-learning and certificates that earn you the entry level job. You gain relevant experience by working up and learning more from there. This path should be able to make “good money” in a few years as you grow into any in-demand career.

**Then you ask how to get that entry level job? Especially when the current market is so competitive?**

- The answer is always: Networking

Always try to apply with referral to increase your chances of being interviewed. This is true for any stage of your career. LinkedIn is free or buy LI Premium as you actively search for your next opportunity. *It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.*

**No it won’t be easy. Nothing worth it ever is. You will have to take initiative to invest into your future. Plenty of people have transitioned successfully before. You can too.

It’s so bad I might call off tomorrow to take a day to myself. Please let me know what excuse I could use to go back to X school.",yurmommadotcomma,2,1.0,1,1698805556,2023-11-01 02:25:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17l22v8/guys_i_kinda_screwed_myself_myself/,11,2023
17l20mm,Passed over for promotion,"I work for a company that really prides itself on “upward mobility.” I recently applied for a promotion on my same team that I should have been a shoe-in for. I found out today, that I didn’t get it. The reasoning; “it was very close. The other person had more years of experience than you.” “You’re so ready. Please keep applying” I’m fairly young and got an early start in my career. This is the biggest gut-punch I’ve ever faced. I didn’t say much in my call with my manager (hiring manager) this afternoon because I didn’t want to say anything I was going to regret, but I have a one on one with her in the morning. 

Honestly, I feel like I’ve been punched in the gut and slapped in the face at the same time. I don’t just feel demotivated but demoralized. I work very, very hard. This makes me question why I even try. What’s the point if it doesn’t matter in the end? Generally I’m motivated by my own desire to be the best, but if it doesn’t matter then I don’t even know where to go from here. I’ve never felt so out of control of my own destiny.

I almost would have rather my manager told me “I think you’re an idiot” and I would have been like “oh okay, that’s fair.” She wasn’t the manager that hire me, and I spent the last year trying to convince myself that she didn’t think hiring me was a mistake. 

I don’t know, I really don’t even know where to go from here. I’m so hurt. How do I stay motivated when my soul is completely shattered?",Beautiful-Potato491,2,1.0,3,1698805369,2023-11-01 02:22:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17l20mm/passed_over_for_promotion/,11,2023

17l02r2,I unintentionally screwed over a coworker and I feel bad.,"I have a coworker who can occasionally be a bit challenging. He’s been with the company for about 2 years now and has from all accounts I’ve heard, kicked toes of a lot of people. He has issues with keeping shared workspaces clean, delegating tasks to support staff and doesn’t really excel with physically technical tasks. Despite these issues he is a genuinely good guy who has a really kind personality despite being a little stubborn. He’s also very smart and most of the time seems like he’s doing a decent job.  The way I feel I messed up is I had a manager ask me to send feedback about this guy and I did. I was expecting this to be a simple conversation about ways he could’ve done better at his role but apparently it was a blindside. The way I found out about this was the coworker in question asked me to talk and offered an apology and asked for clarification regarding some of my feedback. It turns out multiple managers and employees had varied criticisms and this culminated in a HR chat. I feel bad because my feedback wasn’t the end of the world but he still had to get a HR chat from it. Part of me feels like maybe I should’ve handled it personally but I’m not amazing with conflict",Inevitable_Mango_873,1,1.0,0,1698799399,2023-11-01 00:43:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17l02r2/i_unintentionally_screwed_over_a_coworker_and_i/,11,2023
17kzk60,Advice for dealing with annoying coworker?,"Hi, I am looking for some advice/tips on how to navigate dealing with a new, annoying coworker.

Me: F26, mid level chemist

New Coworker: F43, senior chemist

I work in R&D, our team has four people total so quite tight knit. The new coworker joined us two weeks ago and shares an office with me so I spend a lot of time around them. I am planning to have a conversation with her about how we can best work as a team, aiming for this conversation to be respectful and constructive. She has already mentioned that she is neurodivergent (which is fine, of course, I am neurodivergent too) so I want to make sure I am respectful, kind, and not coming off like I am attacking her.

So far, I think she is a great chemist, but I can see some personality differences and general mannerisms that may make it challenging for us to work together. 

The concerns I have with her are mainly social. I have heard similar feedback from our 3rd teammate and a couple people from other departments.

* Constantly interrupting and talking over people.
   * Ex/ Recently our team had a lunch meeting with an external partner and both myself and our 3rd teammate could hardly get a word in during the two hour meeting. New coworker talked for 90% of the lunch, not about science but nonsense. 
* IMO, inappropriate comments
   * Ex/ During the referenced lunch, she disparaged our company's benefits in comparison to her last job to the external partner when they asked how she is liking her new position. 
* Seemly self centered / inconsiderate
   * Ex/ We were supposed to be take some time to get to know each other (professional background and personal interests). When she gave her background, I was actively listening and asking questions. On my end, she had no questions about my professional background and constantly cut me off to compare my experience to hers (positive comparisons, but still). I haven't had a chance to tell her about myself otherwise and it has been a couple weeks. 
   * Ex/ She kindly brought in some baked goods for our break room and I noticed that some of them might have peanut butter. I asked her if the pastries had peanut butter, she said yes, then I mentioned to her that it would be good to note any common allergens with the pastries if she does that. Her response was that the pastries clearly had peanut butter and wouldn't be neccessary. Note that our company does have an allergen policy.
* Unnecessary distractions
   * Ex/ I would be focused on my work at my desk and she would start talking to me, unprompted, about things like her dogs. I think it's great to chat here and there, but it is highly irritating when I'm busy. If it is work related, interruption is welcomed. 
   * Ex/ I've noticed her talking to herself on several occasions. While this isn't inherently a problem, I am thinking I should ask her to please prompt me when she wants my attention? I don't mind tuning it out if she talks to herself, but I don't want her to feel ignored either. 

Overall, I am becoming increasingly irritated by these mannerisms and want to convey things I value in my teammates, primarily being respectful and considerate of others to mitigate these issues. I would also love to hear about her values as it's not meant to be a one sided conversation. On a positive note on the science side, she seems very knowledgeable, open minded to new ideas/processes, and I don't think she has an ego about her work.

Wildly enough, this is the first time I have had a direct teammate that has been this grating so I want to keep my feelings out of the conversation and focus on solutions. I don't want to mention these things to management at this time, I would prefer to discuss with her directly. 

If anyone has some advice on how to approach this conversation, I would really appreciate it!
