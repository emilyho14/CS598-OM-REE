1h3pxmg,FIRST REAL JOB OFFER: How DO I NOT Screw Up the Salary Negotiation? ,"Hey Reddit,

So, I just got my first post grad job offer (still not quite sure how), and I’m super excited... but also terrified because I have NO CLUE how to handle the salary negotiation part this friday. 

CONTEXT: I just graduated with a BCom Degree and got offered an entry-level role at a mid-sized company, and the offer seems decent, but I keep hearing, you should always negotiate. Now I’m wondering if I’d be leaving money on the table if I didn’t at least try.

Here’s a couple questions that I am hoping for some thoughts on:

* Is it ever a bad idea to negotiate salary? If so, when?
* What’s the best way to phrase a counteroffer without coming across as greedy or ungrateful?
* What is realistic regarding things like benefits, flexible hours, remote work, or a signing bonus?
* How do I follow up to ensure any agreed-upon terms are put in writing?
* What should I do if I don’t have competing job offers to strengthen my case?

I really don’t want to blow this, but I also don’t want to accept less than I’m worth. Any advice from those of you who’ve been through this before is greatly appreciated I’d really like to hear your personal experiences and different opinions!

Thanks in advance for your help seriously! ",Beginning-Upstairs41,2,0.6000000238418579,56,1733010867,2024-11-30 23:54:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h3pxmg/first_real_job_offer_how_do_i_not_screw_up_the/,11,2024

1h3omb1,Feedback Wanted - How to Proceed With My Career ,"Long time reddit lurker, first time poster. 

Im looking for some advice or feedback on where to go from here with my career;

To make a long story longer than it needs to be, I worked in property management for over 10 years of my life; I worked as a property manager for about 7-8 of those years and a licensed apartment locator for the remainder. I worked for mostly smaller real estate firms so the majority of the monthly accounting cycle would fall to me besides in most scenarios there would be a controller to do hard close etc. 

I got to the point a few years ago where working on site was not ideal; I worked in low income housing so it was constant extremely high stress environments and just generally not a good time. I got a few clients I would do general bookkeeping and administrative services for so my resume would not reflect a gap while a took a little break after the horror show that is property management. 

For the last two years I've been working in AR/Payment Posting for a hospital system and i'm quickly finding out that no matter how I slice it, this job is a dead end within my hospital system.  The pay is not great but I was willing to risk it for the biscuit to get some non property management financial experience with promises of room for growth. However our hospital has done several rounds of layoffs and freezes on hiring and department moves which is not an environment cohesive for career growth. 

The conclusion is Im wondering were I should go from here? Where have you gone after Payment Posting? 

I don't have a bachelors degree 

I got a Google Data Analytics Certification (don't ask idk why I did it) and the Intuit Certified Bookkeeper Certification to try to beef up my resume. 

I would like to stay on the financial side of healthcare unless I'm being delusional and my credentials are not on par and I should look into another industry. 

I would like to stay fully remote

Should I get my CRCR (Certified Revenue Cycle Specialist) Whats the practical application for that? 

Should I pivot to billing and coding? What is the pay opportunity like and remote eligibility? 

  
I feel like all the positions I've chosen to build my career are just adjacent enough that my skills aren't transferring to higher paying positions within the accounting cycle or the financial side of healthcare. I've done tons of google research and feel like I'm being pulled in conflicting directions as far as advice. I would love to hear from anyone who's been here or somewhere near here and has any helpful advice or direction and has some practical knowledge to drop! 

  
TLDR; Property Manager to Hospital Payment Posting trying to figure how to stay remote and monetarily move up in my career.

1h3nm6b,Need advice in advancing my career,"I'm a non-EU person residing in France for last 8 months. My French level is zero (but seriously taking French classes on saturdays). I have a PhD in materials science and working in EV battery industry (5 year academic reaserch and 2 years in industry). I'm a bit scared about European battery industry after the northvolt debacle. 

I'm being paid decently, for my qualifications. My major worry is that I'm the sole earner in my family of 5 (dependent wife and baby, and parents back home). So I feel whatever I earn is insufficient and feel like im sitting on a financial time bomb. 

All my life as a student I never gave importance to earning money, and I followed my interest in scientific research. Now starting from scratch and I'm feeling the need to earn more. Looking at automotive sector right now, I feel that I'm never going to earn enough to have a comfortable life. 

I'm wondering what are the next steps should I take to earn more.
 Moving to management?
 Staying in R and D?
 Sitting to manufacturing?

 ( of course when my wife starts earning, I would be in a better situation, but I'm just focussing on what path I should opt). 

I kind of feel lost and any sugestions are welcome!

1h3m2gy,On progression plan with boss but big boss hates me,"I have a direct boss who I get along with fine (I resigned this year and he asked me to stay with my requests answered, so I did). We agreed on a progression plan for me this year and feedback in my latest 1:1 was good and he said keep doing what I an doing. 

Problem is, we have a big boss - Ceo - who I feel dislikes me and I never really knew why, only reason I can think of is I am quieter and more serious, and he has a clear liking to joking, funny types. My big boss has openly been quite rude to me in meetings which my boss tried to brush off as its ""just him"" and don't take it personally. My boss even apologised to me for my big boss' behaviour when I raised it in my 1:1, so it's definitely not in my head. 

I have a big project coming up which will be great for achieving the goals on the progression plan. Seeking views on - is it really worth it to try hard and keep going here or should I just look for another job because I am not sure my moving up is going to happen with my big boss? 

Further info: overall theme of my progression plan is to build better relationships with my relevant stakeholders including big boss. I am kinda lost on how to do this now and had even felt about confronting my big boss about what his issue is with me. I think its my personality as he would assign some very complex issues to me (so don't think it's performance related).

I have worked in kitchens since the age of 16. (21 now.) Kitchen porter, kitchen assistant and then as a cook. I dislike working the crazy hours that come with working in kitchens. Don't get me wrong. (I am thankful for the employment. Also, that I have found stable employment in kitchens or the years.) However, It has been 5 years and I am sick of it. Ngl. Too much stress but sadly it is all I know how to do. The only time I spent at college was doing my cookery certifications. I did awful at high school. I am dyslexic and have dyscalculia. So, I need a job that as NOTHING to do with numbers, maths, or too much writing. I have ''Ok'' people skills when it is on a one to one. But, dislike having to talk to too many people in one day. (Stress.) I don't have many talents other than I can ''cook'' and draw sometimes.

I am not smart enough for an office job. Also, I do not want to work in sales as I have 2 friends who work in sales and they are unhappy in their work.

I honestly don't mind hard work as long as I am not mentally stressed while doing said work. I was thinking of paying for a job coach but all my family is telling me it is a waste of money going to a job coach. I am financially safe atm as I have not handed in my 2 weeks notice yet.

1h3j009,"Coworker refuses to work more than a minimal amount due to ""taking care of a sick spouse and kids"", but Facebook shows that they are partying and traveling","I have a coworker who is junior to me and reports to senior management generally.  I am one of about a dozen members of senior management.  The coworker has a very narrow, technical job that nobody in senior management can do, so the coworker is considered to be important and nobody in senior management knows enough about that job to say whether or not the coworker is good at it.  I've learned some aspects of the coworker's job and I think that the coworker is incompetent, though.

Most importantly, the coworker refuses to do their job for more than a minimal amount of time.  Whenever I ask the coworker do so exactly what the coworker was hired to do, the coworker refuses, stating that they are taking care of a spouse and children who have significant health issues.  The coworker uses this same excuse when others ask the coworker to do the job that the coworker was hired to do.  The coworker works remotely, several hundred miles from the company's office.

I found the coworker's family's information online (using sites such as Mylife, Facebook and LinkedIn) and:

1. The coworker's spouse has a full-time senior job at another company.
2. The coworker's and the coworker's spouse's Facebook accounts are full of photos of the coworker and the spouse partying: dressed to the nines while sipping Champagne and otherwise living it up at night.  The Facebook accounts also show the coworker and their family at major tourist attractions around Europe within the past few months.

Maybe the coworker's spouse and children are sick, but somehow they managed to party and travel.

I think that we're being conned by this coworker.  I plan to share screenshots of the coworker's and their spouse's Facebook and LinkedIn accounts with other members of senior management.  I want to have the coworker fired.

Anything else you would do in this situation?

But I wasn't dumb - started interviewing month 1 of that PIP. Landed a senior position at a competitor literally the day before they let me go. New place actually values speaking up in meetings. Been here 2 years now, running my own team.

1h3ge6l,"Stuck Between Career Decisions: Abroad Assignment, Potential Promotion, or External Job?","Hi everyone,

I’m facing a tough career decision and could really use some advice. Here’s my situation:
	1.	The Abroad Assignment
I’ve been offered a one-year assignment abroad as a Post-Merger Integration Manager. It’s a significant opportunity and could potentially boost my career. However, I recently bought a house and have a great support network of family and friends where I am now. I don’t feel a strong need to relocate, but I asked my manager for career progression, and this is the opportunity they’ve presented.
	2.	Potential Finance Director Role
Separately, a Business Unit Director at my company has expressed interest in offering me a Finance Director role. This would be my first leadership position, which is a key step in my career. However, the position hasn’t been approved yet, and the same higher management that proposed the abroad assignment would need to approve it. I would need to decide on the abroad assignment first before they would even consider me for the Finance Director role.
	3.	External Opportunities
I’ve thought about applying for senior roles at other companies. While I like my current company, I feel like I’m being bounced between different management factions. That said, I’ve only been here two years, and leaving this soon might not look great on my resume. Also, I’m concerned that my lack of leadership experience might make it harder to secure similar roles elsewhere.

Key Concerns:
	•	If I reject the abroad assignment, I worry it could negatively impact my standing with the higher-ups and jeopardize future opportunities within the company.
	•	The Finance Director role feels like a great growth opportunity, but there’s no guarantee it will be approved.
	•	Moving to another company might provide clarity and new opportunities, but I’m not sure if it’s the best choice given my tenure and lack of leadership experience.

For context, I generally have a good relationship with senior management, but I’m concerned about how rejecting their offer might be perceived.

What would you do in my position? Take the abroad assignment, gamble on the Finance Director role, or start looking externally?

1h3e83v,My Full Time Salary increased by 386% in just 3 years! This is how!,"Having pursued my bachelors and masters in Geology, I started working as a GIS Engineer in November 2021 at a US Based MNC.
I joined at a 3 LPA Package, where my in hand salary was 17,500 INR for the first 2 months. Increased to 19,500 INR from the 3rd month onwards after a 2,000 INR monthly deduction component was removed.

Worked there till 2023 March, for about 1 year and 5 months. While leaving, my last in hand salary was 21,500 INR.

I had started my own EdTech Platform in parallel, in November 2021 itself. The Full Time salary calculation doesn’t take this into consideration at all.
But for overall context, I am mentioning the details here.
It started giving me the net profit of 35,000 INR to 45,000 INR from January 2022.

Grew the platform from zero to 5,500 Subscribers in 1.5 years entirely organically.

Left my full time job in March, 2023 just to pursue this venture full time.

Got suggestions to pursue MBA to boost my salary package. I didn’t feel like investing money into pursuing MBA which I wasn’t interested in.

Long story short, The EdTech experience added a few skill sets to my repertoire, which I didn’t know would count towards any corporate job thereafter.

Cut to August, 2024; After being away from a Full Time job for about 1.5 years,
I applied for a Business Consultant role at a company, got the job offer based on my interview excellence and my entrepreneurial experience.
I decided to go for the full time job based on a few factors that I won’t elaborate here.

The Business Consultant job role was no where related to my education background neither to my work experience of a GIS Engineer.

It has the starting pay package of 12 LPA.

Right now, I am making 85,000 INR in hand salary from this full time job.
The EdTech platform is still running in parallel.

","Hi everyone,

I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at a startup in India with over a year of experience, where I focus on building applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating AI to deliver products to clients across various industries.

After doing some research, I’ve noticed that the pay and growth potential in Finance seem to be higher compared to Data Science. While I’m confident in my performance and anticipate a promotion in my current role, I’ve observed that there are significantly more hiring opportunities in Quantitative and Risk roles than in Data Science right now. The Finance sector, with its potential for higher salaries and the sense of prestige, also seems very appealing to me.

That said, I also appreciate how dynamic and ever-evolving Data Science is, though I sometimes wonder if I want to keep diving into new AI models and mathematical concepts for the rest of my career. This doesn’t affect my job performance, as I continuously work to upskill and excel in the AI projects I’m involved with at my company.

Considering future prospects, what would you suggest I do? Should I continue honing my skills in AI and Deep Learning, aiming to move to a better company in the Data Science field, or should I pursue an CFA/FRM certification and explore opportunities in Finance?

For whatever reason late 2022 into about spring 2024, in my department of 17 people over 10 quit or were let go very quickly, including some people who had been there for like 20 years almost. This happened across several departments and I believe the organization lost around 15% of the workforce during that time period, if not more. This included people who previously supervised me or that I reported to indirectly. I did not keep up with my department head, either managers I had, or a director who was a former supervisor who left about a year before me. 

I did try, most of them reached out to say goodbye or offered me a reference, including my department head. I was polite and thanked them but did not do much in the 7 month period I was unemployed to reach out beyond that. My references were an external client, someone who was my indirect manager, and a colleague I sort of indirectly managed at one point. 

I’ve been in my new job for about five months and plan to try to stay until about this time next year (maybe longer?) however they’re experiencing some financial difficulties that were not known until about two months ago, and it is distinctly possible my position may be eliminated. This is a small possibility but I directly oversee some financial pieces of the organization so I’m pretty aware of how bad it is. 

Anyway! My concern now is that of the four people I would consider asking for references who are higher level, all but one have left for other opportunities and I feel it would likely be too late to try to repair the “friendship”. I’d rather not see or talk to these people given how toxic it is, particularly the one person who would likely respond, but I am a bit worried about references while I casually look at job openings. 

Right now I would ask the same people who gave me references. Although now it has been more than a year since we worked together. Otherwise I can ask a former direct report and possibly a director and manager from another department who have also left, but it might be weird as I’m courting them as consultants for a project at my current job?

Does it look terrible to not have any direct supervisors to act as a reference? As said the job experience was extremely toxic and by the time I left it was busy season (so people were unresponsive) and I spent the next 3-4 months basically taking care of my mental health. I’d rather not engage but I feel I have to?

Thoughts? Apologies this is long. ",scrivenerserror,1,1.0,1,1732973336,2024-11-30 13:28:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h3cld5/references_trying_to_hedge_my_bets/,11,2024
1h3cc7z,Is my manager being an AH or are his concerns valid ? ,"Not sure what flair to assign. I am extremely confused on how to handle this.

A year ago I started working on a KPI and my efforts were noticed. This then prompted an action to start a project centered around the KPI. The project was led by this manager. Let's call him A. He is empathetic and kind. Takes everyone's opinion. His project management skills could improve. But overall a nice guy.

This project is now managed through series of workshops conducted across different regions. So a fair bit of travel is involved. Initially A hired a consultant to run these workshops. He then later asked me and another team member to run these workshops by learning a new agile mythology. We accepted. I let my manager  (P) know that A is expecting me to run workshops and I want that too. Well my manager got mad. He said A cannot change the scope of my involvement in the project. According to P, he had agreed 30% of my time for a very specific task in this project. Not for me to run workshops. A's argument is that it's not P's call on how he utilizes me in the project.

P now has said I cannot absolutely run the workshop. If I want to, I can join another team who is into these kind of tasks and he will initiate my movement in 6 months. 

You can understand my dilemma. My current position is of people manager. So I like leading a team and don't want to forsake it. But I also want to consider the option of running the workshops. Maybe I can reduce the intensity of the travel. Maybe 1-2 travels a quarter. But the prospect of running a workshop in a different region is too exciting for me to turn down. It also helps me learn and expand my network.

My manager is not up for negotiation and is being a total ass. I understand his concern that if I am traveling too often, I am not available for my team. But at the same time, I don't think there should be this much dependency on me. I had also asked for a backup during my annual assessment and was denied.

My partner thinks I should not pick too many fights. What do you guys think ?",Sufficient-Paint-534,0,0.5,11,1732972480,2024-11-30 13:14:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h3cc7z/is_my_manager_being_an_ah_or_are_his_concerns/,11,2024
1h3bcol,Searching for a first job in France,"Hi everyone,

I'm writing here because I really need some advice and support. I'm a recent graduate from a French university, and I'm struggling to find my first job. During my Master's program, I completed two great internships in the fields of tourism and digital marketing, and I received recommendation letters from both employers. After graduating, I even did another short internship as a social media manager to gain more practical experience. I really enjoyed it, learned many new things, and brought lots of fresh ideas. My work was appreciated, and I received another recommendation letter.

At this marketing agency, they wanted to hire me on a temporary contract (CDD), either full-time or part-time, as they were impressed by my skills. Unfortunately, due to financial issues, they couldn't make it happen. Whenever I followed up, they would say something like, ""We would be happy to keep you, but we don’t yet have information about our budget, let's keep in touch"".

Recently, my university had a job opening for a position that was a great fit for me. The Head of Department wrote me an internal recommendation to strengthen my application. It didn't work either - they rejected me immediately, even without an interview, and justified it by high competition

It has now been over a year that I’ve been trying hard to find my first job. I send about 600 CVs and personalized cover letters, I maintain a portfolio, and include my recommendation letters. I speak 3 languages, which is often considered a great advantage, but it doesn’t seem to help. I’ve only had about 15 interviews in the past year, each of them ended up with a rejection due to ""high competition"" and ""we chose a profile with more experience"".

I constantly develop my skills by taking online courses to stay updated and because I enjoy learning new things. I also participate regularly in professional events in my city and work on building my network. I’ve visited associations like Mission Locale, APEC, and France Travail for support. My LinkedIn profile is polished, with a professional photo, an attractive summary, and relevant experience. I’ve also modified my CV and cover letters multiple times and tried different formats, but nothing seems to work. I always prepare hard for interviews, try to manage stress, prepare questions to ask. 

I’ve been learning French since I was 6 years old in school, and I always dreamed of moving to France to study and work. I still love this country, its people, and its culture, but the job market is hard, and it affects my self-confidence. All of the effort I’ve put in - from learning foreign languages, adapting to a new country and education system, dealing with bureaucratic issues, to securing interesting internships (which many employers still don’t seem to count as “real experience”) - has left me close to burn-out.

How did you find your first job? Are there anyone here who is working or looking for a job in France (especially in marketing)? If anyone has been in a similar situation, or if you have any advice or simply support, I'd love to read your comments.",matveevanastyaa,1,1.0,0,1732968910,2024-11-30 12:15:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h3bcol/searching_for_a_first_job_in_france/,11,2024

1h39v7w,Feedback,"I've had been working as a consultant for 6 years
As Data Engineer support (ETL developer, Databricks, Azure, python) and data Analyst in last 4 Years (PowerBi certified,ETL, Data Warehouse, data pipelines, SQL server).

Worked for one big 4 and switched to another big 4.

On last 4 years in this big 4 things have been a rollercoaster of emotion.
I'm extremely good in projects where data maturity is more than bronze and queries only require 200-300 hundred rows because there is a good data model.

I have been put on pure SQL projects with queries longer than 1500 rows to be tuned in machines that host 7 big databases with only 16 gb of ram.
Data's quality is less than bronze.

I'm struggling even if I manage to fix things and I'm trying to get away to another company, as sometimes it is overwhelming for me to understand the domain or to understand why they wrote 1500 lines for a 2000 rows table.

I don't consider myself a rockstar neither a stupid data engineer, just a good person with skills in DE and DA.

I'm trying to hang up on consultancy as the anxiety to be 100% operative on projects with no domain explanation in 2 weeks is crushing me.

In interviews I struggle if they ask abstract questions (if a data model has a measure that is wrong what you do?)

But if I can visualize them I'm extremely good at finding a solution  (theoretical and abstract logic questions are always causing me anxiety because I cannot visualize them).

When I talk with friends or ex colleagues they are ""wow, you work with stuff I would never know, you know more than me""
.
But when I apply is becoming more hard because they ask me questions on something and I don't know because I've never worked with it and the level is hard because Im considered a senior role.

Interviews are always tough but when I pass them the job is 3 level above the interview standard.

Has someone of you had this problems and did you fix it?
Do I really need to learn how to crack the interviews ?

1h39lff,Need an Advice on my current situation ,"Working at one of the top 3 consulting firms. It’s been less than 6 months so I am yet to complete my probation. Things were going very well for me for the first 3 months and everyone was happy about how I was progressing in my role. The fourth month I took leave for my marriage and when I came back, things have suddenly became very different.
My work load increased tremendously, and even though I was sick, I never took a day off. Over the last one month I’ve been working tirelessly - An average of about 14-16 hours. 
Having said that, my supervisor hasn’t been the easiest person to work with. He just vanishes in the day, saying he’s got work to do, and the team is just left trying to figure out things ourselves.

The other day when I went to office, he just came to me and started saying things like - You look so overwhelmed. He literally took away my laptop from me and started pointing out mistakes (Alignment only). Then he started saying things in a very negative manner. He said your work is not zero defect. You’re going to complete 6 months and If you don’t work on this, I’ll have to report you. 
He then started comparing me to one of my juniors, saying how that person works better than me, and how I should atleast be better than them. 
He then started asking questions like - Do you even know what we do? What did you make in the slide today? 

And so felt so small. I was like you can’t do this to me. I atleast know my job. 

Okay…for once even if you think I need to work on my performance, you don’t give a threat to report when the person hasn’t even completed 6 months! You can’t be comparing me to someone else! It literally felt like harassment and an attempt to break my self confidence.

I have been working tirelessly and this incident has just shaken my confidence in my own capabilities. I am legit scared for my job now.

Instead of pursuing internships like many of my peers, I chose to work with small F&B businesses, helping them build their social media presence using the creative skills I had taught myself.

After college, I received a full-time offer from a small wedding company to produce wedding films and manage their social media. However, after a couple of years, I became burnt out because the work felt monotonous and lacked opportunities for career growth.

Now, I’m working a part-time job while living at home trying to figure out my next steps.

When I first dropped out I began selling insurance for nothing exept for comission as a life/accident agent. I made some money but it was give or take about minimum wage. I had to quit because my car completely broke down over how much driving I had to do.

This lead me to transition into medicare health insurance. This industry has big ups and downs, benefits being everyone needs health insurance (especially seniors) and the pay was decent with a 3.5k base and with comissions I was making about another 1.5k a month. Downside being the industry has to deal with constant government regulation that gets more strict each year and if any financial struggle arises they lay off the agents first (which is what happened).

Which takes me to my current role from January 2024 until now. I made a transition into tech as an entry level SDR for a mid size auto dealer SaaS company. The work and pay is gruelingly painful but the long term payout is nice. I love this company's value and culture but I watch my bank account every week like a doomsday clock. 

What I am trying to figure out is should I double down and give more than the 100% of what I am giving here and try to make it work (me and my entire team has not been hitting quota since we started). Or should I abandon my sales background and learn a new skill that pays out no matter what the client says.

1h31x0a,My new employer are not allowing me to walk to and from work due to safety reasons. Has anyone experienced this before?,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping for some advice about a situation with my new job. For context, I (F25) recently got hired at a place that’s about  20 minutes away from my house. I don’t drive, but I specifically chose this job because it’s close enough for me to walk. I’ve done longer walks for work before, so I really don’t mind it at all.

During my induction, my manager asked if I found the parking okay, and I mentioned that I don’t drive and walk instead. That’s when they told me I’m not allowed to walk home in the dark because it’s not safe. At first, I thought they were joking and laughed it off, but they were serious and said the company takes employee safety very seriously and won’t allow it.

This was a bit alarming because I’ll be working a lot of night shifts (starting at 10 PM and finishing around 4 AM). My manager clarified that the company would provide a taxi for me to and from work, but I’m feeling conflicted.

Although I appreciate that they care about my safety, I’m worried this could cause problems. A taxi for every shift seems like a huge expense for the company, and I don’t know if this is going to lead to tension down the line. This wasn’t mentioned in the job listing or the interview, so it’s all come as a bit of a surprise.

I initially told them I could likely put in a two week notice (at the first of multiple interviews), but I hadn't thought of the fact that my annual performance bonus is being paid out at my current workplace very soon afterward. Historically, my company has not usually penalized people for this, but it is of course possible and totally up to their discretion (as I have personally seen noted to others). I'd really like to not lose that, especially considering it is for my past year's work which I did already put in with my current workplace. I really want to get started at this new place, but also don't want to miss out on something I did work hard for. I also realize that a complication is that I do want to give the current employer proper two weeks notice, and even if I stay through that week of the payout, there is always a chance that they would rescind it any way just because they know I am leaving (unless my start date was pushed back numerous weeks, which I don't see likely).

1h31bcr,HELP :( what career might fit me? ,"im currently ending my senior year at highschool and am considering majors/careers. i recently got the advice to not imagine the dream career, but the dream lifestyle and what career would fufill that (while being doable). sorry it's pretty length

here are some things about me - skills-ish:

* i am most talented at (and enjoy) writing, organization, and to some degree, communication
* i am averagely (or a little above average) at math and science at my highschool (maintained med-high A's in all my science classes - bio, chem, etc - and all A's in my math classes - but i only took lower math such as geometry, alg, pre-calc, and now, stat)
* idk if i suck at this or just had a horrible class but i despised my physics class, i ended with a low A in all marking periods so technically not bad but it was a horrible memory for me
* in my personal life, i love talking to people about creative things such as books, shows, psychology, and giving opinion on those stuff, people always come to me for advice about anything and when they need help with organization and creating a schedule to not procrastinate (im very good at these things)
* pretty ok/good at public speaking
* however, when it comes to serious decisions, i like giving informal advice but i dont like having to make big decisions, find official solutions for people, or do anything where i could be wrong (decision-related, interpretation-stuff if that makes sense) it stresses me out knowing i could have made the wrong decision so in that way, i guess i like more matter-a-fact things like ""do this for me"" or ""organize that and create this"" (i just dont like being the one in charge/blamed but i like to contribute to decisions being made by giving inpute. i hope that made sense)
* im introverted to a degree and pretty good with work-ethics so i like to finish things on time which usually means i work alone, but like mentioned above, i also like having people to work with so they can proof my work and that i wont make big mistakes

logistics/lifestyles things i want:

* i want a very good paying job considering i want to be able to travel, have a home/car, sustain a family, my parents, and my younger brother without stress (80,000-100,000+)
* i like jobs with remote opportunities (i want to travel)
* i like jobs with part-time opporunities (especially if i decide to switch and only want to work a 3-4 days a week)
* i really value work-life balance so a job that doesn't carry to out of work times (when i clock out, IM DONE- dont need to think about it)
* a job with good satisfaction rates
* a job that could be worked outside of america/globally

There was also no discussion about pay increases, even though our workloads are expected to grow substantially because of this.

The real shock wasn’t that AI is becoming a part of our jobs (we’ve all been using it to some extent already), but the way it was communicated: on a Friday, weeks before the holidays, after months of overwork, and with zero preparation or guidance on how to upskill ourselves. We’ve been expected to go above and beyond just to keep up with the current workload, and now we’re being told we have to do even more with no help or clear direction.

I am trying to decide how to set myself up for better chances of long-term success. I live in a HCOL area and don’t necessarily want to move away just yet. I’m considering a Masters degree but want to narrow down what tracks may best fit my interest and skills while providing a higher income.

I am very much a craftsman, have a lot of skills including basic laser cutting, CNC, and 3D printing. I love understanding how things work, problem solving, and visual design. Is it worth taking time to do an M.Arch degree and pursuing architectural work? Is this an already over saturated market, and would entering the game later (mid-30s) be a waste?

1h2w5xo,If You know you are going to lay someone off or let them go... just do it ,"I currently work for a company that is going through significant cuts due to financial constraints. And there are all kinds of schemes being developed from closing down entire projects to downsizing services and departments to offering early retirement and even a voluntary exit with a payout. 

And I'm in a role that is absolutely on the list of ""likely to be eliminated"". I know because I am senior enough to have seen documents and budgets that include uncertainty about me and my role. No one seems to know ""what to do with me"".  

They don't know because my role is leading a multi-year IT project portfolio where everything except one project is being paused for a few years. I was hired full time because of how many years were planned and there's really nothing comparable for me to move into. 

I know this... I see it coming and nobody has talked to me about it. Nobody has provided me notice or made me an offer to stay... nothing. So I'm sitting here doing work that is important to what is going forward in this project but I know it won't be led by me. I've seen the org charts. 

All I gotta say about this situation is that if you know that a job will not exist just pull the lever and terminate it. Because being in a state of limbo and uncertainty is untenable. It's also humiliating as I sit there talking to staff who ask me what I'm going to be doing and I don't know. It's damn embarrassing. 

Why am I waiting instead of leaving on my own? Well... I've got almost 20 years in this place and I'm going to wait for that severance package. They have to give me a nice chunk of money and at my age (I am 60), I need a good cushion. 

Just wondering if anyone here has experienced this and did you talk to anyone about it?

1h2vp1w,"In need of advice, what careers suit me?","The market today does not value what I believe it should, but as so famously quotes centuries ago, you cannot get an ought from an is.

Also I am typing on an iPad so please forgive errors.

I am a philosophy major (I chose it for personal reasons), and the plan was to go to law school. But, plans change. So, let me just dive into who I am it’s some  bullet points:

*philosophy major, with a concentration in ethics and political theory, half analytical, half continental 
*mag cum laude grad
*Fulbright Grant winner, currently teaching English in Central America 
*fluent in Spanish
*Military Veteran, marine corps infantry, non commissioned officer, two tours. 
 
I have my eye set in public service again, and so naturally USAID or State are two agencies that I pay close attention to (USAID requieres a masters, State does not but its preferred) but with President Trumps return I have to face the reality that there is going to be a massive restructuring of things, and that being said, a major layoff or freeze of federal employment—this is not a political statement, just a fact. 



I have applied to John Hopkins SAIS as well as the Bush School for a Masters in International Relations; but if I am being honest, while I love school and am of the opinion that that continued education is never a bad thing, there is an elephant in the room—I’m already 34 and want to get into the job market to build civilian experience, I’m not a 25/26 year old. 

Some interests of mine are things like:
International development, primarily within law enforcement and corruption, climate change, women’s rights, and education—hence my interest in a masters. I have reached out to some larger nonprofit organizations on LinkedIn and through email that work with migration and stability, but had 0 success. 

So, I have two months until the JH and BSPS tell me yes or no, but I figured it never hurts to ask for advice…so here I am.

What corporations, organizations, or sectors should someone like myself look into, either as a plan if I am not accepted into masters school, or as a goal to set after? Public service is still my number one dream but as I stated, I’m a realist…Trump Admin is gonna gut quite a bit and leave no room for newcomers.

1h2ueug,A cautionary tale about freelance video editing:,"On February 22nd, I reached out to a real estate agent in Dubai via Instagram, offering my video editing services. After a follow-up message on October 30th, she finally replied on November 23rd, asking me to create a free sample edit.

I agreed, and suggest her that if she liked my work, she would need to pay for the services. I shared my charges and portfolio with her, and she seemed to like my edits. However, she demanded a free video, promising to pay for the second video. I politely declined, explaining that I couldn't provide free work to every new inquiry.

After agreeing on the final paid edit, she shared the raw video with me on November 28th and asked me to edit the entire video. She mentioned that she would pay after the delivery of the edit.

I worked on the video and sent it to her on November 29th at 1:04 pm. However, she left me on ""seen"" without responding. After waiting for two hours, I followed up with a polite message asking if she had viewed the video.

Her response caught me off guard. She asked for some changes to be made to the video and casually mentioned that the edit was ""very basic."" Her words triggered me, and I quickly responded, ""Please get your video done elsewhere however you like it.""

I realize now that my response was abrupt, but her comment had stung. She replied, saying, 

""Oh my god, your attitude is really bad. Good we didn't start working!""

That's where our conversation ended. I'm still reflecting on how I could have handled the situation better.

I tried to explain my perspective, saying:

""It shouldn't be called attitude, even good or bad! I have a different mindset than yours, and without clear instructions, especially when it's the first time doing work for a new client, it took a few revisions to understand your vision. Instead of clarifying your doubts, you chose to criticize my work, calling it 'basic.' And you'll probably agree that there are better ways to ask for changes and provide feedback. Feedback is essential, but the way it's delivered matters.

""Imagine if someone told you, as a real estate agent in Dubai, that your services are poor and there are much better agents in the city. Wouldn't you feel that's unfair and unprofessional?

It's just that we can either criticize the work or maintain professionalism.""

However, my message seemed to fall on deaf ears. She replied, saying:

""You're not ready to hear feedback. And by the way, I'll be paying for the video, I have the right to speak.""

I ended up replying, 

""God bless you with more money so you can continue treating people this way who work for you.""

Her response was, 

""You need to grow up!""

At that point, I decided it was best to end the conversation. I haven't responded since then.

It's clear that our working relationship wasn't meant to be.",Imranedits,1,0.6000000238418579,0,1732910428,2024-11-29 20:00:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2ueug/a_cautionary_tale_about_freelance_video_editing/,11,2024

1h2sgpq,Thinking of switching careers from IT to Nursing. Should I do it? Is it do-able?,"Hello all. Let me give you my background: I'm a 30 year old woman. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science. I've worked in the IT field, with various titles, for 8 years. I've been working for a healthcare company for 5 years. I currently make about $100k a year. I was stuck at \~$85k for many years, and only recently hit the $100k mark a year ago. I live in a big city where $100k is just about living comfortably. It was always my dream to work for healthcare company, so I never felt a drive to leave my current company for more pay.

I've been considering a career shift for almost 5 years now...For SO many reasons. First one being job security... Job security of corporate America has ALWAYS been at the mercy of the economy and other unstable factors- But recently it's gotten so much worse. Viewing job boards earlier this year, I was seeing barely any listings, and the few listings I did see were offering $50k for full time. I started doing some research and there are articles everywhere now saying the tech boom is OVER- And tech job listings are down 30% since Feb 2020. Many jobs being replaced by AI. My company is also struggling, despite being in a sector that's considered ""strong"" (healthcare). The company does yearly layoffs. I live in a state of anxiety worrying if I will be in the next layoff cycle or not.

Second biggest factor- Which has gotten stronger as I got older- Is that I generally feel out of place in this field. I am the only ""younger"" (well, sort of younger) female on most of my calls- Which is fine with me, truly, I love working with men. But what I've realized is that I do not have the ""assertive"" or ""high-strung"" personality that typically women in corporate fields need to have, in order to do well in a mostly male environment. It goes against my nature- Which is to be more caring and nurturing towards people.

Thirdly- My interest in the field itself has sort of died. When I was in school, I loved writing code and doing math and taking programming logic classes (well, sometimes...). I just don't have the fire in me to do it anymore. At my job before this one, I would cry in the bathroom sometimes after being given a list of 50 penetration test fixes that needed to be done in 5 days- But at some level I loved the pressure of this. Part of me still loves pressure I think- But not for THIS. I hope this makes sense. 

The problem is- I have bills and not enough savings to support myself through nursing school while not working. If I lose my current job, I'd be completely screwed. I've been talking to an LPN/RN program, who thinks I'd be accepted no problem- But I think the workload on top of full time work may be too much for me. I'm not sure if it's even do-able. Looking for any input from anyone.

1h2sgpl,I submitted what I think to be an honest Self Appraisal,"We have had the initial self reflection aspect of our annual review process and I have submitted my section for the use of management. For context the company I work for is highly corporate and is a multinational.

I pretty much said I wasn't happy with how I have performed and that I'd not been influencing the teams that interact directly with ours in any way outside of what they would expect. I was promoted about a year ago but I'd always describe myself as a middle of the pack worker. I don't shirk off, I arrive on time and I've never been off sick but I'm not particularly happy with my PDEV and I put that. 

I find self evaluation hard in general because I always feel like I'm not doing as much as I can/ should be but don't have the energy to do any more than I am. 

My boss was saying to me before that I needed to put in what I had achieved but I genuinely felt I haven't this year.

I have been working the past week while being sick because it’s a new job for me and he’s been at his job a bit longer. He says that we need to show them that we are willing and want to work but I feel I have shown them that. I came in while having this terrible sickness and even also I have an infection in my nose too. This all limits my work ethic a tiny bit but I know it would limit my work ethic over the next couple of days because I am now coughing up so much phlegm sorry tmi and also coughing every 2 seconds that follows a pounding headache and hot flashes and cold sweats. AND we work at an ice rink that is very cold so I don’t think working all week has been helping it go away at all. It’s at the point where I know that I need to just take a couple of days off. And my employee has no problem I feel giving me the 2 days considering I haven’t done that before and how I worked all week while being sick. 

My partner also does the literal most at jobs like is almost a slave to work and takes care of his health second.

1h2rzoj,Is this standard practice?,"I am a manager in a guest services team, the bulk of which is compromised of staff on hourly wages.  Myself and other managers, including in other departments, are on salary wages.  Last week, it was announced to the team that all hourly staff will receive a roughly 6% raise in December, and will receive time and a half pay for approximately two weeks when we get into the holiday rush after the pay raise takes effect. Ontop of that, they do receive a small cash bonus (Max of $700 before taxes).

In previous years, salaried staff receive the 6% wage increase as well. This year however, this is not the case, and we are only getting the small cash bonus of the same amount.  My boss sent the announcement of the wage increase to the hourly staff, but there was nothing addressing the wages for managers.  Based off what I have heard from manager colleagues in other departments, they were not told anything either and they too manage staff of hourly employees. It was only when one of us asked the boss via Teams on whether we will receive a pay increase, and the answer is that our raise is merit based, and will not come until April, and will be applied retroactively.  

Is it common practice for a company to treat wage increases different depending on your exemption status, and if it is, to this degree?

The fact that I have no college or social life never affected me much as I've been an anti social germ since covid struck but when I got out of my home and moved to another city I felt TERRIBLY lonely. I made a few friends in hostel but but but.
 The thing is I've been single all my life, there have been a few situationships if those counts but I've never had a constant someone and it has always felt like a void. When I try to say that out loud I've been judged and called desperate (and i judge myself too). Plus I've been single for too long that it has become veryyyy difficult for to let my guard down around people. I cannot let people in even after a while. It takes too much of time to get there.
All of this was okay until my academics started getting affected by all this. I have pattern where i start to like someone or vice versa and I dive all in into all the possibilities that could happen and then it doesn't work out, and at the end only thing that end up getting fucked is my studies.
My parents are chill until I maintain my academics and from the last couple of years i have made no progress in CS exams. And the law degree I'm getting won't get me a decent job so that doesn't count for my parents. So the pressure's on from that side to now.

1h2o4w8,How to tell my asshole boss I'm quitting ,"I have been working at this job for almost 3 years, im a 25 y/o woman with a 65 y/o grumpy boss. I got this job through my dad who has worked here for 5 years as a subcontractor so he doesn't work directly in the store, we basically just set him up with jobs and then pay him when they are complete. I am the only sales employee and my boss is the owner of this small store. He is an absolute asshole. He makes mistakes and blames them on me (Example: he sucks at spelling which I don't blame him because English isn't his first language and misspells so much but blames it on me). I always just accept the blame to not make things worse because he has been very vulgar and angry in the past. He often will cuss at me and he nit picks everything I do down to the way I speak and type on my keyboard. (One time he even mocked me by typing on his keyboard very fast and aggressivly and stated that I email too much or something - I also have longish nails so they always make a click noise when I type and I'm also a super fast keyboard typer). 
Last week our new employee (a 36 y/o woman) quit out of the blue, she went up to our boss and told him she didn't want to work here anymore and left. She did tell me about an hour beforehand that she was going going be quitting and stuff. She only worked here for about a month and a half. She told me she couldn't put up with his ""toddler tantrums"" anymore and felt like no matter what she did while at work, she was always wrong because of him. I also feel that way. She called out on a Saturday (which is only a 4 hour shift) because she wasn't feeling good and he cussed at her about it and said she should have given him more of a notice. She argued with him that she didn't ""Plan"" on being sick so she couldn't have given more of a notice. We were also supposed to work the next weekend for a Halloween event and stay extra late until 8pm so she told him she wouldn't be able to because she had an important dinner with her boyfriends family and he told us that ""I understand family stuff is important, but not when you work for me"" and blah blah blah about work being more important. To give more context we are a VERY small store and have maybe 1 customer a day. I have rarely called out or taken off any time in advance because it is always super inconvenient for him.
I am starting school in January and I need to let him know I'm quitting but I'm scared to give him a notice and then him be a jerk to me the remainder of my time here and I would be open to just up and quitting one day without a notice because of the way he has treated me but I don't want that look bad on my dad or anything.

Hey everyone,

I’m feeling really stuck right now when it comes to choosing my career. I feel like I’m interested in too many things, and it’s making it hard for me to commit to a single direction.

To make things more complicated, I wasn’t able to get into my dream program due to my grades, and now I’m left with a few options I’m unsure about. I’ve been considering:

Law

Economics

Food Technology

Human Resources Management

I’m genuinely torn because each of these fields seems interesting in its own way, but I’m also worried about whether I’ll enjoy it long-term or if it’s the right fit for me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you make your decision?

Any advice, stories, or insights would mean a lot to me. Thanks!",Metanoia_0010,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1732893637,2024-11-29 15:20:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2o26z/feeling_very_stuck/,11,2024
1h2nsil,Finance Degree worth it? ,I currently work in sales with no degree. I’ve been thinking about switching careers as I don’t get paid that much (45k average) I have some college credits (dropped out) and needed to find a way to get a degree while maintaining a full time job (8-5). The only thing I could think of that would be even remotely feasible is a school that was completely online. So I looked into southern New Hampshire university and am thinking about a bachelors in finance. Is this degree worth it? And would an online school like SNHU be the right school to pursue? ,nickcedar,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1732892883,2024-11-29 15:08:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2nsil/finance_degree_worth_it/,11,2024

1h2n2df,How I am going to explain this ,"Hi everyone I need for advice about my situation last year early 2023 I finished school got a job around June then found out I was 3 months pregnant and worked there for about 5 months I went on my Maternity leave for about 9 months and made a mistake of looking for a new job because I was so underpaid and wanted new opportunities 

I got a job in September that was paying better and I was very honest during my interview and told them that I am new to the industry and that I don’t have enough experience the hiring manager was like no problem we are ready to teach and invest in you. 

My team was so toxic that I would say morning and nobody would reply to me, the old ladies that worked there for over 20 years started to bully me by saying that I am stealing their job because they are not busy enough and were fighting with hr all the time it was exhausting to come in there every morning but I kept my head up and The hr lady kept encouraging me by telling me to hang in there that she knows my team is toxic and they are trying to change that 🤔 and of course I was patient because l needed the money to keep paying my bills 

So this morning I got a call from hr and she told me that they are letting me go and that I am not the problem and that my team is the problem and not willing to train  me and she apologized by saying that she wasted my time and that she shouldn’t have hired me in the first place 

Now my resume look terrible because basically basically I worked for 2 different companies one for 5 months another for 2 months I got an interview coming up and one of the lawyers worked at the first firm I worked at so I can’t even say that I still work there because he might check how I am going to explain this ???

1h2m3ll,"Will you sign a contract that has ""contractual penalty"" clause?","One potential client sent over a contract that has this clause: 

""Upon breach of Section 3 of this Agreement (Confidentiality), the Mandatary shall pay to the Mandator, upon its substantiated claim, a contractual penalty of up to 5000 euros, regardless of actual damages.""

For more clarity on what section 3 actually contains---it lists these as confidential items to not be disclosed to anyone even after the agreement ends: 

3.1.1 business, financial, operational, technical, administrative, marketing, planning, customer and supplier details, business opportunities and staff information relating to the Mandator;

Is this something to push back against? I am worried about this: ""contractual penalty of up to 5000 euros, regardless of actual damages.""

Ofcourse you share work samples with future potential clients (esp if they are not ghostwritten), so I am not sure if that would also be considered ""confidential information"" as per the above? 

- Is this clause normal? Or is it something you would be worried about too?
- Will you sign the contract if the client refuses to remove this clause? 
- Anything I can say/ask/suggest to make the client remove this clause? 
-  Anything that has worked for you in the past?

1h2lktk,"Stay at ""real"" job or go full time freelance as a mechanical engineer? ","Hey everyone,

Just want to preface this by saying I'm in the EU, Croatia to be more specific. Also, excuse the throwaway, my main is very doxxable.

I graduated Uni (master of science in mechanical engineering) in July and started in my new, basically dream, position in September. The job is great, I like what I do, I make enough money and I like the people I interact with regularly.

In the meantime, somewhere around March or April, my freelancing started taking off. I currently have multiple  clients, all of which have expressed great interest in a longer term relationships (some of them I've already done multiple projects with). All in all, I earn almost as much doing freelancing after work (around 10 hours a week) as I do at my ""real"" job (40 hours a week). I'm also confident I would have enough freelance work to do for about 30 hours a week for at least the next year. And all of this is without actively seeking new clients. I'd also like to add that I enjoy the freelancing stuff as much as the ""real"" job, if not more, though it does cause me more stress because I take on more responsibility personally.

I've only been at the ""real"" job for three months now, and there's a six-month probation built into my 2-year contract. Obviously, as a recent grad, I've been learning so much here and it has been very beneficial for my professional growth. I originally intended to work through the 2-year contract and then consider going full time freelance. However, since the freelance work has been growing, I'm thinking about ending it after the 6-month probation period.

I'm young enough and confident enough to be willing to take the risk now, but my biggest concern is what happens when the freelancing stuff dries out. I'm worried I'll be missing out on some natural career progress and promotions, and that I'll be stuck back in junior roles if, for example, in 6 years I have to find a ""real"" job again. Additionally, I'm also questioning whether or not I should stick it for the entire 2-year contract just for the real world experience (supplier and manufacturing communication, network connections, and the knowledge and experience from the seniors that I can tap into here at my company). I value this highly because I have ambitions of developing my own products and starting a goods company at some point.

Overall, I think short term (next couple of years) freelancing is the better option, but I just don't have the experience or the foresight to know whether it's a good decision now for the long term.",temptortoise420,1,1.0,2,1732886231,2024-11-29 13:17:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2lktk/stay_at_real_job_or_go_full_time_freelance_as_a/,11,2024

1h2jog6,Our VP of Finance confided something VERY personal at an event to me after wine. She either forgot or she’s now purposely trying to sabotage me. HELP! ,"This…is a doozy. 
I work at a small family business where I’m the one-person marketing department. It’s a relaxed, collaborative environment, and I’ve always gotten along well with my coworkers. My father is an executive at the company and my role requires me to meet regularly and travel with the leadership team with whom I am very close. I want to emphasize I am not worried about my job security. 

 A few months ago, my dad hired a new VP of Finance, “Kathy,” who’s in her mid-60s. At first, she was wonderful—smart, kind, and a great fit for the team. A mutual friend of my dad‘s had recommended her and from day one she was just so happy to have this job and be the newest member of our team and would tell us that. I could just tell she really needed to feel like a part of something positive and she’s say things to me like we’re her pseudo family. We would regularly chitchat about things like her grandkids, and my child, her terrible divorce, in which her ex apparently had been cheating on her their entire marriage, how she hoped she’d sell their house in another state soon, things like that. She is very classy and accomplished, and I just felt terrible that this amazing woman who didn’t deserve anything like this had been growing through such a tough time. Our roles do not overlap in any way, shape or form except for occasional invoicing sort of things.

However, things recently got weird. At a company event, after a few glasses of wine, she followed me to the bathroom. She told me that her ex had tried to contact her that day and then send to me, and you know… The worst part is he infected me. Confused, I asked her what she meant, and then said to her oh my gosh, he gave you an STD.?! She told me yes that last year she found out he had an infected her with HIV. I have never been so shocked in my life. I felt like my heart just shattered for her and could not believe this professional and amazing older woman had this happen to her life. I also immediately felt sort of guilty because I realized she was probably a little tipsy and would maybe be embarrassed for revealing her secret. I don’t even remember what I said, but it was kind and empathetic. We went back out to the table and honestly, we all had a really nice night. 

Since then, her behavior toward me has shifted. She’s micromanaging things that aren’t part of her role, escalating minor issues to the CEO, and making comments about my schedule that feel like she’s trying to undermine me. Part of me is scared that she’s worried I’ll tell her secret and is trying to push me out.

I don’t want to overthink this or be unfair, but the dynamic has gotten really uncomfortable. How do I handle this without making things worse?",DependentStand,139,0.8600000143051147,135,1732879221,2024-11-29 11:20:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2jog6/our_vp_of_finance_confided_something_very/,11,2024

1h2jab3,"New software engineer, working solo on the largest project we have.","So I'm a fresh grad just a couple years out of school and I've been programming since I was a kid. I started working at my job a couple of years ago and quickly rose to the performance level of the senior-most engineers at my organization.
And long story short, I volunteered to work on coming up with (and implementing) a design for one or our biggest endeavors ever. 
And so now I've been the only developer on the project for several months. I was told by my supervisors and colleagues to let them know if I needed help on the project, but it's started to become an obsessive passion project for me, and I just wanted to develop it entirely myself.
And so everybody has just sort of stepped back and left me to it. And I'm now the main point of contact for the project. And I've also interfaced directly with the customer all by myself.
Nobody else has a clue how I'm doing it, everyone is just standing by and watching me demonstrate the end result of each iteration of the product.

Although everything's been going well so far, lately I've been starting to reflect upon my current situation: 
I'm the sole designer/developer of this project (which I proactively sought out to be), and everyone including our customer knows it...
And so if I inevitably fail (which I havent so far, but I am starting to feel imposter syndrome), all the blame will be solely on me. There's no way to ""politic"" myself out of this situation.
And so, it feels like this one single project has the potential to either make or (permanently) break my career. And that is absolutely terrifying.

1h2h1fo,Is this considered mobbing/toxic?,"I started to work as a simulation engineer for a robotics company. A small company with 20-25 people. It's only been 2-3 months. After getting proficient enough with simulations, my manager told me to spend some time with the commisioning team in the workshop so that I can understand how my simulations/codes work irl.

Day 1 in the workshop:
There are 3 guys that I'm supposed to hang around with. One of them is the commisioning engineer. The other two are his some sort of assitants. Guy1(engineer) told me about some basics. What he does with my code and simulations etc. We spent the day together and got along very well. They were talking about how quickly we got along and etc. I enjoyed spending time in workshop more than I did in the office.

Day 2:
It was a Monday. I went there and was continuing where we left off on friday but something was off. Guy1 did not make any eye contact if I did not directly speak to him. He ignored me and didn't talk to me unles I ask him something directly or if our manager wasn't around. And when I ask something he speaks in a tone that makes me want to not ask anything again. I feel like a shit and I just sit there doing nothing. When I ask about something either they respond with a rude tone or theh say they dont have time for that. They go to breaks and they don't ask me to come with them. They act like I'm a spy from a rival company trying to steal intel.

What could've happened and what should I do?
1. After the first they I really enjoyed working in the workshop and was talking about how easy it is and how much breaks they have. He might've overheard this and got mad at me for this.
2. I'm currently doing my masters in one of the most reputable schools in the country. In the first day we talked a lot about ourselves and they learned about my ""success"" in school etc. He might've gotten his ego hurt or he might've seen me as a competitor or something.

There might be some other causes but these are the most likely ones that come to my mind. I'm open to your ideas.

I don't wan't to bring this to my manager since they've been working together for some time and I'll be the party pooper and maybe a whiny bitch.

I also dont want to talk to him about this because he'll probably deny by saying something like ""what? I dont even think about you lol""

What should I do? Am I overreacting?

1h2fjf0,What are some careers I could pivot to based on my experience?,"22F 

I know I’m young! I don’t need to hear the whole spiel about how I have my whole life ahead of me, things change, life doesn’t go as planned as you think, etc. All I need from you, the reader, is to trust me when I say that I have always been mature for my age. I carry myself very differently from most 22 year olds and have always been assumed to be much older than I am. Even if you are inclined to think I’m “just saying this,” and it’s not actually true or you think my definition of mature/capable differs from what most others would think, just pretend for the sake of this post, that I truly am mature and have a level of professionalism and competency that most 22 year olds do not. 

I really am just wondering how I can either continue career growth in my field of experience or pivot to other loosely related fields. 

I have my high school diploma and I did duel-enrollment (community college while still in HS) during my senior year. So I do have some college credits/started working on an associates degree. I graduated in 2020 at the peak of covid when everything went remote and I didn’t feel like paying full regular tuition for only online classes because I tend to be more successful with in-person, hands on learning. So I started working full time and haven’t found a good opportunity to go back to college yet. (it’s something I’d like to continue at some point tho) 

I started working at 16 for Target doing order fulfillment/ picking and shipping. I was there for 3 years then left for another retail order fulfillment job. I’ve been at that company for 3 years now too. 9 months after getting hired, I was promoted to an assistant manager position. 

So I have a HS diploma and some college and then experience in customer service, warehouse operations, inventory management, fulfillment, leadership etc. 

I am extremely interested in career advancement/higher pay at the moment. My current job does not really have room for growth at the moment and the company is actually in a tricky position that brings me a lot of concern with job security throughout the next year. (it’s complicated) Other jobs in my area for warehouse/inventory/fulfillment management do not pay very much, either less or the same as what I currently make so I feel like I can’t just find a new job. 

I really enjoy what I do, but I find the most enjoyment in the things that aren’t “part of my job description.” 

* I love creating solutions to problems and finding ways to improve efficiency for operations and for the employees. 
* I reallyyy love solution focused analysis of data discrepancies. 
* I enjoy how my job is a perfect mixture of being on my feet and computer work. I couldn’t stand to be sitting at a desk all day, everyday. It makes me sleepy if it’s too excessive. 
* I like looking into the specifics of orders and inventory history to figure out what the issue is, how it went wrong, and then figuring out how to prevent the same problem from occurring again or documenting the problem and communicating with other people that can fix the problem. 
* I thrive in high stress, fast paced environments as long as I am well equipped enough that I either have all the knowledge and tools needed, or I have the flexibility and authority to make executive decisions on a needed basis. (I’m aware that this is not always a realistic ask and that sometimes you have to just make-do with very little)
* I consider myself to be very creative and meticulous. 
* I’ve always been interested in graphic design, “behind-the-scenes” operations, planning and execution. 
* I enjoy a mixture of working alone and with a team, but I have really enjoyed my experience in management.

This entire post is essentially just me asking if anyone has any ideas on what I could do. I’m open to returning to school as I really enjoy learning. Financially it won’t be easy but, if it’s necessary, I can make it work. I know I lack a lengthy history of experience because of my age, but I’m driven and dedicated to learn whatever I need to.

1h2ff20,Associate at a $9B AUM VC vs. Chief of Staff at a Series A startup?,"Background: graduated from a T10 grad school in the US (non MBA), majored in finance and marketing for my undergrad, and 3+ years WoE in investment advisory & VC as an analyst and associate. I got an offer for a CoS position at a series A company with $1m ARR (not too big of a number i know but the traction & market opportunity are promising). 

Questions:
-Will the learning curve be really steep if i take the offer? 
-anyone here knows what are the possible career paths after chief of staff?
-is this a better opportunity compared to working as an associate at a large VC? ($9b AUM)

My biggest concern is that I have no c level experience and with my work experience I’m worried that the learning curve will be really steep and I might f**k this up 🥲 any advice will be greatly appreciated!",Jabba-the-Hoe,1,1.0,0,1732861023,2024-11-29 06:17:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2ff20/associate_at_a_9b_aum_vc_vs_chief_of_staff_at_a/,11,2024
1h2f8zd,"Is anyone else out there feeling aimless, hopeless, and just … stuck?","Long story short, I just left a toxic job in a field I’m no longer passionate about for a different role — and it went badly.

My new employer explicitly discriminated against me in a way that is blatantly against certain federal regulations that they’re held to. (Before anyone asks: Yes, I can prove this. I have documentation, and the regulations are clear. I’m taking steps to hold that employer accountable, but I’m sure it will be a horribly dragged-out process. So until I get resolution, which will take God knows how long, I have to figure something else out.)

Anyway, I have a useless liberal arts degree, I’m not a highly technical person, and it feels like no matter where I look, fields I’m qualified for are over-saturated, competitive, and unstructured. There’s no clear path to advancement or development.

And while I used to love learning, I don’t have a budget for another degree or expensive, subjective certifications. (I’m also still wildly burned out, which doesn’t help.)

Nor do I want to start over in an entirely new field that MIGHT work out.

I’m just sick of problem solving. I’m sick of trying to figure out solutions to problems that shouldn’t exist. People shouldn’t need to be in a perpetual state of tremendous, formal learning to make a decent living. People shouldn’t need to be wealthy and privileged to have access to the learning opportunities they want.

I just want stability, financial freedom, and a job that doesn’t make me want to jump in front of a train.

1h2df92,Small company was acquired and about to lose fringe benefits. How should we proceed?,"I've been with this company for a little over a decade. Most employees have. We were under 30 employees total. We were bought buy another company that has been buying small companies in our field across the nation after a large private equity group became involved with them. Now the company is nationwide with over a dozen acquisitions and in the 300 employee range.

With this small company we were paid in the $60-65k range in a county where the median HOUSEHOLD income is about $60k. On top of that we were given company vehicles that we had access to use as personal vehicles. I, along with most of the employees who had this benefit didn't even own personal vehicles other than our spouses.

Obviously the new large company doesn't want to take on this liability and we'll be losing access to the personal use portion of the vehicles(I don't fault them for this, it is the right decision). We've been offered a lump sum $5,000 since we are losing this benefit. But I approximate this benefit to be in the $10,000/year range once you account for vehicle cost, maintenance, gas, additional insurance, etc.

I guess my question is, should we just accept this and be happy we were getting the free lunch for so long? I'm considering this a pretty severe pay cut, but at the same time we're still paid pretty well for the market we're in. Any move we would make to a similar position elsewhere would be a lateral one in pay.

On the other hand, we service a large portion of area for this new company and even a few employees saying they're going to leave would cripple our 'branch' for 6 months to a year. We're booked months out and our jobs are cyclical. Losing just a few employees would mean millions lost in business over the next year as well as absolute chaos trying to keep up with contracted schedules. So we do have negotiating power in the short term (1-2 years realm).",OnionReasonable6607,0,0.3799999952316284,23,1732853664,2024-11-29 04:14:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2df92/small_company_was_acquired_and_about_to_lose/,11,2024
1h2d4rt,I felt uncomfortable at work,"Hi Reddit, so I'm a long time lurker first time poster but this situation has me posting for the first time. So I 24F, have recently started my first corporate job alongside another girl (also 24f). I had some previous experience while in college (retail and the like) but this is my first time working in a office from 9am to 6pm. My job is relavtively high since my boss is directly under the CEO.  Which means he often is in meetings and I have dealings with the rest of the directors and managers. So far this job has been fine and this is the first time i ever felt uncomfortable .

So today we were done with our job and we were getting to leave when the CEO calls us and my boss to a meeting. At first it was normal but then another high ups started to arrive and having drinks.(These are all 40 to 50 something year old men) Nothing untoward happened but soon the conversation took a turned I didn't like.  

They started talking about an epic Christmas party, they had where they invited strippers and how its unfair how drinking during office hours its not longer view as ""appropriate"" and ask us wether he had boyfriends. 

All of these while they were drinking whiskey and even offered it us (I refused but they put a glass in front of which I didn't touch) since it was getting late not a lot of people remained at the office. The office where this happened was also pretty secluded. 

I was finally able to leave and I repeat noting bad happened (they didn't assault us and didn't offer us to go with them or anything like that)  but I got to admit i got pretty uneasy and a little scared, the whole thing gave me a bad gut feeling. 

So my questions is how can I stop this from happening again? Should i report it to HR? Does this count as harrasment? This my first job and I have only been here 2 months, it's a pretty good salary considering I have zero experience and I really want to stay and don't fuck it up. 

The other girl seem pretty comfortable with the situation and was even engaging with them and having drinks (they even joked about which clubs are the best and discussed vacations spots). 

Am I blowing this out of proportion?

i sat down in her office to ask if i'm doing anything wrong. the entire conversation seemed like she picked at the smallest things. she told me how these two specific coworkers (yes, she said their names) were complaining about me, i asked what the complaints were. one of them was that, ""i saw you walk into work one day, and noticed you didn't say good morning to (coworkers name). that was very rude of you."" i always say good morning to everyone and ask how they are, but one day was a big deal to her. i told her that was just a mistake and that i didn't see him. it wasn't intentional at all, i just literally did not see him when i walked into work.  
  
 i asked what the other coworker was complaining about and she was smiling like a bully and said, ""well... it's just, your face."" i had no words and was so so confused. i was like, ""my face?"" which was offensive to me as an asian woman who grew up being bullied. then i noticed she paused and you can see that she regret saying it, then was like, ""actually, wait, i don't think he said exactly that."" and laughed it off. i was so confused but upset. like my stomach was turning. i started to tear up and straight up cry. i told her, ""everyone else in the building says i've been doing a good job, and that i look brighter lately."" then she was like, ""well are they the manager? of course they're not gonna tell you what i tell you. some people are two-faced. that's the real world. you're still young, but when you're older and get married and have kids, you'll know."" i just kept crying and after that she said, ""look, all you need to do is smile a lot more."" i was just silent, then said ""alright. thank you."" and just got up and silently left the room.

it hurts till this day what she said to me. especially because we work at an office and i'm always trying to keep the workplace a positive environment and keeping in touch with all my coworkers, even buying them lunch and coffee every now and then. but those words, ""your face"" as a complaint was so so hurtful. i can't look at myself the same without feeling insecure and trying to figure out what's wrong. we don't have a hr department, she's the office manager. i want to send a complaint, but not exactly sure how. i just don't want her to get away with what she said. i don't even know if it's discrimination overall",sor0-0,17,0.8399999737739563,35,1732847156,2024-11-29 02:25:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h2bm29/is_this_discrimination/,11,2024

1h29unm,Should I pursue a web development job or a CS master's abroad after graduating with a triple major in life sciences? (23F) Seeking career advice and mentorship,"Hi everyone,

23f, graduated in 2022 with a triple major in life science from Bangalore. After graduation, I felt lost and unsure of what to do next. I briefly considered preparing for CAT but didn’t go through with it. I then tried sales for two months but quickly realized it wasn’t the right fit for me.

Initially, I considered continuing with life science, but I felt that the scope to make a good income in India wasn't as high, and I wanted to explore opportunities abroad. However, at that time, my parents weren't exactly willing to support me in that direction. Now, they are more open to me pursuing a master's abroad if that's the path I choose.

I also thought about pursuing data science at one point, but I didn’t follow through. This year, I decided to focus on learning web development by myself and have successfully completed courses for frontend, I’m currently learning backend development, but I feel stuck in a loop where I keep learning without applying my skills in real-world projects. I’m too scared to start applying for jobs because I don’t feel ""ready"" yet On top of this, I keep seeing posts on Reddit and elsewhere about how difficult it is to find a job in this economy, which makes me more anxious. I’m really keen on gaining experience and upping my skills, even if it means working for free to build a portfolio.

I’m also worried that time is passing by too quickly, and I’m considering pursuing a master’s abroad in a relevant field like computer science. I initially thought about doing a distance MCA but have now ruled that out after reading a lot of negative feedback about distance learning programs.

Right now, I’m at a crossroads and unsure whether I should:

Start applying for web development jobs with my current skills, even though I don’t feel fully prepared yet?
Pursue a master's degree abroad in a relevant field to gain formal education and credentials, while also potentially opening up more career opportunities?
My main goal is to gain real-world experience, continue learning, and grow my skills in the software development field. I also feel like I need a mentor to guide me through this uncertain phase, as I’m struggling with decisions and direction.

1h27e2q,Hostile work environment in boston biotech,"Need some advice ! 
Joined a small biotech few months back and had horrible experience. Senior management had filled the department with their faithful pets (from previous companies, old friends etc.) and these people were totally hostile towards newcomers. These assholes took credit of others people work, openly projected aggressive behaviors etc and managememt was supportive of this. This went to the extent of my manager threatning with the consequences when I raised my voice (he actually wrote that in teams 1:1). They had a brown manager before under their noise and fired him (I am sure racisim also play big part in their behavior). Now this company got acquired by big biotech, this old management manipulated performances during communications (i suspect !) and I feel new management is passive aggressive towards me due to that BUT still no lays offs in picture. These assholes (small company) made me sign non-compete during hiring and every other biotech works in same therapeutics area as my current company - so moving around is difficult. HR never helps in these hostile work environment situations and always side with management. I feel stuck. Any thoughts on this?

1h272xy,I feel lost. What can I do?,"
Hello all,

I for the last 3 years have worked at a contact center for Merrill/bank of America on the wealth management team, my responsibilities are servicing wealth management clients and FAs/CAs that will call in on behalf of the clients servicing includes updating Merrill/Bofa personal information, going over activity/statements, regular banking services reordering checks, paying credit cards etc, and online banking I recently also started getting skilled for mortgage and small business calls as well. 

I do well in my current role in most ways, except the heaviest weighted benchmark which is client satisfaction. The issue there is clients are sent a survey after the call via email that they have to score the associate as well as Merrill/BofA but the clients simply just don’t read the questions when they’re upset/unreasonable. They will mark 1s for all 5 questions then in the note box they will praise me then bash the bank. My management will see this and still say I could’ve done better explaining the survey or some other comment that just is not helpful in anyway. (I as much as I can explain the survey the first two questions are about me the rest is about the bank I hope my service meets all your needs! We aim for 9s and 10s here at Merrill!).

The bank wants all associates to be at 95% to be in the green anything below that is a fail.

Only 9s and 10s are worth a point everything else is a 0. 

I have been applying to WFM for awhile now. There was an entry level role that I qualified for so I reached out to the hiring manager to ask if I can shadow one of his associates, which I then did and it went great asked a bunch of great questions and learned a lot about the role. Then I got the interview for the same role. I believe I did very good on the interview I was already very familiar with the systems they use because I used them myself to peek at the queues while on calls, and I was very proactive with having my management change my skilling based on what line of business was queueing up to get it cleared out.

I believed I was the perfect candidate for the role. After the interview I emailed the hiring manager and the team manager thanking them for their time, no response. A week later I emailed both again following up thanking them for the opportunity and looking forward to speaking again, no response again. I check my workday portal everyday to see if the status on my application will change to anything other than interviewing. Another week later my application is no longer on my dashboard, never received a rejection email, emailed the hiring manager one last time asking for pointers for the future and any reason why I wasn’t selected, no response again.

I was ghosted from both the hiring manager and the team manager I do not understand for the life of me why, I reached out to my management to let them know and ask their input and they were shocked but nothing can be done 

I feel helpless. I still apply everywhere but no interviews since then. Most of my applications are internal and I have a good standing with no verbals or write ups and getting a meets every year for the last 3. 

I just want to be off the phones and advance I’ve been stagnant and speaking with clients that make you feel like you’re not getting anywhere after an hour of explaining what a statement balance is for a credit card is driving my nuts.

I just want a role that’s not client facing at this point I don’t care what it is I’m just tired.

Note: I do have my bachelors degree in business management as well I recently graduated this year.

Please any advice would be deeply appreciated.

1h2450c,Are Job Assistance Services worth it?,"So I am planning to sign up for a 3-month contract with [Student Ports](https://studentports.com/) (a UK based agency to help International Students with their needs) to have a personal case worker and apply for jobs on behalf of me. The case worker would also be working hand in hand with me. Their goal for me as their client is to help me secure a visa sponsorship from an employer based in the UK, Ireland, or Gibraltar (as those are my country choices). Of course, I am still the one who will attend and ace my job interviews, their job is to just apply as much as they can, use their skills and connections with employers etc., and get me to job interviews. The service also comes with AI-ready, CV enhancement (to UK standards), cover letter, LinkedIn ""re-branding"".

I am eager to get a job in either of those 3 country options. I am a temporary resident (student) here in Spain and I don't see myself working here in the next coming years of my life. I could apply jobs for myself but, I am just thinking that I am still no-expert and there are stuff that I don't know especially that I am applying from overseas. I am also a full-time student + remote job worker, living alone plus the everything in between happening with my life as an expat in a countryside here in Spain (struggling and surviving, I need to study Spanish as long as I'm living here of course, I know that).  So I'm thinking it might be a good idea to bank on a personalised case worker to help me secure a job in my desired countries.

Do you think this is a good idea? You can search up their [website](https://studentports.com/) and please let me know your thoughts.

1h23igs,Spiraling because I don’t know what to do with my life ,"Hi, 

I’m currently enrolled in a community college and taking classes to fulfill public health and nursing prerequisites, but I’m not sure if I want to jump into the health field right away. I’m in my 2nd year of CC and I’m planning on applying to 4-years next year, but now I don’t know what to do because I feel like I’m neglecting the rest of my passions and like I’m losing touch with myself. I really love design, specifically fashion design and furniture design. I’m not sure what to do about this because I feel like if I decide to change my major I’ll take even longer to get my bachelors degree, which might delay me from getting a job or pursuing higher education. All my life I’ve been focused on health, so the thought of doing something different is scary to me. The idea of nursing gives me comfort because I feel like the amount of money I’ll make will make it easier for me to switch careers and go to grad school, and I also like the idea of being a travel nurse. This is something I could always revisit though, but I’m not sure what to do. I’m almost finished with my prerequisites, i just need to take my TEAS test before applying for nursing schools. Honestly all I want is to make things I love. I want a studio to make my furniture, clothes, and jewelry in. I’m also questioning whether I should go to a trade school or do industrial design at a 4-year. I’m not sure of anything at all right now.

My position is entry-level and I was trained by Coworker A who is in the same position as I am and started a month before me. However, I noticed that they have been assigning A newer tasks, so I suspected A was getting promoted. It basically got confirmed when A told me our manager let them know of some changes happening in the new year: manager is stepping down from the role and is offering the position to the senior members of our team. 

I was excited for everyone, until I talked to Coworker B about it. We kind of got into a rabbithole and it was a rude awakening. It doesn't help that in a different conversation a while ago, B told me about past coworkers being laid off due company changes.

Some red flags I gathered:

1. Not getting notified about my manager stepping down

2. Not getting trained on tasks that Coworker A (has the same position as me) is doing

3. I also noticed that I didn't get a 1:1 meeting this month while the rest of my coworkers did

However, there are also other factors that make me think otherwise:

1. Manager told A and I that we would be trained on a certain task that mid-level members do

2. There are no significant financial issues that I notice, our company has been offering many bonuses

3. We have been extremely busy and need all the help (although, this could drastically change after the holidays)

1h1x51b,feeling like i disappointed my boss’ boss,"to summarise the context of my situation, due to certain circumstances, i’ve to report directly with my boss’ boss for some tasks. i’m fairly new to the team, only been about 3 months in the team and i’m very new to the workforce in general. 

in general, i pride myself for picking up tasks quickly and being able to get things moving despite being new to the work and to the team. my boss and his boss are very understanding and good too. they know i’m new and have not had much guidance, so they mention they appreciate that i’m doing my best in my situation. 

recently, after revising a deck twice with our agency, i sent it to my boss’ boss for her approval only to receive a ton of comments on the deck. i was focused on the overall content body and making sure the deck was aligned/cohesive. But she commented at a level of detail that I had not anticipated (and had not thought to look at the deck at her level of detail). She had not made any comments implying ill performance or called me out, but in her comments, she directly pointed out to me the details that I had missed out on and elaborated. There were quite a lot of them, and they were quite long. When I received the deck, I just felt very bad that I had not been able to spot these problems before raising them up to her, as comments to this level of detail is actually below her level. She’s a very good and fair boss and I had always wanted to live up to the expectations of being a newbie who was able to take on challenges and perform well in new environments. 

Looking at her multiple comments…I just feel like I had not lived up to expectations and was disappointing. I know it’s only one deck of work, but couldn’t help feel this way. She didn’t reach out to me separately and say anything, so I don’t find it necessary to reach out to her and speak about this or make this a bigger issue. But just feels terrible, especially when I’m so new to the team and wanting to make a good impression. 

Anyone have any objective thoughts or perspectives to lend me? Seeking some objectivity and actionable advice before I dive back into the workday… much appreciated from anyone!

It was then that I noticed they had clocked me in for days I didn’t work. So technically on the system I was paid for the days I did work, but I know I did not work those days. I don’t know what went wrong or how I did get clocked in, because you either clock yourself in and out or a manager will do it for you. 

My friends told me to keep it but I don’t want to get fired, on the other hand I don’t want to be the mug who tells them when they might not have noticed otherwise. 

Should I just keep it to the side in case they do ask for it back, and then if they don’t that’ll be free money lol, or do I just tell them?

1h1vywr,Need more clarity,"After almost 2 years of healing I finally feel refresh enough to be back at working full time again.

I had 2 years break from my last work and it crushed me hard. I really didn't like that I wasnt seen as a person nor couldnt I treat someone as a person, it is as hierarchical as in forbidden city.

I was fighting internally to accept this is how it is and i hated that I became the person I didn't like. I had a hard time moving forward in the past but this job actually helped me to see where to look at in a company that I need to avoid.

I started looking for jobs a year ago and rejected a few offers due to various reasons, income, culture, the vibe, package etc.However, now I see through it more clearly that it is OK to choose a career less paid to be happier.

Those were my own decision, along with other rejections i started losing confidence due to not having a job yet.

I understood 2 years break doesn't look nice on my CV but I am thankful i got the time to work on myself.

1h1viwf,Is it appropriate to reach out to a company after withdrawing from a job application?,"I recently interviewed with a company for a content position. Back then they indicated the position as being open to freelance/part-time work (I was hoping to land a role in this capacity).

However, during the interview their requirements had changed, and they told me they needed a full-timer. I withdrew my application, but I came to regret my decision shortly after this, because I thought the team was really interesting.

As a freelancer, would it be appropriate for me to pitch in a content proposal or ideas for freelance work several months from now? I am aware they've hired a full-timer to fill the role, but during the interview they mentioned that they intend to keep their core team small, and were open to working with external vendors. They seemed like a fast-moving team, so it may be likely their needs might change in the future.

I am hesitant to pitch, because I do not know if the company would view this negatively. (i.e. they might think that this overlaps with the role/ responsibilities of their full-time content staff.)

I would love to have feedback generally, and also from the perspective of someone who's hiring. ",Exact-Candidate7485,1,1.0,2,1732799106,2024-11-28 13:05:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h1viwf/is_it_appropriate_to_reach_out_to_a_company_after/,11,2024

Sono una giovane laureata in CTF con abilitazione a farmacista. Da un paio di mesi lavoro in una farmacia nel Lazio (zona aeroporto). Stipendio abbastanza alto (~2100 euro), orario spezzato e un giorno di riposo a settimana. Il problema? Tutto. Pago quasi mille euro di appartamento (a nero!) che mi hanno trovato i datori per facilitarmi il trasloco essendo fuori regione e senza macchina; tuttavia il benefit dell'alloggio (€500) me lo fanno figurare in busta paga, su cui vado a pagare tantissime tasse. Gli orari di lavoro me li cambiano giorno per giorno, i datori non mi possono sopportare in quanto volevano farmi un contratto da 30 ore e io mi sono imposta sulle 40 e questo a loro non va giù-me lo rinfacciano spesso che ""guadagno"" più delle mie colleghe decisamente più brave. I flussi della farmacia sono estremamente alti, la richiesta di prestazione è elevatissima e a me sta iniziando a pesare tutto. Non ho amici, la mia famiglia è lontana, non vedo il motivo di continuare a stare qui, la mattina mi sveglio e mi viene da piangere per aver accettato questo lavoro e aver rifiutato tante altre proposte migliori (esempio? 3 giorni prima che venissimo mi avevano chiamato da un'industria farmaceutica sita a Bari, nella mia regione). Mi pento ogni singolo giorno e l'idea di rimanere qui altri 4 mesi mi mette l'angoscia....

At my old job we had a group chat to ask for help with job problems (cash resister, lost items, fixing things) but here it's all on the app that I didn't get  the username and password until last weekend but I use the website because I don't want to pay for a app with less than 3.5 stars even if it's under $8 (what i make an hour so less than an hours work worth). From my last job I picked up a habit of screenshotting the schedule and sending it to my parent (I don't have a car/permit/license) and as the days pass I cross it off in one color and the days I don't work I make a different one. 4 hours after I took the pitcure ( less than an hour before my next shift there) and sent the pitcure to my dad my boss changed to me working on a day I wasn't scheduled but I never checked the website after the picture assuming that if there was changes it would come to an email because my boss has my number and email so thought it was hooked to one of them. It wasn't fulky. I looked at the website to see if they have next week's schedule and I realized an hour before my shift ended I was suppose to be there. I had no email no text or verbal telling that this happened and the only way I found out it wasn't a glitch was me asking my friend his opinion on it and he said it is in a corner you have to press a button in the corner and go to messages and then I also had been told in a separate message from my boss saying she sent a confirmation email and I didn't know I had to confirm it because usually emails for confirmation it say ""to confirm"" or ""for confirmation"" but it said confirmED so I assumed it was saying it was confirm*ed* not needing me to actually confirm. And I also didn't know we could actually communicate on the app and just told that it was our schedule so I thought we'd switch and cover for people verbally or the manager would ask for them because of us not having eachothers numbers besides managers. Also my dad said when he worked in fast food they'd do it in verbally and write on the physical copy the people had to put initials so I assumed it was the same because of the same burger place just less ten years apart and in towns right next to eachother.

1h1ogwp,Thoughts on Working with An Ex Friend? ,"
Hi everyone! Wanted to get some advice about working with an ex friend. 

I’m in a very niche field, with only about 3-4 companies offering jobs in my city for my position. 

Unfortunately my current company isn’t doing so well, and isn’t really paying me what I’m worth, especially compared to the other companies. There’s a lot of nepotism (not really in my favour), and I’ve been told that there’s not really any room for me to move up and there’s not really a concrete answer for any career progression or development, even though I’ve been pretty clear about what my goals are. 

There’s an opportunity available within a company, but my ex-friend works there. We didn’t really leave on a great note, because I felt undervalued in the friendship and she was messing around with my other friends romantically, leaving them hurt. I eventually told her how I felt and cut contact. My life drastically improved and was less stressful without her. We wouldn’t be on the same team, but I’d probably have to see her around the company, and at socials. This company is doing well and would offer a higher salary and potentially more career progression opportunities since they’re more well funded. 

Has anyone dealt with a situation where they had to work with an ex friend like this? Did it work out for you, or not work out for you?

1h1oezt,"Relocated for a Job, but the Role Is Completely Different Than Expected—What Should I Do?","Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice because my current job feels completely misaligned with my skills and expectations, and it’s really starting to affect my mental health. I recently relocated for a communications role at an Ivy League institution, expecting to focus on storytelling, writing, and strategy. Instead, I’ve found myself doing work that feels more like a producer role, which isn’t what I signed up for or enjoy.

Here’s the situation: I’m one of only two hybrid employees on my team—everyone else, including my manager, is fully remote. The only other hybrid team member is supposed to be a videographer/photographer, but he barely works, and the quality of his output is so poor that we’ve had to hire an external videographer to handle anything important. My manager has told me directly that there’s no way to fire him due to institutional policies. Instead, she’s asked me to “engage him on non-technical tasks without deadlines,” which is as useless as it sounds.

A big chunk of my role now involves managing a monthly video series, and I feel like I’ve been pushed into the role of a producer rather than a communications professional. I’m responsible for:

* Identifying subject matter experts to interview.
* Scheduling the interviews and booking locations.
* Coordinating with the external videographer (since the in-house one is unreliable).
* Editing the videos myself.
* Creating animations and voiceovers for the videos.

The problem is, I’m not a video editor or animator, nor do I want to be. I expected this role to focus on communications, not technical production. I’ve tried to make this clear, but the workload hasn’t changed. To make things worse, my salary is low for the high-cost area I moved to, and the stress of all these responsibilities is starting to take a serious toll on my mental health.

I’m feeling stuck and unsure if this is just how the communications field operates or if I’m in a uniquely bad situation. Is it normal for communications roles to include so much video production work? Has anyone else been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you handle it? Should I stick it out or start looking for a new role?

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!",Several_Pudding_3797,1,1.0,1,1732770230,2024-11-28 05:03:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h1oezt/relocated_for_a_job_but_the_role_is_completely/,11,2024
1h1nin4,"Is veterinary medicine worth it, or should i just go to human medicine?","This is a post that i didn't want to do but i found necessary. Recently i got accepted in med school, but after finding and researching more about it, i found out that it wasn't my biggest passion. My parents are doctors, so they celebrated and even gave me a cake when i entered, however, this all made me just cry, and finally rejected the vacant as i found that i had a big passion over veterinary medicine.

When i said this to my parents, they started yelling at me that i will not reach anything at life and started every day insisting and trying to convince me to enter med school. But everytime they did that, my passion for medicine decreased more than before. On the other hand, vet school was passioning me alot and even tho i hadn't the support of my parents, i entered vet school too!

Now here is the part that is giving me the worst of anxietys, THE SALARIES AND WORK BALANCE. I have seen more than 30 videos of vets talking about their salaries in comparison of doctors, and the more i hear about it, the more anxious i get. I really love animals and i wish to help them, but i want to gain a great salary too, worth of a DOCTOR, as i basically get to study the same things and even more difficult than doctors, just to get so much less salaries than them, and this makes me sad, as i rejected the med school, but i don't want to go right now still. Obviously my parents did not even celebrated a single bit when i told them i entered vet school, so thanks to them i hate med school right now.

They are always telling me that they raised me to gain more money than them, not less, so i want to do this, but i will need to work so much harder to get this and even like this, it is not sure that i will be able to make it (my parents also told me that they are not willing to pay as much as they are willing to do for med school than for vet school btw). So what makes me anxious is that i have a much easier path as i can still ask to readquire that med school vacant as an option that the university gave me and i think ill possibly regain my passion for it as it is only because im mad at my parents.

But what do you guys think? what should i do to get a decision on this?",Historical_Run_2167,0,0.5,2,1732767045,2024-11-28 04:10:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h1nin4/is_veterinary_medicine_worth_it_or_should_i_just/,11,2024
1h1nawj,deciding if mechanical engineering major is right for me,"hello, I am currently an engineering technology major and considering switching to mechanical engineering. 

I started looking at salary outlook for engineering technology major and you do not pass 50k a year typically, so I figured I might as well go all the way with something versatile like mechanical that would be worth the time and energy. 

the reason I chose engineering technologies was because I can minor in something like communications which is really where I excell at since I have always loved writing and I am very good with people and presenting ideas. but as I started researching the et major, I thought it was gonna be a bad idea because I would have two degree types that have low rates of employment instead of just going all out on one.

I have always thought that a PR manager or a creative director would be a cool job since I think I would like to manage a group of people. but unfortunately communications major has high rates of unemployment and my thought process is ""you can turn an engineer into a business person but you cannot turn a business person into an engineer"".

the job market is fucked right now and I'm kinda looking into stability and knowing that I wouldn't be in jobless when I graduate. but I just don't know if it's right for me.

when I look at jobs in engineering, the opportunity of perhaps being a product manager would be cool but I am not sure if it is the right thing for me. but I am afraid of majoring in communications because of the high rates of unemployment and I thought maybe I could switch careers later in my life , but I am not so sure how easy that would be with something as specialized as mechanical engineering.

I really just need outside perspectives since I am going into my second semester as a sophomore and I feel my time is running out. I really just don't want to be in poverty and I want to enjoy my job.

1h1lfwi,Is it better to leave a role early on or stay at least a year even if you know you're still going to leave?,"I'm coming up to 3 months at a role I recently started. When I was interviewed and asked what I was looking for, I was honest and clear about (2) things: Work Life Balance and a Predominantly WFH set up.

The person who brought me in said that the work-life balance is possible as long as I am able to manage my time and workload well. I had no issue with this because I know how I work. I usually start an hour early to make sure all tasks are accomplished and finish my workday on time. On the second point, they said that since I would directly be reporting under them, twice a week was workable cause they trusted me. I considered all the factors, most especially that I trusted the person bringing me in and looked forward to a mentorship under them.

Fast forward to my almost 3 months with the company, I have been presented (3) different org structures regarding my placement. It is different each time. The latest development has shown that I will be doing (2) roles than what was originally discussed to me, no longer directly reporting to the person who convince me to join the team, and in the next week they'd be implementing a 3-day work week already. Not to mention, I only found out when I already signed with the company that overtime can only be off-set and that is only if you work on Sundays. Saturday work cannot be offset.

This is the second time that this has happened to me where what was discussed to me during the hiring process was not the whole picture. And once I signed on, that's when all these developments started being put in place.

At this point, I already know that this is not the end-all for me and I will leave at some point.

1h1jbwe,Career Change from corporate to nursing,"Career Change from a corporate to nursing

Living in NS, Canada. 34F, 2 kids (5 and 14). 

I'm aware of the long shifts, lots of walking and lifting. Probably i'm not getting all the experience I should expect.

What is the hardest part of being a nurse in Canada? Are there any other expectations?

Currently working in project management, and I make 69k annually. I'm thinking of changing my career for the following reasons:

Slowly losing interest in the PM field and in an office setting workspace. I work in the defense industry. 9-5 M-F schedule, with benefits and paid vacation. Only downside no union and my company is not a crown corporation so no government pension, etc.

Mentally draining with just sitting in front of the screen 9-5, by the time I get off, I get really tired after work to do physical work, etc. I gained weight just working in the office.

I've always been interested in nursing. Relatives are mostly in the medical field. My mom is a CCA, and I admire her when she takes care of her patients whenever I visit her at work.

I want to take care of people too, and I feel a sense of fulfillment by doing it. I'm more of a hands-on and physical job and had no issues with me. I used to work in a hotel as a room attendant for 2-3 yrs before going back to school. I felt healthier doing physical work.

NS is offering Accelerared LPN (18 months) with 0$ tuition as long as you work in the province after graduation for 2 years. I aim to be an RN, and bridging is another opportunity I'm looking into.

I have saving accounts like RRSP, which I can use for LLP if needed.

My partner works in construction and makes decent and very supportive of my thoughts on changing my career.

I know I won't get the same salary when I start in the workforce, but that could change after a few years of experience.

Is this a dramatic change? Is it too late for me to shift my career?

1h1ff09,Put On A PIP Now On FMLA,"I was put on a PIP and after two weeks in, I messed up again and knew I was going to get fired at the end of it. After that, I went on FMLA and applied for short term disability.

Ive been so distraught/anxiety ridden from this FMLA route I took rather than finding another job, being fired or just quitting. I wanted to keep my current companies benefits (which are amazing) to get the help I need and return once Im okay and have a new job lined up. To be clear, I am dealing with personal stuff as well but, this PIP issue has only made my mental health worse. 

I am young in my career and have an entry title position. Since Ive been here, this company has had a bunch of layoffs due to budgeting, being overworked and understaffed. My position is even a dual role to a team of 3.5 and then to a team 1.5. (me being the .5) My old boss from the 1.5 team, quit due to the stress they were under and said they needed more of team but, we didn’t have one. 


I know my move was smart but, as I mentioned, Im distraught as Im so worried about how I am being perceived by the company now. In addition, questioning myself on how am I going move forward with my career if my relationships are tainted due to the stigma of mental health. I know, for a fact, I’m already being shit talked as I heard stuff prior to my last day. In addition, Im embarrassed of the mistakes I made during my PIP and have no chance to redeem myself now.


How do I come back from this? What your best advice for someone in my position?

1h1ctbj,PSW struggling with patient but staying passionate ,"
Hey Reddit,

I’m a 23-year-old Personal Support Worker (PSW), and I’ll be starting nursing school in January. I’ve always loved my job and working with older people, but lately, it’s been emotionally draining.

A lot of my patients are rude to me, and it feels like they focus on my appearance—especially my weight. They make hurtful comments, call me ugly, and fat. it’s hard not to take it personally. One of my patients has severe behavioral issues—she’s violent, bites and hits me, and hurls nasty words at me.

I don’t want to stop working with older people because I genuinely care about them, and some of my patients are wonderful. But the negative experiences are starting to overshadow the good ones. I’m sad and exhausted, and I’m worried about burning out before I even start nursing school.

At the same time, I know I have a passion for what I’m doing, and I don’t want to lose that spark. I’m just struggling to deal with the way some patients treat me, especially since their comments about my size hit me on such a personal level.

For anyone who works in healthcare or caregiving: How do you manage when patients are rude or abusive? How do you stop yourself from burning out while still keeping your love for the work alive?

I really want to push through this and stay committed to my goals, but it’s hard to not feel defeated sometimes. Any advice or words of encouragement would mean so much to me right now.

Thank you for listening.

1h1af4h,Should I shift from BA to software developer?,"I recently graduated in June and I got an internship for 3 months (currently 3rd month is ongoing). The pay is $550 dollars per month. I stay in Qatar so for an intern to get that much it's a huge deal as here interns don't get any salary. Very few companies provide salaries to intern. 

I got hired as a a Junior Business Analyst intern and I got hints that they are planning to hire me full time as my Project Manager said she would be involving me into a large project.  She also trusted me enough to talk to a client for another project plus I am the only BA who is working with her for one more project. I am mostly testing and adding bugs to JIRA and following up with the developers. Sometimes I got the task to make user guides or update BRD. 

I originally planned to become a software developer upon graduation as I graduated with a information systems degree and I also like coding. I told my PM and also the HR that I have a passion in coding so I would like to shift to backend development field. The HR told me they will make me do the internship training again for the backend developer position if I get selected after the interview. Also the teams they have in the company are either .NET Developer, Laravel, or Drupal. Mobile app development is done from their branch in India and I can't go there. I have a passion for mobile app development but I'm not sure if they would let me work from here so for now my only options are .NET, Laravel or Drupal in which I have no experience nor passion in. 

My question is, do I stay in the BA field or do I take the risk and move to Laravel or Drupal as I'm definitely not interested in .NET. 

Also if I stay in BA field for let's say 6 months, can I shift to a software development field later on or will I be stuck in the BA field. Honestly I don't enjoy the work much but it's fine. My only worry is that when I get hired full time, I will get multiple projects to handle and a lot of workload including working overtime (from home as well after coming back from office?) sometimes when projects are nearing due date.

Like I said, I'm a fresh graduate with very little to none (and bad) experience of how actual corporates work. This is my second actual internship. The first one was very horrible with barely any work to do, plus it was unpaid.",scarletrose04,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1732730217,2024-11-27 17:56:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h1af4h/should_i_shift_from_ba_to_software_developer/,11,2024

1h18pjv,Is it just hesitation or am I not happy?,"Hello all, 

I don’t ever really post personal or career matters online but I am in a rut and need the internet to see if it can guide me or shed some light on my situation. 

I am 30 years old, I have always worked very hard and have climbed the ladder in my industry but recently I have had some serious doubts about my career choices. I went to school for what I do and have been doing this type of job for over 8 years, which has led me to a nice comfortable 9-5 M-F….so why am I not happy? 

I’ve always since I was a kid, looked up at the sky every time I heard a plane fly over, always been the geeky guy to know every plane, make, model, airline…you name it! When I was younger, I wanted to be a pilot but my dad told me I wasn’t smart enough so I gave up on the dream and carried on looking at what he called “a more attainable career”. 

Now at 30, I’m sitting here…years after listening to my dad’s advice, just simply not content with life. So it’s got me thinking…

Do I jump, do I give up everything and just enroll in flight school? Flight school can be extremely expensive and time consuming which financially will cause issues! What do I do? 

I’ve had a continued battle in my mind where one side is telling me to chase my true dreams and be happy, but the other side says just to be sensible and enjoy what you have and understand that you are comfortable! Are there any aviators out there that have advice? Are there anyone else that’s sitting at their desk wondering if this is all to life? 

Id love to start some discussion on this as I am sure I am not the only one that’s sitting at their desk right now wondering whether this is right? Does a complete career change at 30 benefit or damage future prospects?

It started with other coworkers just kind of taking advantage of my work ie. leaving early and expecting me to close for them, or telling bosses i had offered to cover. That quickly evolved into to one of the managers themselves who was in charge of the schedule to start taking advantage as well and consistently scheduling me for the hardest room (we have three, one is park, the big high energy pups, one is city, the small pups, and the last is beach which is the old dog and considered our break day because it closes 2 hours early).

1h17h3b,Need help thinking through a job offer,"
Hi there, looking for some advice on a new job offer which I just received.

For some background I graduated college about a year ago and have been working since then. I am currently in a IT rotational program where most of my focus will be in the analytics space (data science, data engineering, data viz). I am currently on rotation one and would have the opportunity for two more rotations after this. 

After being reached out to on LinkedIn about a new job, I decided to interview and just found out I got an offer. This new role is a data analyst role, with a large focus on data engineering (so probably a less wide variety of experience compared to my rotational program). This offer is at a company which is a similar size (probably a bit more recognizable) than my current one. During my interviews I did like the people I interviewed with, but was a bit concerned that I would not get as broad of work experience as I get currently. It sounds from my interviews that WLB would be the same, and both roles are hybrid with similar amount of time in office.

With this, I am unsure if I should take the offer. I am really enjoying my time in my current role, and like the company I work for. What makes it tough is that this new offer would have about a 35% higher salary than what I currently make with relatively similar benefits (5 less pto days which is a bummer). I make a decent amount of money currently, but the 35% jump is hard not to look at. I am trying to figure out which would be more beneficial for me in the long run, to stick out my current program at a company I like and get more breadth of experience while making less money, or to dive into a specific role at a new company while making more money.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

TLDR: received offer for new role with pay raise, enjoy my current role and company quite a bit, should I take the offer at new company for pay bump, or stick with what I know I like",LilTwangToIt,1,1.0,1,1732722823,2024-11-27 15:53:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h17h3b/need_help_thinking_through_a_job_offer/,11,2024
1h17994,Am I just a shadow worker?,"I've been working in my current role for less than a year. I was initially hired on a contract position with the possibility of becoming permanent and during this time, my senior has taught me a lot. She even acknowledges that I'm learning quickly and has entrusted me with high-level reports that feel beyond my current scope. I initially didn’t mind, as I saw it as a chance to prove myself.

However, I’ve recently noticed something that bothers me. When she sends emails or speaks in meetings, she presents the work as if she's the one doing everything. For instance, she’ll say things like, “Let me know so I can include it in the report,” without mentioning my name or even saying “we.” It makes me feel like I’m just working in the background while she takes credit.

One time, I solved an issue we were dealing with and I sat for 3 hours looking at the spreadsheet, but when she emailed the sales team about it, she said she was the one who found the error. It made me feel like I was just working in the background while she took all the credit.

Considering I’m hoping for a permanent position, this makes me unsure of how to address the situation. How can I approach this?

1h16sm5,My amazing Manager is leaving... what can I expect?,"So I've had this amazing manager at this corporate job I've had for a few years now and they are leaving. I want to start off by saying I'm incredibly happy for them and I'm incredibly encouraging of what they want to move on to.

On the flip side of things, this is the best manager I've ever had my entire career (not even kidding) so on the inside I'm actually crushed.

This person was passionate about the work and just an amazing human being and I can't help feel that my boat will be taking on some heavy waters in the coming weeks? months? - the fear of the unknown is sort of bothering me?

I guess I'm wondering, for those who have had a great leader/ manager/ mentor leave to do something else. What can I sort of expect here? Did it make you hate the job? Was it not as bad as you thought it was going to be?

Any sort of advice or experience here is appreciated.",BowlingBall_0912,13,0.8500000238418579,27,1732721044,2024-11-27 15:24:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h16sm5/my_amazing_manager_is_leaving_what_can_i_expect/,11,2024
1h16k9x,Should I just quit or continue for the pay ,"I am a chartered accountant in an audit job and earn quite well. My husband and I had a home loan but it’s almost 99 percent paid off now and no other debts or dependents. My husband earns really well too. I got a really bad performance feedback last year in 2023 which left me wanting to change my job or teams because I felt like my manager did not have my back. He basically told me that he can’t promote me that year(2023) or the year next (2024). I had a follow up conversation with my manager and kind of told him that I wanted to apply to other open roles within the company and externally which was ok by him. 
My manager changed after that because of a re- organisation and I report into someone else( who reports into my previous manager so my earlier manager is now my skip level boss) . For full disclosure I told my new manager about my wish to change roles/ teams too since I don’t want to catch her off guard if she got a system notification when I apply for an internal job posting. 

Through 2024 I kept applying for other jobs internally and externally but due to the current market situation was not able to land anything. There are no relevant next level positions internally too , however I still applied for at least 2 with transferable skill set but did not work.  I did well in my current year projects but nothing extreme and neither was I given any stretch opportunities for next level . I’m dreading that I’m going to start next year on this note , am constantly procrastinating my year end discussions and feel like a loser continuing in this role . My manager has suggested that I try going next level next year and be more focused. I constantly feel like I should quit and just take a break but don’t know how long I would be without a job. Since I’ve always had a job since my early adulthood it would take some time to getting used to. Not sure of how to handle the situation and it’s constantly stressing me. The pay is good and makes me think twice if this is a good decision ( also quoting now will mean I will lose my gratuity by about 5  months ). I feel that since I’m stuck in this situation for almost a year now , the feeling of loss is kind of creeping into other  areas of my life and I don’t enjoy doing what I previously would. Sorry for the long post but I think I needed to get his off my chest.

1h12so8,"Is it normal thing that in new job, they are constantly remind you that they have a 6 months probation time policy, and ""They are not afraid to use it""?","I am genuinely interested to know by your experience, since most jobs in the world have such policies of 3 - 6 - 12 month probation policy.

The standard policy is that on the introductory week, someone in HR tells us this, and that we need to set a goal, discuss it with the manager, document it, and we will have a 3, 6 months to achieve the goal and that will mostly get our probation approved.

Till there is ok for me,

I have had jobs (at industry) where happened exactly this, technical manager settled a feasible task to test me, and I worked my ass off to achieve it, and the more I come closer to the finishing the task the more assured I was about going forward on the 3 years-long contract, etc. 

Although managers might scold me for some rookie mistake, or for disagreeing to overwork time, they NEVER EVER mentioned the probation time as a control tool. 

I even had a hot discussion with my direct supervisor because he gave me a defective device to develop the probation task. He kind of mock at me, and gave me a new proper device, but again NEVER brought up the 6 months probation policy. I finished my task, documented it, and we were cool the rest of the time at the company.

  
Now, I am working in Academy, I have resigned 2 consecutive jobs, both teaching-research based, where I find upper faculty (the equivalent to the managers) to be so weird for me, specially because they are constantly bringing up that they have a 6 months probation time, and 'are not afraid to use it'. 

Commentaries on the FIRST week at the jobs, from the Dean and Elder prof.

\- If I don't see good 'Synergy' between us, you might need to find another job. I just don't see your point, why should I hire you instead of hiring a student.

\- You have to remember you are in probation time, you need to show your value, what do you have to contribute to us.

\- I am not seeing in you what is necessary to pass the probation, I do not know what it is, but as the things are going now, you might not pass the probation time.

\- I really want to help you, I really do, I know you are a hard-working type but its just not enough to work hard, you need to demonstrate to me you are worth it.

Add a threatening - condescending tone to the sentences, not like 'I really want to help you, and we need your help with this, lets do this shit together' type of tone that I lived at Industry.

To these last managers, I was like: DUDE, is literally my first week at the job, we have not even discussed the goals for the probation time. What the Freak means 'Synergy'. What are you doing?

In the first job, Dean ended up failing my probation, and at the second job, seeing how things were going, I resigned after 2 month to the PI.

So, I want to know whether this is something NORMAL, this is how it suppose to happen and I just had luck at my first jobs. 

Do your managers play this '6 months probation time' game to incentivize you to do show the best of you, or to filter weak natures, and those who are the bests will endure the stress and constant threat of failure? is that what is known as the Rat Race? Like literally is not about your technical prowess anymore. is more about self-confidence, Elam Vital, Will to succeed, etc.",Particular_Mix_7706,0,0.5,7,1732709217,2024-11-27 12:06:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h12so8/is_it_normal_thing_that_in_new_job_they_are/,11,2024
1h12din,Trapped in a golden cage,"From the outside, I have what many might call a perfect life: a great job, a good salary, and a family I love deeply, and who loves me back. We live in a place we adore, and my job allows me to work remotely, which makes life outside of work pretty great.

But beneath the surface, I’m struggling. My job is draining me. I hate the work itself, and I’m constantly teetering on the edge of burnout. The remote setup, while a blessing for my personal life, makes the isolation of my professional life even worse.

The real catch is that I can’t just leave. My job is what provides the comfort and stability that my family deserves. If I were to change jobs, I’d likely have to take a pay cut of more than 50%, and who knows how long it might take to even find something else.

On top of that, my job has me living in a constant state of anxiety. There are frequent layoffs, re-hiring processes, and uncertainty about my future at the company. I feel like I’m always on edge, never knowing if today might be my last day here. It’s hard to settle down and plan for the future when I’m constantly worried about losing everything. I can’t even imagine buying a house because I’m never sure if I’ll still be living in this town, or even this country, tomorrow.

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just needed to vent. I guess I’m hoping someone out there might understand what it’s like to feel stuck in a life that’s objectively great but subjectively crushing.

I can’t even share this with my closest friends because I know they wouldn’t understand. They have more humble jobs and look up to me, thinking I earn a lot of money and have it all together. I feel like if I complained to them about struggling with stress or uncertainty, they’d see it as me complaining about problems they can’t relate to, like struggling with limited resources.

What can I do to secure a more comfortable future? What can money actually buy that helps ensure stability? I’ve considered starting an eMBA, but I’m not sure if it would truly help me pivot. I’m also worried about how my employer might perceive it, if they’d think I’m looking to leave if I pursue a part-time MBA.

1h0zdx2,Biology degree career advice,"I have currently found myself in a bit of a predicament career-wise and I am unsure what to do. 

I am 2 weeks away from graduating college. I will be receiving a bachelors degree in general biology. I have been working in multiple labs throughout the past year (currently working in 2 labs this semester). 

Initially, I had this drive to pursue a career in research. My dream was to be some national geographic biologist, paid to explore the beauty of our natural world. I was naive and had a very surface-level understanding of research jobs. 

When I realized this path was unrealistic, I stuck with my major. I changed my goals to genetics as I saw the potential of gene-editing technologies and I wanted to be involved in genetically modified agriculture, animals, and diseases. My new dream was to use CRISPR across multiple fields and solve problems with genetic engineering. But again, I was naive and I did know that it was not that simple. I would need higher degrees and I would likely only be using gene editing technology in a much more narrow scope.

By the time I realized this, I was in my final semester of college. I do not want to pursue higher degrees (for at least a few years). Im done with schooling and I want to work, but I feel vulnerable as the job market for bachelors bio jobs is not great, nor is the pay.

I have a job lined up for a full time lab tech position at my college. It pays better than both my other labs, but thats not saying very much. My dreams got me this far, but I became disillusioned. I have now made my bed, and I will lay in it.

So, I turn to reddit. What should I do? I will be working at this lab for at least the next 6 months or so. I no longer feel that it is feasible to explore the world with my degree, so I no longer have dreams that I am chasing. Perhaps I am just bitter, but all I want to do now is follow the money. Do I take my skills and pivot? Do I pursue careers like x-ray tech, radiology, etc? Do I suck it up and go back to school earlier than I would like?

The hourly rate was $18-$24, and he was asking how much I was looking to get for the role. I saw the email as I was on my way home and, of course, was eager to email him back. As soon as I had parked, I sent him an email saying that I was hoping for $23-$24 given my prior experience, and he immediately emailed back saying that he would send an offer of $23/hr to HR, though they wouldn’t send me the official offer letter until next Monday due go the holiday. 

So it’s been a few hours later, and I’ve been reflecting, and now I’m thinking I should’ve just asked for $24. The only reason I didn’t before was because the position I’m being offered includes timecards/billing, which is something I technically haven’t done before, but I still feel that my experience as an admin in all types of different industries, and the ability I have to learn new softwares and implement them quickly, makes me confident I can perform in my new role well. 

It’s $1 difference, but that adds up…so I just sent him an email (I hadn’t responded yet to his email about the $23/hr he was planning on sending through) and countered, asking for the $24, and basically explaining my market value. I made sure to say that I was open to further discussion, and to thank him again for the opportunity. So now I’m just hoping this isn’t a faux paux or that he would rescind, since I haven’t been sent the official offer yet.",Time-Concentrate845,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1732694192,2024-11-27 07:56:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0zahr/countered_an_offer_again_after_manager_sent_me_an/,11,2024
1h0yy7m,I have a call with my boss tomorrow and I’m not sure how to ask for a raise,"I work as a Social media manager and content creator for a small startup. I started off doing it for $500/month because I needed money. I even exaggerated my credentials but was confident in my work. I ended up doing such a good job growing the page, but I dropped my effort since it wasn’t enough pay. My boss noticed and started to pay me $35 per Instagram reel for 6-8 posts a week. 

Now he bumped it to $60 per video filmed OUTSIDE my ‘bedroom’. The problem is I don’t see why the videos I film indoors should be $35 still since they still require effort and sometimes do perform well thus leading to product leads. 

The main problem is I feel undervalued for my industry. Freelance social media mangers typically have retainer fees of 1000-2k/ month and I don’t even make $1000/ mo yet. I realized I could just start filming every video outside my home And earn $1440/ mo ( 6 videos x $60), but there’s a logistics issue. 

For each video I film, I need someone to record and move angles — something a tripod can’t do. People are busy and I don’t get to film until my friend gets out of class or my sister gets home from work. By this time it’s usually nighttime and I have nowhere else to film besides my friend’s bedroom— My bedroom is not as aesthetically pleasing. Sometimes I film at the bar but I can only do it so much. On top of that, I pay my friend $10 per video to record. 

My boss gets onto me about consistently hitting 6-8 videos per week (i do the minimum of 6) and is asking me to start batch recording videos — which is something I’m working on during the holidays. 

I noticed my boss started hiring influencers in India to promote our product. They paid one guy $80 for 1 video. I did 2 videos recently in my friend’s room and it performed similar, if not better than the influencers yet I got paid $35 for each. This makes me feel undervalued. I would’ve been happy with $60 for each. 

My boss wants to call me tomorrow to check in and possibly have me on board “full-time” in January. I’m not sure how full time differs from my current structure. While I enjoy the work I do in a sense, it’s the fact that I’m not earning a monthly salary I’m satisfied with. I was thinking of mentioning this during our call, but I’m not sure how they’ll react. Make no mistake, I am very thankful for this gig, it’s just that it doesn’t support my expenses anymore. 

I was thinking to ask my boss if they can increase my indoor videos to around $45 and provide a monthly bonus at a rate of $0.05 per link tap (I got 10k clicks last month). My boss is somewhat reasonable and laid back but I feel I’ve proved my worth. 

I don’t have any other jobs right now so I don’t want to lose my job. Although, I do so good i feel it would be more work to find someone else.

Can anyone offer advice on how to approach this situation?

1h0ytzn,90 days into a new role and feeling low morale among peers,"I left a high paying role after years at a large company 6 months ago to relocate abroad for my family. I knew I was going to take a pay cut and that I wouldn't have the same earning ability or career growth, but in this season of my life, I wanted to prioritize being a mother and balancing my career as I was at the point of burnout with health issues in my previous role (even though on the surface I was thriving) My husband and I wanted to put our family first, without having me leave the workforce entirely.  
  
I interviewed with a startup for a role that I was clearly overqualified for, but at the time when we discussed the scope of the role with the recruiter and hiring manager, the org was flat with 20 IC's. Everyone reported into the head of the department, with no middle managers. I decided this would be a good fit for me to continue to keep my skills sharp and relevant and take on less responsibility, doing what I already knew I could do while my kids were young (my youngest was 6 months old at the time). I didn't mind the more junior title and less pay given the role they described in the job description. I also didn't have much leverage during the negotiation as the salary I asked for was out of their budget, and they told me that that would be a director salary band and they did not have any directors at the company. The recruiter pressured me to make a decision within 3 days as they said they would extend the offer to another candidate if I declined, so I accepted it since I was genuinely interested in the product and appreciated the flexibility to work remote and set my own hours (which is invaluable for me when juggling 3 kids schedules). We ended up settling for a lower salary and I expected less workload and more time with my family. On my first day, the COO introduced himself to me and told me he was so happy I joined the company and that given my experience and pedigree, the hiring manager had told him he should ""give her anything she wants"" to hire me. I was surprised and slightly irked by this comment since I did not think their offer was competitive at all and they had pushed back on my negotiation.  
  
In the time between accepting my offer and my start date, there was a reorg and several senior level IC's including myself were asked to become ""hybrid leads"" to manage a team of IC's while still doing some IC work, focusing on strategy. At my last company, this would have been a director. There was no salary adjustment or title change for any of the hybrid leads. I joined the company and became a people manager. We recently had our performance reviews (which I was not a part of as a new hire) and from talking to other hybrid leads, it seems that across the board, people feel bamboozled into taking on more responsibility without promotion.  
  
I wasn't salty about any of this before, even accepting the offer as is, but as I'm taking on more responsibility 3-4 months in, I'm seeing the scope of the role more clearly, and the company is definitely getting a lot out of the hybrid leads without any acknowledgement. Others have mentioned to me they are bitter, and privately we are discussing what we can do collectively to raise this issue to our manager. We have an ongoing conversation among the hybrid leads about the issues of this role. Internally, we haven't gained the support from our reports and cross functional partners, since there was no title change or announcement that a select few of us would be taking on people management responsibilities, and externally, it doesn't seem like we've had any career growth either despite everyone feeling they've taken on 3x the workload since become a hybrid lead. Some have said they are going to propose stepping back from the hybrid role and returning to the IC track given there is no difference in compensation and title.  
  
I was really excited about this job, I was prepared to lower my expectations for pay and growth at a startup, but the low morale among my peers and the way things have played out have become a distraction to me. I'm not sure how to manage my mindset and how to overcome the feeling of a bait and switch.

1h0ylhu,"Thinking of declining a job offer after being unemployed for over a year. Are these red flags, or am I just acting too entitled?","I am married and in my early 40s with \~$1.2M net worth and no major financial overhead (we rent our place, don't have/want kids, and don't spend a ton). My wife and I can realistically continue living comfortably for a while before things get really desperate. Nevertheless, I am beginning to feel very anxious -- like I NEED to get back to earning a paycheck soon. I should note that I have struggled to manage my anxiety (in general) for a long time, even when I was well compensated at my last job.   

I began looking for a new job \~8 months ago, and despite landing many interviews, I believe my anxiety got in the way of converting interviews into job offers. Now that I finally have a job offer, I am doubting whether to accept it. The pay would be decent (at best), but I think there's a good chance the job could make me miserable.

Are these red flags or am I just acting too entitled???

1. The role is based in the United States, but the company is a WITCH company (Wipro, Infosys, Tata, Cognizant, HCL). These are well-known companies that operate \~75% of their staff in India. I have heard mixed-reviews about work-life balance and treatment of employees.

2. The role is WFH, but I'm worried about work/life balance. The hiring manager says he typically starts the day \~6:30am and works until 5-6pm. I've very rarely taken video calls before 9am...am I being unrealistic to ask whether I could start at 9am? Would it be crazy to turn down a job offer just because I'm not a ""morning person""? I'm worried I will burnout.   

3. I initially interviewed for an entirely different role. The role they are offering me now seems like a lot more work. I'm really skeptical about this ""bait & switch"" move...

4. Half-way through the recruitment process, my recruiter ""left"" the company and I was assigned a different recruiter.

I'm worried that if I do not accept this offer (\~$200K salary, low/no bonus, no equity), I might not see another offer for a long time. Is it naive to expect to find a good-paying WFH job in this market that doesn't have some kind of ""catch""?

The new job sounds pretty promising, though. It comes with a 30% salary increase, the chance to work with an offshore team, and I’m hoping there will be more opportunities to learn and grow. The thing that’s making me hesitant is that taking the new role would basically mean starting over in an entry-level position.

I have an academic faculty job that I’ve been in for 3.5 years. It’s a professional program that is accredited, this year we’re up for our accreditation review. For a variety of reasons I am looking for a new job and I think I am about to be offered one. 

The main thing I do like about my current job is my coworkers and I’m feeling really guilty about leaving them in the middle of the school year. Luckily it looks like I’ll be able to stay to the end of the semester (since it’s almost over) but my department chair will have to find people to cover my courses next semester.

 I’m feeling mega guilty knowing there is a good chance she’ll have to find someone to cover my classes too. All this when we’re about to have our accreditation visit makes me worried the program will not get reaccredited and then the program and all the students will be in a really tough spot.

A few weeks back, I was handed a mutual separation agreement, which came as a shock.

Sunday was my first day, I get to the store, am handed my shirt to put on, and head back to the meat department. The person there was not who I was told would be training me. He tells me that he's left a lot of work for me to do, so I can get used to the process. I tell him that's fine, but that I'd be a little slow getting used to everything.

Less than two hours later and I'm being yelled at because there's still too much work to do, and I'm not moving fast enough. He kicks me out of the department a few minutes later, which has me going to sit in the corner like a child because there's no designated break room that I was informed of. I end up crying a bit, but manage to get it back under control and head back to try and help with the rest of the workload.

I only get yelled at -again- for not properly stacking ground beef in the display, and then again when he assumes I put old product in the back, and misplaced where I had put it... Which was up front, as it should be done.

At the end of the day, he tries to act apologetic, insisting that he didn't mean to ""be a dick"", suddenly concerned that I'm acting like I would rather be anywhere else. And frankly, that's the truth. I never want to put that shirt on again, I don't want to set foot near the meat department. The dude knew I was coming in to train, shoveled a workload on my shoulders that I couldn't handle, and then got pissed at me for his mistakes. On top of that, he left early, leaving me to work out how to restock the freezers on my own, and with no guidance, after yelling at me for most of the day for being too slow.

To clarify a little, he never used abusive language. But the way he spoke to me was very passive-aggressive, and it just left me feeling put off. ""Come on, man, do I really have to show you again?"", and so on. It got worse towards the end of the day, during cleanup, when he repeatedly 'accidentally' sprayed me down with the cleaning water after ridiculing me for not standing closer.

I'm supposed to go in later this week to work regular store stocking, and then go back to the meat department the day after. But I've been suffering a constant migraine since I started crying on Sunday, and every time I think about having to go back in, it gets worse.

For the last 4.5 years, I have been working for a market leader in the SaaS industry and have been incredibly successful. I am in a strategic sales roles and have received several raises and RSU increases during my tenure and it's safe to say, I am in a really good spot here. However, this past year has been difficult and our company has faced significant challenges outside of my control or my direct leadership's control. My boss left to a competitor and our business in general started to get stale and we also experienced our first RIF due to our stock dropping significantly. 

Due to this, I started looking for roles outside of the company. I actually received a job offer a couple months ago at a large competitor of ours. It was a good offer but I decided to turn it down because my company countered me, not with comp, but better accounts to sell into. 

Flash forward to now, my old boss had an opening on her team and I have now received another job offer. This time it is from a household name in the tech industry and they have recently launched their own product to enter into the specific industry I am currently in. They are developing and hiring like crazy to make this successful. They offered me a significant raise in OTE (on target earnings, base salary + commission) along with a great RSU package. I was pretty certain I would be stupid to turn this down and that there was no way my current company would be able to counter me.

I told my direct leadership today about the offer and now they are working on trying to match the offer at least from an OTE perspective (I don't think they can come close to the RSU amount). The question is, if they can come close to my other offer, do I stay and hope my company can turn it around and continue to develop to stay ahead of the increasing competition entering the space? Or do I jump ship and take the other offer? What would you do?",FlakesTwo,1,1.0,2,1732677461,2024-11-27 03:17:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0uqgw/saas_company_job_offer/,11,2024
1h0um2c,Seeking career advice: Transitioning from retail and unsure about going back to school at 30,"I'm about to turn 30 and have been working in retail for the past 5 years. Recently, I've been feeling like it's time to move on to something new, but I'm not sure where to start. My background is in retail , and while I’ve gained a lot of experience in customer service, leadership, and problem-solving, I’m feeling like I don't have enough technical or specialized experience to switch to another field.

I was previously working on an associate degree in Engineering Science with the goal of becoming a Civil Engineer. However, I’ve been feeling uncertain about continuing that path due to time constraints and my age. I’m not sure if I have the time or energy for a 4+ year degree anymore.

With that in mind, I’d love to hear your thoughts on:

* Career options that don’t require 4+ years of schooling but still offer good growth potential and stability.
* How to break into a new field with a background like mine (retail, some college experience).

I’d really appreciate any insights or advice you can share. Thanks!",Existing-Response355,3,1.0,2,1732677063,2024-11-27 03:11:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0um2c/seeking_career_advice_transitioning_from_retail/,11,2024
1h0u9f1,Can Reading Fiction Help Improve Your Leadership Skills?,"I’ve read many books on leadership over the years, but the more I read, the more I realized that many of the concepts were shallow, often revolving around common sense ideas. Eventually, I stopped reading them.

As I continued to reflect on ways to develop my leadership skills, I explored different avenues. One option that stood out to me was reading more fiction. 

At first, I scoffed at the idea because I thought there was no correlation between the two. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense.

Strong leadership requires excellent communication and interpersonal skills. I believe reading fiction can help enhance these areas in the following ways:

* It encourages you to be more descriptive, which is crucial when conveying ideas clearly and effectively.
* It enhances empathy by allowing you to connect with characters from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, fostering a deeper understanding of others.
* It enhances your EQ. Many works of fiction delve into characters' inner struggles, helping you better understand human emotions and motivations. This awareness is key to building strong, trusting relationships with your team members.

What are your thoughts?",proudmelon,1,1.0,1,1732675947,2024-11-27 02:52:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0u9f1/can_reading_fiction_help_improve_your_leadership/,11,2024
1h0tvni,21 and lost ,"Hey I’m 21, I’m in my last semester finishing off my undergrad and then I’m picking up my MBA so by 22 I will have my MBA and my undergraduate degree in marketing. With this last semester I am done credit wise and am going to begin my masters program, yet my passions lie elsewhere, the knowledge and connections I have made taking this path has allowed me to start my own firm which does pay the bills yet my true passion lays in finance. My question is how unnecessary/dumb would it be to grind out a minor or maybe even a major in finance in this semester along with winter/summer classes, I already have 75% of the classes done since it falls in the same school I currently am in. I know finance is cutthroat and you need lots of experience through internships and so on so I just don’t know if it would be worth it. In the end i guess looking back it was a poor choice to choose marketing at the time but I was young, dumb and lazy. I’ve woken up and want a challenge….

1h0tuhg,When do you stop chasing a dream career?,"So I wanted to come here and get some practical and logical advice here from unbiased parties, just raw truthful feedback. I’ve been dabbling in things for far too long after college and honestly starting to worry about my future and the direction it’s going. 

I got my bachelors degree and decided to pursue real estate for a while. Decided I was tired of that path and wanted to get back to my true passion, something I pushed aside chasing monetary goals for quite some time. For the past year, I’ve been freelancing creatively doing video work, while filling the down time/gaps of client work with site surveys for a solar engineering firm. The pay was pretty good, allowed me to create my own schedule, which worked really well with the video work side of things. 

I was talking to one of my buddies and he actually quit a top tier position with a software company to pursue videography. He is struggling monetarily speaking, but he says he loves it. Which got me thinking….  I really love it too, but do I want to be doing this for the next 10 years and be in his shoes, 42 and have nothing? 

Another one of my good friends, actually much older than me at 52 is a CTO with a software company. I’ve talked to him a lot about this issue, in fact a lot of things in life for advice. Long story short, he said he could get me a gig in software being a project manager, for lack of better terms with stable income, starting around 70-80k 401k the whole package that comes with the “corporate” world. Would I be an idiot not to take it. 

He mentioned it could be a great foot in the door into software and maybe down the line, get into a creative role within software. It all sounds like the perfect combo, monetarily speaking and securing a future, but I tried to fight so long to not have a “corporate” life. 

Again, would I be an idiot not to take it? Sorry, this was long winded and I’m sure I left out a few key details, just wanted some feedback from total strangers who can think objectively about this situation. If you have any questions, or more details don’t hesitate to ask.

1h0tt47,Job Advice for Zoomers from an Aging Zillenial (Mid-90s Birthday),"For the Zoomers in the back, I'll keep my philosophy short and succinct: Apply, apply, apply. Apply for literally anything and everything under the sun even remotely related to your educational/vocational background, including jobs, internships, fellowships, opportunities, etc. Like dating, the job market essentially boils down to a numbers game and the more you actually take your shot, even if you think you have a minuscule chance of getting a call-back, do so. I literally know people with the most dubious of credentials and without university degrees who managed to somehow weasel their way into high positions in major industries by just applying to random positions. Anything's possible and probability tends to favor the bold, even if it's in a marginal sort of way.

An important followup to this that is equally important is to never be fully complacent with a job and to consistently apply for other jobs while having said job. Even if you were to land your dream career, it's always important to maintain a contingency plan and to consistently apply for better-paying jobs in your industry just so you build connections with another potential employer in case the first job doesn't work out. Plus, because of the zero-sum nature of most industries nowadays, employers tend to find you more desirable if you have a job simply so they can snatch you away from another employer in a similar/same industry. I deeply regret not doing this in my last career when I had ample time and opportunity to do so, and it really affected my career trajectory once I left that job. Hope that helps you guys with your quest. It truly is as simple as I just made it out to be.",TheHaplessBard,1,0.550000011920929,0,1732674527,2024-11-27 02:28:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0tt47/job_advice_for_zoomers_from_an_aging_zillenial/,11,2024
1h0th8o,Should I accept an offer and back out if my current job counters?,"Need advice: Should I accept an offer and back out if my current job counters? TLDR:

* I received a great job offer and have until Friday to decide
* I'm comfortable in my current role but am a contract to hire holding pattern (no PTO, sub-par benefits, etc.)
* There's a 75% chance I'll get a better offer from my current company, but odds of getting something in writing by Friday are slim to none

How bad is it if I accept the offer on Friday and back out next week? I don't want to burn bridges professionally, or be a generally shitty person.

Background, I'm a Data Engineer for a big telecom company.

I'm a Data Engineer at a large telecom company. I joined in April 2022 in a contract-to-hire role. A few months later, I was added to the FTE conversion list, but a hiring freeze put everything on hold. My hourly rate is pretty good, my boss and I have a good relationship so I chucked it up to ""these things happen, be patient"".

Recently, I came across a posting for a Sr. Data Engineer that looked like a good fit, I applied and ended up getting the job. I've been keeping my boss in the loop, he's upset with the hiring freeze and the company's philosophy on hiring and is understanding of where I'm coming from, even if that means supporting my decision to leave. He said if I get an offer, HR would counter with an offer and then I'd be converted and he's aggressively pushing some of the higher ups to hire me.",holdMeClserTonyDanza,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1732673513,2024-11-27 02:11:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0th8o/should_i_accept_an_offer_and_back_out_if_my/,11,2024
1h0tefc,Don’t even know what kind of advice I need…,"TL;DR: High performer took promotion leading 20-person team but got stuck with toxic boss who provided zero training, violated medical privacy, and became hostile when called out (HR sided with OP) - now torn between staying in a role they love despite terrible leadership or risking career mobility by trying to transfer within company.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

For some background, I’m a high performer. I’ve been promoted 4x in 10 years. Most recently, I’ve taken a promotion within my company to a different department. It’s a new role that was created to support a struggling portfolio. 
I’m leading a multinational team of 20 finance professionals, but this type of department is new to me. I believe I was hired for my ability to lead people and my strengths as a finance professional and process-proficient professional. 

My boss is unlike any leader I’ve ever encountered. My training consisted of a 1 hour meeting (that I requested) my first week on the job.  I didn’t know the systems, responsibilities, people and quite frankly, didn’t know the industry that well as I’d only been at the company a little over a year. Guidance/training wasn’t given, nor were expectations of any kind. 

I rolled my sleeves up and made a bunch of connections and solicited info from others within and outside of the department to figure out what the heck I was responsible for. It was an exhausting 6 months but figured it out (for the most part) and led my team to improvements month over month. Also trained new managers how to be good managers. Never received feedback of any sort from my leader (positive or critical), but receive tons of positive feedback from other leaders in the department as well as folks underneath me. 

Part of the story also includes the detail that i have a short-term medical accommodation (Dr note and HR/boss approved). This is recent (within the last 8 weeks and will last through mid-year next year). A few weeks after getting approval for this accommodation, boss told me I needed to disclose it to my team or he would. So I disclosed it. He’s also tied it to performance a couple times. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My team/portfolio’s performance was better than that of my male peer’s (who has 10+ years experience on me and a simpler portfolio), but boss publicly and aggressively criticizes mine. I contact him privately and ask if he can share his criticism privately with me going forward instead of publicly, and he just get so aggressive and nasty (over Teams/email). I maintained respect and kindness despite his inappropriateness over several hours of messages. 

I end up reporting it all to HR - the violation of medical privacy, the hostility and poor treatment, a few other things as well. HR is very sympathetic, and tells his boss within a few hrs of my complaint. When my boss finds out, retaliation begins and I report that as well. 

HR investigation concluded in my favor. But now what? I have an awful leader, but I really love what I do (and I worked so hard to learn it). I have great connections within the company but worry he will “black ball” me if I try to interview next year within the company. FWIW, im highly charismatic and well-liked (he is not), I’m 10 years younger than my peers and I’m typically attractive (I don’t think this should matter but I’ve been told there have been comments made about my age and appearance). I’m not worried he’ll continue to retaliate directly, because he’s on thin ice. But at the end of the day he’s an awful people leader and I won’t learn anything from him other than “what not to do”.

1h0t1k4,i got fired after 4 days of working over an injury and now the owner doesn't want to pay ,"hello, i really need advice. i'm 17 and this was my first ever job experience. i got ""hired"" as a waitress in a local restaurant nov 14 and my first day was nov 15 and i was ""hired"" to work friday, saturday & sunday every week since i'm currently going to college. i worked the next 3 days i was supposed to and was always right on time, did great, and in my opinion i got the hang of it pretty quick for it to be my first ever job but sunday my lower back hurt A LOT and i still stayed and worked but i genuinely couldn't even think because of how badly it hurt. wednesday i go to the hospital because i can barely get up and they tell me it's most likely a spasm and give me pain relievers which made it a bit better and friday when i had to go back to work i went even though i was in pain and worked and everything fine but saturday i woke up and i couldn't get up at all and i was crying and tried to calm but to call to see if i could take the day off but, and i know i probably did this wrong, i texted the owner and explained the situation and told him how i was in the hospital wednesday and went friday to work but i was just in too much pain to go that day. i know i should've called but in the moment my thought process was ""who the fuck is gonna be okay with a 17 year old calling them at 9 in the morning crying"" and didn't think it was appropriate. never received a response from him but knew he saw it. next day, even though i'm in pain, i get ready and go to work and as soon as i walk inside the manager comes up to me and tells me i'm fired and that he was sorry but he had no say in it and that the owner didn't even explain but said that since i couldn't meet the hours he wasn't gonna have me working there any longer. i didn't fight it, i was pretty okay with it since i hated the job because of how much unfair and illegal shit was going on there and just explained to the manager what happened and left. now, the illegal shit, the tips are shared and the owner takes a percentage of the tips that the waitresses make, the cooks are all cokeheads that are in the back smoking while making the cook in the nastiest kitchen ever (when i say nasty, i mean NASTY, wayyy worse than a mcdonald's kitchen probably) there was no hygiene while making the food, people touching the food with dirty hands, and i didn't have a proper break i was just allowed eat very quickly and keep going while i was having 10 hour shifts just starting. but back to the story, i leave and i call him the next day saying if i can pass by later to pick up my money from friday that i worked since i was told he brought the checks every monday after 4:30 and i called him at 3, he told me to send him the day i worked and hung up quickly. i sent him the text and passed by at 6, there were only 2 guys working there and they couldn't find my money and tried calling him and he would hang up and i stood there waiting around 20 minutes and they told me to come back tomorrow to pick it up, so today, so the same shit from yesterday didn't happen, i call the owner and tell him about how i went to the restaurant the day before and my money wasn't there and that they told me to come by today and that i was gonna go later and he told me that they didn't even open today.... okay so why the fuck would they tell me to go today?? anyway, i tell him i also need to talk about the situation and that with a little bit more of communication he could've just told me he couldn't bring my money yesterday and to pick it up wednesday and he tells me ""i don't know why the hurry for the money, were u expecting me to quickly run and take your money?"" with attitude and hangs up immediately without letting me finish. i call him back and i tell him i wasn't finished and that i think it's very unprofessional from his part how i never even received a response saturday and sunday i go and i get told im fired and then i call for my money and i go and it isn't there and he starts fighting saying i'm the one that's unprofessional missing work after not even working 2 weeks and that he doesn't need to talk to me and that i'm just mad i got ""fired"". i keep putting """" cause i was never fully hired, i never signed any paperwork cause i was training at first. but to make this long ass story short, he starts arguing and insulting me after i was NOTHING BUT PROFESSIONAL and he ends up hanging up. now, i have no idea when the fuck i'm going to get my paycheck and idc if it was only from friday i worked those hours and i want that money idgaf if it's $100 or $20. now, i think that if i do get payed i'm scared it won't be the amount that i actually earned and i was wondering if there's any way i could ask for proof that that's actually what i made. sorry if this was all over the place, english isn't my first language and i'm pissed the fuck off rn. i think this situation is ridiculous",meowrawrmeowrawr,5,0.6100000143051147,29,1732672186,2024-11-27 01:49:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0t1k4/i_got_fired_after_4_days_of_working_over_an/,11,2024

I’m currently chatting with a recruiter and he has been setting me up for meetings with different companies. We haven’t gone into specifics about salary, visa sponsorship, or other details yet cause they’re mostly introductory calls. 

But I just had a good chat with a C-suite management person and I think it went well. They asked me to send them an email about my salary expectations.

So I’m wondering, should I respond back through my recruiter to ask him about the market rate and budget or should I just give a broad range directly to the company?

What do you think is the best way to proceed?

1h0qbp2,taking on product work as an engineer is disturbing my productivity and peace ~ ,"hello \~ i am 32f the lead (only) frontend engineer at a small tech startup based in the usa , fully remote \~ i have been feeling frustrated for a while and realized it's because i i'm taking on a lot of product work . i build the UI so all product discrepancies , missing assets , broken backend work all comes to me and is discovered by me . i spend a significant amount of time chasing down information that is missing in my stories like ""what is the route i should be hitting and with what payload shape"" like , the most basic information ... imo we need a good product manager which i mentioned like a year ago . i want to have a positive conversation with my team about this because it is really messing with my ability to get any actual coding work done . i am continually interrupted and waiting and it kills my interest and problem solving energy and is a large source of stress in my life ; i feel like i cant get anything done . my manager was on leave for a year and just got back like a month ago and is doing jack of all trades roll so i feel like he has a lot on his plate .

for example , 3 weeks ago i got a story that contained three bullet points about the page and a link to the design . it's a rewrite of the home page that includes a filter modal , AND a new :id route that also includes a multi step form modal . this is doable , looks intersting , i like building UI , and will take maybe a week , week and a half with testing . the first thing i notice is there is no information about the multiple related backend routes . i ask for the information on a thursday and get it on a monday . in an unrelated meeting i see another view of the page that i have almost finished rewriting showing the original state . i ask about it and am told 'oh yes we only show the new design under x circumstance' \~ this page logic was not included in the story , i go back and rewrite . on friday i noticed that the design shows a multi select for a certain filter field and the route only accepts one id as a query param . in the response to my first question about the routes , my coworker had specifically written that he couldn't think of when we would need to send more than one . it would take one conversation between these two of my immediate coworkers to have these product details ironed out before the work gets to me .  
  
i can't give accurate deadlines ( which i have been getting asked for more lately ) when i do not have all the information . it causes me personal distress , and is not the role i was hired for and am actually good at . i like writing code to solve problems and i am good at it , i need to be able to sit and focus with all relevant information available without being distracted . i'm not sure how to approach the conversation especially because have been feeling emotional about it lately . i didnt realize how much being able to be productive and focus and work was good for me and contributed to my positive mental health and ability to structure my life . i also want to add that i have been at this company for four years and no one has ever said anything to me about productivity . maybe i just need to "" manage up "" ? i am the only woman on my team , is this that 'women are the glue' thing that was going around a few years ago ? i like my coworkers and think we work well together otherwise . im just doing so much work that is not my job and i am stressed !",fruitfight,2,1.0,2,1732664267,2024-11-26 23:37:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0qbp2/taking_on_product_work_as_an_engineer_is/,11,2024

1h0pv4o,Company is making us work whole week of Christmas except the 25th (yes the whole week),"Company making us work the whole week of Christmas but the 25th. We are recruiters, is this evil?

Hey y’all so we found out today that our company is enforcing us to work everyday of the week of Christmas but the 25th. This is ridiculous, we work as recruiters and NO one is going to be answering the phone.

This means we can’t go visit our family’s, as all of our families live elsewhere.

The whole company is doing very poorly (as the whole industry is) 

And I have a feeling they are just waiting to see who resigns so they don’t have to pay taxes unemployment/give people any sort of severance?

I obviously want to see my family and can’t phantom not going home (my dad is getting up there) and would hate if this is his last Christmas . Part of me thinks I should resign, but the market is so bad that it’s really difficult. Also, wont let us take that week. FYI: I have been applying elsewhere 

any advice would be appreciated!

1h0po2p,Golden Handcuffs worth it?,"My current job is a government job which lets me retire and collect a pension at 22 years. My anticipated pension will probably be around $100,000/year. I am 13 years into said job.

For the past few years I have really struggled with leaving it and doing something I want. I would love to be a commercial pilot and took a year off from work to try and do it. I ended up almost finishing, but regretted leaving due to the pension and the fact that there is an aviation related spot at my job that I can now apply to. I came back last year and applied and got into what is considered a “dream” spot at my
job.

Ive been at this dream aviation spot for a year and haven’t done any flying. Im mostly administrative work. But the promise of flying is dangled in front of me; and it’s an exciting kind of flying that can’t be matched in the private sector.
The day to day is very easy almost mindless, but the head of this unit is an asshole, and treats me and my coworkers like children. 

So here I am again trying to get a hold of my expectations. I have a brainless job which would allow me to take in 200k/yr, with a 100k pension in 9 more years. I will probably fly at some point, but due to my supervisory position, it is secondary to the mindless admin work and an occasional thing. But I feel I could leave with my pension and then pursue my flying goals even harder with money basically not being an issue at that point. Im 35 now. I feel like Im getting too caught up in the whole dream thing and not seeing the forest from the trees. I have a stable life and a bright future with this pension. But I still have that itch, albeit not as bad as a year ago.

1h0pes7,"New Job Offer, I Like my Current Role. Should I take it?","

Hi there, looking for some advice on a new job offer which I just received.

For some background I graduated college about a year ago and have been working since then. I am currently in a IT rotational program where most of my focus will be in the analytics space (data science, data engineering, data viz). I am currently on rotation one and would have the opportunity for two more rotations after this. 

After being reached out to on LinkedIn about a new job, I decided to interview and just found out I got an offer. This new role is a data analyst role, with a large focus on data engineering (so probably a less wide variety of experience compared to my rotational program). This offer is at a company which is a similar size (probably a bit more recognizable) than my current one. During my interviews I did like the people I interviewed with, but was a bit concerned that I would not get as broad of work experience as I get currently. It sounds from my interviews that WLB would be the same, and both roles are hybrid with similar amount of time in office.

With this, I am unsure if I should take the offer. I am really enjoying my time in my current role, and like the company I work for. What makes it tough is that this new offer would have about a 35% higher salary than what I currently make with relatively similar benefits (5 less pto days which is a bummer). I make a decent amount of money currently, but the 35% jump is hard not to look at. I am trying to figure out which would be more beneficial for me in the long run, to stick out my current program at a company I like and get more breadth of experience while making less money, or to dive into a specific role at a new company while making more money.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

TLDR: received offer for new role with pay raise, enjoy my current role and company quite a bit, should I take the offer at new company for pay bump, or stick with what I know I like",LilTwangToIt,1,1.0,0,1732661788,2024-11-26 22:56:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0pes7/new_job_offer_i_like_my_current_role_should_i/,11,2024

I love working in creative industries. I have always been curious about getting into the music industry (business side not performing) purely bc I love music so much. It’s such a passion for me and I would love to be surrounded by it. When I was in college I worked on photoshoots. I recently assisted a photographer on set and remembered how much I loved it. I thought that could also translate into events? I love moving around and not spending my entire day in front of a computer. I REALLY love people and working with them. If I stayed in fashion/retail id love to do something in sustainability. 

I clearly am all over the place but I think I’m slowly starting to get somewhere. I would really love to have someone mentor me. Would love a backboard and guidance on all of my ideas. Would love someone who is empathetic but honest.

1h0p65t,Accepted internship return offer but got better offer after ,"So currently I started an internship with a financial trading company in NYC in May and since I live in the area, they offered to have the internship extended through December while I finish my final semester of school and graduate in December (originally internship was only for the summer). Around October I received a return offer from them for 100K (WFH 2 days, in office 3 Days midtown NY), no sign on bonus or anything else, but eligible for end of year performance bonus(up to ~15%) and as I had no other offers and the rough new grad environment I accepted their offer. Though, sometime later I was able to get an interview with Capital One and said might as well interview see what happens. Well….Now I just recently got an offer from them for their Richmond office for 119k + 25k sign on + 5k relocation. 

In this case, would I reengage my current company I’m at currently to see if they can come closer to C1s offer or what would declining their offer now look like? I’m tempted by C1 since it’s more money in a LCOL area, but not sure how I would go about this.

Mid manager (report to C level) in a pretty big corporation. 

Overall, the pay is good for the complexity of the job that I do. The hours are quite long  - 50ish a week. 
Work both , in field and manage others.

On a big picture, people generally value me. 

Nevertheless, it is clear the CEO hates me. 

The guy himself (CEO) - very good at speaking/communication. Not particularly a specialist when it comes to the market the corporation is operating at. 

Me - a nerd that is pretty good at his narrow field but terrible at communication mostly due to poor English (non native). Every time I have to present something , the CEO either leaves the room or goes to his phone while concluding at the end directly or indirectly that ‘we need more understand in this field’ or this ‘this field is unclear’.

I decided to jump ship, and get another job in a manufacturing company, its packaging products. I took a dollar pay cut to be free of Aerospace and have been happy, I am still making close to what i was making because the position offers overtime as well. I have always wanted to get into Human Resources but never had time to go to school, and never had an opportunity to apply within any of the companies i worked for until recently a position opened here where I am working. The Job Title is Human Resource Coordinator it is basically entry level because I have no experience, so not only will i most likely take a small pay cut, but I will also lose overtime and that makes it a big pay cut. Human Resources is a great career with growth potential, I know I will love it, but life is very expensive!!  I am afraid to take the leap. Can anyone give me advice on Human Resources, and if it is worth the pay cut for the future potential earning, also am I to old to do this?

1h0n1bw,navigating a transition,"I work for a company that, under new leadership, is now operating more like a scrappy startup. I’m fine with the changes, but there have been significant shifts. Early last year there was a round of layoffs, and just this week, my immediate supervisor was let go. From what I’ve gathered, the decision was due to a combination of performance and a conflict with a colleague.

I’ve been with the organization for several years, and my performance has always been strong. After my boss’s departure, leadership gave little information about what this means for my role or the team that reported to my boss. They mentioned it “could be an opportunity to take on more leadership” and said they’re working on restructuring the team, but there’s been no mention of hiring a replacement.

I’d be happy to step into the role, but it hasn’t been explicitly offered. I’m concerned leadership might expect me to take on the workload without a raise or promotion. Colleagues have already approached me, assuming I’m taking over, asking to schedule discussions about team plans and expectations. I'm being added to my former boss' meetings too, that I typically did not attend. 

How should I approach this? Should I take on the responsibilities and then advocate for a promotion, or would it be better to address this with leadership sooner? I want to avoid being quietly assigned the role without proper recognition. I also have intel that asking for more money has backfired on people, so that's certainly a concern.

Since then l've applied to a few jobs and had some good interviews. I've since been offered at least one job with a good chance of a 2nd. Issue is, these companies think I'm still employed. On my job offer letter, it explains barring a background check, I'll be hired on. Originally, I figured it was more of a criminal background check but my wife has me nervous thinking it's a full check with dates. I'm now anxiously thinking that if they find out I was lying, they'll rescind the offer if they find out I was terminated a few weeks back.
Should I be worried?
Should I bring it up to them now with offer in hand?
Should I let sleeping dogs lie and keep this to myself?

1h0m2mq,Resigning right before Christmas Holidays? ,"I took an easy entry level job 12 months ago to have a bit of a ""brain break"" after 10+ years in the construction management / facility management sector (last job I was made redundant with a bunch of others due to the company struggling financially) ANYWAY, I actually enjoy the work here but the people are awful. I recently returned from surgery due to a cancer diagnosis and it put a lot into perspective. I am free and clear of cancer now (yay!) however am actively seeking another job that pays better and has a better team.

  
I could go into deep detail but for the sake of keeping the post  simple - its an incredibly toxic workplace and there is a lot of bullying / purposeful exclusion happening that has worsened for me since my time off and I am just over it. We are a very small team and I could cut the tension with a knife most days. Its completely one sided. Due to recovering from surgery for 6 or so weeks I have no leave left and I have a few job interviews lined up over the next 2 weeks. If I were to receive an offer I doubt employment would commence until the new year. 

  
What are the implications to resigning a few days before Christmas holidays (and is it even possible?) so I can still be paid for the public holidays over the break? For example I give 2 weeks notice on the 18th of December I would be paid for all the public holidays over the break? 

  
As you can imagine finances have tightened due to my time off, so whilst I typically wouldn't fathom doing something like this I feel like I need to look after myself and my family ?

I’ve been a mechanical engineer for military defense over 3 years now. Never been overly excited about engineering. Finished my MBA in June and got my first offer for a new job. This job is doing software support for a large tech company that makes a software used by mechanical engineers. The pay is exactly the same but job is only 3 days in office and half the commute I currently have (right now I’m in office 4-5 days per week).  

I think this new position would broaden my skill set, get me out of engineering, and give me an entrance to the software field while also keeping me in the same realm of engineering. 

I am just worried doing software support/user success will put me in a weird spot when it comes to career progression. However, the company is very laid back and claims to let people switch internally to roles that better suit themselves (consulting, R&D, etc.) I don’t want to regret turning down this job offer especially in this tight of a job market.

1h0ks35,Need help deciding on a career (medical and leadership inclined),"Hello!  So, like the title says, I need help thinking of some possible long term careers.  I'm 21F, bounced around career-wise for several years already and life fell apart twice when I was so sure.  I'm currently floating around the workforce giving law enforcement a try, but it's turning out I might not like that forever.

One thing I am constant with is medical.  I am always the first to jump in when a first aid injury arises.  But I am also drawn to a sense of leadership.  Are there any careers out there that combine both or is EMT/Nurse my best bet?

1h0k0pb,Should I take this role at work?,"
Hi, 

I’m working as Sales Lead for MENA Region since few years. I have total 10+ years of experience in past. 
I have recently been offered Head of Africa role with more responsibilities including retail and sales which is good opportunity to showcase my skills. 

This comes with a lot of conditions , like I will have to travel every month to South Africa leaving my home country, disturbing my personal life or routine at not much salary increase. Also married with no kids yet. 

I am also being sent there to improve the issues which I don’t know if they are even fixable hence it’s like arrow in dark in name of great opportunity.

While I accept all of above as risk to grow in career, there is one condition recently told to me which makes it very difficult decision- they asked me keep head of Africa as confidential within the African region internally while they are okay to approve as ‘head of Africa’ externally. 

I’m not sure why they want to do that, maybe it’s to not let people within African region feel they are hiring from outside instead of internally. They have also tried hiring externally but they have failed and I’m their ‘desperate’ choice. 


Also additional information, I have been very good at my work since last few years and been poached by this company from the previous one. 
I just don’t get what’s the catch with fake designation thing.

Any insights from more experienced people will be valuable.

1h0jrz6,"Not sure where my experience is leading me, what kind of entry level roles can I get with my current experience?","


I’m looking for advice on what kinds of roles might be a good fit for me based on my work experience and skills. Here’s an overview of my background:

Education: I’m majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS). I’ll admit I didn’t dive deeply into all the technical aspects during my coursework, so I’m still building confidence in areas like coding and advanced analytics. However, I’m actively learning and improving.

Work Experience:
Digital Transformation Intern: Created blog content, analyzed engagement metrics, and streamlined workflows. Used tools like Excel and Python to enhance project timelines and deliverables.

Marketing and Partnerships Intern: Analyzed customer behavior to improve engagement by 33.8% and contributed to strategies that achieved a 37% KPI improvement. Created presentations for business strategy meetings and tracked ROI metrics.

NielsenIQ Scholar Program: Collaborated in a team of 9 to analyze sales data, market share, and competitor trends for a global CPG company. Presented insights and actionable recommendations to industry professionals using Excel.

Volunteer Data Analyst: Processed Slack data in JSON format, converted it to structured datasets using Python and Excel, and worked with team members to compile actionable reports.
Class Projects: Analyzed a 15,000+ record dataset, created Power BI dashboards, and explored data trends to identify sampling bias and feature distributions.

Skills: Beginner-level Python, Excel, and Power BI. My technical skills are basic, but I’m committed to improving through hands-on experience and troubleshooting.
With this background, I’m wondering:

What types of entry-level roles would align with my experience and skills?
How can I best position myself for analytics-focused opportunities?
Are there industries or specific job titles that would suit my mix of marketing, data analysis, and project experience?
I’d love any advice or insights on where I should focus my job search or how I can better frame my experience to stand out.

1h0irqx,Should I confront my boss about my frustrations?,"Two years ago, my manager stopped coming to the office because he was focusing on his other business. Once the boss found out, she fired him. I was ready to step into his position because I had always been the one training new employees, and while my manager was absent, I acted as the team supervisor.

However, the day after the boss fired him, she announced that the new manager would be another employee—someone who had shown no interest in advancing his career and hadn’t contributed nearly as much as I had while the manager was away.

A year later, that same person was demoted back to his previous position, while I was promoted to a higher role. The new manager came from a different team altogether. To my surprise, I found out that the demoted employee was still earning the same salary he had as a manager, while I—despite my higher position and increased responsibilities—was earning much less.

At a corporate party, this former manager told me he was chosen for the role because our previous manager assumed I had snitched on him, so he selected someone else out of spite.

Despite all this, I continued to work hard. I trained new employees, proposed new features for our admin systems to make work faster and easier, and actively contributed to the team's success. Yet, at the end of the year, that same employee received a 5% raise, while I only got 4%, even though I had done significantly more work.

When I expressed my frustration to the manager, she told me I wasn’t ""active enough."" This was particularly upsetting because even my colleagues acknowledged that I was the most active and helpful person on the team. Whenever they faced issues, they came to me for help, not to the new manager or even the previous one.

This year, I’ve lost my motivation. I still do my job, but I don’t feel as driven to go above and beyond anymore.

Now, as the year comes to an end, I’ve been reflecting on everything that happened, and it’s left me feeling even more frustrated. I’m considering telling my boss about my frustrations overall.

1h0i5t2,Post grad and hating the role I chose ,"Coding has always made me really anxious and feel overwhelmed. I’ve never found it a passion or fulfilling but I was getting through my schoolwork and thought it was a broad enough major to where I could do something other than SWE. Until I started applying and realizing I only heard back from SWE positions..and at a FAANG so I knew I had to take the opportunity to at least see if I liked it.

Well I don’t. It really stresses me out, I feel like I’m not doing enough, and I don’t know enough. My mental health has been shot recently and I really want a less demanding job even if it means less pay as long as I feel somewhat competent enough to do it. On top of this, I was relocated to a state where I’m completely alone so things have been hitting 10x harder.

Im competent when it comes to technology so being in tech still would be fine, but coding..not so much. I’m not sure what my options are…I’m afraid of underperforming because it takes me so long to find things and implement them because I don’t know everything on the back of my hand yet so staying at least a year is sometimes questionable. 

And before you say, how did you pass the interview…I definitely got lucky in the interview process with a good interviewer and simple questions.

1h0f937,Stuck Between AI/ML and Java Full Stack – Which Career Path Will Actually Get Me a Job?,"Hi everyone,  

I’m completing my BE in Computer Science and Engineering (specializing in AI & ML) in 2024. I’m passionate about becoming an ML Engineer, but I currently have no strong technical skills in AI, ML, or other technologies.  

The companies visiting my college for placements aren’t offering roles related to AI or ML. Many of my friends have taken courses in other technologies like Salesforce or Full Stack Development and have secured jobs in those fields.  

Now, I’m at a crossroads and could really use some advice:  
1. Should I dedicate time to building my technical skills in AI/ML and possibly enroll in courses to become industry-ready for ML roles?  
2. Or should I follow the path of my friends and switch to learning unrelated technologies to secure a job more quickly?  

One concern I have is that if I choose to learn something like Java Full Stack Development now and later pursue a master’s degree, I’ll likely need to take courses related to AI/ML as the field is booming. If that happens, I’d end up changing my career path again, as there’s no overlap between being a Java developer and an ML engineer.  

In conclusion, I’m wondering if it’s better to stay focused on AI/ML, despite the challenges, or if I should pivot to other technologies that might offer quicker job opportunities but potentially force me to change paths again in the future. Also, if I decide to shift to Java Full Stack, what master’s programs would align with that skill set? 

I’m torn between staying true to my passion for AI/ML and adapting to the market for immediate job security. Any advice, insights, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.

While the job has its perks—it’s comfortable, lots of days off, offers great work-life balance, and pays around $70k—I feel like I’ve hit a plateau in my career. I don’t see much room for growth in my current position, and I’m ready to challenge myself with something better and different.

Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in the networking field, and I’ve set a goal to pass the CCNA by February 2025. My long-term goal is to transition into a role that will help me become a Network Administrator in the next few years.

That said, I’m feeling a bit lost about how to approach this career change since I don't have experience working with networks.. My plan for now is to focus on getting the CCNA certification, but I’m not sure what types of jobs I should look for after that or what additional steps I should take to move closer to my goal.

If you’ve made a similar transition or work in the networking field, I’d really appreciate your advice. What positions should I aim for after earning the CCNA? Are there any other certifications, skills, or strategies I should consider to build a successful career in networking?

Instead of explaining everything they just asked if I had questions after they just completed something totally brand new to me. I voiced my concerns but it didn’t help.

1h0dutb,Need Advice on Choosing Between Data Science and Spring Boot Developer Role!,"Hello friends,  
This is my first post in this sub, and I really need your advice.

I recently completed my master’s in Data Science and have 8 months of internship experience as a Data Analyst. For the past 4 months, I’ve been trying to get a job but haven’t had much success. I’ve attended 4 interviews so far: got rejected in 2, almost got hired for one but the company later froze the hiring process (that’s what they told me), and I’m still waiting for the result of the 4th one, where I made it to the 4th round.also have a Data Analyst interview scheduled for the day after tomorrow.

Recently, a family friend offered me a position as a Spring Boot Developer. The issue is, I want to work in a data science related role. I only familiar with  Python, Sql, powerBi ,Excel also have knowledge of ML,DL and NLP ..currently learning pyspark and Gen AI whereas Spring Boot is Java-based. I would also need to learn other technologies, but they’ve offered to give me 2 months of training.

Now I’m confused. Should I take this offer or wait for a data science role?

Does Spring Boot development have a good future? Is anyone working in this role? If so, could you share what the work is like?

1h0dicz,29 and majorly struggling in what I thought would be my dream job in policy,"I've spent my career wanting to make as much improvement in the policy world of my choice. After college I had an analyst position that was partly related to that area, got a masters in my desired policy area of focus as a full time student (but still got professional work experience), and then got an early career economist job at a policy/regulatory government agency, which is where I am now after a promotion almost a year ago. 

In my early career economist job there was a lot of structure and I was working on things that have a lot of precedent. My boss was communicative and I'd interact with coworkers in my division pretty often. I excelled at that job for two years and then got a big promotion and raise into a policy specialist job where I've been tasked on working on essentially all the emerging issues in my rapidly changing policy field. I thought this was the position I was working towards from a content standpoint and I even have 3 days WFH with very limited expectation to work outside 9-5. 

The specialist job was essentially just a title with vague descriptions of responsibilities because it was a newly created job that no one had been in before. The agency was required to have the job, but I don't think people really knew the details of what it would be. I switched divisions and now hardly ever interact with my new coworkers or boss due to remote work. My boss especially is hard to communicate with. He doesn't really answer the phone or emails and I have to hope to catch him on the rare occasions he comes into the office. Technically he is my boss, but since this is a new position on emerging issues, he honestly doesn't know the answers and I can tell he really just wants to stay in his government employee lane and keep his head down. 

The job has become one where I'm essentially asked to just figure out emerging, very contentious issues and write issue analysis for policymakers. Often the timelines that I can work on things are very short - 2-4 weeks because the issues are complex, new, I'm learning a lot of it as I go, and there's just so much going on. A lot of what I do is often treated with great concern by the senior leaders (two people above my boss) because they worry about the organization as an entity saying something they might regret or can't backtrack on, which is fair enough, but it's hard enough to get it right without any direction and limited feedback. It's really negatively affecting my confidence to put a lot of work into these things and then have it be met with big last minute edits and reluctant submission. There are things I can tell they are hoping I can figure out how to do that I simply don't have the skills/experience to do without someone to lead me and that gives me a lot of anxiety too.

I've got a few questions I'm hoping to get some advice on (thank you for any advice in advance). 

Is this just what it means to be a mid-career person? I think the organization is just dysfunctional and I didn't see it in the first two years since I had a good boss who helped me stay in my lane with limited interaction with leadership, but I am also worried that maybe this is just what it means to be above a junior level and I just am not able to succeed. 

Is it too late to switch my career entirely? Thanks to the professional work of my 20s, I have a beefy resume (at least on paper) for my field that can prove I'm relatively smart and hardworking but wonder if the contentious and continuously/rapidly changing nature of policy work aren't for me. I thought I could do this policy work and be stable and have work life balance but have started thinking it might be better to just work in a career where I develop a hard skill that can create more stability for me. 

I have a friend who is willing to help me get into commercial banking (regional level or smaller), which he says is a great sector of finance to clock in, do your work, and go home, but I'd take a $20k-30k salary hit to start again in an early career type of role. Conversely, I could probably get a $0-$10k raise just by jumping to the same type of job for a consulting company but am worried I'd just be experiencing the same thing at a different place.",OliveDragon7,1,1.0,0,1732632345,2024-11-26 14:45:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h0dicz/29_and_majorly_struggling_in_what_i_thought_would/,11,2024
1h0dd4e,My boss is ghosting me?,"I am on my second month of a new job. My full responsibilities were not made very clear in the interview process, but I have been adjusting. One major issue is I may or may not be in charge of a project--it has been *incredibly* unclear. I am not the manager of the people working on the project, yet they are acting like I am, and my manager/manager's manager have given me the date of expected completion and want me to explain why it's not met when it is inevitably not met.

I have been trying to push the project along and as far as tasks I can complete, I have done these quickly. However, despite the project starting months before I was hired, the other members have not completed even half of their work (and it's due in a week). I am not able to do these tasks, I am only able to confirm they have been completed accurately, which is what I was originally told my role would be for this project. I reached out to my manager to explain that person X and Y have not completed their tasks and have complaints about the process and that these are the reasons they've given for no completion. My manager replied asking if I do not have time to complete my tasks and if I am holding up the project. I explained *again* that I have completed my tasks, but can't continue on because my role relies on others doing their tasks, which they are not doing. My manager has not replied in a full business day and will be off work until the due date once they leave this afternoon. I can see them replying to other people and I can see their calendar is empty. They canceled all of their calls with me last week, so I haven't been able to discuss this face-to-face with them.

I have not been treated this way in previous jobs and don't know what to do.

	•	Education: I have a BA in Communications and am nearly finished with the Google Project Management Certificate.
	•	Current Role: I’m working as a Customer Operations Coordinator in a challenging environment. While the job pays better than my previous roles, I don’t feel aligned with the company’s product or culture.
	•	Career Struggles:
	•	I’ve been praised for my work but have also faced challenges like office politics and ineffective leadership.
	•	I’m not sure if I want to stay in customer service long-term.
	•	I’ve explored project management, marketing, and supply chain but feel unsure which path is best for me.
	•	Many project coordinator roles seem focused on construction or IT, which I don’t have experience in.

I’m looking for a behind-the-scenes role that offers a decent salary (I’m currently earning $53,000) and aligns with my strengths in organization, detail orientation, and process improvement. I’d also like opportunities for growth and a healthier work environment.

Durante l'università e oltre ho sempre cercato di lavorare sulla mia formazione per essere spendibile nel mio settore.  
Al momento mi trovo alla mia seconda esperienza lavorativa (terza contando uno stage alla fine della mia carriera accademica), ho conseguito una Laurea in architettura in uno dei migliori atenei italiani con il massimo dei voti e dopo poco tempo in studio ho deciso di mollare la professione (non era l'ambito adatto a me) e passare in azienda per svolgere un lavoro più affine alla ricerca. 

Al momento mi trovo con una posizione lavorativa parzialmente stabile e decentemente retribuita nel settore del proptech-Real Estate, specificatamente mi occupo di R&D, innovazione, gestione e manutenzione tools interni e innovazione nel settore. Il problema è che al contrario di quelle che sono state le premesse non sto crescendo lavorativamente, sono stato quasi totalmente demansionato dalle mie task a fronte di variazione strutturali nel mio team e sento di star sprecando degli anni chiave per la mia crescita professionale e di competenze all'interno del mondo del lavoro.   
  
Da settembre sto cercando lavoro altrove, in Italia e all'estero, ma da subito questo processo si è rivelato un inferno, non riesco a trovare posizioni del tutto sovrapponibili alla mia job position e, contemporaneamente, temo anche che il mio background da architetto non stia dando valore alla mia posizione. Non ho ricevuto una risposta da quando ho cominciato ad inviare il mio cv. Al momento sono molto scoraggiato e sento di non riuscire a capire a pieno quale sia il problema alla radice di tutto questo. Posso comprendere la non spendibilità al pari di una figura più trasversale ma in questo momento sento come se io mi presentassi alle aziende con assolutamente nessuna competenza spendibile. 

Al momento sto cercando nel proptech, all'interno di organizzazioni internazionali (FAO, ONU, UNhabitat ecc. ecc.) ed in generale all'interno del settore del city making e dell'impatto sociale. 

Avete qualche consiglio rispetto alla mia situazione? Aree da implementare o azioni utili ad uscire da questa situazione? Sto anche valutando un master per posizionarmi più verticalmente nel settore (più verso impatto sociale e innovazione sul citymaking) ma dati i prezzi e la necessità di fermarmi per un anno al momento la sto valutando come ultima sponda.

1h0cn4j,Work is stressful and Co workers and managers are toxic,"I recently moved to a new city to start a life with my boyfriend. I love my job and I love what I do but this is a very stressful job. I'm not talking about work loads but co workers and managers. I started working at my work almost a year ago, and I'm clearly new to the city and barely new anyone. It was good at first but Im starting to get a bad feeling about the place being very toxic in terms of people who works here. I saw their relationships being so close to each other and call the work as their second family. I have no problem with that at all but when it comes to work they dont take it seriously. As for example; I tried to bring up a problem that some supervisors did to the general manager secretly first and she told me that ""dont say that kind of stuff to the meeting, that's not how it goes in this company"". I only wanted to bring up that the supervisors are making a lot of mistakes and I have a lot of complains from the customers that needed to be addressed but I got dismissed by only mentioning it. The owner has a very close relationship with the manager as she already works here for about 10 years. I always get left behind by everyone and somehow I tried to be friendly with them, they usually talked in their own language. I know for sure they are talking about me as as I see them all the time staring at me and laugh infront of me. This takes toll on my mental health for awhile now. 

Tl;dr should i quit my job or just keep ignoring them. Advice?

Then on top of that, do trainings and things related to the merge of the departments.

With the junior lead I would have had less to do as I wouldn’t have been scheduling for any location. I wouldn’t be constantly on the phone. They also took away the lead stipend I was getting as well as the $1 raise for the junior lead position.

Also, trying to career change just seems like major stress and risk, and likely take years of struggle to get back to my pay level - This would all have an impact on family life…

I’m a former banker specialized in digital transformation projects that partook in a role like the mix of product management, project management and business analysis over 5 years. And as one that have affinity with development cycle, I transitioned into software development realm, learnt web development frameworks(Django, Django REST, Flask) and exploratory data analysis. I’m able to build full-stack web applications from scratch with HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript or React front-end on SQlite, PostgreSQL and able to make exploratory data analysis with some machine learning models(sci-kit learn) with data visualization libraries(matplotlib, seaborn, plotly etc.).

Now I’m looking for both freelance or remote job opportunities in Europe especially in web development, but Upwork seems money trap(probably due to freelancer inflation) and Linkedin seems tailored for bigger companies(highly for full-time roles). My motivation is rather than to work for smaller companies or startups for steeping my learning curve and gaining technical and international experience either in part-time or full-time

So my questions are:

1)      Do you know any other places to find jobs considering my circumstances and expectations?

2)      What do you recommend for next steps to add my tech stack? (I consider deployment tools like Docker or Kubernetes as next tasks)

1h08wt0,Survived PIP but still quitting,"I was put on PIP for the past year. It was a genuine PIP. Some of it were my fault and some were theres but I admit I really do have big faults in it. I was given few works. Managers would barely communicate with me.  I basically sucked cuz i did not have the experience. Instead of confronting me or giving review points, i got PIPed. My manager was also confronted to train me better. I did well after few months. But i know that one mistake and i piss people off sometimes. I sent my notice and they said they were sad about it because i was doing great 

I am still quitting though cuz i am not hitting the budget due to low amount of work and I know i’ll be the first one to get kick out. Manager just asked me if i have a new job and i said yes and she was like good. She told me that it will be hard to find a replacement though. I really have low confidence and sometimes i dont know if i made the right choice but i feel like i did. The environment was ok in general. I just did not like my manager but was really grateful cuz she trained me. It just feels like im tiptoing everytime. Another coworker noticed it and said that she too is avoiding my manager. She has the tendency to call people out publicly and someone already quit before because of it. 

I did try to develop thick skin but i got rattled again when she threw me off the bus right after i went on vacation in a meeting. Like she pointed the tasks at me even though i had nothing to do about it. I couldnt speak cuz i have not double checked if i am indeed not responsible but after the meeting i checked and confirmed I have nothing to do about it.

Me and my wife currently live in Europe My wife got an offer in her country, emirates.

“Leave your job (senior designer), leave your country and start looking for a job here. I will pay for one year the renting, even two if needed and I will help you finding a job, in the meantime you can work for my company”

Now, there are many cons on moving to his country, there are even many possibilities.

I am working in a stable job, not super heavy (hybrid) my salary is around 2100€ with taxes removed already.

His job will be different from mine, he said they will train me. The salary he offered me is not great (2500€) but decent considering that i wont pay the rent for 1-2 years.

Ofc paying rent and everything in my current situation doesn’t allow me to save a lot.

1h07q56,Should I prepare for GATE or take the placement from my college? Advice to freshers,"Placements are absolutely the best option only if your from IITs/NIT otherwise their are lots of factors to be considered:

Package seems to be the most important parameter, but according to me this is a mistake Most freshers make. It's very important to have a career rather than having a job, the only way to have a career is to think long term. Their are N number of companies that can give you CTC of 10-15LPA, that means in hand salary of atleast 80-90k but in many cases the growth is negligible as this involves just practice of well structured skills and chance of being replced is very high.

Secondly their is a good chance you may not see a very high salary jump if your shifting to another company, despite 3-4 years of experience. In fact you may not even get a senior position. The best way to avoid this is quite obvious don't do any job that only depends on some skills, if their are some conceptual knowledge with technical skills then your chance of replacebilty decrease, usually product based companies are safer, and the growth is also exponential. This is very easy for students in IITs but may not be possible for vast majority. 

In this case I would suggest you to prepare for GATE, so the advantage here is you can either pursue a master's degree and finally get your IIT tag or Their are N number of PSUs that recruit through GATE and these jobs are much comfortable than MNCs. Even if neither of these things happen your fundamentals will be extremely strong through which you can crack difficult interviews. Many people have cracked interviews like NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google just by preparing for GATE. But of course this task will be quite difficult than preparing for a placement interview. 

Conclusion: if you believe your an hardworker and deserve to be in a better place than now GATE is the answer, I wouldn't recommend master's because most companies in India don't need a master's degree, to the contrary if you believe your more of a practical person take whatever job you get in placements but always work towards getting into a product based company.

1h07bsv,Seeking advice on leaving my current company. When is the right time to move to another company?,"Hello guys. I know there is no simple answer to this question and almost always the answer will be dependant on the context and the unique situation of every person, anyways I decided to post it and collect some feedback from the community.

Some of my background. I've been working as a software engineer for the last 4.5 years. The company where I'm working right know is the same company where I began my journey as a software engineer. I started the internship there, then started as a junior developer, progressed to intermediate dev and now I have the ""tech lead"" title for the last year. Headcount of the company is \~400 people.

In my early days I remember I was super motivated, I was working long hours. Almost every day I was up and working extra time, before and after work. Never asked for additional payment for the work that I've done outside of the company hours. I felt immense satisfaction to learn and improve my skills over time. A lot of people came and left on the company's project (probz around 15 people). Currently we are a team of 4 people.

I see myself as a very proactive person. I almost always was taking on the more difficult and time consuming tasks and putting myself in the fire in order to speed up my professional development. So far I'm pretty happy with the progress I've made. The problem is that some of the colleagues took advantage of that. They feel content and okay with themselves by working on simple stuff, changing text, button color, responses, etc.

In the last couple of months I changed my approach and started assigning them more complex stuff. The actual work that needed to be done at best would be completed in 4 days. They took 3 weeks to complete it. In the end when there were problems with the quality of work, I was the one who was pinged by the project manager to fix it. I have a pretty holistic understanding of the product which we have and somehow I have involved in every line of code that was written. We all have our specific roles within the project and I can't let other people taking advantage of me doing their job.

At first, I was okay with this because I saw it as a learning opportunity. Gradually, I started to feel unhappy, overworked and the anxiety kicked in. In the morning I have trouble even looking at my laptop. I lost my spark and motivation. The environment is pulling me down, I don't have anyone from which I can learn. I'm pretty stagnant in my skills for the last 12 months. Some people are fine with being in the same place and I'm totally okay with that. For me, It's not the way. I want to have a 10X person working besides me, so I can learn from them.

I'm not scared to let go of all the project knowledge and my 'tech lead' title and start at ground zero. The monthly salary of $1,500 month is something I can left behind. I don't want it to be my poison drug which keeps me at the company. Maybe for some of you this seems pretty low, in my region it's quite a salary on the higher and.

At the end, it's very personal decision. Thank you for reading. Please let me know what do you think? What are your reasons for changing your company?",Extreme-Pie-3585,1,1.0,0,1732610387,2024-11-26 08:39:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1h07bsv/seeking_advice_on_leaving_my_current_company_when/,11,2024

1h046iz,Accepting better offer after starting current job only 2 weeks ago,"Hi folks!

I am facing a dilemma. 

I had an offer from Company A and they wanted me to start ASAP so I did. I had also just interviewed with Company B(big tech) but they needed more time to interview other candidates. 

By this point, I had already put in my notice with my old job, so I had to start with Company A. 

After starting with A, I followed up with B for their decision and informed them I have until the end of the month to make a choice between the two. At this point B doesnt know I have started with A. This is because they had indicated that upon knowing I started with A, they would likely pull my name out of consideration so as to not waste the recruiter's time. To this note, they had explicitly requested me to be transparent about accepting the other offer. I held back telling them because I still wanted a shot at B.

If I get offered the job at B, I would regret leaving company A after only a short week or two but Company B has a better offer and prospect, so I would probably switch.

Here's what I am worried about if I do get offered a job from B -

1. How much of a problem will B have with my lack of transparency?
2. How do I bring this up/approach it with the hiring manager when I will be offered the job?
3. Since this will show up in my background check, could B rescind my offer since I would have recently jumped ship from A, and they doubt my trustworthiness?
4. What should be my general course of action?


What are you thoughts on the situation? Any and all advice will be helpful!

1h03844,How do I get over getting fired?,"Hello everyone, in 2022 I decided to challenge myself by taking a job at a trading firm. I lasted one year there, learned a lot, but the job wasn’t the right fit for me. 60h weeks, flat structure, nightmare boss, and my personality wasn’t a fit (quiet). I wasn’t aware when I took the job as they didn’t state this, but the position was an “up or out” one. If you don’t move up to another role within 1-5 years or show progress towards that, they fire you.

Well, they fired me, and I explicitly asked if I was on a pip and my boss said no. I sensed it was coming due to being taken off projects/rotations and how hostile my boss had become towards me. I got a great new job about 3 months later, and love it. Great team, 40h weeks, manageable workload, and very positive feedback from my boss (8 months in now).

Every now and then, I have a sinking feeling in my stomach about how unstable life is. I learned a lot from getting fired, and make sure I am vocal, always go the extra mile, and finish work promptly and well. Even despite all this and having a health emergency fund, I still feel a great amount of anxiety or maybe trauma from being put in such a vulnerable position.

1h02p9r,Should I quit or just suck it up?,"I (23F) have been working my current job since I was 19. I work with children and youth at an urban church in Canada. In July, two new pastors started working at this church, one of whom has a lot of experience working with children. The first two months were really good, she seemed really down to earth and we got along really well! She had a lot of great advice and was my rock during a stressful week-long church day camp, and I felt coming out of that at the end of the summer that her and I were a really good duo. As far as I knew, our jobs didn’t actually overlap; she hadn’t been hired to work with the children and youth, that was still my job.

By early September things started getting weird. I had worked without a curriculum (by choice) for the past three years and managed to grow our Sunday school from three children to over 20, but suddenly she could not let go of the idea that I needed a curriculum. Like NEEDED a curriculum. And while it’s true that the first few weeks of Sunday school were a struggle, it was because I was doing it all by myself, not a lack of curriculum. I continued to make improvements to the Sunday School and would tell her my plans in an effort to reassure her that I was doing okay and keep her in the loop, but it’s like it made things worse. EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION we had, no matter what the original topic was, would always revert to what I was doing wrong. When I tried to put some space in between us, she’d push even harder. She me feel like I couldn’t do anything right. She was acting like she was my boss, which as far as I knew, she was not.

Well at an HR meeting (that I had requested) a week or so later I was blindsided by HR when they told me that this pastor WAS indeed my boss, that this decision had been made months ago and there were sorry that they “forgot” to tell me but if I didn’t like it, I could leave. They made it clear that there was no room for negotiation and by the end of the meeting I was in tears, and afterwards I went to my office and just cried. (This pastor came into my office, and just like every single other conversation we’d had for the past month, it quickly descended into the same old negativity she’d been giving me for weeks. Like read the fucking room.)

Another meeting was planned with us and our two HR reps, this time to discuss us working together and clear the air. For someone who prides herself on being a very emotionally aware person, I thought she’d be able to acknowledge what I wanted to say and we could move forward from it. Instead, any time I said anything remotely to my own defence she’d look at the two HR reps with this look of “can you believe this shit?” (which was humiliating enough on its own) or come at me with an extremely specific example of a thing I did or said ONCE as if to make my argument pointless. Again, I was in tears by the end of it. Speaking to the two HR reps privately, they recommended I write down what I wanted to say to her, which I did, and read it to her the next day at another short meeting. The gist of it was that I truly did want to work together, that I appreciated all of her knowledge and didn’t mean to hurt her feelings by pushing her away. I’d only reacted that way because I didn’t know that she was my boss and to me, her behaviour came off as very invasive and unasked for. (It’s worth mentioning that she thought I knew all along and was being insubordinate.) If she could just acknowledge that and express genuine sympathy/remorse, I was more than happy to put it to bed. 

Instead I was met with what could best be described as a no-holds-barred. She started bringing up other employees (it’s a small office, there are only five of us) and how much I annoy them and how much they don’t like me, about how I always interrupt her while she’s working (but God forbid she interrupt me), how I always butt in on conversations (and I’ll give her that, I do have that issue but I’ve been trying to be better), how often I have non-workplace-related conversations, blamed me for the lack of communication between us, how apparently I’m conducting myself around the children and parents inappropriately, how apparently I’m committing TIME THEFT (??), the list goes on. Talk about splitting hairs. She also made a comment about how if people who knew her saw how boring and lacklustre Sunday school was at her current church, she’d be laughed at. Ouch. It was clear by the time she finished that she just simply didn’t like me.

Even after that meeting she never apologized for how she treated me or any of the hurtful things she said and has instead just completely moved on like nothing happened, but I can’t just forgive and forget. I don't even enjoy working there anymore because of her, everything is so awkward and I feel like I’m being held to a different standard than our other colleagues. Part of me thinks maybe I’m the problem like she says, but them I remember that I’ve been working here for three years longer than she has, with three different pastors and five different lay staff (think secretaries or other non-religious employees) and have never had a single issue. I’m going back to school in January so I’d have an excuse to leave after Christmas. Should I suck it up and at least see out the end of my contract (it’s up in June), or get out of there?

TLDR: my new overbearing boss/supervisor has nothing good to say about my work. I’ve complained to HR and they’ve done nothing. I am miserable and no longer enjoy my job after having nothing but great experiences for three years.

A little over a year ago I got my real estate license but I’ve only sold one house. The market is very difficult. Before kids u worked in HR. I’m now considering going back to school to become an elementary teacher or nurse. I’m open to other suggestions as well. Teaching because of the similar schedule to my kids and being able to take most of the classes online. Nursing because it pays more and there a ton of different fields and types of nurses.

1h01ba8,Career Advice,"I’m 23f and just bought my own house, have a dog with medical issues and am engaged and planning a wedding. I only make $19.50/hr being a cashier at a dealership, and was denied a raise as it needs to be a year before you’re eligible for a raise (apparently??) even though I know the other cashier that works opposite of me makes more and does less, it’s infuriating, even though she’s been there longer, but still. With taxes and 401k (which I have at 4%) I only make like 27-28k/yr which is not enough. 

I asked to move to the accounting department to get experience there as I know accounting is profitable, although I’ve never had a job just in accounting.

I am a new hire, having just been released in October. In that time, I have made two “critical errors”, while my other 7 new hires have made 0 critical errors. Critical errors are we a significant aspect of a trip is incorrect, like the date, or someone asks for something on the phone or email that was missed that impacts a trip. 

My first error was a misclick, and my supervisor said i did everything right, but it was just an unfortunate situation. I confirmed the details with the booking person multiple times, but they didn’t catch my error. (Think like they said they wanted to travel on Thursday and I clicked wednesday). I kept saying wednesday to them, and they never corrected me. Supervisor said that they have to give me the error due to what the client had asked for initially, which i completely understand.

My second error occurred before I had even found out about my first. I had taken a booking via email, and completely missed the bottom half of the email booking a return flight home. This was an idiotic mistake, and I have no clue how i missed that. The supervisor on duty told me that these things happen and to not beat myself up from it and try to learn from it, but i don’t think he knew about my first error.

I am so afraid to touch any booking now… I am terrified i’m going to be fired or reprimanded and I’m worried they won’t think i’m a good fit for the job anymore. I try really really hard, but I had these two errors that cost the company money in just my first month working here. I touch so many reservations every day, and now i’m worried that i messed something else up a while ago and I don’t even have a chance to be more diligent. I am so anxious I feel like I can’t breathe.

1h00glp,"Advice Requested - Have the ""Difficult Conversation"", Suck It Up or Move On?","tldr: job responsiblities (that I enjoy doing!) are being steamrolled and revoked for no communicated reason and can't get clarity on role; discuss, suck it up, or leave?

Hi all. Hoping for some advice. Throwaway account for somewhat anonymity.

  
I have been at my current job for nearly 6 years. While stressful at times due to workload and a small team, it is a pretty chill, flexible job. I get along really well with my manager, however, my manager's boss is a different story... Let's call my manager's boss Sarah.

  
Sarah is fairly new to her role (in this position for about a year), but not the team. They were promoted when the person previously occupying the opposition chased a new opportunity. Obviously, there were some transitional speedbumps during this change for the whole team, but not as much as if someone brand new came in to fill that role. Despite the speedbumps, because Sarah was already on the team, she was already aware of everyone's roles or responsibilities, though now it is a question of whether or not she cares to respect them.

About 6 months before Sarah's promotion, I was also promoted and acquired new responsibilities (and pay!)--this was something I asked for after noticing a gap on our team and the person previously occupying Sarah's position was exceptionally supportive and acted as my mentor for this new part of my role. I was given the confidence to work directly with new clients, planning projects from the start and managing them throughout their lifecycle. However, after Sarah's predecessor, most of that has been taken away. 

I have been reduced down to just keep tracking of budgets for these projects with little-to-no client interaction, which was something I enjoyed. I've been cut out of meetings (literally not invited) to meetings I should be leading, I am steamrolled in meeting series I previously led to the point where I essentially say nothing the entire hour, and I am cut out of decision making that I previously assisted in.

Now, this isn't completely out of Sarah's nature as a person, and the rest of the team (who has observed these happenings). I have asked my manager multiple times for more clarity in my role (I don't want to have to keep asking if I am responsible for certain things in fear of getting yelled at for overstepping, or, conversely, dropping the ball). and if my responsibilities are being ""revoked"" because I am doing a poor job. My manager says this is not the case, and states that she also cannot get clarify from Sarah as to *anyone's* role on our team. She has advised me to just leave it and ""roll with the punches"", but that is absolutely frustrating. I have asked her advice if having a sit-down meeting with Sarah, her, and myself would be a good step in providing clarify, but my manager doesn't seem to think so.

  
I have previously tried communicating what I understood to be my responsibilities to Sarah, who is constantly complaining they are just one person and have so much to do, but it seems to fall on deaf ears.

**I am at a loss as to what to do. Do I go against my manager's advice and request a meeting to discuss? Do I just ""deal with it"" as my manager is suggesting? Do I deal with it and look for new opportunities, however rare, elsewhere? Something else? Hoping some wise Reddit folks can help me shovel some snow from my career pathway.

1gzzary,Company in Transition: How Much Leeway to Give,"The company I work for is doing extremely well--and has been doing extremely well for the past few years. There's been a lot of growth and big gains, and we're at the point where we need to make a lot of structural changes in order to accommodate the new level that we're at. It's resulting in a lot of chaos and a lot of burnout. It looks like the goal is to work on this transition over the next year, which I imagine means that the chaos and burnout will extend for the next year and a half. Based on the ideal job parameters that have been laid out for us, I'm essentially doing the work of 3.5 employees at the moment. We've recently hired one person, and I've talked to my manager about how I need this individual to take on some of my workload and then some. It looks like this person will be taking on some of that but will also be taking on pieces from others, which will put me at the workload of maybe 3 people. And the chaos doesn't help. Others aren't able to meet their deadlines, which means that I'm constantly moving around schedule and getting buzzed on Slack every 20 minutes with some new crisis I have to work through.

I have so many other positive feelings about this company. It's my dream job, and I worked so hard to get to the place I'm at. I feel like I have a lot of job security and that I have a lot of opportunity for career growth. I get to work remotely full-time. I get along really great with my manager. I like the actual work I do and the majority of the people I work with. The volume is just so overwhelming, and I'm tired of spending most of my evenings taking a break for dinner and then hopping back on. Or finding time on the weekends to work for most of the day. (And to still be drowning even with all that.) I'm getting conflicting information about whether we're actually going to hire enough people to get us to the ideal job parameters (which still has a higher volume than industry standard).

I work in a somewhat niche field so while jobs like this exist, the opportunities are somewhat limited. And it feels silly to look for something else in a potentially uncertain political climate (I'm in the U.S.) when I'm working for one of the most booming companies in my field. So my question is really directed at those who have gone through or left during a company transition. Were you glad you stuck it out? Were you glad to have left? Or are there any regrets either way?",PagesNNotes,2,1.0,1,1732582729,2024-11-26 00:58:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzzary/company_in_transition_how_much_leeway_to_give/,11,2024

1gzxb2n,Am I the 1/10 that should accept a counter offer?,"I know I know... You probably shouldn't accept a counter offer... Hear me out though.



I have a Computer Science degree, I enjoy working for the company I'm with. I've been there about 5 1/2 years. Started off in Technical Support for 2 years and progressed on to be an IT specialist. I enjoy the current job that I do, but I'm keen to progress my career to the next challenge. I always knew I wanted to head towards a Cloud Infrastructure role, so that's what I'm aiming for.



I was encouraged to apply for a new DevOps role internally as it would allow me to build upon my development style strengths and is very closely aligned with Cloud Infrastructure. I didn't get the role. The reasoning I was told is because they needed someone with development experience to hit the ground running and push forward some CI/CD projects with a fairly short deadline. Disappointing, but at least I had some direction I wanted to head towards. 



I requested a PDP that included working with the DevOps team once a week so I could get some experience with new technologies and hopefully be more prepared should the day come that they were expanding or I apply elsewhere. This went through just fine and now I am learning some of the newer technologies and applying them to my work in my role.



The usual budgeting and staffing requirement gathering that companies do, I figured I would wait until early 2025 before pushing for a direction internally, and seeing whether there was any progression planned. Especially as the company have been good in the past at providing opportunities to progress.



Wanting to tackle my possible future internal role from all angles I decided to humour a few recruiters on LinkedIn. I could get some Interview experience and hopefully some critcisms. I was turned down for 1 of the jobs and had some feedback that I wanted to apply to my next interview, just to make sure I was taking it in. The interview for this job didn't feel like it hit every mark but the feedback was positive nonetheless.



From my previous experience with LinkedIn IT roles they fall into 3 categories:

\-Requires 3 lifetimes worth of knowledge for a service desk job

\-Doesn't know what the job actually is or does

\-Is exactly what it says on the tin but my experience only covers about 30-40% of what the job requires



This particular job had somehow mixed options 2 and 3. In this way, it was unique because it would put off the more experienced of us by not stating really what it was supposed to be but also had quite steep requirements. I think because of this they were struggling to find an experienced candidate and were looking for someone to invest in.



Needless to say, I was offered the role. The role is for a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer with Security. Not 100% what I was after but so close that it still peaks my interest greatly. The progression potential is fantastic! Sadly though, despite going into these interviews knowing I would either be turned down or be unenthusiastic about the compensation for the roles, I had landed the role I've always wanted.



The offer pays significantly more, has a few benefits and comes with a brilliant training programme. I figured I would be a fool to turn down this offer so I accepted it and handed in my notice without warning. My manager is very happy for me and very supportive of the decision. Sad to see me go but understands.



My worry now falls onto counter-offers...



I have pondered on the new role for a while and whilst I'd be sad to leave my current company, I know that it's an outcome I'm happy with and I'm fully accepting of my decision. After all, it's for the greater good. 



Shortly after I handed my notice in the head of my team made me aware of a lot of structural changes happening across the entire department (it's about 120 people), with these changes there is requirements for new roles. This hasn't been fleshed out to its fullest but is a work in progress. 



I've read a lot online about counter-offers and whether you should take them and 9/10 it's a resounding; no. I just don't know whether I'm in the 1/10?



I'm not leaving for money

I'm not leaving because the company doesn't respect progression

I'm not leaving because of ill will towards the company

I'm leaving simply because this offer is great and right here right now



So, provided that my current company offered me all that the new role offers? More money, more training, a new role.



Should I consider it or just move on?",SilverSlide6479,2,0.75,8,1732577235,2024-11-25 23:27:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzxb2n/am_i_the_110_that_should_accept_a_counter_offer/,11,2024

1gzwvlr,Help my friend please??,"

Guys I really, really, really need your help for a close (F/24) turning 25 next year friend of mine please. 

So for background my old friend we will call Sarah was in a very abusive controlling relationship sadly from about 18/19 until just now so 24 so she has always worked in fast food it’s all she’s ever known. I know what you’re thinking what is this related to abusive relationship? Well before Covid she did go college (uk) and she did art and design and then did a complete u turn and did science she didn’t know what she really liked but she was trying new things, but Covid started and she was at home all day with him and got comfortable etc and then when she went back to work he didn’t like the idea of that so he would limit it, basically become she was in fast food it was more easy for him to control so she was basically limited to that job, and when she wanted another job he would push her to not leave well all I can say is she saw the light realising the abuse and everything was wrong after me telling her for years I mean the guy would come into work and watch her for hours just to make sure she wouldn’t talk to any other guys… but now reality as hit her sadly shes still in fast food and she doesn’t really have many qualifications and she lives back at home with her parents and she can’t drive and as much as im trying to help her and im actually really struggling because its really hard out there i can only see jobs in care homes which she can of wants to not go into since she would prefer office. She is applying and trying her best and I feel really bad for her and I am just wondering what can I do to help? And what would you do if you were her in this situation??? Would having her driving license help her??? Because she would like to try work at a letting agency and building herself up from the ladder there but she needs a license? Or should she just get any job? I don’t really know how to help since I’ve never been through this but I really want to because she keeps telling me she doesn’t have time it’s too late now and I keep saying she can still have a life she loves but then I feel how can I say that if all I can do is help with her cv? Her family aren’t very helpful either and feel didn’t help with the abusive situation. Thank you so much if anyone replies.

1gzwdyd,Russel Group to OU - thoughts?,"Hi all.

I am in a bit of a complicated position so I'll try and explain it as briefly as possible.
I'm 21 and I used to work at a college as a Teaching Assistant and at the same time would do the odd TV running job on a soap opera. At the time I wasn't in a good headspace and felt like I needed something new, so I dropped the TA job and (with some additional pressure from my parents who don't like the idea of freelancing) went to the University Of Liverpool to do a degree in English hoping to open some doors, not considering the ones it would close off; the running. This was in September, I'm in my first year.

Don't get me wrong - I still want a degree. I just worry that the the foot I got in the door in the film industry is going to slip out. I'm thinking about doing the rest of my degree after getting the level 4 this year at the OU.

How flexible do you find it as current students? I read on the site that you've got a deadline of 16 years to finish so I am assuming that it would go well with my slightly more erratic career choice, completing this at my own pace.

I'm hoping some of you can give me some advice, especially those with mad careers or busy lives with kids.

1gzuy3c,What are Employers looking for in an Employee these days? ,"**Why for the love of god is it so difficult to get a job these days. Yet when I deal with companies and their employees it seems like everybody's checked out.  I can say I'm the easiest employee you'll ever deal with. I'm reliable, punctual.  Have great communication skills. Meaning I actively listen and respond. I'm articulate.  I always have a positive attitude. I smile. I'm adaptable and open to change. I ask co-workers, ""Hey, need help with anything."" I have self awareness and empathy when needed. I'm always learning something new and  share my knowledge with everyone.  I try to inspire those I'm around and show respect. I come in with a ""We got this"" attitude. I do the job that is required of me with enthusiasm and pride. I try to give 100% and do quality work. I'm not afraid to ask for help but also can be resourceful and research and figure it out on my own. Meaning I try not to be a pain in the arse.  So what is it that employers are looking for when they are getting resumes.  Should I say all these things in a cover letter. What is the answer to get the interview to show them we have these attributes.**

1gzu1ug,Need Career Advice: Stuck Between Two Teams,"Hi all, I’m a project manager in a tough spot. This year, I’ve been split between two teams:

1. A digital/client-focused team handling event-based projects like apps, websites, videos, banners, booth renderings/layouts, and graphical work. I’ve been with this team for 3 years.
2. A software development team in the data insights division, where I’ve been acting as a scrum master. This team seems to be growing and taking on more work.

Both teams seem to really want me to stay next year, but I have to pick one as the split is ending. I enjoy the work and people on both teams. The software side seems to have more growth potential, as the company is refocusing on it, and they use more widely known tools like Jira and Confluence. On the other hand, the digital side uses a PMS I’ve only encountered here, but I’ve been with them longer and have built great relationships.

Both teams have seen redundancies this year, so neither feels completely secure. I’m really torn and unsure what to do. Any advice? I have about a week to decide.

1gztyjr,No longer sure where to go with my career,"Hello Career Advice!

Using a throw away here.

Just looking for a bit of general advice / guidance. i'm going to post this in a few other subreddits as well so please shout out if you think there's a better place.

This is going to sound a little bit ridiculous but I feel like I've progressed too quickly and don't know where to go from here without major imposter syndrome which I already get in the role i'm in now!

30 years old, 42k salary in the UK

After/ during the pandemic I completely changed career from a sales based role into application support and essentially started from scratch again earning £18k.

In the space of 4 years, i some how jumped from software application support to managing a team of 10 other application support engineers (1.5 years doing pure application support before being promoted into the managerial role for another  1.5 years), and then jumped to another role at a different company which i've been in for nearly a year and a half where i'm purely managerial (although in a tech industry still, more security focussed).

I guess my dilemma is where do I go from here?

With only 3 years of actual tech experience (which was mostly dedicated software support), I'm very concious that this will fade quickly and i'll purely become a 'middle manager'.

There's no scope to be hands on in my current role so i'm trying to gain skills elsewhere (primarily in audits/ ISO27001) but looking for advice on what other skills I should be targetting to ensure I progress my career moving forwards.

Should I pivot back to be more hands on? What sort of opportunities are there for purely managerial people in IT?

Any advice or shared experiencss would be much appreciated!

1gztrz2,Aerospace Engineering Career Advice For A 14 Year Old,"Career Advice

I’m 14 and dream of becoming an aerospace engineer when I’m older. Where should I start now to set myself up for success in the future?

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been absolutely obsessed with space and flight. From rockets to airplanes, if it flies, I want to know everything about it. I love the idea of working in a STEM career, especially in aerospace, where I can apply my skills to build something amazing. I’m super passionate about physics, engineering, and maths, and I’d love some advice on how to get started now so I can achieve this goal in the long term. Here’s the plan I’ve come up with so far:
	1.	Learn as much as I can about aerospace – I’m already watching videos about space exploration, reading articles about engineering concepts, and even playing games like Kerbal Space Program to understand basic orbital mechanics.
	2.	Build my skills – I’m using CAD software to design models and exploring 3D printing as a way to prototype. I’m also diving into subjects like physics and maths, since I know they’re essential.
	3.	Get involved in projects – I’m looking for opportunities to work on STEM-related competitions or engineering challenges (I’ve already done First Lego League and F1 in Schools).
	4.	Network with others – I’ll reach out to local universities, attend space-related events, or maybe join online communities about aerospace.
	5.	Work hard at school – I’m aiming for top grades in GCSEs and A-levels, focusing on physics, maths, and engineering-related subjects. My ultimate goal is to apply to a top university or even get a scholarship abroad.
	6.	Internships and work experience – Once I’m old enough, I’ll look for internships or summer programs in aerospace companies or engineering labs.

I know the path is going to be tough, but I’m ready to put in the work. For now, I’m just figuring out if there’s anything else I should be doing to prepare. What would you recommend for someone my age who’s serious about becoming an aerospace engineer?",Positive-Aside-6132,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1732568486,2024-11-25 21:01:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gztrz2/aerospace_engineering_career_advice_for_a_14_year/,11,2024
1gztc2e,Failing at a project due to coworkers,"I was recently hired for a role that I have experience in and otherwise do well in. However, once hired I was informed they have an ongoing project that they want me to participate in. As part of my role, I have to approve all parts of the project as they're completed. The project has been ongoing for about 4 months before I was hired and needs to be completed in a week.

Here's the problem: within my role, I have completed every task/approval. However, the project is about 30-40% complete. My coworkers are not completing their sections, so I do not have anything to review. I have spoken to the coworkers on a daily basis and they tell me they are working on it, it's just difficult. I made a guide, essentially, telling everyone involved what steps were left, who each step was for, etc. They are making almost no progress. They have a combined 400ish steps to complete and finish maybe 1-3 per day, if any. I can't seem to do anything to make them work faster.

I brought this to my manager and they asked me if I had too much work to complete my tasks. I said no, as I just explained that the issue is *everyone else* not doing their tasks, which my tasks rely on being completed. I don't know what to do, I am the person responsible for this project apparently and everyone else on the team is causing me to fail. I am not the manager of these people either, so I don't have any authority over them. I am going to be held responsible and potentially fired because other people won't do their work that was supposed to be completed before I was even hired. I don't know how to defend myself either because like I said, when I brought this up my manager just asked why *I* hadn't completed everything. How can I be any clearer?

1gzsvwc,Am I valuing the money too much?,"I work in implementation - post-sales work with enterprise customers in my domain. Customers are big and complex, so we only get one or two. I was thrown onto a second one this Spring almost 2 years into an active implementation with no viable product. I ramped up as quickly as possible, and we trudged through 70 hour weeks to get the customer in the right direction, but they termed eventually.

My name is very, very low on the blame list but I know that in the back of their heads, my boss and their boss both still have that term etched into their mind when my name comes up. I've got an offer from a new opportunity where the pay raise would be 25% (currently I am at mid-six figures) with an options package. Fully remote just like my current gig. Unlimited PTO in both situations. It's at an established startup that is booming, but from every interview it's been described as chaos. I am okay with chaos, and I understand they have to present the environment truthfully as to not have people BS their way into the position.

I don't reasonably think I could go to my manager and ask them to match the pay raise, so my question is if I am valuing the money too much? Are there other elements that I should consider?

1gzspdh,Annual Review and Raise?,"Hi there!

I need some advice in terms of asking for a salary increase this year.  Our annual reviews are typically in the first two weeks of December here, and I want to be prepared.

I work in architecture, and have been in the field since 2017.  I am highly qualified for my job, and have been told that I am “excellent” at it by my direct manager on multiple occasions.  I meet all deadlines, and have been told that all of the work that I produce is “superb”.  I brought a spreadsheet system in with me that I have been evolving over my career that has kept us all sane and organized on a very difficult project.

I started at this firm last February, and was hired because of my experience with complicated projects and my organizational skills.  What I didn’t realize was how complicated this project that I would be assigned to would actually be.

I’ve been on this job for pretty much the whole time I have worked at this new firm.  It’s a mess.  The schedule has been insane (less than 1/10 of the usual amount of time to complete the drawings and documents for construction). 

On top of that, the client is horrible.  And that’s putting it lightly.  They are disorganized and unresponsive, and frequently make large-scale, last-minute changes.  They’re demanding, inconsiderate of our time, and have even been straight-up abusive.  One time, we were berated for 25 minutes straight and called unprofessional over a call with such disgust and vitriol that I actually started to cry and had to turn my camera off.  Apparently my limit for being actually screamed at by a client is about 20 minutes.  But they are very powerful, and we are not allowed to say no.

All that being said, I need a raise.  I like my job, and I like the people that I work with.  But, if I’m being honest, I need some incentive to keep me from walking out the next time this client treats us like actual dirt.  Because I could easily make just as much, if not more, at another firm.  And we have at least two more years with them in this project, if it goes well, and they stop making changes.  I’m also aware that I’ve made myself integral enough to this project that it would be a problem if I quit, and would cause serious issues for my direct manager.

I’m payed fairly well for my years of experience.  Not great, especially considering how expensive our health insurance is, and the cost of living in the area we live in.

I have looked up the inflation calculator for this year, and it’s at 3.1%.  What would be a good raise to ask for in a situation like this?  Would 6% be too high?  I know this boss counters whatever you propose.

My old firm didn’t do negotiations like this, so this is new territory for me!  Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!!!

1gzs4va,Job Comparison - Should I leave my current job?,"I was offered a good role this past Friday, and I'm trying to think through what I should do. I'd really appreciate some unbiased input here! The in-office requirement for Option B would separate me from my family a few days each month. My partner has a job lined up for just under a year from now that has a higher salary than either of these positions, but will not be earning any income until then.

Option A (Current Position):

* $155,000/year
* Junior director title
* Annual raises are usually 3% and promotions are capped at 10%
   * I was recently promoted and don't see that happening again for >2 years
* I was given a fully remote exception since I live out of state, although my team recently started going in-office once a week
* 4 direct reports that are all individual contributors
* No annual bonus
* 7% 401k match
* 36 days off per year (PTO + holidays)
* Insurance is \~$4300/yr
* Good relationship with my manager
* Generally comfortable in my role
* Path to serious upward mobility (outside of nominal title bumps) is unclear

Option B:

* $175,000/year
* Senior manager title
* Unsure what annual raises usually are
* Required to be in-office three consecutive days each month
   * The company indicated they would be willing to pay for flights, hotel, and food for in-office days.
   * I've been told that this requirement will lessen over time to requiring coming in just a few times a year, but I do not have a guarantee or a firm date for this. The reason they gave me for the in-office days makes sense to me and seems purposeful given a major project I'd be working on; the reason also does go away after a milestone that will likely be reached in summer 2025.
* 4 direct reports that are all individual contributors
* 8% annual bonus
* 5% 401k match, with a 3 year vesting cliff
* 30 days off per year (PTO + holidays)
* Insurance is \~$2500/yr
* Will be more stressful short-term due to a large project that wraps up in March 2025, but this project would also put a ""gold star"" on my resume.
* Scope of the portfolio my team covers would be larger, which is a positive (growth) and but could also turn into a negative (stress).
* I talked to one of my former colleagues from my current company who now works in this department (not on the team I'd be managing), and he seems to like it here more.",ProjectLow5371,1,1.0,1,1732564574,2024-11-25 19:56:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzs4va/job_comparison_should_i_leave_my_current_job/,11,2024

1gzre6l,"Fired twice in a year because of poor performance, how do i stop feeling like a failure?","I’m 20 (F), and I’ve been fired from two jobs in the same year, both because of poor performance. On top of that, I’m still stuck in my first year of college, even though it’s been 3 years since I started. It feels like I can’t get anything right, and I don’t know what to do anymore.

I’ve struggled with social anxiety and depression since I was 12, and I think they play a big role in why I’m not able to meet expectations at work. I find it hard to communicate, stay motivated, or even focus on tasks sometimes. I really try to do my best, but I keep falling short, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m just slow or not good enough for any job.  

Getting fired twice feels like a sign that there’s something wrong with me. I’ve been trying to work on myself. I see a psychologist and psychiatrist, I’ve tried treatments, and I’ve been pushing myself to do things that scare me. But no matter how much I try, it feels like I’m stuck in this loop of failing.  

I feel so ashamed and lost. I know I’m only 20, but it feels like I’ve already ruined my chances of figuring life out. Has anyone else been through something like this?

1gzrb7q,How Do You Handle a Job with No Communication or Direction? Look for a new job?,"I’ve been in my current role for 7 months now, and I find it really concerning that I haven’t spoken to my manager even once. My supervisor is slightly more responsive, but we’ve only ever communicated through quick chats if I need help with something. Occasionally, I get messages saying we’ll do a 1:1, but those never actually happen.

On top of that, it can take days (if at all) to get a response or even a simple confirmation for something I’ve sent over. The lack of communication is overwhelming and honestly pretty disappointing.

When I took this role, I was sold on the promise of moving up quickly. It’s a lower-level position than what I’m used to, so I took it with the understanding that it would lead to growth. But now it’s starting to feel like that was just a way to get me in the door.

I hate the idea of looking for another job so soon, but this is not the type of environment I envisioned. When I accepted this role, I asked plenty of questions and genuinely thought it would be a good fit. Unfortunately, it hasn’t turned out that way.

What’s even more frustrating is that I left my last job after over a year for the exact same reason—no communication or direction, it's like my manager didn't exist. Now I’m back in the same situation, feeling forgotten and unseen. I can’t even get a simple status check on how I’m doing.

1gzqoz4,Need Advice on Negotiating Pay as a Co-op/Intern (USA),"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on negotiating pay as a co-op or intern in the U.S.

For some background: I recently started working at a top 10 manufacturing company in the U.S. This is my fourth co-op/internship, and I previously completed three semesters (about a year) at another large manufacturing company. I have solid experience in the field, but I left my previous position because it required too much travel, which wasn’t manageable while taking classes.

Here’s the issue: I just found out that I’m the lowest-paid intern in my department, making roughly half of what other interns in the same role (even new hires) are earning. I’m not sure why there’s such a significant pay gap.

	•	It’s probably not related to education: I’m pursuing two engineering degrees (Mechanical and Robotics) and plan to pursue a master’s in Data Science. My GPA is 3.8.

•	It’s likely not work ethic either: I’m consistently the only intern asked to stay late to work on projects, which I’m happy to do because I genuinely enjoy my job.

The pay, however, is so low that I’m struggling to cover rent and basic expenses. I can’t even afford to go out for food anymore. I have a performance review coming up, and I see this as an opportunity to negotiate my pay if they want me to return. I’d love any tips for how to approach this conversation effectively.

I’m also actively searching for higher-paying internships as a backup in case the negotiations fall through.

Thanks in advance for your advice!",Serious-Basket4715,1,1.0,0,1732561081,2024-11-25 18:58:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzqoz4/need_advice_on_negotiating_pay_as_a_coopintern_usa/,11,2024
1gzqih8,Career Change on The Cusp of 60 w/ 2 Decades of Retail Experience,"I've seen some posts on this sub about people with lots of experience in retail so I thought this might be a good place to ask. I'm making this post on behalf of my mom who is in her late 50's, who recently confessed to me that she's looking to get a second job. She's been working retail my entire life, and this would simply just be another retail or even food service position on top of her current position at Walmart. I know she hates it, but I also know some of our family back in El Salvador is relying on her, and she isn't awfully close to being able to retire either.   
Now that the groundwork is laid, I wanna ask if it is legitimately too late for her to get an associates or something of the like and to find a job that pays more than roughly 20 an hour? This isn't something she's really considered, I think school is an intimidating idea to her, but I think it would be the best bet for her if feasible. If she was to go back to school, would it really be feasible to find a position with a somewhat decent salary, or is her age going to prohibit her? Is that gonna be an immense road block for employers, or would this be a worthwhile investment for her to make? A community college in our county offers a lot of degrees that could lead to 60k+ salary positions(Healthcare/Health Science), which would likely be enough of a growth to satisfy the growing need for 2 jobs. Many certifications that it offers seemingly only lead to jobs similar to her current pay. Any helpful input on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

1gzqi21,How would you approach this situation? Unemployed for 2 years but…,"How would you approach this situation? Unemployed almost 2 years but…


I’m thinking about looking for a new role after nearly 2 years of being out of the workforce. However during the last 2 years I’ve been working on my 4 year old online startup full time with a cofounder. My last roles was as a senior front end engineer for a large corp and a full stack engineer in fintech. 10YOE

The startup has become fairly successful with a projected $600k revenue this financial year with 85% profit margins and 50/50 equity split with cofounder and no employees. 

My role in this startup was technical but eventually consisted of doing everything as you would with a bootstrapped startup. I built the entire platform, built and manage the infrastructure, did the ux/ui, worked on seo where now we get 200k clicks/month from google, manage all the 3rd party service we use from customer support to crm to email marketing, analytics, manage financials and accounting, recruiting contractors and project management, plus more. 

The only issue is this startup is in the adult space (completely legal in its incorporated country). How would one approach putting something like this in their resume if at all? How would you approach talking about it in interviews or would you not bring it up?

And yes I can easily continue working on the platform but right now I am worried about my skills becoming stagnant and while I’ve gained expert level knowledge in the industry I feel like it’s a waste and not something I think transfers well and something I’m not interested in long term. The platform can run itself with very minimal work if we wanted.

1gzqgey,do I change jobs or try and save my current?,"Hey all,

Going to reddit because my mom told me to just get babies and settle lol. (ignore this trauma)

I (26f) have a job that for alot of people might sound like a dream job. I have decent pay, good flexibility and sometimes travel for work. I had a manager which whom I had a good relationship and he offered me new chances all the time. He quit his job sadly about 1 year ago and in return I got a manager that semi took my chances away. Altho she is still beter then the onces from my previeus jobs, she does tempt to push me in a corner. Also important, government job. 

I had 2 jobs before this one that were pretty bad and I had to quit, compared to those my current job is heaven. (first was really low pay but great learning experience, stuck 2 years. Second downbad toxic and people were crying behind there office, 1year).

To come back to feeling pushed in a corner. I have some painting experience but don't really like doing it. I took my current job with my previous manager as project lead under the promise that I sometimes paint but get to get interesting projects in trade. This seemed fine to me and I did get those nice projects that filled most of my time. With my now manager the opisite is happening. They are pushing painting jobs on me while never giving any challenges and questioning my knowledge. My days are filled with tasks that don't challenge or motivate me at all. 

Before I was a project lead (or honestly a painter at this point) I was an interior architect. Something I loved doing and now slowly start to miss. I most likely will get an offer next week from a company that will offer more pay but less flexible hours. It will be back in private instead of a government job which will spice things up. (offer as interior architect) 

I have seen that someone I semi know that used to be a jobhopper now works at this firm for the longest ever, I got a good vibe from the interview as well. 

My current job is so flexible it feels like a golden cage to change. One of the biggest pros is that it allows me to have a side bussiness. Something I also really love but don't want to do full-time as of now. I don't really know what to do. I'm really scared to roll the dice again and end up in a toxic place again. So I'm really scared and clueless. 

My boyfriend and friend I told are also on some fence. They see that my current job is the best one yet and it's stable but they also see that I hit some dead end as of now. 

Since I'm about to hit the 2 year mark on my now job im also scared that I'm going into some jobhop cycle  for some reason and I can't hold a job or something and have to look deeper. I don't want to regret leaving and being back at square one, but I'm also aware that that's just one of those risks you have to take. 

My father had a similar path and then also stuck to a government job, my mom said it made him happy but I don't really believe it and fear the same faith.

1gzqa7e,Seeking Advice - Got an initial interview for a good opportunity after accepting another offer,"
Hi everyone, I apologize if this is a repetitive question, but I’m trying to navigate this situation without screwing myself once in the long run and would appreciate any advice.  

I got laid off earlier this year and have been on UI for a while now.  I recently accepted an offer for a Data Entry position (I was formerly a Data Analyst) to get back on my feet.  This position came with a pretty significant pay and benefits cut from my previous job, but I was worried about having a large gap on my resume, and need the health insurance .  This position starts next week.

I continued to apply after accepting the offer, and got an email today to schedule an initial 60 minute interview for a Data Analyst position with a large company.  The pay is almost double, and it would really help my career progression.  However, they are asking me to give them my availability for next week (when I’m starting my new job) and I’m not sure what my training/onboarding schedule looks like yet.

I don’t want to withdraw my application from this new opportunity since it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for, but I also know an initial interview is far from a guarantee that I’ll get an offer. 

Any advice would be much appreciated!  TYIA

1gzpunc,Seeking advice on negotiating a promotion to a full time position,"NY, USA

I (30F) have been really hustling these past few years to get where I am and I am very proud of the progress I’ve made in my career, but now my hard work is paying off and I don’t know how best to move forward. I have a BFA in theatre (lol), but after years of working as a performance artist and supplementing my income with restaurant jobs, I realized that path wasn’t sustainable. I wanted stability, better pay, and benefits.

So, I taught myself graphic design and started building up a client base. Over time, I’ve worked on projects across all kinds of industries— building websites for various verticals from medical and aesthetics businesses to B2B clients, plus designing beer labels and book covers.

I leveraged my graphic design skills to land a job as a Content Manager for a successful international business that focuses on coaching sales techniques and career development for public speakers. It started as a part-time gig at $25 an hour, averaging 22 hours a week, though some weeks have stretched to almost 60 hours (not including travel time to other cities). The hours are flexible, 80% of the work can be done remotely, and the office is within walking distance of my home. The job does require significant travel quarterly, and may even involve travel out of state and potentially out of the country. 

The team is mostly international, with members in Canada and the UK. My boss and I are one of 5 emoloyees based in the US, and we live in a small town of about 5,000 people, and where we live is definitely a high cost of living area. My boss is a recent transplant to the town (hence how I stumbled upon the position), and I have lived here for several years. Because of this, I’ve taken on some in-person assistant tasks, as their PA isn’t local.

Recently, I was offered the chance to transition to full-time, which would include a salary, health insurance, a 401(k) matching, and other benefits—all things I’ve never had before. While I’m tempted to accept, I’m hesitant because I don’t know how much more work it will add or what salary to ask for. I was initially thinking of asking $75k, but after talking to others, I’m considering $105k, but that feels like an absurdly massive jump. I do have a tendency to under value my work, which I know is pretty vital to the company now, so I feel like I need an outside perspective here. As someone who has been on the hiring side in this town, I know for a fact that the candidate pool in my area isn’t exactly bursting with people who are both qualified and seeking employment. I feel confident that my position is secure no matter how I respond to their offer.

On top of that, I just passed my real estate salesperson exam! I don’t know how much energy I want to put into that career path. I got the license to act as the agent for my fiancé with small real estate investments, but I also know there’s serious money to be made in real estate if you hustle. The question is whether I’ll have the bandwidth to do it all, and I need to find a broker who understands my position and commitments. 

So here’s where I’m stuck: My five year goal has been to make it to a six figure annual income, but I also value a healthy work-life balance and don’t want to be burnt out all the time. My design work brings me so much joy and pride, and I really don’t want to give it up. My boss has been incredibly supportive of both my design business and me pursing my real estate license, which is lovely. It’s a super healthy work environment. But if I take this full-time position, what should I ask for salary-wise so that I’m not undervaluing myself or over extending myself? And how do I figure out where to put my energy without sacrificing my mental health?

For as long as I can remember, my life goal was always to become a veterinarian. I recently started working as a veterinary assistant in small animal emergency/critical care and while I love the job and what I do, it has also shown me more and more that vet med is not really where I want to be long term anymore. I have so much respect for every assistant/technician/doctor/etc. that I work with, but I just cannot picture myself sticking around much longer.

I have a bachelors degree in animal science as well as a certificate in equine science, with several years experience working as a kennel and veterinary assistant. My favorite part of my job is running diagnostics, obtaining samples, analyzing results, that type of stuff. In my search for other careers this might be useful for, I’m always most intrigued with research. I’ve learned the next step for this would be pursuing a masters degree - but my undergraduate GPA is less than a 3.0 and I graduated very recently in spring of 2024.

I guess my question here is has anyone else been in my shoes that can offer me any next steps I should be taking here? Financially, I would prefer to gain some experience in the research field rather than retake classes in order to get my GPA up, as I know some masters programs will accept work experience as a redeeming factor for GPA.

I've decided that I've done enough putting out fires and am ready to hand it off to whoever they hire after me but I also realized IT feels like a little less work then programming so I would like to transition into the IT field. Currently I have an associates in comp sci and a lot of experience working data analysis and building small scale erp systems then linking them through custom api's to third party systems. Example, I add a file uploader to a website and parse those files and send the data to a SQL db hosted by a cloud server then I scrub the data and port it into a new system.

I have some general IT knowledge about servers and networks as well as some maintence experience. I've also dabbled with camera systems like LTS and pretty much the entire Microsoft suite, however I could not be a professional admin for a Microsoft environment but I can get a lot done. I'm pretty comfortable building whatever with power apps or power bi as well as porting in data from external sources like sql servers. While I know this isn't a massive amount of experience particular to any IT field I am also pursing my net+ and sec+ to increase my knowledge.

I was fired for doing a small sliver of what other employees do. No employees ever get fired. It is very rare. I was a DSP. I knew of abuse and extremely illegal things that were happening, and with reports, nothing was happening, especially without a lengthy investigation were staff was still allowed at these houses. I personally miss 2 days & 5 hours within 2 weeks, but without missing work for over 6 months and working 100's of overtime hours. I was, no ego, one of the very very very very few that were doing there job at ALL other than showing up to sit on a couch. I didn't have a car for a couple weeks because it wasn't safe to put clients in. I DID have Ubers. But the client wanted me to have my car. Then, 1 day my old neck injury causes such a bad flair up, it was VERY unsafe to drive anyone around. The finial day, I only asked for 5 hours to be covered. Mind you- I only missed 8 hours from the other 2 days because they were only 4 hours each. I asked because I was sweating, freezing, hot, gagging, dry heaving, and couldn't move without excruciating pain in my stomach because of a new medication my doctor prescribed me the day before. I was fired for missing work & not having my car. BUT I know of a staff member that didn't have a car for year and another one that didn't have one all last year or most of this year, AND I only didn't work the -13 hours-. People miss shifts alllll the time. And I am the only one fired out of all of the staff -period-. I haven't heard of anyone getting fired for a while. But they fired me. Didn't even warn me. Nothing. Pretended to be understanding and willing to work things out to cover me. Dragged me on for 4 days taking my shifts promising me 15 hours of PTO, losing 36 hours, being told I wasn't losing my job, to be fired when they wanted to return to work on their $80,000 salary.

Help me make sense of this.

1gznfhn,Is my supervisor unhelpful or am I taking the wrong approach?,"Hello. I'm new to IT and struggling with my job. I'm not sure if I'm expecting too much from my supervisor or if he's expecting too much from me.

I started an IT helpdesk job about 6 months ago with absolutely no experience and no related education. The job listing showed only needing a high school diploma and I was 100% honest in the interview about my lack of experience. Coming into this position, I expected to have at least some mentorship; someone I could ask questions to when I get stuck at the very least.

I have found that my supervisor is entirely unhelpful when I don't know what I'm doing. If I ask him a question he usually responds with ""Well you're a specialist. You're kind of expected to be self-sufficient. Figure it out on your own."" or he gives a completely unhelpful answer like ""That's not how that system works."" On the other hand if I don't ask him for assistance and I mess something up he gets annoyed and says ""You should have asked me if you weren't sure.""

It has gotten to the point where if I don't know how to resolve an issue I kind of just lock up and try to kill time hoping the problem will just magically go away on its own (which is exactly what I'm doing as I type this up). I feel like I'm not expanding my skills and that I am only an irritation to my supervisor. I absolutely dread my job and lose sleep over it any time I know I have to deal with my supervisor again. As this is my first IT job I'm not sure if I hate IT or just hate my current job.

Some additional context: I work a semi-remote job for a company of \~350 people that spreads all across a rural state. My supervisor and I are the only two IT people, so its not like I can get assistance from anyone else. It seems like my supervisor is trying to get out of IT and have me replace him so that he can transition to a different position in the company. I have heard from multiple people when I am assisting them that they are so happy to have me helping them rather than my supervisor, so I know that I'm not the only one who doesn't enjoy interacting with him.

I have talked to my supervisor a few times about how I feel like I can't ask him questions but nothing really seems to change. At this point I'm not sure what to do. Was it silly to expect to have someone mentoring me in an entry-level position? Should I be able to learn everything on my own with no prior experience or education?",SyrupSimilar1529,1,1.0,3,1732553446,2024-11-25 16:50:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gznfhn/is_my_supervisor_unhelpful_or_am_i_taking_the/,11,2024
1gzndcd,Lawyer who hates their job needs advice regarding career change ,"When I graduated high school in 2014 my teachers and boomer relatives warned us graduates about getting a “useless” media/communications degree and told us to chose a proper degree instead (something in the classic fields like law, medicine, engineering) if we didn’t want to end up jobless. 
I have always been more on the creative side, I always enjoyed literature, drawing, photography and editing videos. 
However because of all the fear mongering that took place I was too scared to pursue something more creative and decided to go to law school instead. In hindsight, it’s the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. While I law school, I was too scared to drop out and pick something that was more suitable for me, because I didn’t want to disappoint my parents who have subsidised my education. I also felt like it was too late for me to switch career paths and was overall too scared to start over. So I stuck with law and forced myself to take my bar exam. 

It has come to the point though where it’s really obvious that I’m not cut out for law. I just don’t enjoy it and I’m miserable working in that field. It feels horrible having to suppress my creativity and pretend to be someone I’m not. Nothing in the legal field interests me. 

I am thinking of switching career paths but without going back to uni again since completing my law degree already took me so long. I wish I could do journalism/reporting or PR work instead but I feel like no one would hire me since I come from law which is completely different. 
Does anyone have any advice for me on how to venture into other career fields such as marketing, journalism, pr, communications without having to go back to uni? What advice would you give me that could help me find a more fulfilling/creative career path?

During my intern period I learnt the Computer Architecture and System Verilog language and UVM. I also gone through AMBA protocols and created the  UVM based testbench for those.

Now 11 months of intern period is completed but they not converted me for the Full time and asking me to wait for some months and they said that once I get the project then they convert to Full time role.

Since 3 months extra intern period is so completed so what I can do now whether to stay in the company due to domain satisfaction irrespective of salary or moving out and searching for new jobs ?

1gzmoi8,on the verge of being fired after only 2 months - need advice,"hi! I was hired back in september for a ""freelance"" position with a company overseas - I'm technically a freelancer since I'm not a resident of the country the company's in, but I'm paid monthly + have all the attributions of a regular employee with a significant salary bump to compensate.

I went through their onboarding programme for about 2 weeks after my first day and it seemed to be smooth sailing up until early October. they assigned me to a specific project that, put simply, was terribly managed - the people who I was directly reporting to were offline due to holidays specific to their country of residence, the briefing changed about 2 times in the span of weeks, it was simply awful. it was supposed to be delivered within 2 weeks and it has not been finished yet (I have since then been assigned to a different task). 

a couple days after they assigned this project to somebody else I was called in by the head PM for a chat. they were told by the director of our department to give me a few pointers since he and my supervisors weren't happy with my deliverables. it was stuff like being more attentive to feedback, communicating more effectively, etc - needless to say I wasn't happy about this call, since it felt like they were hoping to push the blame of a failed project to me. regardless, I voiced what happened in that project and accepted the feedback. I've been working on it for the past 2 weeks + sending detailed logs of everything I do, asking questions, doing my very best to showcase I'm trying to do better. 

now, out of the blue, I have a 1:1 with the director (the one who initially voiced the negative feedback) scheduled for next Monday. no explaination and no specific topic - I know where this is going. 

I don't know what to do for now. I've done everything in my power to try and keep this job, but it feels like I'm set up to fail. it's been giving me extreme anxiety ever since I've had the initial talk about my performance - I've never had a negative feedback session like this, let alone been fired. it's been keeping me up at night, I've had skin allergies due to stress and anxiety. I've been considering just outright quitting before this meeting is even up because I can't take another week of not knowing what to do or what I'm doing wrong. any advice would be greatly appreciated. <3

1gzlvbk,Technology Consulting vs. Software Development,"Hi,

I’m a senior majoring in IST (Information Sciences and Technology), and I recently received two offers:

Deloitte: GPS Business Technology Analyst.
PNC: Technology development program.

Here’s my dilemma:

I’m not sure what I want to do long-term, and I’m also unsure if consulting is the right fit for me. I’ve heard the work-life balance in consulting can be rough, and I’m more introverted, which makes me wonder if I’d feel drained by the fast-paced environment. I also always thought I wanted to go into a development role more than consulting and PNC would allow me to do that but I honestly don’t know if development is what I actually want to do since I have no experience to know. 

PNC’s rotational program appeals to me because it offers structured exploration and exposure to 4 different areas, which seems helpful since I’m still figuring out my career path. One of the rotations is software development. 

Deloitte pays significantly more ($20K higher), has a prestigious name, and could open doors for me down the line. 

 I’m worried that if i take the consulting role and hate it, switching to a development role will be harder down the road because as a IST major, I don’t have a ton of technical experience and PNC would train me. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Which would you choose and why? Any advice on consulting vs. rotational programs would be super helpful!
Thanks in advance for your input!",Financial-Bike-1792,1,0.6600000262260437,1,1732549651,2024-11-25 15:47:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzlvbk/technology_consulting_vs_software_development/,11,2024

Hope to hear some opinions from here

Basically I summarise some of the trigger points before I jumped into a new field like safety:

1-Company went through retrenchment and I worry about my prospect outside of my company 

2- Have been working and taking more low value jobs that people shun. I felt no growth in me despite trying to maintain a positive mindset 
that I'm learning new stuff. But true fact is if I get retrenched, the skill I have don't fetch me higher salary

3- Unappreciative and difficult boss... I think enough said.

4 - chance upon job transfer and felt like trying new stuff

5- ends up different from my job interview and now I landed up in Safety. Safety isn't my interested field to be honest. But since I have left my old dept I have decided not to look back

Currently I felt fuzzy and kept thinking whether did I made the right decision... Probably I have put in a lot of effort and when I let go I felt... Waste of my years.

So its been a couple months since graduation and i’ve got a job offer that I was initially inclined to agree. I applied hesitantly because of how bad the market is and surprisingly got it. After more thought(yes this should have came before applying) I realized I would be miserable taking the job. The pay is lower than the usual for this position at the company, its 2nd shift(which usually should indicate above avg) and I’d have to move away from friends and family. The company is also known for having almost no room for promotion. I’d be using up a huge chunk of my paychecks on just rent and taxes alone. Its six months after graduation and i’m supposed to start soon and have been applying like crazy for other positions because I realized too late that I do not want this position and it may have just been desperation making the decisions before. Just looking to hear some input and advice on what others would do in this scenario. Bite the bullet and start the job or decline and keep looking? 

P.S its about 75000 which seems like a ton but when ur single paying taxes and hefty rent in a HCOL area + retirement it gets drained fairly quickly. ",Tactician37,1,1.0,6,1732529785,2024-11-25 10:16:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzfozt/advice_needed_wwyd/,11,2024
1gzfg64,Which Short Course Offers the Best Job Opportunities to Complement Future Studies in Industrial Engineering and Management or Design and Construction Project Management?,"**Hello everyone!**

I am planning to start a 5-year university program in either **Industrial Engineering and Management** or **Design and Construction Project Management**, beginning in August. Until then, I would like to enroll in a shorter course that leads to a job I can combine with my studies and work during school breaks to improve my financial situation during my studies.

I am wondering which short courses would be the best for me, considering the following aspects:

1. **Career perspective**: What would future employers (who might hire me after completing my 5-year program) see as the most beneficial experience on my CV?
2. **A strong job market and high employability**
3. **Salary**

Examples of courses I have found so far:

* **Network Technician** (40 weeks)
* **IT Support Technician** (52 weeks)
* **CNC Operator in Industry** (22 weeks)
* **Procurement Analysis and Digitalization** (20 weeks)
* **Sustainable Procurement** (16 weeks)

There are also many shorter courses (ranging from a weekend to a few weeks) that result in certifications, such as **Economy Assistant**. However, I’m wondering whether certifications from these smaller, shorter courses would actually be useful. Would employers value them, or would I simply be outcompeted by those with longer and more comprehensive training in economics?

What should I aim for?

I would appreciate any and all tips, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts! Career fields I have considered relevant so far include **economics**, **industry**, **technology**, **project management**, and **law**, but I’m also open to suggestions from other fields (for example, could psychology be useful for future project management roles?).

Any general advice on what might be good to consider in my situation is also very welcome :)

**P.S.** I live in Sweden, so if anyone has insights into how the opportunities look nationally here, that would be great. However, I’m also happy to hear advice from an international perspective!",Sea-Chipmunk-9168,1,1.0,0,1732528771,2024-11-25 09:59:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzfg64/which_short_course_offers_the_best_job/,11,2024
1gzf37u,Does anyone else do mostly nothing all day at their job?,"This is my first job out of college. Before this, I was an intern and I largely did nothing all day and I kinda figured it was because I was just an intern.

Now, they pay me a nicer salary, I have my own office and a $2000 laptop, and they give me all sorts of benefits and most days I’m still not doing much. They gave me a multiple month long project when I was first hired on that I completed faster than my bosses expected and they told me they were really happy with my work. Since then it’s been mostly crickets.

My only task for today is to order stuff online that the office needs. That’s it. Im a mechanical design engineer. They are paying me for my brain and I’m sitting here watching South Park and scrolling through my phone all day. I would pull a George Castanza and sleep under my desk if my boss didn’t have to walk past my office to the coffee machine 5 times a day.

Is this normal??? Do other people do this? Whenever my boss gets overwhelmed with work, he will finally drop a bunch of work on my desk and I’ll complete it in a timely manner and then it’s back to crickets for a couple weeks.

1gze0nt,"I think I'm going to be sacked this evening. Please help, what do I do? [N/A]","

I’ve been in my current HR role at an FMCG company, and it’s been…a lot. The environment here is far from ideal—there’s a colleague (let’s call him ""X"") who openly discriminates against women, avoids his responsibilities, and pushes work onto others (like me). Leadership knows about him but won’t act because of his age and tenure. To top it off, this office doesn’t feel like a safe space—verbal fights among leadership are common, and it’s just draining my energy day by day.

Two weeks ago, things came to a head. I called out ""X"" for embezzling company resources and cash. He baited me, and I fell for it, escalating the situation. The CEO forwarded the matter to my manager, who luckily supported me but also advised me to ""watch my tone in emails going forward."" Fair advice, but it made me realize leadership will never take real action against ""X."" After that, I just stopped going to the office for two weeks—it was partly my way of avoiding the toxic situation, but I know it was a mistake.

Now, my manager has texted, asking me to come to the main office and promising an update by the end of the day. While I respect my manager, I’m worried about walking into the lion’s den—facing the CEO, ""X,"" and this dysfunctional leadership team.

To make things more complicated, I’ve received an offer with a 30% hike. While the new offer initially seemed promising, I’ve noticed major red flags there too (late-night calls, vague job expectations, and below-industry-standard pay). After much thought, I’ve decided not to take it, but now I’m left wondering: Do I resign from my current role without anything else lined up?

This job is sucking the life out of me, but walking away feels risky. Am I being too rash, or is this the right time to leave and focus on finding something better?

Im 24m I had come to usa for my master which I did in cs and for about 4 months I'm searching for jobs without any success and really it's such a shit market at the moment that it's mentally fucking me up.

I always had a passion to be in some kind of an entertainment industry, I do know few stuff about it and I can sing and play few instruments plus i have some drama experience.

So what my plan is to go back to India where I'm from and utilise my skills (data science)to find a job and atleast try for the area i really see my self being in. 

The only reason of going back would be to do things without restrictions which I can't do in usa. Also being jobless here is just wasting my precious time and even if few months down the line i do get a job but I'm willing to take that risk

1 thing i would like to clear is that I'm not delusional i know the entertainment industry in India is not something easy to break in but 5 years down the line i don't want to feel like man if i would have atleast tried then how things would be

And in the end even if I'm working in India I will close to my family always freely explore and really grind for my passion use my connections 

What i really want from this post is to someone just share if they have gone through such career changes not necessarily like cs to acting or something but just any career change

1gzc5wi,Really not sure what to do next….,"Facts:
-  I’ve worked at a big corporation for over 25 years
-  my title is “executive director” - fancy title which doesn’t mean much, but I mention just to show that they are paying me plenty (>$200k/yr)

Over the last several years, re-org after re-org has landed me further and further from anything that interests me, and in a position with no power to change anything, while taking all of the the bullets for things not changing.

Without going into too much detail, I’m currently in the second situation in a row where I submit proposal after
proposal for the permission to make necessary changes to support the project. Management is too busy to review or seek approval from above to move forward.  When it gets escalated, I’m the fall guy and they want answers.    Answers seem argumentative since it puts it back on them. 

In the most recent example, my manager came down hard on me when I didn’t submit a ticket for a broken form for 2 weeks.    I explained it took THAT long because he owns the project, but refuses to allow me to transition the ownership of, because he’s trying to find the rightful owner.  This has been the case for the YEAR that I have been there already.   I am not allowed to build what’s needed to support it because it’s in its way out. 

He continued to mansplain the importance of keeping the lights on while he tries to get  answers…..  he asked every week, he claims.   (Since 3rd quarter 2023????)
he used the words “blindsided”,”shocked “,”furious”.   I finally had to ask him what I needed to say so that he would stop.  He said he should be able to be transparent with me.

Again.  27 years.  Executive Director.
Again.  SECOND time in a row a man is making me feel like my job (career of 27 years) is in jeopardy and I am screaming without a voice to stop it.

I am posting out, of course, but it seems like I’m giving in like they want me to and there should be a better way.  Corporate America really stinks.   Who reviews the managers as MANAGERS and not as their own personal lemmings?   

Before you tell me to go to me leader, I did that last time - another fun story about how I could have saved developers DAYS in compliance review times but wasn’t allowed to, then called in a panic several times a week at night.

1gzbrgt,"Should I quit my stable job for a more fun, but stressful, on-call job with better pay?","Hey everyone,

I’m 18 and currently facing a dilemma. I have a stable job right now that pays well and has predictable hours. The work is a bit boring, but it gives me plenty of free time for hobbies and side activities, which I really value. The downside is that the job feels unfulfilling and I don’t feel like I'm growing much in it.

I’ve been offered a second job, which is on-call. It pays slightly more and is definitely more fun and less boring, but it comes with unpredictable hours — sometimes even at night — and I’d have less free time for my personal projects. The job is more stressful, but I think it could be more exciting and challenging. (Casino Dealer)

My dilemma is whether I should quit my current job, which is stable but boring, for this new one that pays a bit more but could lead to more stress and less free time. I’m trying to figure out which choice would be better for me in the long run.

1gzblmd,Advice needed - too soon to quit?,"Hi all, apologies for the long post. Looking to get an outside perspective on whether or not I’m being rational for wanting to quit so soon. 

I picked up a second job as a cook at a chain restaurant. 1st job is also chain, but very different cuisine (think cheap comfort vs upscale bistro). I was clear on my needs in the interview. 20-25 hours a week, afternoons and evenings, and two days off because my spouse is disabled and I need those days to take them to doctors appointments, since there’s at least a couple a month. They told me no problem, and I was hired on the spot. After filling out paperwork I was told someone would be in touch with a schedule. A week goes by, I give them a call, and apparently no one ever told the manager I was finished with the paperwork. I’m told again that someone will be in contact soon with a schedule. Almost another full week goes by and I get a call asking why I never showed up. Apparently I’d been scheduled the previous night, which not only wasn’t communicated to me but is also one of the two days I can’t work. Manager got pissy with me but gives the schedule for the week and they’ve scheduled me on the weekend, a Monday, and my one other day off. 
 I show up for my first shift, no one knows who I am or why I’m there, so I’m sat in front of a computer for two hours to watch videos. Only about two 5-minute videos were on their actual menu and recipes, the rest was just the history of the company. I’m then sent home four hours before my shift was supposed to end. The next night I show up and again, no one even knows I’m supposed to be there, I’m immediately escorted to the line with my jacket and bag still on and the manager who brought me back basically scuttled away as fast as possible. 
Once on the line I’m just watching a guy who’s been there for 30 years on one station. He did do some actual training, but mostly it was me watching him trying to ask questions and him responding “eh you just kinda know” to EVERYTHING I ask (including things like which of the unlabeled timers to use for fried items, where to find things that may not be prepped, portion sizes, etc). The closer told me that he’s switching over to working days soon and that the GM’s plan is to have me take over as a full-time closer, 35-45 hours a week. Found out that GM and one of the managers are siblings and one of the cooks is her husband. Bartender is burnt out and exhausted after having been there for less than a year. 
On top of all of this, it’s disgusting. Surfaces that clearly haven’t been wiped down in at least weeks if not months, years worth of black sticky gunk crusted on the floor under every appliance (and I mean EVERY appliance), and cooks who touch food with no gloves and without washing their hands, including raw meat. I also felt like I was being ignored for most of the night. I know you don’t have to be besties with coworkers, but on top of everything else it just feels like “how am I going to tolerate this bullshit if I don’t even like the people I work with?”
I’m on the fence about whether or not to go back. It’s not a big restaurant. Quite frankly, once I get the hang of it, it seems like it’ll be easy. It’s much smaller and slower than my other job. Amount of business on a Saturday night was about equal to a Monday night at 1st job. The other reason is that I just left a job in favor of this one because it paid more, and I feel it’ll be humiliating to have to tell people that yet again, I quit a job after only being there for a short time. 
I have another shift tomorrow night and I’ve been nauseas all day thinking about having to go back. I almost cried on my drive home that second day, and I had a panic attack while on my break at 1st job this morning. Would it be reasonable of me to quit so soon? Or should I just stick it out for a little while? My spouse says they’ve already been so disrespectful to me that I should just not show up again, but some coworkers of mine are encouraging me to just push through for the money, and I really don’t know what to do. Any sort of advice or perspective would be much appreciated.

1gzb5av,Looking for a science career that studies… us.,"Are there any science research careers that study us? That’s very broad and let me narrow it down.

I’ve always been interested in drugs. There’s a stigma around that word but I’m talking more about the pharmacology. Like how does C12H16N2 (2 N, DMT), in a physical form when smoked make us “trip?” 

This curiosity got me into more of a rabbit hole for the past few years about how our bodies and consciousness actually work, and to my surprise, no one has figured out how. Are there any research professions that study our brains and body on a more molecular level? Or how we are conscious, despite just being neurons, which are made by proteins, made by cells. I’m not as interested in trying to discover more on how our bodies make that protein, but rather how when grouped together we become conscious, and how other chemical compounds can change OUR perception on reality.

This is something I’ve been interested in for a long time and believe understanding our consciousness can advance us as a species. I’m wondering if there are any careers that research this topic as I see myself as a very smart person being able to discover and pick up on/learn things very quickly and thoroughly.

TL;DR:
Are there any research career paths that study our brains at an atomic level and study consciousness?",Dremshack,0,0.4000000059604645,8,1732510770,2024-11-25 04:59:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gzb5av/looking_for_a_science_career_that_studies_us/,11,2024

1gzan6f,I regret switching career and want to return to my previous field,"I'm 24 from SE Asia, been working as a software dev for almost 2 years. I have a civil engineering degree and worked as a consultant for 6 mo.

I didn't like civil engineering and working an office job in that field just made it worse. I switched to tech because I thought it would be much easier to find a job abroad and it's in every industry out there, so more variety.

However now I'm stuck in a dead end boring job. I feel like I haven't improved one bit since I started working here. They don't care what we create as long as it works, there's no feedback loop. I could push a super redundant stupid code and nobody would care.

I have been applying for the past year and it's super demoralizing. The industry is over saturated. My IT friends are getting laid off left and right. My contract will expire next year.

I thought about going back to civil engineering but I'm probably even worse than a fresh graduate now. I'm afraid I'd have to settle for a 60% lower salary. I'm also worried that I become even more miserable if I still hate it.

1gz7lt2,I have anxiety at work,"So I just recently started a new job. The job is with the City at a recreation centre. It’s an old building and we’re supposed to clean the rooms before the next team goes onto the ice but we give the first team that plays the keys in the morning and they leave them in the door all day. Every team has 25 minutes to leave and then that gives us 10 minutes to clean the room. Well, they do not always leave within that time, and the new team will arrive within that time and already be in the room before I’ve even been able to clean it. And today I had an anxiety attack because I’ve been sick and have lost my voice and my supervisor today called out to me the check the “blank”.. couldn’t hear him well since he was on the Zamboni and since he’s been coming at me all this shift to make sure that the rooms are cleaned I figured he was saying to clean the rooms and I accidentally walked in to see a bunch of men not fully clothed. My worst nightmare as a woman and I said sorry and walked out but my voice is lost so they probably didn’t even catch what I said and I went straight into an anxiety attack because I didn’t want them to ever see me again but they most likely will. And this supervisor just gives me so much anxiety….and the system gives me so much anxiety. I think I also need a microphone in general so then I can be like “MAINTENANCE. CAN YOU GUYS PLEASE GET UP AND OUT FASTER AS THE NEXT TEAM NEEDS TO COME IN” because I do not have a loud enough voice even without this cold I have. And what would be even better I think is if we just gave them the keys when they checked in and then when they checkout they have to bring us the keys. Then we could get the keys back and know they are out and then go clean the rooms. It would be so much simpler. I hate it here because I hate this anxiety and how they do things and this happens to me at most jobs but systems just aren’t that good for anxious people I think. What’s your thoughts?

1gz6rsy,Yearly Raise Question,"A bit about me:  
I’m 24 years old. This is my first job after college. I live in a HCOL area but work remotely. There is an excellent work life balance (sometimes a little light on the work honestly).

Career trajectory/situation:  
I started in September of 2023 as a Data Analyst 1 (P1) with a salary of $70k. In April 2024 I was promoted to Data Analyst 2 (P2) with a salary of $85k due to my rapid development. Since being diagnosed with ADHD in July 2024, I’ve found a number of coping mechanisms and my growth has only continued. My manager and his manager are consistently impressed and give me very positive feedback on my work. At this point in time, my manager has implied that I’m one of the best contributors on my team full of P3s and a few P4s. I have a broader/deeper understanding of the data, turn requests around more quickly, and will regularly help others with their work when asked (~2-3 times a week). Recently, he acknowledged that he has seen my growth and realizes I need a bigger role. Because of this, my understanding is that the only reason I’m not a P3 is that I’ve only had the job for ~14 months. 

Officially, they promote to P2 after ~2 years but in practice they often promote after ~1 year. P3 is officially 3-5 years. I have no idea what the practical timeline is.

Question:  
At the start of every year, we have yearly reviews and salary bumps. I want to know:
a. What should I be asking/expecting to get in terms of pay?  
b. How should I do that?  
c. Any other advice you may have for me ",Every-Performer-5627,1,1.0,3,1732496619,2024-11-25 01:03:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gz6rsy/yearly_raise_question/,11,2024

Now, one company is a massive poultry company, with direct reporting to the VP of Finance and working closely with the executive team. This job to me seems to have the biggest future potential as I can grow within the organization or move to competitors for career advancement. Salary offer is 115k, with better benefits.

Offer two, is with a service company as an assistant controller. The team here is only 7 people and the controller is not retiring or leaving anytime soon, so my growth is limited. The salary here is 130k and lesser benefits.

My dilemma is, do I take more money and hope I can transfer the skills for a raise later on if I don’t grow? Or should I go with the larger company with more potential for future opportunities and promotions within?

1gz3vvx,Should I change my career from Video Editing / 2D Animation to Sales?,"Hi everyone hope you all are doing good.

I am currently working as a Video Editor / 2D Animator & Motion Designer at a reputable company in my home country, Pakistan.

The way we do business here is by registering the company in the US and providing video editing and animation services to US clients. The sales team usually carries American names and goes on calls with the clients stating that the company is present in the US however, the team works from here.

I work in production and even though the pay scale here is higher compared to companies that have local client clients, (since the company gets money in US Dollars). The growth is quite slow compared to the sales team.

The people present in the sales handed out company-maintained cars and got to $300 - $400 a month (which is quite good in my country given the exchange rate) in around a year.

Meanwhile, the growth in production is quite slow. No company-maintained cars are given and the payscale reaches the same stage after like 3 years.

Plus there are no upper ceilings on the money a salesperson can make since they get a lot of money via commissions, the more videos they sell the more money they can make. Meanwhile, there is no such thing as this in production and once we reach the upper limit of $600 - $700, that's just it, one can't expect more salary after reaching this stage, and that too after years of work.

On the downside of Sales, It's a stressful job where you're only evaluated through numbers and no matter how good you are if your numbers are low for just a single month then you're gonna get heat.

I recently have been offered to switch to the sales team by a co-worker who thinks I can be a good fit there and I have to make decisions. I graduated with a degree in Advertising last year and have 1 year of experience in my current role. I also have turned 25 just last week. Even though I love my work passionately, it is of no good if It can't make me enough money to put food on the table.  Additionally, I think I have the necessary skill set to be a salesperson and can do good there.

Another thing which I have to keep in mind is that I want to get a job somewhere abroad and move there. Maybe in Europe, Mid-East, etc, and have to suffice which career line will align me more towards my goals?

Keeping all this in mind what advice would you all give to me?

1gz24c4,Layoffs: A Poem from a Former Employee,"I came across a moving poem on LinkedIn written by someone who was recently laid off. The post was shared about a week ago and captures the emotional toll of losing a job after years of dedication. She seemed deeply passionate about her work, frequently posting positive updates about the company. Her transition into a senior managerial role reflects her competence. Yet, like so many others, she was let go without prior notice. What made it even more heartbreaking was discovering that she and her family had just purchased a house shortly before the layoff.

The lesson here feels universal: stay professional, but don’t let your identity or self-worth be tied too closely to any company. Managerial praise, while uplifting in the moment, isn’t a guarantee of job security. At the end of the day, it’s only your loved ones and yourself who will always have your back.

The comments on her post were sparse—just one supportive reply from her spouse. None of the four teams she managed left a comment or reassured her. It felt as though she had already been forgotten. The contrast is striking: when someone resigns, colleagues gather to say goodbye, but when layoffs happen, it’s often business as usual for everyone else, leaving the person to deal with the loss alone.

Her poem is a bittersweet reflection on her love for her role and the shock of sudden severance. It’s a stark reminder of how fragile job security is in today’s world.

------------------------------------------
I thought you loved me as much as I loved you,
Reinforced my belief, the way I grew,
You nurtured and cared, wrapped me in warm embrace,
I cannot now take it, that you send me out with disgrace.

“You are strategic, you learn fast” , you said,
With words of encouragement the managerial path you made me tread.
Oh! What would I do now without you,
You packed me off without a heads up or a clue.

“Don’t have any more allegiance”, my friends advised,
“Your 11 years of contributions cast aside”,
But working for you was more than just an occupation,
To me, like most, it was always a happy emotion.

I cannot force myself to look out now,
Will take time to heal and figure things out somehow,
I am positive that changes happen for the better,
I am not bitter, you will be special and this is a love letter! :) :)

---------------------------------------

What do you guys think, How do you see such layoffs changing workplace dynamics?
Are we becoming more detached from our jobs to protect ourselves, or is there still room for genuine passion and dedication in today’s professional environment? What should be the best strategy to save yourself from being in such a situation?",ForeignAd7638,1,1.0,0,1732483880,2024-11-24 21:31:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gz24c4/layoffs_a_poem_from_a_former_employee/,11,2024

1gz13mj,Any advice on qualifications for next step in (generally finance) career,"Hi all, mid 20’s, been working in financial operations for about 4 years and have been trying to find out how to get out of the backend of finance and into something front end, more analyst/research related that I’d find more engaging. Honestly though, I’m open to pretty much anything not financial operations related… a job that engages more of your brain really! I lack the qualifications to make the jump elsewhere unfortunately (only have a bachelor’s in economics) so I’ve been looking at various degrees/certifications I could pursue to open some more doors! Does anyone have any suggestions? Do certain certifications open more doors than others e.g would you recommend the CFA over the CPA because it’s more broad? 

Any and all help/advice greatly appreciated, thanks!

1gz135x,Career Advice - Should I take a Risk on Job Offer?,"- **Current Job:**
  - 32 years old, no family, earning $115k in a small company.
  - 25-minute commute, good work-life balance.
  - Job is easy but not much room for growth.
  - Company is facing business issues; home office is now 1 day/week.

- **New Job Offer:**
  - Offer from a major company in a leading industry at $150k.
  - Negotiated a permanent contract because the position is through consultancy.
  - Requires relocating to a more expensive part of the city to keep a 30-35 minute commute.
  - Home office likely 2-3 days/week (a big plus).

**Challenges with New Job:**

- **Cost of Living:** Need to rent in a pricey neighborhood (~$3k/month vs $2.4k elsewhere), and possibly buy a car. This absorbs 70% of the salary increase. I wanted to change apartment anyway though.
- **Stability:** Role is funded for a year, but nothing is guaranteed beyond that. They did promise otherwise but who knows. Having that company on the CV would be a plus.
- **Commute:** Slightly longer (35 minutes), restrict me to 1 neighbourhood unless I sacrifice on the commute time.

**Questions:**

- Is the career boost worth the higher living costs and commute?
- Would the job stability and career potential outweigh the financial strain?

**TL;DR:** Got an offer from a big company for $150k, but it comes with a higher cost of living and more commuting. Is it worth it for the career boost, or should I stay in my current role with a better work-life balance?",Saayaminator,8,1.0,24,1732481196,2024-11-24 20:46:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gz135x/career_advice_should_i_take_a_risk_on_job_offer/,11,2024
1gz0rfa,"Decent job, but no upward trajectory or motivation ","I have a pretty decent job by most accounts, its remote, pay is decent. Its a small company so I basically do a bunch of different things from marketing to design to customer support. I don't feel like I enjoy or am particularly good at any of these things, just good enough to keep the job. After a few years of working there I have so little motivation to continue.  But finding another job is difficult especially since overall the pay is good. I think the problem is I really want to be good at something. I want to have a real career trajectory, not just perform random tasks for decent pay. 

The problem is I'm not even sure what to focus on. My job before this was in museums which is a generally low paid, niche industry. I've been interested in computers for ever but in todays job market I'd probably need a second degree. I'm not sure its worth the money and time.

1gz0qes,Career transition and job search troubles ,"Hi
I am going to be 26 yrs in this Jan.
Would appreciate all the help. 
I worked for ~3 years. Got stuck in the last job with bad role, bad manager and few co workers that made life hell. Left and decided never to work in job again (was so burnt out, hence the madness). Tried business in between - burnt money and failed (important to mention that family wasn't happy and gave me ultimatum to stop)

Been 9 months to that job. I come from a non tech background with no - monetisable skill, clear industry preference and direction I want to pursue in life. All the things I have tried so far are things that I didn't enjoy so life feels like a dead end. I tried mentoring platforms like Adplist but it was a bunch of generic advice cause I lacked clarity. I feel I am less numbers person and want to explore more on marketing and design - but I have 0 background in any. I am worried about the finances now and would want to work. 

 Does one just do any job that makes them unhappy so it helps financially or one should be patient and invest time to find a career that's fulfilling? If latter, what's a way to start there and have quantifiable milestones and checkpoint to not procrastinate? I am also scared what if conventional moulds are not for me and I am meant to do something more free... all in all its a mess.

On the positive side, I finally have time to dedicate to things I care about. I've decided to learn two skills: my parents' mother tongue and Kung Fu. I miss the structure and discipline of physical practice (I did Tae-Kwon-Do as a kid) and crave the feeling of getting good at something again.

For the next few months, between internships, I’d like to focus on these skills and also work on creative writing, which I enjoy and have made progress with in the last year.

1gyyxzz,SELLING MY SOUL TO THE DEVIL,"Currently, I am in a contractual work that would end in the last week of December and I won't have a job in the coming year. While doing my contractual job, I continue to look for opportunities so I could continuously support and provide the needs of my family.

Now, I am thinking of going back to my previous work and boss (CEO). I worked with him for 2 years almost as a Production Artist and after a year I was promoted to Executive Assistant because of my administrative skills. I started with a basic salary and was given a raise being an EA. He's a generous guy, he sometimes gave me an extra amount of money from his personal pocket and he would sometimes let me bring our company car when we work overtime.

But

Working with him for 2 years, and with my colleagues (who have been working in the company for more than 15 years) sharing their experiences about him, I have somewhat see who he really is and his schemes.

I maintain a neutral stance between these people (boss and colleagues). So when they share something about the boss, I don't believe it right away. I observe and confirm if things check out based on what they have shared  and mind you most of the things that they have shared really checks out.

He retains employees by gas lighting and letting them loan money from the company and used it against them when he feels threatened. He gives but he will use it against you and makes you feel that you owe him 10x. No paid leaves, regularization is floating, 1 day of rest is given and sometimes there's work on it, being creative, we need our brains to rest and relax. Also short-staffed since the beginning.

I, being warned by my colleagues and having read books about toxic bosses and work, was able to dodge his advancements and schemes. I was being treated differently because at that moment I was an asset to the company, especially for him.

So

Do I need to sell my soul to the devil?

I resigned from that work because of the health of my parents were being compromise. I cannot go home early because of work piling up plus the Boss doesn't report early in the office and give instructions early on. I tried fixing the system but he doesn't listen genuinely. So I decided to find a work that I could take care of my parents while working.

1gyyxch,DevOps vs Software Engineer career advice,"Hello,

About 3 years ago I joined this company, right after school. I was doing mostly software engineering but I also liked working with servers. After about a year the company was sold to investors and another year later the department I was working in was being layed off.

Now another department, managing the servers, asked if I wanted to join them. And I did. I enjoyed it for sometime but the policies the investors are enforcing are becoming quite annoying.

I am now looking for another job and orginally wanted to go back to SE because this is more in my comfort zone. I had an interview with one company, I thought for Software Engineer but they said they are looking for a DevOps engineer and my knowledge does match what they need.

- Should I take this job? I do like it tech but the only reason I'm not comfortable is just the thought of possibily taking down production and start panicing. 

- What if in 2-5 years I do really want to get back to SE, which is what I studied for, will companies see my devops expierience as something postive or negative? I ask this because in another interview I got rejected because I do not have expierience in Java but in other langauges I do. Learning another language wouldn't be that hard in my opionon and I did have Java in school but appeartly they don't see it this way? So now I'm scared if I do go DevOps I will have even less expierience in programming, on paper. This is simply not true I have been programming since I was 14. Now I am 29.

1gyxpzf,New job and pet loss,"I (24f) started a new job at the beginning of the month.  Last Monday, my dog of 12 years passed away very unexpectedly and it has been the worst pain my family and I have felt in a long time. This dog was also my sisters soul dog/best friend, and she was already not super mentally stable before this, so to say that hasn’t added to the stress, I’d be lying. Like to the point where she’s saying she’d rather not live on anymore, so I’ve been trying to be as present with her as I can to support her.

New job is hybrid with a 4 in/1 WFH day schedule, and it’s a 2 hour commute each way (that alone has been more than miserable). I had been unemployed for a year, so I needed to accept this as it was the first offer I had gotten and a 20k pay increase from my last. My job previous to this was my first out of college, fully remote, was there for a year, and I am now longing for that job again because this new job and commute is miserable beyond belief. Everything about it is miserable except for the coffee machine they have there. I’ve been crying almost daily this whole month, at my desk and in the bathroom, and this past week has made me realize how badly I miss the flexibility of my old job. I cannot keep doing this one. 

This past week I also finagled my way into working remote for the entire week, and took a half day Monday and Tuesday off. It’s not like I was just being lazy and wanted to WFH, I have been an absolute mess and couldn’t/still cannot fathom being around people, especially strangers who don’t understand what I’m going through. I got a talk from my boss and his boss about my attendance and the importance of being present in the office on Wednesday/Thursday this week, which I do understand because it’s the company policy, yada yada, but it really just put a bad taste in my mouth because I was visibly crying on both calls while thanking them for their flexibility during this traumatic week. I still am a wreck and don’t know how I’m going to go into the office and function this upcoming week. Yes I know the distraction would be helpful for a lot of people, but I have hated this new job since day 1. I need to find something with remote flexibility for more than 1 day per week. 

Now for the actual question I want advice on: should I ask for my old job back? I am 100% willing to take the pay cut and I miss/need that kind of remote flexibility with everything going on in my life. I regret accepting this current job offer so so so much to be honest. I know anxiety and stress is expected within the first few months of a new job, but this is a whole new level that I know for a fact I cannot sustain. I ended on ok terms with my previous employer, and say “ok” because I could only do 1 week instead of 2 due to the new job I was supposed to start (that fell through the cracks and then I was unemployed lol). Is that a dumb idea? I wouldn’t quit current job until I had an offer from old one, but I could really use some advice as I have no idea what path to take right now. Thank you in advance.

1gyxfpl,I have 3 semesters left in my BCompSc degree — should I finish it ? (foreign student),"I started studying at a university in 2019 as an international student in Europe, with plans to graduate in 2023. But, due to many reasons (pandemic, financial problems, etc), I failed two semesters and had to retake them, which has delayed my graduation. Also in 2021/2022, I relocated to another city because of my new job in IT (courses were online at that time), however, shortly after, the courses transitioned back to in-person classes, so I failed 3rd time. After that, I began applying to companies with the hope of returning back to the city before the start of the next academic year. Unfortunately, it took me 1 year to find another job in IT. During that time, I completely abandoned my studies without any formalities, I was expelled in 2024 fall, but I can continue my studies if I submit an application. Now, I have a well-paying job at a large company (kinda my dream job), with over 3 years of experience, and everything is going great. Should I continue my studies from the Spring 2025 semester or just move on with my career ? I've already spent more money and time on this degree than it would cost to graduate.


Note: I am now 23, and planning to go back to my country in 2-3 years, not having a diploma really isn't that big of a deal - you can still work at companies like Exadel, EPAM, or local firms. But, I'm also uncertain about the future - I might return to Europe, or there may be situations in my career where having a diploma could be necessary.

1gyve0w,Career Advice to a Mass Communication Undergrad Student ,"I (19F) am a Mass Communication/Journalism undergrad student. My combination includes Social Management (social work) and Literature. Although my interest in English and Literature is quite low, social work is quite intriguing. The span of my bachelor's degree in the country I live in is only 3 years. I am in my second year and I've had my fair share of regret as to why I chose this major. The scope of social work in my country is very bad. I would like to move to the US to pursue a master's degree. I've narrowed down my options to MS Marketing. Initially, I wanted to pursue an MBA but I figured GRE/GMAT is not my cup of tea. I don't have a math background and it would be a waste of time and money even if I put my heart into it to crack them because I'm pretty sure I won't be scoring appropriate marks to get into any uni. According to my research, people with an MBA and MS get paid almost the same. 

I want to move to Texas because my family lives there and picked a few unis that don't require GRE/GMAT tests. Texas A&M, McCombs, UT Dallas, East Texas, McCoy, Webster, and Rawl's are the options. My question is what do I do to get accepted? The application processes compared to my unis in my country are so different so I would appreciate it if someone could drop things that I need to do to have a good student profile. Things I need to do along with language exams, internships, and volunteering. 

I currently work in a company and I'm planning to stay until I graduate. It's been 10 months since I joined. Do colleges prefer long tenure in one company or short tenure in multiple companies? I have a decent academic percentage of 89%. I'm working on my extracurriculars and volunteering, they're not so strong as of now. 

In the back of my mind, I also think about whether I should pursue higher studies in social work because I heard the job gets paid a lot in foreign countries. I feel like my expertise could lie in Psychology rather than social work. I have no interest in entering the journalism field and thought marketing could help me land a good corporate job. 

If you have any other ideas about what I can pursue instead of Marketing, please let me know. All suggestions and perspectives are open. Please guide me through, I have a year and a half left.",InterestingRound121,1,1.0,0,1732466955,2024-11-24 16:49:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gyve0w/career_advice_to_a_mass_communication_undergrad/,11,2024
1gyuvu3,Need advice,"I'm currently working in Dubai as a Mechanical QC Engineer on a very low salary. The opportunities here are quite limited, and I often end up covering other people's duties when they’re on leave, such as project management, coordination, and, more recently, estimation. Over time, I’ve learned to handle these tasks efficiently, but now the people who are meant to do these roles are passing their workloads onto me with the manager’s approval. 

I decided to request a salary increment, but the manager refused, claiming they are seeking investors and promising that once they secure funding, I’ll be given three times my current salary (which is just 2,000 AED). I had hoped that when the time came to renew my visa, I’d receive some sort of raise, which is why I went the extra mile with all this additional work. 

Now, there’s a new issue: they want me to stop my QC work entirely and focus solely on covering for others. The manager even dismissed quality and safety as “myths” rather than actual professions.  

I’ve been trying to find a new job since June but haven’t had any success in this tough market. I have my medical check-up tomorrow, and I’m torn between renewing my visa or resigning and returning to my home country.

1gyts7e,Im really upset. Is my coworker harassing me?," (F, 28, single) just started my job at this new firm a month ago. I was assigned to a coworker (44 M, married with a kid) and to shadow him. We had a very normal and friendly professional relationship and we made superficial smalltalk, as you do with a coworker. On one Saturday, me and him were alone at our workplace and i sat on the other table and he jokingly said to sit next to him. After a while we continued talking and he asked if I have a boyfriend. I said no. He then said “but you surely have a friend with benefits, don’t you?” and I got really nervous and my head became warm. Im someone who has always had issues with imposing my limits and setting boundaries. In hindsight I’m mad at myself for not having said no right then and there, but I hesitantly answered his questions. He then asked me if I wanted to have kids, I said no. He was surprised and asked me why. I said “many reasons”. He then kept on asking and I said “many reasons, including the physical aspects”. He then said “But you do know that all of our bodies are going to change eventually and we are all going to age, right? You are going to become an old wrinkly woman one day. I’ve noticed you look a lot into the mirror and you do know that you can’t keep staying a young beautiful woman forever. Soon you’re going to turn into an old woman.” He then asked me what I would do if I got pregnant and if I would abort. He asked if I’m on the pill or if I use condoms and asked me why I don’t do a tubal ligation. At this point my head was super warm and my heart was racing and I kept answering the questions but I felt sick and my gut was telling me that something is wrong. On another occasion when we were alone, he asked me to show him pictures of guys that I found attractive and he asked me what my type was. He asked me also if I was into older guys and I jokingly said “only above 80” to change the subject. I once was attending a client and making a joke that he looked like a rich guy and he asked if I care about that. I said “yeah I guess I care about if a man is able to provide.” And he said I will be an old lonely woman with cats if I care about that. He then made a joke about me being an old wrinkly woman with loads of lipstick on my teeth (because “I like to wear makeup”) and trying to give kisses to my grandchildren. I asked why he would say that and he said “to tease you and because I know you don’t like it and have a problem with your body”. He also once commented on my nails when I said I was going to get them done, saying that it wouldn’t make me more feminine. On the last occasion he asked me if I have many suitors and if I have many men chasing after me. I said “some”. He asked me if I liked any of them. I then said “yeah i like one”. He then asked me what I would do if he tried to kiss me. And I don’t know what happened but I snapped. I said “Dude, this is a workplace! Please be more professional and don’t ask me these questions!” He then smiled and said “the workplace is over there (pointing to the office) over here it’s just us”. I flipped and said “dude stop asking me these questions” and he asked “what, don’t you kiss your boyfriends on the mouth?” and i said “a bit more of professionalism please” and got up and left.
After that he gave me the silent treatment and was visibly upset. 
The next day we had a shift together and were, once again alone at the workplace. He was explaining me something about the lights and I said “ok I got it” and he replied sarcastically “oh you’re a fast learner” and said that I don’t care at all what happens in the workplace and that I’m performing badly. I asked “why are you talking to me like this? I’m not your daughter, you can’t yell at me like that”. To which he responded “If you can talk to me like the way you did yesterday, then I can talk to you like this too.”

It made the atmosphere REALLY heavy and awkward and I decided to confront him. I said:
“Can I tell you something? I really didn’t like that you asked me those super intimate questions. I’m a person that can’t say no easily, but after having digested this events I realised that it felt really wrong. I don’t want you to tell everyone things about my most intimate parts of my life and I really felt super uncomfortable the whole time.” 
He then said “oh it wasn’t my intention and I’m sorry.” And then he said “But, keep in mind, YOU were the one telling me these things.” and I said “no, I remember exactly how it went, YOU were the one asking me these intimate things and you kept digging and digging.” 
He then said “Oh, but I thought we had such an open and fluid relationship and could tell each other everything “ and I said “I have been here a month, we have a Professional relationship “. And I added “And also you have to keep in mind the power dynamic in our “relationship”. You have been here longer, you are 44 and I am 28, this is my first year out of college and my forst working year. I am also 28 and still evolving in life and learning how to impose my limits and boundaries and it is your responsibility as an older person, not to take advantage of me as a young person.” To this he replied that he doesn’t see age and that he treats all people the same. I left it at that. He is not very mad at me, and is acting like a little upset kid. 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t have proof that he said it because it was verbal. My only proof is my mom, my brother and my best friend who I went to immediately after the first incident happened because I felt like something was wrong. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want him to now tell everyone that I was the one telling him this information or to make a big deal out of it. I only want keep my job and to not be working alone with him anymore.

1gyt0du,I'm pretty much stuck,"And I know so many other people are in my same boat. So many of us feel insecure about our own abilities and fearful for what's to come considering the state of the job market (and really, the world in general), but I genuinely don't know what to do now.

I love tech. As a child I learned HTML and made very bad websites and then delete them, only to make new ones again and again. As a young teenager, I started actually creating functional websites with all kinds of purposes, still just for the fun of it. And that hasn't changed.

Designing websites is genuinely so fun, and learning new technologies to do so is so rewarding, especially when I get to set them up for something that I actually need in my daily life. I have dozens of little web projects running locally I use constantly for a bunch of things. I think that a job in this sector would be so good for me.

As they say: if you love what you do you won't have to work a day in your life. Whether that's accurate I don't know, But I truly think that making websites as a job would be great. But I simply don't know how to do that.

Looking online for job opportunities in this field leads me nowhere. I've looked both in Italy where I live right now and Sweden where I'll have to move in a year with no luck, as people want university graduates with CS degrees or whatever. And I simply can't do that.

Nothing is entry-level. Nothing is accessible. Working towards the goal of getting a job in this field seems fruitless because no matter how much I try, I can't find anything.

I'm hoping some of you have any tips? I've made quite a few portfolio websites but I've scrapped them all and I'm building a new one right now. The only ""job experience"" I have is a single electron application I made for a friend for literally €15 (which I'm still maintaining) and I can't find a way to gain more experience. This definitely has to do with the fact that I don't know how to market myself, but how do I do that when no one wants to hire a web developer with no qualifications? And qualifications cost so much and considering I have to ration my meals at the end of the month I can't afford anything respectable. 

I don't want this to be a sob story, though. I'm going to university in a year (hopefully for software engineering or web development!) and despite everything I'm still hopeful I will make something of myself. Eventually. I'm just wondering if anyone here has been through this and come out on top, and has any tips for me",occupieddonotenter,1,1.0,0,1732460844,2024-11-24 15:07:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gyt0du/im_pretty_much_stuck/,11,2024

1gys0uo,Children's ministry after a false accusation?,"As a single male, I graduated University with a bachelor's in elementary education in 2022. To help build my resume as I looked for a full time position, I started substitute teaching.

Jump to five months later. While subbing in a classroom, another teacher came in the morning to collect field trip money. She left and I continue teaching for the rest of the day. A few days later, I'm sitting in the police station being told that teacher witnessed me touch a student. 

One and a half years later, all charges dismissed. I'm finally free again to plan for the future. 

Previously, I had also been active in my church's children's program. I have worked alongside many adults who know I would never do anything nefarious. Of course I dismissed myself from my volunteer position after the arrest. 

While I'll never return to public education for many reasons, do you think a role in children's ministry is advisable? Many churches have cameras which schools lack and enhanced protection for both students AND adults (always have two adults present at all times for example). Furthermore, I would take greater strides to protect myself from even the appearance of evil.

I was going to ask what their training and expectations for me would be since this is my first job in this career and I interned there. I was also going to ask about the annual performance review and what that looked like, since they didn't perform them during my internship. Are these decent questions? Should I ask one more? I tried googling interview questions but most of them are all questions I already know the answer to since I was there for 5 months. 

I'm even *more* nervous about this interview than the others because I'm not sure if I should talk about my experiences during my internship since they experienced them with me and that would be redundant. I could answer from my experiences during my program as well, but should I answer with experiences from my retail/fast food jobs, since they're not really at all relevant to this job?

1gypfn5,Promotion offer,"UK, remote

Hi all, I've been offered a promotion to a CSM role with a focus on my current role (Data Analyst).

I've been continuously employed for 5 years and only increased my salary by about 8% in that time (including 1 promotion for no raise) while inflation has been more like 23% so I'm way behind. 

The promotion is 15% more and just catches me up to inflation but I feel like this is the time to catch up on what I've missed previously.2 promotions just to be where I should be anyway doesn't feel great. Frustratingly, though, my part of the company was bought out this year so my new company haven't 'contributed' to my previous (lack of) increases. 

I've purposely not put actual numbers because I'd be interested to hear opinions both on what I should be asking for and whether I should be asking at all given the situation.

1gyng72,Doing senior role tasks but paid as a junior,"Hi everyone,

I’ll try to keep this as concise as possible.

Over a year ago, I started as a bid-writer for a great company. It was my first role in this field, so I accepted a salary below my expectations because I loved the work, the team, and the challenge of tackling complex projects. I was promised a salary increase as I grew in the role.

My frustrations:
Once I started, it became clear that the company’s bid-writing structure had some serious flaws. This made it extremely difficult for me to perform well:

1.I often had to work weekends to meet deadlines.
2.I was juggling multiple projects without adequate input or guidance.
3.Managers provided contradicting feedback, which was often disrespectful rather than constructive.

I felt thrown into the deep end with no proper onboarding or support.

Despite these challenges, I delivered results. I won the majority of bids I worked on, which brought in millions in revenue (over 90% of the company’s total income comes from these bids). However, during my year-end review, they seemed to focus more on my mistakes—many of which I felt were unavoidable given the circumstances—than on my accomplishments.

Where things stand now:
Over time, I defended myself and proved my worth, which led to some positive changes:

I’ve introduced new ideas and strategies that have improved workflows. I independently gather insights from stakeholders and specialists to create commercial strategies for management to review. My contributions ARE helping the company move in a better direction. We're all starting to get more involved, which makes it so I won't be the fall guy when we inevitably lose a bid.

That said, I’ve hit a major roadblock. The company is now hiring a senior bid-writer, but the responsibilities listed are tasks I’ve been handling since day one. It feels like my efforts are being overlooked, and I’m stuck in a junior role despite working beyond my job description. To add to that, some choices management makes just outright feel like sabotage and I can't convince them of how it's simply a bad tactic. Again, to my frustration. 

I don’t believe I should immediately be promoted to a senior role—I’m still new to this field—but I can’t help but feel undervalued. I’ve sacrificed personal time and put in significant effort, yet the company seems stuck in its ways, repeating the same mistakes.

So to sum up; while I’ve seen some genuine change and still love the job, I’m struggling with:

1.Feeling overworked and underappreciated.
2.A lack of personal and professional growth.
3.Uncertainty about whether higher pay would resolve these issues.

I’m torn between staying to see if things improve further or moving on to a role where my efforts might be better valued. For those who’ve been in a similar situation:

How did you handle feeling stuck or undervalued?

What steps can I take to address this without jeopardizing the positive changes I’ve worked hard to create?

Is it worth staying for the potential or should I explore other opportunities?

Thanks in advance for your advice. I really want to do what’s best for my career while maintaining my passion for the work.

1gymjrc,Career Advice: BGAS Level 2 vs. MS in New Zealand/Australia?,"Hi all,

I’m a 34-year-old BE Mechanical Engineer with 13 years of experience as a Welding Engineer in the GCC (currently in Saudi Arabia). I wanted to do an MS in Germany but couldn’t in 2019. Now, I’m thinking of pursuing BGAS Level 2 in January 2025, which could help me find jobs in the GCC, but I’m unsure if it will benefit my long-term goals.

Alternatively, I’m considering an MS in New Zealand or Australia to boost my chances of working there. I want to eventually move to Europe or New Zealand/Australia for better opportunities and lifestyle, but I’m torn between these paths.

Would BGAS Level 2 be worth it, or should I focus on doing an MS abroad instead?

1gymglm,Switching from Business Degree to Cybersecurity ,"Hey guys, I'm 22, and I've been studying for a 4 years business degree and will be finishing it in June, but I've understood I don't want to work on this and cybersecurity is what I'm truly interested in.

Right now, I'm having so much free time because I want abroad to Germany for a year so I could hone my skills in German, but my studies don't require me to work too much so I've gotten a job at a shoe store, again, so I could learn German, but I've also been thinking about saving all this money to pay for certifications that could help me land a job.

I've also been thinking about giving my Bachelor's Degree Final Project a cybersecurity approach.

Could I land a job in cybersecurity if I get great certifications and a master's degree in cybersecurity? Would it be possible?

I've always been fascinated by cybersecurity although I always thought it'd be more of a hobby than a job for me. But I've understood that's not the case, I want something that excites me intelectually and challenges me to be better. I want to work in cybersecurity.

1gymg53,Need Career Advice - Is the Salary Boost Worth the Trade-Off?,"- **Current Job:**
  - 32 years old, earning $115k in a small company.
  - 25-minute commute, good work-life balance.
  - Job is easy but not much room for growth.
  - Company is facing business issues; home office is now 1 day/week.

- **New Job Offer:**
  - Offer from a major company in a leading industry at $150k.
  - Negotiated a permanent contract because the position is through consultancy.
  - Requires relocating to a more expensive part of the city to keep a 30-35 minute commute.
  - Home office likely 2-3 days/week (a big plus).

**Challenges with New Job:**

- **Cost of Living:** Need to rent in a pricey neighborhood (~$3k/month vs $2.4k elsewhere), and possibly buy a car. This absorbs 70% of the salary increase.
- **Stability:** Role is funded for a year, but nothing is guaranteed beyond that. They did promise otherwise but who knows. Having that company on the CV would be a plus.
- **Commute:** Slightly longer (35 minutes), restrict me to 1 neighbourhood unless I sacrifice on the commute time.

**Questions:**

- Is the career boost worth the higher living costs and commute?
- Would the job stability and career potential outweigh the financial strain?

---

**TL;DR:** Got an offer from a big company for $150k, but it comes with a higher cost of living and more commuting. Is it worth it for the career boost, or should I stay in my current role with a better work-life balance?",Saayaminator,1,1.0,0,1732437441,2024-11-24 08:37:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gymg53/need_career_advice_is_the_salary_boost_worth_the/,11,2024

1gykgl6,[CFA + PMP] Need Career Advice – Are These the Right Next Steps?,"Hi everyone,

I’m at a point where I’m reflecting on my career and planning for the future. I’ve had some diverse experiences so far, but now I want to focus on building the right skills to grow and stay relevant. I’d love your advice on my next steps!

Here’s a bit about my journey:

* I graduated in 2021 with a **Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering**. My first job was as a **Design Engineer** for a US-based startup, but it didn’t feel like the right fit. I applied for an internal **Project Manager** role and transitioned into managing **150+ clients across the US and Canada** in the **solar energy sector**, focusing on residential, commercial, and utility-scale solar permits. I worked closely with structural and electrical teams to streamline processes.
* After almost two years, I decided to explore new opportunities and joined my current organization, a **state nodal agency for startups**. Initially, I worked in the **communications team**, handling social media, reports, and related tasks.
* After six months, I moved to my current role in **global relations and market access**, where I manage **international partnerships**, help startups connect with global markets, and facilitate participation in events like GITEX.

While I enjoy my work, I know the importance of staying **multidisciplinary** in today’s world, especially with the rise of AI. I see gaps in the startup ecosystem that I believe I can fill with the right skills, particularly in areas like **investment promotion, finance, and project management**.

Here’s my plan to future-proof my career:

1. Pursue the **CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) certification** to develop strong financial and investment expertise. Completing all three levels is a long-term goal, but I believe it’s worth it.
2. Earn the **PMP (Project Management Professional) certification** to refine my project management skills and better execute large-scale initiatives.

In the future, I see these skills complementing my role if I transition into **investment promotion** or other allied fields. I want to position myself as someone who can drive global partnerships and bridge gaps in the ecosystem, especially in areas like funding and project execution.

I’m willing to dedicate the next five years to achieving this, but I’d love to hear your thoughts:

* Do CFA and PMP sound like a good combination for my background and goals?
* How can I balance pursuing these certifications with my current responsibilities?
* Are there any other certifications or skills I should explore to stay competitive?

Thanks for reading this far—I really appreciate any advice or insights you can share!",monk6819,1,1.0,0,1732429025,2024-11-24 06:17:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gykgl6/cfa_pmp_need_career_advice_are_these_the_right/,11,2024

1gyixmp,Stay or Go,"I currently work for a company which in June my boss suggested I consider interviewing for a high position in another company we have a good relationship with for my own career growth. I currently make 58k per year. I’m arguably the best worker at my employment level. My coworkers make between 44-65k and there is no further advancement opportunities. Coworkers making 65k have been with the company for 10 or more years I’ve only been with the company three. 

I interviewed with the new company, and it is expected that I will receive a job offer shortly for 70k. I would have a higher position and better pay. 

My current company which has been encouraging me to seek a higher position with this new company however is now back tracking and does not want to lose me. Ive essentially been told they will attempt to match what I’m offered.

I’m conflicted because I only interviewed for a new position at the advice of my current company. I feel like I will be burning my relationship with this new company for the rest of my career and while a pay-raise is welcome just feels like an odd position for my company to put me in. I would have never asked for a pay raise or interviewed had they not strongly suggested I seek a higher position in our partner new company.

1gyiej0,Should I Stay in My 6-Month Contract with Samsung or Leave for a Full-Time Amazon Role?,"Hi Reddit, I’m a single-income female in my late 20s, living in a high cost of living (HCOL) area, and I'm at a career crossroads. I’ve recently started a 6+ month contract with Samsung, which has the potential for extensions. I’ve been contracting for about 2.5 years (which is pretty common in my industry—entertainment), and before that, I was a full-time employee for 2.5 years at a major entertainment company.

The Samsung contract offers paid holidays, 15 days of PTO (eligible after 3 months), and I opted for private health insurance (\~$400/month). While it’s not the highest-paying job, it feels like a stable option for now as I continue to search for full-time work. I also don’t want to burn any bridges, as my industry is small and niche, and I take pride in leaving on good terms.

That brings me to the Amazon opportunity: I’m in the final rounds of interviews, and it looks promising. If I get the offer, I’d have to leave Samsung early, and I’m concerned about the consequences of doing so. On top of that, there’s always the risk of layoffs, and I’d be starting in January when layoffs tend to happen. That said, the role seems fairly low-intensity, and I’m not overly worried about burnout.

So here’s the dilemma: Should I stick with Samsung for the stability, or make the jump to Amazon and potentially face the risk of layoffs or burnout?

Would love to hear from others who have been in similar situations—what would you do in my shoes?",lalaland_0824,2,1.0,2,1732421424,2024-11-24 04:10:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gyiej0/should_i_stay_in_my_6month_contract_with_samsung/,11,2024

I'd be lying if I said the title wasn't important to me. I've been grinding for two years, had excellent reviews and feel my performance and responsibilities are at an executive level already. Thinking ahead if I get a raise with no title I'm afraid it will appear as if I was stagnant.

1gyena0,DAE feel like illusory causation is ruining their career?,"**TL;DR:** Intern for 6 months at a big company, never felt connected with colleagues or manager. Struggle with overthinking and feeling unappreciated. Asked to consider leaving early due to holiday conflicts, but panicked thinking I was being fired. Received mixed feedback, worried about getting a recommendation.

Sorry this is a bit long, but I've been an intern for six months at a very large and prominent company and I've never felt like I've had the greatest relationship with any of my colleagues, especially the ones I work closest with like my direct manager.

I have a bad, but not entirely unwarranted habit of finding illusory causation when there maybe isn't any, which kind of reached a boiling point yesterday when my manager and her manager (director) suggested I think about leaving the role early. My end date is currently January 3rd, but they brought it up due to the holidays conflicting heavily with my last week (team travel, holiday plans, etc). Immediately jumped to the idea that I was being fired or let go, and freaked out a little bit.

I was already not feeling the best about a conversation I had with my manager the previous evening asking me not to stay on past my set end time, which admittedly has been brought a few times, but I was trying to wrap up an email to send out so I had one less thing to worry about the next day. I've also felt that the team has been neutral at best towards me and I can't tell if I'm liked or if my work is actually appreciated. If I were asked if my team liked working with me, at this point, I would say no - I don't even think I'm getting a positive recommendation. Here are some other feedback items I've received over the course of the internship:

\- Lacking in gratitude (I saw thank you quite often, I averaged it out on Slack that I said thank you at least four times per day. I still don't know where this is coming from).

\- Need to be more intentional and considerate of people's time when arranging meetings

\- Need to stop overcomplicating things (I admittedly have a tendency to over support my self when it's not needed - such as providing a proposal with research completed vs just sending over a brief slack message with an idea)

Nothing disrespectful or distasteful was said, but I was insistent about arranging a 1:1 that day to discuss and clear up some of my perceived notions I assumed before accepting the offer - my manager did not seem to understand how a feedback 1:1 pertained to myself considering to leave the internship early, and I feel like this is just another nail in the coffin.

I'm also kind of sensitive to tone, so if I think someone sounds annoyed or mad, it makes me quite anxious.",PossibleAggeentt,1,1.0,1,1732409272,2024-11-24 00:47:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gyena0/dae_feel_like_illusory_causation_is_ruining_their/,11,2024

1gyd36n,Should I Leave Or Stay? (Paid Media Job) ,"**Current Role**  
I've been with my company for nearly two years, working in a specific brand division on PPC and paid media. It was one of the best jobs I’ve had—until it became too corporate, and the company culture shifted. We’re part of a larger organisation, and this year has been tough in terms of trading. As a result, most of my team was made redundant due to restructuring.

I saw it coming, as leadership made some poor decisions, assuming the business could keep growing at the same rate as during Covid. Now, I’m the only one left in my role and was TUPE-transferred to a centralised marketing function.

I’m three weeks into this transfer, but the new team doesn’t feel the same as my old one. Previously, I thrived in a smaller division where I was the sole PPC specialist, making it easier to build a strong reputation and progress. I currently earn close to £40k, which is decent, but in this larger parent company, I feel like progression depends more on who you know than what you achieve.

**The Job Offer**  
During the consultation process, I applied for another role and recently received an offer. It comes with a £6k pay increase (plus a bonus), which is tempting. My current role only requires me to go into the office once a month, which has been great for work-life balance, but it also feels isolating. The new job requires being in the office three times a week, but the commute is much shorter than my current one.

**My Concerns**  
When I was transferred, I was told the business would be reviewed again in six months. If the brand division gets shut down, I could be at risk of redundancy again, as there wouldn’t be a paid media account to manage. This insecurity is a big reason I applied for the new role.

On the other hand, I’m anxious about leaving. I’ve gotten comfortable here, and starting a new job with probation and the unknown is daunting. I also loved my old team, and work was enjoyable because of them. But now they’re gone, and the work environment just isn’t the same.

I’m torn. The extra money would help, but starting over feels overwhelming. At the same time, staying here feels risky given the potential for future redundancies.

But I'm mediocre at best at the languages I speak so I can't use them in a professional setting, and I have no interest in becoming a language teacher as I don't like speaking in front of lots of people.

1gyc3m3,¿Should I stay on this job for a little bit or should I move to the big city?,"Hello,

I'm a recent graduate student from Mexico, and recently i just acquired this job, even though I feel grateful that I've been given this opportunity, I feel that I can accomplish what I really want to do on Mexico City, but I don't know if it is cautious to leave the job early and start over on the big city, so my idea is the following:

  
a) Stay on this job and do some illustrations/projects off side to add it to my portofolio, while I work over here (even if it's not the area that I really want to develop on the future) and then move to the big city when I feel like it's time.

b) give up the job and start on the big city so I can develop my career in the area that I want

1gyc1sn,Career Advice Wanted/Needed,"I'm 23F who recently graduated from a private university with a BA in biology in May this yr. Did a semester of direct research assistance with a biology professor during junior yr. Also took many science courses ofc but a good number involved doing research, wet lab work, and hands on experience in biology (microbiology, genetics, etc). Currently working as a medical assistant in a outpatient clinic full-time but my skills aren't up to their standards (my first healthcare role ever). I'm getting a bit worried and stressed if this job doesn't work out as I hoped. I've only worked a couple retail/cashier jobs, 1 medical manufacturing job, and 1 fast food job prior to graduating college.

  
Are there jobs people would recommend for me that have decent pay? I don't want to work in retail or fast food again as I've been harassed far too much and hated working there but they were all I could do without my college degree. I live with my parents and just covering utilities so I'm not too worried about my financial situation unless my current job ends up not working out as some point. Idk if they're laying me off soon but it seems they might with my lack of skill improvement).

I really do not enjoy school as I am not a great test taker (I have severe testing anxiety that developed 2 yrs ago). I have people telling me I'm intelligent but I find myself terrible with studying when prepping for any exams for school. Hoping others out there post college who can give some advice, esp those in biology or science on what path to take.

1gybxmi,Suggestions on how to grow my career (Admin),"I have a fantastic job that meets my personal needs of work/family flexibility, amazing team culture and fantastic employees. 

My title is admin, but it's a small company and I've found that title encompasses a lot, as I am the one and only admin. I currently manage a large portion of client interactions, job scheduling, getting contracts up and running from an admin side of things, staff schedules, updating staff on regulation changes, some personal assistant tasks, maintaining the office area and more. As big part of what I have been doing is establishing and improving the administrative flow. Moving forward, I'll be taking a more active role in managing finances and will have another admin member working under my guidance. 

How do I grow with this career? I have no formal education after high school, but spent many years working as an accountants assistant. I would say I have a decent amount of skills for the role, but could definitely benefit from further education. 

My goal isn't to upskill and move on as I want to grow with this business. What should I be doing to help that? ",Sprinksi,1,1.0,0,1732401575,2024-11-23 22:39:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gybxmi/suggestions_on_how_to_grow_my_career_admin/,11,2024
1gybnvu,Afraid of resigning and being interrogated or even smeared by my superiors,"First off, unlike the US, my country has a two-months’ notice when an employee resigns. This period starts the following month after the resignation, so it’s actually even longer. It IS mandatory by law. Ignoring it and just not showing up may lead to a lawsuit, big fine and loss of future unemployment benefits (even years later). This same law applies to employers as well – they can’t fire you on spot but must keep you for two more months instead. An employee doesn’t have to state the reason for the resignation. An employer can’t refuse to accept the resignation, but many try to refuse it. Please do NOT suggest anything like “just don’t come anymore” – no, I am not getting fined and sued!

Now to my situation. I already have a new job which is waiting for me. They understand the laws, so two months aren't a problem. I plan to put in my notice next week, starting the period in December. I am currently on the sick leave, but I feel good enough to bring it in myself (it’s safer than sending it by mail). However, I will likely have to see the director sooner or later. She is genuinely out of her mind and intentionally humiliates everyone she sees. She keeps promising massive raises which she never provides, not even to her own managers. I really don’t want to see her, but I can’t avoid it, definitely not for two full months. I have been to her office before - she won’t let me leave until I spill the beans. I have an excuse ready (very low salary), but she will just promise me a massive raise she won’t fulfil. My other excuse is that I can’t actually raise or develop my skills here.

Telling her “no” could actually ruin my future. She is a millionaire with extreme power in the region, has many contacts in our field, and has even bribed her way out of lawsuits (I found out after getting this job). I can’t say “no” and storm out. I can’t even mentally handle it, struggling with severe anxiety and other issues. If she wants to, she will ruin me. I am not exaggerating. This entire job is so hyped up everywhere and I loved to be able to finally work in my field after desperately needing the money, but then I found out what it is really about. My own superior (manager) who is nicer than the director could ruin me as well, as he is pretty famous. It once felt like a big honour to work for him, given his status. The truth hurts. And I ignored it for too long.

I am terrified of the next week and the next two months. I am terrified of resigning and then having to talk to them. I obviously can’t avoid them at work. And I legally can’t leave right away, even if they wanted (they can’t legally fire me on spot either). I am terrified of being pressured into revealing the true reasons (which I do not want to say, but trust me, there is a lot to say), of having my name smeared (privacy is not respected here) or having been given false promises. I can try to just see the HR with my resignation, but the director shares the space with him and will immediately know, plus the HR often openly lies to us employees and can't keep secrets.

Please, if anyone has any advice, let me know. Actual advice (no jokes and no “just leave now”!). How to mentally prepare for ultimately seeing my superior and the director? How to get out from the meeting as soon as possible? How to respond to what I know are lies but obviously can’t say it openly (like ""we will give you a raise"")? How to react if they refuse to accept my resignation (she thinks she is above the law, so quoting it is useless)? How to keep my future reputation as intact as possible?

Thank you all.",Sally_Throwaway_12,1,1.0,5,1732400830,2024-11-23 22:27:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gybnvu/afraid_of_resigning_and_being_interrogated_or/,11,2024
1gybc72,Do I take the higher paying job?,"I am an architect, and I recently just left a toxic work environment. Over the last weeks, I've been interviewing for new opportunities. This is the situation:

**About Me:**

* I have always worked in small offices/start-ups. I am used to having to do a bit of everything, because it was the fastest way to learn all aspects of the profession without being pigeon holed in a specific role. This usually means more stress and having to take on additional responsibility.

* I recently just acquired my professional license. Eventually my dream is to open up my own studio, however I would like to gain more experience in the types of projects that I envision myself doing when I go out on my own. 

* I am very particular about which offices I work at because for me the type and execution of projects is very important. Some offices I would never work at because I don't believe in their vision/ethos, or they lack focus (they do all types of projects for any clients). 

* I have never worked in a big office with actual structure, procedures and departments. I would like to try this work environment before I do my own thing. I would also like to be exposed to international projects because it's something I also envision myself trying. 

**Company A:**

* They are a bigger, established office with internal departments, so this would be a new experience for me which I want. International projects are a possibility. 

* Not a company I ever imagined myself working in, but I got headhunted and was offered a job immediately. Pay is 6k more than what I had at the last toxic company. In all my experiences interviewing, I was never straight up offered a job on the first interview and I am weary about this.

* Their portfolio of projects has no focus since they do everything. I do not know what I will actually be working on. 

* The company made up a story about the director being abroad to get me to interview on very short notice on a Saturday. Later I realised they lied to me just to get me in quickly. I also saw people working in the office on that Saturday. 

* Questionable work/life balance. The contract states that OT pay ""may"" be compensated and they have an OT structure, but there is no official mechanism that guarantees that OT is paid. They said that they take their employee's word on this.

* I know a client of theirs and they said that employees from this office change often (high turnover?) and that they're often sending emails late into the night. This contradicts the company's story that they never lose employees to competitors and that the option to do OT is ""voluntary"". 

* Probation period: 4 weeks. Notice period: 4 months. Shorter commute.

**Company B:**


* A small office, so an environment that I'm used to working in. No exposure to international projects. 

* A company that I had interviewed with in the past over the years, as I like their work. Initially they offered me 1k less than what I had at my toxic company, but after negotiating on the second interview they offered me a 2.5k increase over my last job. No OT pay.

* A portfolio of projects that I imagine myself doing when I'm on my own. I can gain relevant experience here.

* Office culture and team dynamics seem to be better as they are very careful with who to bring in. An hour of unpaid OT everyday seems to be the norm. Company seems to be a bit jumpy since they are very busy right now, and the position was open because they are envisaging a lot more work in the near future. 

* Software issues - this company has a different software workflow than the one I'm used to. There would be an adjustment period for me at the start as I need to learn this on the job (they will not provide training but other employees will help me when I get stuck).

* Various monthly team building events. 

* Probation period: N/A. Notice period: N/A. (no info yet). Longer commute.

**Company C**

* The biggest company out of these 3. The most established and corporate, with internal departments and resources. International projects and assignments are possible. 

* No offer yet since they need to confirm if they obtain this big project or not. My employment would depend on this project getting through. This could take weeks or months. They do not offer OT pay.

* Projects are often of a bigger scale with bigger budgets. Not the type of work I really imagined myself doing on my own as the projects are massive. But it would be a great opportunity to try, and scale it to something smaller when I go solo. 

* They seem to value work/life balance, and they can afford to invest in employee training and advancement. Various monthly team building events. 

* Probation period: N/A. Notice period: N/A. (no info yet). Shortest commute.

**Situation:**

Company A was the first to offer so I signed. Company B decided to come forward with their offer today. The net difference between A and B is only 2.6k yearly as the majority of it is eaten up by tax. There are a lot of unknowns about the work environment at Company A that put me off, as well as the dishonest tactics they already used on me which left a bad taste in my mouth. I am considering ditching the higher paying offer of Company A to go with Company B as the work is more in line with what I want to do. 

Company C are my preferred option, as they seem like they have their stuff together and that they have a good work/life balance. They also offer an environment that I have not personally experienced yet with opportunities for growth. However, they are the only company that haven't offered, and with the pace they've been going, I imagine it will be months before I see a concrete offer. 

**TL;DR**

What would you do? Would you ditch the higher offer from a seemingly dishonest company for the lower offer from a more ""genuine"" company? Does more money in hand trump ethics?",gbejniet,1,1.0,0,1732399961,2024-11-23 22:12:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gybc72/do_i_take_the_higher_paying_job/,11,2024

I’m essentially looking for a 2 year degree job that will make me a decent amount of money (like $60-70k a year and up) if that is possible. 

I also don’t want to an intense schooling but if that’s the deal breaker then i guess that’s something I will have to put up with. and maybe a community college so i can actually afford to live on my own, take care of my dogs, pay my bills, and pay for school haha

1gya6b2,People who have had disciplinary investigations/hearings and have made it out with/without warning - tell me about it?,"I am currently on suspension with full pay pending a disciplinary investigation. My company is charging me with gross misconduct allegations in the UK. 

Reason for those allegations - my manager was suppose to be convey my leave to upper management and failed to do so. When upper management pulled her, she threw me under the bus saying that I had not been completely clear with her. I have evidence of our Teams conversations and the leave in her Outlook calendar accepted by her. 

I have done very well and have been with this employer for 7 months. My manager was very nice and even checked in with me during my leave and I shared information with her about my trip because I was doing every correctly imo. 

I feel like I would never be able to recover from this and I am in the first year of my career. I want to go into research and PhD but I wanted to work for a year or two more. I feel like my life is over and that I will never recover from this. I feel that this would always be a spot on my reputation. Can I escape it? Can I still have a career?

1gy9iq9,How selfish should I be in making career decisions?,"I recently left a job after nearly 10 years. I loved that place for a long time and was considered a core member of the team. It was a big deal to me to leave and took a long time to make the decision, but it was no longer a place I felt like I could achieve the things I want to.

I took essentially the same position at another company very shortly after leaving. The new place is smaller (35-40 people) and (I was told) has a more relaxed pace than what I was accustomed to. This was appealing as I was quite tired and burnt out after having pushed so hard for growth in my last role.

Fast forward 6 weeks and my work life is insanity. I’m in a leadership position and meant to be managing the department and the business (new business, team management, etc.) but am instead actively delivering nearly 10 projects simultaneously. I’m told this is a total anomaly, that we are just in a very very busy time, and the start of the year will be more like what I expected.

I’m trying to decide if I believe my new position will shape up enough for me to love it, or if I should change course. If I don’t stay, I will work for myself. I have a good pipeline of work already that would more than sustain me working on my own. My biggest question is: is this short stint enough of a stain that I need to stick it out? If I jump ship, I will burn a bridge and leave people in a pretty tough position even though I’m promised things will get better.

1gy6zym,"To take “high-paying” and “prestigious” position, or move closer to family with short-term job uncertainty? ","Hello! 

I’m currently facing what feels like the first major career decision of my life, and I’m completely torn. I’d love to hear any advice or insights you might have.

I’m a 29M working as an epidemiologist. I’ve been out of school for about a year and a half and have been working in a decent job with a good salary since graduating. Recently, I was offered a full-time position at a prestigious public health agency in Canada. This role would pay about $25,000 more than my current salary, and it’s at a place I’ve always dreamed of working. It would look great on my resume and could open up a lot of career opportunities down the line.

Here’s the dilemma: this job is in a city I haven’t enjoyed living in. I’ve been here for about four years (I moved here for school) and have wanted to move back closer to my family and friends for some time now. If I take this position, I’d almost certainly need to stay here for another 1–2 years.

Adding to the complexity, my long-term partner is also thinking about moving. She’s been wanting to leave her current job, travel for a bit, and eventually settle somewhere else. If I accept this position, it could pressure her to stay in the city longer than she wants, or we might need to spend time apart.

If I take this job, I’ll be prioritizing my career and financial growth in the short term, likely staying here for at least a couple more years and potentially without my partner.

On the other hand, I could choose the uncertainty of passing up this opportunity, face short-term job insecurity, and move back to my home province to try to build a life closer to my family and friends.

The career-focused side of me says I’d be foolish to pass on such a prestigious opportunity. But the family-oriented side of me worries that I might regret not taking the chance to move closer to loved ones now, especially as life moves quickly for everyone.

I know this kind of dilemma isn’t unique, but I’d really appreciate any advice or perspectives you might have. Have you been in a similar situation? How did you decide?

Thanks for reading and for any advice you might have!

1gy6n6o,Got a Job Without an Interview—Offer Letter Feels Off. Need Advice?,"Hey folks I'm a developer with 1 YOE recently I got an offer for an Android Developer role at a remote Ed-Tech company that has 8 employees, but the process feels a bit off.

There was no interview—just an assignment. I completed it, and the CTO offered me the same CTC and asked when I can start. I requested a hike, but he said we’d discuss it after the paid probation period.

They sent the offer letter, but it doesn’t have any signature from the CEO or higher-ups. I asked the CTO today if it could be countersigned, and he said, ""Yeah, HR will get it countersigned."" However, I contacted HR for clarity, and there’s been no response yet. There’s also an NDA included.

I checked the company’s reviews online, and there are only 3 reviews, so it’s hard to judge.

Currently, I’m with an organization where my CEO told me I’m free to move on since there’s no work here.

When I applied for this job, the max salary was about $5000 less than what I have been used to. HR told me that they were hoping to hire on the low end of the spectrum which would have put me at about $15,000 less than normal.
I told HR what my minimum would be, which would have put me at about $5000 less than the maximum (and that puts me at 10,000 less than what I typically would be going for). 
💥💥 If I get an offer for $5000 less than their maximum which is $10,000 less than what I’m typically used to …. how do I negotiate this?

But that doesn't matter if I'm under a lot of stress no matter the position my hand trembled and I can't hold the pencil. I also get stressed very easily to the point my school made me get into therapy. I know my dreams are to big and I should find another career, but I love the studies of the human body, their organs, their bones, everything and it's sad that I'll never be able to pursue the career because of my shaky hands and my stress issues.

1gy56ry,Can someone help with career ideas?,"
I’m definitely ready to move on from what I’m currently doing, but I’m struggling to figure out what I could switch over to. I will give an overview of my education/experience for context:

- BS in Business Management
- 1 year GM of a small, fast casual restaurant (10-15 employees). Don’t really want to get back into food service. 
- 6 years with a F500 company who provides rental uniform and linen services (there are only a few big names in the industry). 
4.5 years as a service/sales rep which is delivering the products to the customers and servicing the accounts, building relationships with key decision makers, securing service agreements with existing accounts, growing the accounts by finding more products and services to penetrate the account with, and hitting route KPI’s. 
1.5 years of being a service supervisor, leading a team of 15 service/sales reps where my main focus is coaching, teaching, and developing these reps to ultimately provide the customer with the best experience. Also indirectly oversee another 25 reps within the department, making 40 total. Also responsible for presenting safety meetings and making sure we stay compliant, driving sales in our existing accounts, staying on top of service agreement renewals, a ton of problem solving and handling upset customers, finding win-win solutions even in bad situations, coordinating with other departments internally, building relationships with customers, overseeing a multitude of KPI’s, etc. 

I’ve found that I really enjoy problem solving and staying extremely organized. I think I have a knack for operations. I also really like the thrill of getting a big sale. I have been interested in getting into sales, but not sure where I could start with my limited experience, not ever having new business sales under my belt, just existing customers. 

I could really use some suggestions. Thank you in advance. ",MrBigBeez,1,1.0,0,1732383711,2024-11-23 17:41:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gy56ry/can_someone_help_with_career_ideas/,11,2024
1gy4zk2,I lost all motivation at work until I realized WHY. The Two-Factor Theory changed my entire approach,"We tend to approach work satisfaction as a binary. Either satisfied or dissatisfied. For the most part, there are so many factors that cause us to be unhappy with our work… and often, we can’t precisely identify why. Psychologist Frederick Herzberg devised the Two-Factor Theory to discuss workplace motivation. He broke it down into:

* Motivators: Markers of job satisfaction
* Hygiene Factors: Markers of job dissatisfaction

Very often, we can never find the motivation needed if our basic work ‘hygiene factors’ are not met. This was extremely interesting for me to learn about and I wanted to break it down for you here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5Wfk4zWd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le5Wfk4zWd8)

1gy22oj,No Title Hierarchy at my Company,"I (26M) am a manufacturing process engineer at a shoe company. I am having a blast and have had a ton of success in my first 8 months, however I am beginning to worry about something. 

The engineering team is very small, it’s just me and two other engineers, and a few techs. As such, no title hierarchy has been established for the department. My manager has said that we are small and do not need it. So my title will forever just be “manufacturing process engineer,” instead of advancing to Engineer II, Engineer III, Senior, Principle, etc. 

My biggest worries with this are:

1. There is no established incentive to give me a big bump in pay as I rack up years of service and accomplish goals. Ex: My coworker who has been there 7 years says he has only ever received a standard raise 3-5% (this could be related to his performance, though he seems pretty competent). 

2. My resume wont be able to show any impressive title or evidence of promotions. The aforementioned coworker is much older than me and already has “Senior” from a previous job on his resume so he is not worried about this factor like I am. 

I am not sure if it is normal at other companies to work this way with their engineering staff? My previous company had the full hierarchy and solid bumps in pay with them too. I only left because my wife and I bought a house further away. I fear I will fall behind early in my career if I stay at my current company too long. 
Almost all of my colleagues who I graduated with (MechE degree) are Engineer IIs at this point, and I suspect are making more than me now. 

Am I worrying too much about this title hierarchy? 

Annual raises are coming up so I will have to see what happens there.

Personally I make 75k but thought the work life balance was amazing and the work we do was something I believed in and helped people so I stayed. 

What kills me is that I still have a rank of a BA2 an experienced BA or junior which is what you get when you have no experience.

1gxzxp5,Red Flag in hiring process?,"I was approached by a recruiter for a very attractive position in production management. Hiring manager and HR representative both left a very good first impression. Yesterday they gave me a tour of production which is when I found out the person who currently holds the position is unaware they are recruiting a replacement. Now I can't think of any reason why they would do this secretly - as far as my logic goes they could either be planning to promote them - but then why should they not tell them? Plus, from the org chart I saw the only position they could promote them to would be the one that's the hiring manager now - so in that case, why would they not include them in hiring the replacement they would then have to work with? Or they could be planning to fire them - but that is legally difficult where we are based, they would need a good reason. So if they have a very good reason (like gross misconduct), I'd expect the company to fire the Person right away and not drag this until a replacement is found. And if they have a weak reason (like ""Performance issues"") there's a not so small likelihood they'd fight being fired in court so why should anyone be stupid enough to sign as a replacement when firing the person could be dragged out over months?

It’s my lowest-paying job so far, but I took it to get my foot in the door in finance.

A little about me:

I recently earned my bachelor's degree in Finance.

My past roles include:

Relationship Banker (current)

Customer Success Manager

Operations Manager

Sales Advisor


I’d love to pivot to a hybrid or fully remote position. Im open to still going into the office but something where I can focus on my tasks and work more independently as long as I meet deadlines. Ideally, I’m also looking for a role with opportunities to grow within the company. 

I'm open to give more information if needed.",Sneakystocks,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1732368997,2024-11-23 13:36:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxzrw3/feeling_burnt_out_and_looking_for_career_advice/,11,2024
1gxzny9,Need advice - Am I overthinking things?,"I‘m 32 years old and currently working in a position where I earn 115k in a small company with a 25 minute commute. They have some business trouble and are quite small so I cannot expect getting better from them. The location is ideal, as it’s in the city Center, which would make relocation easy without affecting my commute time. Indeed, I feel the need to move to a bigger apartment, although it would be tricky with my current salary. The team is nice, but it’s not a major factor for me. The job itself is easy and gives me a good work life balance. However they are moving to 1 Home Office day only which does bother me.

Recently, I received an offer from a much bigger company - a leader in its field with a huge market. After some negotiation, I managed to secure a contract for 150k. The position is through a consultancy agency, but I negotiated the contract to be permanent, which gives me more security. However, the catch is that the company‘s location would require me to move to a more expensive area of the city in order to keep a reasonable commute. But, the company is much more progressive on home office time and the team told me I could get at least 2 home office days, maybe even 3.

With the new role, my commute would be around 30-35 minutes, but to stay in the city, I‘d need to rent in a very expensive neighbourhood. The budget for an apartment in that area is around 3000/month, compared to 2400/month anywhere else in the city. So, a good chunk of the salary increase would go toward covering the new apartment costs and need for a car. Also, for my quality of life requirements, only that single area would work which makes it quite less flexible.

The company assured me that my position is funded for a year and that they will either renew it or internalise the role. But, as we all know, nothing is guaranteed, and the job market can change. On the other hand, this company is massive and a leader in its field, which could be great for my resume. Plus their industry is generally less impacted by economic downturns.

1gxz1r2,I Can’t Quit: The Reality of Being Stuck on an H1B Visa with an Abusive Employer,"Where do I even start? I’m on an H1B visa, which means if I quit my job, I have only 60 days to find another employer willing to sponsor me. If I don’t, I’ll have to leave the U.S. — the country where I’ve built my entire life. But here’s the kicker: I work for an emotionally abusive employer, and the situation keeps getting worse.

I’ve been at this company for a few years, and the red flags were there from the beginning. The threats started when my boss decided anyone who didn’t work until 8 PM (almost 12-hour days) was “inefficient.” If you don’t answer his calls, no matter the time of day, he gets furious. We’re expected to be available 24/7.

It gets crazier. He presented us a contract (didn’t sign) with absurd clauses like:
	1.	Mandatory workouts that he personally approves (including the time and type).
	2.	Deductions for “unapproved” PTO, even for emergencies like getting sick or a family crisis.
	3.	If you’re on vacation and he decides he needs you, he can demand you come back to work immediately.

People don’t last long here. A few years ago, he tried to withhold nearly $6,000 he owed me in tax reimbursements. It was only after I pushed hard that I got my money back, and I later learned he pulled the same stunt with another associate.

I feel trapped. If I quit without securing another job that sponsors my visa, I’ll be forced to leave the U.S. within three months. But my home country isn’t an option — I’ve built my entire life here, and there’s nothing left for me back there.

What can I do? How do I escape this situation while staying in the U.S.?

1gxy12f,Is It Okay to Lie About Your Legal Work Authorization While Applying for Jobs as an International Candidate?,"I've been applying for jobs for the last two months. I hold a Master's degree in STEM from the EU (I am from Asia), and based on my experience, most recruiters don’t clearly specify whether they can or will sponsor a work permit. Instead, they outright reject candidates without clarifying this upfront.

The most frustrating experiences have been with companies in the US. They often have super long application processes, and then, right on the last page, they ask about your work authorization status. These companies claim to be progressive and say they don’t discriminate, but based on my experience, I’m convinced they apply a filter for work authorization. I’ve received rejections within 5 minutes of submitting applications, which is disheartening after investing so much time and effort into filling out their forms.

Now, I don’t have any issue with companies having a preference for candidates who don’t require sponsorship. It’s their prerogative. But wouldn’t it make sense to clearly state upfront that they will not sponsor visas? Why waste the candidate’s time?

A friend recently suggested that I should just lie about my work authorization status during the application process. Their argument is that even if the company rejects you later, you could gain interview experience in the process, which might help with future opportunities.

* **1 year** working with CodeIgniter
* **1 year** working with React/React Native

My company is asking me to switch to Zoho Deluge, but I’m unsure about making the switch, especially since I feel React/MERN aligns more with my interests and skillset (I have 5 years of experience with JavaScript).

The big problem is, if I move out of my current company, I’m worried I won’t be able to find a position that offers ₹36k with my current profile. So, I’m stuck between staying and learning Zoho Deluge or pursuing React/MERN further.

(Since I have a family to feed so I need to generate income once I quit my finance job and focus on my ML career. Therefore, I need to choose a sub-field that would help me to earn doing freelance projects or hunting for a ML job.)

After moving back to my old company (current role) after a few months i was promoted into a management position, i enjoy the company culture but i have low pay for my role and my workload is enormous, but i feel i do a good job and get great feedback.

* it would likely be less stress than my current role and higher pay
* but in terms of career development, i think i have better opportunities in the future in my current role as the company is alot bigger, though i may not see a decent pay increase for several years and this is not gaurenteed

1gxsxv2,"Need Advice: Should I Consider ESOPs in My Offer? No Clear Exit/IPO Timeline
","Hey everyone,

I recently got an offer from a private company that's already well-established and operates in multiple countries. The CTC is top-tier and includes 20,000 ESOPs. Here’s the situation I need advice on:

1. ESOP Value: The average current value of the shares is \~₹130/share. This is not part of my CTC.
2. No Clear Exit Timeline: The company hasn’t provided any definitive timeline for an IPO or exit opportunity.
3. Limitations:
   * I can’t purchase more shares to increase my holding.
   * The company won’t buy back these shares after one year (or doesn’t have any formal plan for buybacks).

The uncertainty around the exit is making me question whether I should treat the ESOPs as an actual value-add to my CTC or not. My thought process right now:

* If the company eventually goes for an IPO or has a profitable exit, this could be a huge upside.
* However, if it doesn’t happen anytime soon, this could just be locked-up value with no benefit.

I’m considering asking the company to convert the ESOP value (\~₹130/share x 20,000) into cash and add it to my fixed CTC instead.

Would that be a better move? Or is it worth the risk to hold onto these ESOPs and wait for a potential exit? Any insights or experiences with ESOPs in private companies would be greatly appreciated!

1gxrnbn,Boss is pissed at me.. I’m not sure if it’s justified ,"Since I was hired, I have been forced to learn my job without guidance. The company is going through major improvements to make it scalable. 

My boss encourages me to find a flaw and do something to make it better. This was great… until it wasn’t. 

Long story short, I was assigned a department with areas of improvement. I took the initiative to create a task team and attack the dysfunction. The intent was to brainstorm the current flow and present a possible solution to my boss and the other department heads. This was NOT intended to be the new process - only suggestions. 

Because some of the material was ugly (very apparent issues), he felt blindsided when folks from the task team brought them up in conversation. He took it as I was making him seem like his department was garbage. This was not the intent… it was only to recognize issues and find possible solutions. I was only trying to help… 

I feel horrible. I get his point and we had a great relationship (hopefully still do). 

How could I recover from something like this? Yes, I should have brought the issues up to him as we were working to find a solution. But… I feel his reaction was an overreaction. 

At the end of the day… I am a young engineer that was likely too ambitious and tried to do something out of my lane. As a result, I pissed off my boss and likely others.

1gxrh9g,AIO? Is my manager gaslighting me? I don’t even know what is going on anymore. ,"Backstory: I’m a recruiter and we have some pretty massive goals for an early December start date. Was supposed to have hiring wrapped up last week but we have had almost 20 withdrawals at late stage so we still have some finals for next week. 

IT wasn’t planning on being in office, so someone was going to come in and ship equipment out next week so we could get people started. Someone else in IT told me that the guy planning on coming in was having car trouble and he lived 1.5 hours away from the office so wouldn’t be able to make it. IT has to set the laptops up and ship them so needed to get this figured out. The IT guy straight up told me no laptops would be able to ship. 

Made a thread with my leader (Director of People Ops) and the VP of Sales (who I work super closely with— wanted her to be in loop about the roadblock/anything that would affect hiring timelines. Plus I always just keep her in the loop) and outlined he wouldn’t be able to get into the office to do it due to car trouble and living far away. Asked me leader what our options were in order to ship equipment for December starts. 

My leader responded and said: “First, we should never share an employee's personal information with other team members, regardless of their level. Second, I can address this issue privately with [someone else in IT] to explore alternative options. It should be an easy fix.”

Fine. She’s working on it.

My leader then pinged me separately hours later and said:

“When you encounter a roadblock, try not to panic or assume the worst. Utilize the resources available to you (like me). Often, it just takes a conversation to express what we need instead of making demands—I'm not suggesting you made any demands at all.  Also,  laptop issues are not [VP of Sales] responsibility to fix.”

Responded nicely saying I didn’t mean to panic or escalate. And that I loop the VP of sales in if there’s anything that could affect hiring timelines. And that I’d make sure to just bring this directly to her (my leader) next time. 

She then said: “I know you had/have good intentions, let's correct or at least try first before telling everyone, and it creates more immense chaos that we don't need.”

I didn’t tell everyone???? Literally looped her in and my VP of sales. And I don’t think I created “immense chaos”. I’m very annoyed. This is the 5th instance of me having issues with her.

1gxr7dh,Should I stay at my current job or take the new one with a 15k raise?,"I am currently stuck between taking a new job (15k more) or staying with my current position. 

I like my current company. For the industry I am in, my company has a phenomenal reputation locally.
I’ve worked with them previously along with 15-20 similar companies (both local and national) and this company was always my favorite. Very put together with a coherent structure system. 

Upfront when I interviewed the management let me know the pay is bad. They still sold me on the idea of growth in the company. Which I now know doesn’t exist for my position. Best I would ever get is a $3 raise. However, I have always wanted to switch positions/fields in the industry. And this company would be a great opportunity for that. They have great management, amazing training, and offer opportunities to switch after 6 months. 

I know I would potentially be able to switch to a position I want career wise in the future and receive the training at this company. 

A few negatives other than pay… I do not get a 401k match, they have layoffs sometimes in the winter and offer part time employment / mixed with unemployment benefits until things get busy again. They are not fully remote. I do not drive so a 30 minute commute is a hassle (I have not told them this). They have let me work remote after a month or two. Super lenient (like I said a great company with easy going people). I got permission to work remote so I can go down south for a few months during the winter. But again, I would have to go back to hybrid if I come back. If I come back, I would have to stay with my parents. Which is not always enjoyable and no I would not permanently want to reside in the city for rent or owning a home.

Also, I’ve only worked there for about 5-6 months. I’ve never left a job this early in. I live in a small city where my family and I all work in the same industry. That negative perspective of leaving early might look bad.

MY NEW OFFER✨ 
I would be offered the highest salary for the current position I am in. Same industry, same position, same software system. 15k more. New position in the company so they are looking to expand and potential have a compensation plan down the line. I already see room for growth because I was interviewed by a “team lead” and “vp of the department.” Fully remote. Salary is $6 more an hour. 

Bad side, I saw reviews saying they layoff when things go bad. Immediately being a new “position” for the department, if it fails, I would be the first to go. Which from companies like this happens all the time. I’ve experienced it once before with a mass layoff of 6,000. 

THOUGHTS? Is 6 months too early to leave? Would I never be able to go back to that company? Should I just stay and hope to switch positions there?",Zealousideal-Play101,0,0.5,0,1732335414,2024-11-23 04:16:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxr7dh/should_i_stay_at_my_current_job_or_take_the_new/,11,2024

I've no interest in it, I even tried to redo it for 4 months and couldn't make up my mind
Then I came across joining Maac Academy for their multimedia & animation degree, I got interest immediately because I've been creative my whole life, I decided to go for degree because I heard some companies require degree for them to hire you.
I watched several videos and got enough knowledge about designing and decided to do it.(degree + I'd do freelancing as well)
I told my dad about it and he was supportive even tho he was a little criticising me, he had doubts if I coudnt do this or I'd leave it in middle as well.
There's alot of money getting spent if I join it
Have to pay rent,food, laptop and ofc the fees.
I've never made them spent this much money on me before, I don't want him to be stuck with loans again, I'm SO OVERTHINKING it that thoughts that coming in my mind tells me to quit taking this step. my neighbors, relatives all of them had made fun of me that I'd leave this as well and am gonna waste this much money, my confidence is slowly dying, excitement is fading away
And idk what to feel about this anymore 
Can I even make enough in future to repay this 3 lakh fees,70k-60k laptop and rest living expenses? Or I'll just... prove all these people right? 
Anyone who guides me in comments will help me alot, thanks",No_Mix8742,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1732333659,2024-11-23 03:47:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxqotd/decision_of_changing_my_career_path_towards/,11,2024
1gxqogi,"Better opportunity offered from competitor after only a few months with current job, how should I inform my current employer?","Hello!

I am a recent graduate from a master's program who had just completed my externship hours as of last week. I was lucky to get a position with my current employer to obtain the hours required to become fully licensed while gaining experience working in the field. 

However, I have been contacted by another employer who has offered a better opportunity including better pay, benefits, and will cut my commute down by more than half. I interviewed for the position and have since received an offer of employment. I would like to accept the offer, but I am anxious about trying to still remain respectful and grateful for the opportunity that was provided from my current employer. This nervousness is further compounded by the fact that I just completed my externship hours and now I'm leaving to go to another company. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to best approach this situation? I want to avoid anyone feeling like I used them as a means to an end.

Side note: We also have a work holiday gathering coming up in a week and I don't know if it would be appropriate for me to attend. Any advice or opinions on whether or not I should still attend?

1gxqgor,Bank MT?,"Hi,

I need your advice because I’m torn about whether to pursue this opportunity or not. I recently got accepted as a Management Trainee for a bank as an external applicant. I’m being cautious about sharing details due to an NDA, so please bear with me if I’m a bit vague.

As a trainee, my salary will be similar to what I currently receive. However, after a few months and successfully passing the probationary period, I’ll be regularized with a 40 percent increase in gross pay.

Currently, I live in the province where my job sustains my lifestyle and even allows me to save. The work environment here is great, with good work-life balance, ample training, and opportunities to take on acting leadership roles. The main issue is that I keep getting passed over for promotions, which has left me feeling frustrated and envious, though overall, my provincial life is comfortable and fulfilling.

The training for the new role will require me to relocate to Manila for a few months. I don’t have much information about the new job yet, so I’m struggling to weigh it properly. From what I’ve heard from former classmates in that agency, the work is demanding but financially rewarding, offering a sense of financial security.

I’m in my early 30s, and another concern is my aging parents. I worry about being far from them in case something happens, and the thought of leaving my comfort zone is daunting.

Most people I’ve consulted, including colleagues at my current job, have encouraged me to pursue this opportunity because of the bank’s reputation for competitive compensation, benefits, and growth opportunities. However, without concrete details, I’m hesitant to commit.

What do you think I should do?",DefyingGravity729,0,0.5,0,1732332904,2024-11-23 03:35:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxqgor/bank_mt/,11,2024

1gxq5zw,Navigating Uncertainty: Should I Stay or Explore New Opportunities?,"I recently transitioned from the industry to one of the consulting firms as a senior consultant. While the firm is still building its team in my area of expertise—hiring senior leaders and VPs—there have been limited project opportunities aligned with my skills. Over the past six months, I secured a project through my own networking within the business, where I was staffed 60% of the time and the rest on bench doing certifications. A couple of promising opportunities are currently in the pipeline.

However, my experience has been marked by significant turnover. The colleague who referred me left within a month (for a compelling opportunity), and now a senior leader and my direct manager is departing. Given these developments, I’m uncertain whether to stay and wait for stability or explore opportunities elsewhere.

1gxpluj,Manager Gave Bad Feedback to Coachee,"The company I work for assigns each employee a career coach for 1:1 feedback in addition to their manager. My manager gives me the raw feedback for my coachee and I compile it, share, and discuss it with them. In addition, my manager compiles a performance review that influences raises, promotions, etc. 

I have a coachee who joined our group about 10 months ago after leaving a different group where they were unsuccessful. They had 2 months of bad feedback from the previous group, but ever since they joined this group, their performance has consistently improved. For the past 2 feedback cycles, all of their scores have been between 3 and 5 on a 1-5 performance scale. 

Today I gave my career coachee their feedback which was that they've been performing well and moving in the right direction. They had areas to improve on, but nothing alarming. It was a positive conversation. 

After our meeting, our manager gave my coachee their performance review and gave them such a bad rating that it indicates they are in danger of being fired. My coachee reached out to me confused and upset because they got whiplash going from our meeting to the meeting with the manager. Based on the timing of the afternoon, I believe that my manager called them and gave the feedback on a quick 15 minute Teams meeting which feels to me like he didn't take it seriously. 

I dug into my feedback summary compared to the one from my manager and realized that he had basically emphaized all of the bad feedback from 10+ months ago and omitted all of the more recent positive feedback. He chose my coachees rating over a month ago and never notified me, setting me up to have a completely misleading meeting with them. 

I am very upset with my manager, both on my own behalf and my coachees. I don't believe that the poor rating was warranted, but even if I did, I think he handled the situation extremely unprofessionally by not involving me and presenting the review to my coachee in a dismissive way. 

How can I address this situation with my manager? Should I escalate to his boss?",Conscious-Custard755,0,0.5,1,1732330070,2024-11-23 02:47:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxpluj/manager_gave_bad_feedback_to_coachee/,11,2024

And this month is the same where I’ve seen quite a few clients and haven’t sold much. I just usually pitch what we are taught and try not to be overly pushy because I believe a no is a no. My coworker who has seen around the same clients as me has sold quite a bit, but yet the clients are those who just randomly call and want to sign up. Was put into a meeting explaining I’m being put on a 4 week PIP in hopes to improve selling memberships. I wasn’t ever told how important this was and was just simply looking for a front desk job. But based on reviews of my work customers do in fact get upset when we are overly pushy with our sales and think we pay low.

1gxm2jf,HELP Why is the GM next to my office acting weird?,"I’m a new trainee, and my office is located near the GM’s office. I used to know him from a distance as someone with a confident personality and a loud, assertive voice. He’s young but successful and never hesitates to assert his directions to everyone.

One random day, a director greeted me with a “Hi.” When I turned to him and replied, I noticed the GM standing right next to him. I was shocked because his eyebrows were raised, and he had a surprised expression as if he was shocked to watch me while I was talking. He was so quiet! I found it strange because he’s usually the loud one, but now he was nudging the director and seemingly telling him to ask me questions in front of him. It felt like he was the one saying, “Talk to her.”

Anyway, the Dirctor invited me to train in their department. After that, the director would occasionally check on me, but the GM never spoke to me again.

When he ( GM ) enters the office in the morning and we happen to make eye contact by coincidence, he looks quiet and almost scared. I don’t know how to describe it—he avoids eye contact and tries to look at the floor.

On another occasion, I saw him again during a company event. He noticed me and walked beside me hesitantly, slowing his pace a little. Then he turned around, still not looking at me, leaned toward me, and asked, “Which department are you working in?” I answered him, and he said, “If you need any help, we’re all here.” I thanked him, but he left without making any eye contact.

After that, he started STARING. He doesn’t talk to me, but he just stares. If our eyes meet by coincidence, he ALWAYES holds eye contact with boldness and confidence.

1gxkm32,“People quit bad bosses” - but there are so many bad bosses,"A common saying is “people don’t quit bad jobs, they quit bad bosses,” which I agree with. And, I see a lot of advice on Reddit saying when a boss becomes too toxic, look for a new job, secure one, then quit. But, it seems like there’s a lot of bad bosses out there- from both personal, friend/family experience, and here on Reddit. So, do people just keep cycling through jobs until they find a good/non-toxic boss? Or do they eventually find coping strategies?

1gxkln4,Managers broke confidentiality. ,"I came back from my 2 week vacation to work, 30 minutes later my manager pulled me aside to let me know we will have a talk. I wasn’t expecting much, more of a summary of what happened while I was away. 
I walked to the back with my manager to see another manager from a different team sitting beside the desk with some notes. 

I sat down and got told that there were accusations about me closing the store early. 
I got showed two cctv footage’s of me closing the store early by 10 minutes, i got told to explain what happened. 
I said to the two managers that the reason I closed the store those two times was because I needed to use the bathroom. The cctv shows me walking into the bathroom and coming out 8/9 minutes later. 
After that I got showed a cctv footage of me opening the store late by 14 minutes, again I got asked to explain. To that I replied with “I got stuck in traffic” as I do live 1h away from my job. 

I was then suspended for 48 hours, pending another meeting and was told to keep it confidential. 
Two days later a member of my family that works in another branch called me asking “why I got suspended?” I never told anyone about anything as I did get told that if I do I will get immediately fired. 
The word must of spread around as the only people there was myself, my manager and another manager. My family’s member manager was NOT present in the meeting. 

Clearly the managers have been talking amongst themselves and the word has spread, my family member is not a manager, just a colleague so it obviously gone beyond just managers talking. 
I find this incredibly unprofessional and unfair and I’m wondering what to do about this and what my options are. 

As a side note my manager who was present in the meeting, who also trained me said it was okay to close the store early and did so because “there’s no people in the store”. I was following the example my manager set me. 

This is in the UK by the way. ",Stigma12357,17,0.8500000238418579,11,1732315559,2024-11-22 22:45:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxkln4/managers_broke_confidentiality/,11,2024
1gxk8n5,"Which MHA Career Field Pays the Most, and How Long Does It Take to Get There?","I’m currently exploring career options in healthcare administration and trying to figure out which specialty to focus on. I’ve heard you typically choose a path like operations, strategy, finance, HR (some say an MHR is better for this), project management, facilities management, etc.

One recommendation I’ve gotten is to pursue operations because it’s always in demand, pays well, but can also be very demanding.

I have a few questions and would love your insights:

1. Among these career paths, which one offers the highest earning potential, and how long does it typically take to get there?
2. What does each of these roles actually entail on a day-to-day basis? Are there specific skills or traits that make someone successful in each area?
3. How did you decide on your specialty? Was it based on market demand, personal interest, work-life balance, or something else?
4. Are there particular pros and cons to each path that I should consider before making a decision?

1gxk2z2,Gracefully declining further interviews?,"I'm an engineer with 20 years of experience. 

TLDR:  
My old manager asked me about returning to work for him. I liked the work previously. But I don't like the company culture after a merger. I had a surprise Interview that I thought was going to be an informal chat. I feel like this whole thing has been a failure of communication. Now I'm being asked to fly over to interview in person. I'm not going to. What's the best way to communicate this and avoid burning bridges and offending a former colleague?



I worked for a really great company beginning in 2012.  I enjoyed the job, the culture, the people. But I was paid less than my male colleagues in similar roles, and the industry stagnated and promotions were not really available.  It wasn't all rosy, but I truly enjoyed the work.

Then there was a merger with our biggest competitor.  I survived the merger, but was transferred to a different type of role in a different department. I hated it. It was a terrible year, I didn't like the new culture, I found out I was making 35k - 45k less per year than the heritage competitor engineers who were doing the exact same job, even though I had 10+ years more experience. And the manager was a nightmare.  It was a blessing when COVID layoffs came around and I got a big severance package and could get out of there. 

I moved to a different state, and (eventually) landed in a job I enjoy again. But I miss my old hometown.

So when I got a phone call from my old pre-merger manager saying he's now the director of the engineering department and they wanted to hire someone to do the old job that I used to love, I talked to him about it. He didn't have all the details though - like pay range, and seniority of the position.   
So I agreed to talk to the HR guy (who I also know) for those details. I told him that I wouldn't relocate unless it's a strong offer, and I don't want to waste time, so let's figure that out. The HR guy said he didn't have that info, but he'd ask the hiring manager.  He set up a call for me to talk to the hiring manager.

I still thought this was all informal, to find out if am I interested etc. 

I joined a call later that week to find out that the hiring manager and his boss were expecting a formal technical interview. They had no idea I had history with the company and was expecting only a chat about the position summary. They jumped into very specific questions about a niche assessment I haven't done for over 5 years (and hadn't refreshed on because I'm not sure I'm even interested) and they were not impressed when I told them I'd need to refer to references and company policy to answer most of their questions. (To be clear, these were policy questions - ""what's the minimum acceptable clearance in this specific circumstance"", not basic ""do you remember the methodolgy and steps to do the assessment"".)

The interview left me annoyed with the process, and feeling like it went terribly with a series of ""gotcha"" questions. I thought I did badly, and it reminded me of the post-merger culture shift. 

And I still don't know if they're really hiring for a position that's less senior than the one I held when I was previously in the role, what the pay range is, or where the company will be officing after February.

I don't want the position. I won't be happy working at the merged company.  Even if they paid 150% of what I'm making now (which is already 25% more than my last salary with them).  After the surprise interview, and the way the managers and I interacted, I have no interest in going back to that company. I'm not a good fit there. 

How do I best bow out of this? I don't want to offend my old manager. He's been a solid employment reference and professional licence reference for me. It's not his fault this is a mess, but I'm not stepping into the mess. 

The HR guy left a voicemail and text to arrange an in-person interview, but hasn't answered when I called him back (twice).",GMisNegative,2,1.0,4,1732314140,2024-11-22 22:22:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxk2z2/gracefully_declining_further_interviews/,11,2024
1gxjy64,Does a career in the right industry find you or do you have to find it?,"I'm I'm the kitchen since I was 16. I recently got a job abroad as a chef, starting next month. This is a really big step for me because I will stay for 1 year minimum and take care of some financial problems I've been struggling to take care of because of poor income while working home. I'm happy because of that, but deep inside I feel like I'm wasting time while I should be chasing a different career because staying in the kitchen means no free weekends, constant extra hours and also once I'm back home it's going to be low income again. Don't get me wrong, I do like the job, currently the extra hours for me are okay too, working the weekends is also okay but it's okay because I'm 23 now and I haven't got a girlfriend/wife or kids. One day when the family comes, I will not have enough time for them, that is something I really don't want to happen. 

The thing is I don't even know what industry I would move to. I'm also constantly worried about how the time will pass and it will be too late to even start something new. So because of that I'm asking for advice.

Do I just stop thinking about it and keep doing what I've been doing til now and wait for the career in the right industry get to me spontaneously or do I have to just go out there and look for opportunities?

1gxjwhf,I made mistakes during my first two months of my first post grad job. Am I fired? ,"Hey guys, I made this throwaway Reddit account so that I could ask for career advice and other stuff. 

Anyways, I have just graduated from college this past May. I had trouble finding a job until this past September, and I started working as a cashier at a grocery store near my house. What works is that it’s right across the street and I don’t have my driver’s license yet. 

However, here’s the thing. I made some mistakes and my supervisor said I have room for improvement. 

Back in October, I was called into my supervisor’s office because I was using my phone during work hours. I also got called in last week because I took bathroom breaks for too long (I’d get distracted in there without even realizing it, so now I set alarms so that my bathroom breaks aren’t too long when I’m not in there during break time). I don’t do those things anymore, and I admit I did those things in the first place because I took my position for granted due to us being understaffed. I thought I was already doing what I needed to do so it wasn’t a big deal. However, when my supervisor told me how it was affecting the business but my supervisor also said during yesterday’s shift that I needed to improve on some other things when it came to customer interaction, such as not making my customers’ bags too heavy (which I did because I was rushing during busy days). I was instructed on how I can improve, and I began implementing the strategies as soon as I was improving. 

However, my supervisor while talking to me yesterday said something that rang some alarm bells. He said “We’ll discuss more on what you can do to improve when and if we get through the holidays.” When and if?! The if part really got me because I began to wonder if my position is in jeopardy. I began searching up signs I’m about to get fired on the internet, and so far there’s none other than the ones I listed. I’m not on a PIP, my coworkers aren’t alienating me (in fact they’re all friendly to me), and the only thing that’s really going on is that my supervisor told me that I need to improve. I told some friends and my boyfriend about the situation, and they don’t think I’m going to get fired. 

So do you guys think I’m gonna get fired? Is my boss already considering putting me on the chopping block? Or am I able to redeem myself (which I’m already trying to do)? I’ve only been working here for two months and I don’t know if I should begin applying for other jobs in case I might end up on the chopping block.

1gxisd1,Is my company breaking the law? ,"Disability related post. I have long covid and emailed HR for the ability to work at home one day a week. I currently work 32 hours a week, which ends up being 4 days, and I’m in the office each day. My commute is one hour of the day, and there is no flexibility with start time because of a morning managers meeting. 

On a Friday the week I sent this email (which said I have long Covid and breathing trouble and a doctors note, can I have this accommodation?) my boss texts me “HR can meet right now does that work?” So I said yes, of course now I’m wishing I had asked a lot more about what was going to happen in the meeting.

The meeting ended up being the head of HR, my boss, and me. It began with HR telling me I’ve had good work performance but it can always be improved, and that I’ve had a noteable absences (which I used PTO for.) so immediately I am on guard, which made me feel like I was in trouble, and I needed to answer their questions. 

 These are the questions they asked me: 
“What are your symptoms?” 
“Do you have asthma? Do you have an inhaler?” 
“How would working from home one day a week help you?” 
“Are you going to see a pulmonologist? When?” 
“Have you done a sleep study?” 

After all of that, which felt weird to me, they told me that the company has a no WFH policy for managers becuase we “need to be visible”. (This is BS. The CEO himself works from home regularly.) they then said I could either rearrange my 4 days each week or I could take 5 shorter days. Or I could take PTO. (I knew sitting right there that neither option would work for me becuase it’s ultimately the community and inability to take breaks that’s hurting my work performance.) instead I said I would check with my doctor.) 

I then reminded them that I have a doctors note for an accommodation, to which HR replied, “I don’t think we’re there yet.” 

I’ve read a lot about disability accommodation but can’t quite sort through it myself. Any advice for what to do now? ",petunia-sparks,1,0.6000000238418579,5,1732310662,2024-11-22 21:24:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxisd1/is_my_company_breaking_the_law/,11,2024
1gxiqt2,Thinking of accepting a job 3 h away,"Hi all! I've been unemployed for 8 months now and getting to a point where I'm considering less ideal options. I am an expert in a niche field (new product development of textile integrated electronics, 10 YoE) and would  like to move towards medical device development.
I have some experience in the area but apparently not enough for working with non-textile products. I'm currently interviewing for a position that would combine textiles and medical devices, but unfortunately it is 3 h away, one way, and remote is not an option. My rough idea is (if I get the position) to commute 3h on Monday morning and Friday afternoon, and rent a room close to the work place during the week. So basically I would be home with the husband only on weekends. We don't have kids, but we do have 2 dogs and a cat. It's does not sound great, but might give me a chance to break into the medical devices industry, and later on help find a job closer to home. We like where we live and are also in the middle of a major renovation of our house so all of us moving right now is not great option either. Job is also kinda middle of nowhere. I'm thinking to work this job a year or so, and hopefully at that point job market would have improved and I would have gained valuable experience and be able to find something else.

1gxikmb,Switching career industries without direct new industry experience,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice on switching industries but staying in the same function areas. I want to switch from Healthcare to one of the industries I am passionate about: Fashion, Retail, Media, Entertainment, Sports. However, I want to stay in the same function areas that I am currently in: Strategy, Business Operations, Data Analytics. Over the past year, I have had several final rounds with some great companies in these industries, but have had no success in converting final rounds to offers (see below for more details).

**My Background (Chronological Order):**

* Undergraduate in Engineering and immediately got my Masters in Math
* Started my career in Quantitative Risk within Financial Services
* Left Financial Services after becoming an Investment Banker (was unsustainable)
* Started a fashion brand - was unsuccessful after 2 years
* Worked in Business Strategy at a Healthcare organization
* Received an MBA from a top business school
* Post-MBA, worked in Strategy Consulting for 2 years
* Currently work in internal strategy within a digital healthcare startup (about to hit 2 years)

**Current Situation:**

* 35 y.o. with family responsibilities and over 8 years of experience
* I am extremely unhappy with my current role within the healthcare industry. I do not want to stay in my role. I just do not like healthcare whatsoever. I have no desire to learn it nor do I see myself in it in the long-term
* I am struggling to convert final round interviews in my desired industries. I am 0 for 16 with final rounds to offers
* Literally, all 16 final round opportunities have been consistent feedback regarding why I was not selected: ""Excellent interviews, skills, and background, but lacking direct industry experience. We went with the other candidate who has direct \[industry\] experience"". I later find out via a quick LinkedIn search that majority of the time I was competing against an internal hire or someone with direct \[industry\] experience
* Prior to my interviews, I study and read upon the market, company, trends, challenges, strategies, etc. that is relevant to each interview

**Challenges:**

* Family responsibilities preventing a significant pay cut for an entry-level position in one of these industries
* Losing motivation and confidence in myself after multiple failed final rounds
* Lack of direct industry experience, despite strong transferable skills in function areas of strategy, data analytics, and business operations
* Seems like the roles in my relevant function (strategy, business operations, and data analytics) do not open up frequently. I have networked with many people in the industry, but that hasn't been much of a success

**Questions:**

* Has anyone successfully switched industries with a similar career trajectory?
* Are there alternative paths to consider to gain exposure to my desired industries without leaving my current role? I am open to exploring different roles within these industries.

Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated",gigi_cab,1,1.0,2,1732310107,2024-11-22 21:15:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxikmb/switching_career_industries_without_direct_new/,11,2024

Currently, I have a remote job that is pretty fulfilling and flexible. I do program development for a university. I'm able to travel and work from wherever.

The assistant dean position would be a lot more demanding and they warned me of that. It's also a much higher pay and requires presence on campus. I think it would be a great move up from my position but I've gotten a little afraid.

1gxgt36,Did I Mess Up by Asking to See the Office Before Accepting the Job?,"Here’s the story: I interviewed for a **Senior Office Administrator role** at an **Ivy League university** in their professional development department for alumni. It sounded like a great opportunity. The job was *fully office-based*, focused on managing building operations and tenants.

**The Interview Process**  
The interviews were heavy on DEI topics, which, as a POC, I genuinely appreciated. They emphasized wanting to open doors to people with similar backgrounds, and I felt seen. I had two virtual interviews—one with the Executive Director (my would-be boss) and one with the team.

**The Offer (and the Twist)**  
The ED calls me, confirms my availability, and *offers me the job*! Naturally, I was thrilled. But then I asked if I could visit the office before accepting—especially since the interviews were virtual and the job’s focus was on building maintenance.

Her response? A firm *no.* She said she doesn’t allow visitors unless they’re officially employees. (Keep in mind, this office regularly hosts open houses for alumni, and tenants can have visitors any time!) She told me I’d have to *accept the position first* before stepping foot inside.

She quickly pressed me for a decision. I stayed polite and explained that I’d need two weeks to start because I had to give notice at my current job as a teacher’s aide. That’s when things got weird.

She asked if my current job was virtual (it wasn’t) and said she didn’t want someone who might be ""indecisive"" about the role because she had other candidates ready to go. I reassured her that I wasn’t indecisive—I just wanted to see the space to better understand what I’d be managing. She replied, “I’ll give you a few days to think about it,” and abruptly hung up.

**The Aftermath**  
Confused but determined, I decided to drive by the office myself to at least see the exterior. I sent my acceptance email two business days later (I didn’t have the financial flexibility to turn down the opportunity) and requested an official offer letter.

And… radio silence.

A month later, I checked their website. The position had been filled—by someone who, let’s just say, didn’t represent the DEI values they had so proudly emphasized in the interviews.

**Now I’m left wondering:**

* Was I wrong for asking to see the office before accepting the job?
* Did I handle the situation poorly, or was this just a red flag I dodged without realizing?",chickfromthejungle,0,0.5,3,1732305504,2024-11-22 19:58:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxgt36/did_i_mess_up_by_asking_to_see_the_office_before/,11,2024
1gxgo8q,Overcoming being terminated,"Hi Everyone,

I am looking for some advice on finding a job. I need help explaining why I was let go from my last role. I need to figure out how to overcome this hurdle and would love some suggestions or advice. 

I'm a new lawyer (two years after getting called to the bar). My career has been diverse, with stints in government (4 months), not-for-profit (7 months), and, most recently, insurance defence (8 months). This variety has equipped me with a range of skills and adaptability. 

My prior roles were all contract positions. In my most recent job at the insurance firm, I was let go during probation. I was not given a reason; however, it was expressed that I needed to fit into the firm's culture. Five months after I was hired, they hired another associate whose father is friends with the partner, and he quickly began getting all my assignments. I was on track to reach the billable target for the year. I never got any complaints about my work beyond minor suggestions. 

The feedback I've gotten is that since my prior positions have been less than a year and at three places within the past two years, they are reluctant to give me a shot. 

What am I doing right now to get a job:

* \-Networking at events and reaching out to lawyers for referrals or openings;
* \-Tailoring my resume and cover letter to all jobs;
* \-Applying widely;
* \-Cold calling and emailing firms; 

It's been a challenging 5 months since I was let go, and despite around four interviews, I'm feeling disheartened. I'm reaching out for advice and support in this difficult time. 

I appreciate all of your time reading this post. I am genuinely looking forward to learning from your experiences and insights. 

I am looking forward to your comments. ",yuckyak,2,0.75,0,1732305158,2024-11-22 19:52:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxgo8q/overcoming_being_terminated/,11,2024

Worked as receptionist at senior living for a while and loved it, applied for full time exec assistant position and got passed over.

Tried full time at a different senior living community and it was rough. Total mean girl staff, and memory care so pretty intense and I was expected to help out with the residents like VERY hands on. Had one pee in the lobby and the care staff asked me to bring him to the bathroom like nah you come get him.

Super passionate about senior living, with the right staff and admin, it can make their lives so much better and way safer than being at home alone.

But accepted accounting job using my bachelors. It's good, I've like it, but on a fundamental level I just don't feel good. I don't feel like I'm accomplishing anything while I'm at work all day, I don't like doing data entry. Stare at number, copy paste number.

1gxg5in,Vacation within Resignation Timeline,"TL;DR Is it a bad idea to give my employer a 4-5 week (or longer) notice, but take vacation until the final 2 weeks of my notice?

I may be taking another job, but my wife is due with our first child at the end of this year. We don't get parental leave, but my vacation (and sick) time resets at the beginning of the year. If my new employer is willing to delay the start date to February, I could tell my current employer before I go on ""leave"" that I plan to resign 2 weeks after I return.

This would give them 4+ weeks of notice, but they'd be paying me 4+ weeks for the last 2 weeks of work. I have a nice boss and HR has been decent, but I'm concerned that upper management could pressure them to terminate me earlier. 

Alternatively, I could give them my 2-week notice the day I come back from parental leave. This feels a bit wrong to me, I'd rather communicate openly but I realize it might be the best thing for my and my family's interests. Some other options I thought of (suggestions are welcome) are below. Side note, the handbook requires me to work my last 2 weeks without absence to get vacation paid out.

1. Start the new job before the end of the year (December 15th is currently on the offer but they said after the new year is fine). I could work there for about a week depending on when the baby comes, and I'd get my remaining vacation time at my current company paid out. I'd have to work out time off with the new employer, they say they're flexible so this would be a good test.

2. Start the new job after I come back from leave, the nice way. I'd get my vacation for this year paid out, but I would be unemployed for parental leave. This would probably make both companies happy since they don't have to pay for my time off.

3. Start the new job after I come back from leave, the...""other"" way. I could put in my notice before the end of the year, use vacation time through the end of the year, and use vacation time at the start of the new year. I'm required to be on-site for my last day, so I'd come back for whatever my last day is.",binder_n,1,1.0,1,1732303796,2024-11-22 19:29:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxg5in/vacation_within_resignation_timeline/,11,2024

1gxfr6o,Should I Leave a Job I like for Money,"Hi - I'm a 33F and I'm an Account Supervisor at a small Advertising Agency. I'm currently making $88K/year, we have FTO, 16 weeks of Maternity Leave (important because i'm currently trying to get pregnant), and an amazing amount of paid holidays. I generally like my job - I've been there 8 years, and I've been promised a promotion in Q1 that would get me to $100K. My coworkers are my friends and my boss knows me very well and is supportive of my career.  
I'm being recruited for a new agency that has a starting salary of $130K and I'd get a title bump to Director. This is very attractive. However, they have a maternity leave of 8 weeks, less paid holidays, and less paid time off. The contribution to 401K seems to be the same, but I'd have to wait a year to be able to get the max match.  
I'd probably be able to get to $130K at my current job in about 5-8 years (maybe more). 

I need advice. I'm nervous about making the switch and having it not work out, and I'm nervous about the pay not outweighing less time with my future child/children.

1gxfenr,Need help deciding what to do,"Long story short about 3 years ago u took a gamble to get on myself and move to a company where their values more aligned with my own. I took a pay cut and have since then seen multiple pay increases as well as taken over my department as manager. Overall, I love the work I get to do and I also love the people I can meet and face and on a daily basis. 

The issue arises with our CEO, whom I report to directly. Overall, I don’t hate this guys guts or anything. We don’t have very many cultural similarities which makes it hard at times to agree or go along with him on stuff. Overall he does not have a 4 year degree(which I do not care about) but he also doesn’t value other people’s education or degrees either. To the point where I am actually perusing MBA courses without my job’s financial assistance because I don’t feel comfortable taking about it with him or even having him use this against me for a lack of time(more to come later). 


The issue at hand is that he takes things very very personal especially if challenged in front of others even with no ill intent. I am also running the department with less staff than my prior boss. Leaving my roll to basically fill two different spots from the prior organizational chart. This is something he has refused to acknowledge and it makes him mad even. He came to my office today and told me that he wants me to pick a job. Manager or employee. And that i need to do only 10% of the department production goal(probably at 40-50% now just because it comes easier to me and others are learning). And focus on managing.  But without hiring anyone else. Despite me filling the role and pushing us toward a place where raises and more money is available etc… I can not seem to hit this moving target and no matter what is done it isn’t enough. 


After we talked he said he wants me to come to him on Monday(had this lovely talk on a Friday) and decide if I want to pursue this “leadership” role that has basically become impossible. 


I am thinking of just stating that I will continue to work as an employee and hopefully he or someone else sees me fit one day. I’m worried of the possibility of him firing me or reducing my wage(which is already bullshit for my title and responsibility level). I have 2 children a wife who is looking for work and a mortgage. I would love to tell him to shove it in so many words and why he has set me up for failure in many ways. I also want him to know he does not own my skill set or future. 


Other than this one man, I love my job and all of my coworkers.  I am at a loss for what I should do.

I work in consulting for a large firm in Canada and have been applying for roles in Europe within my firm as I just want to move abroad.

Interviews have gone really well and I was offered the job at the end of my final round. I received an informal offer in writing on Monday, but I noticed that the salary was lower than I expected and is lower than my current associate-level salary (which I provided when asked during an earlier interview). Since it's a move to EU from Canada, I wasn't expecting something crazy high or anything but it is on the lower end of the range I saw from looking online. I asked if they would consider €3,000 more (\~5%) on the basis of the additional skills brought by my master's degree. The recruiter said he would check with the business if there is in any flex in the budget, and would get back to me. This is on Monday.

1gxcvw4,Am I making the right move?,"Hi everyone, I’m facing a career dilemma and could use some advice.

A bit of background: I started my career in digital health tech, where I was fortunate to learn a skill that has opened up an amazing opportunity. Recently, I was offered a consulting role with a prestigious organisation , and the pay is double what I’m earning now. It feels like a dream opportunity!

Here’s the catch: I’ve been in my current role as an analyst for only six months, and I genuinely enjoy the work. It’s my first analyst role, and I see it as a stepping stone toward my long-term goal of becoming a data scientist. However, my current company won’t sponsor a skilled work visa, and my visa expires next year.

The new role is as a business analyst, which isn’t as directly aligned with my data science aspirations, but the pay and prestige are hard to ignore. At the same time, I feel bad leaving my current role so soon, especially since I’ve been enjoying the work and the learning opportunities here.

I’m torn between staying in my current role to build experience for just one year as an analyst or taking the  offer for the financial security and potential exposure it could bring.

Hey everyone, I’m in a tough spot and need advice. Company A offered me an internship, and up until yesterday, they were my top choice. I asked for time to consider, and they’ve kindly given me until next Thursday to respond.

However, 30 minutes before Company A reached out with an offer, I received an interview request from my dream company, Company B. I wasn’t expecting this, and now I’m shocked (but excited). I’ll be interviewing with Company B TODAY, and if offered a position, I would definitely prefer to work there.

The issue is, I’m not sure if I should mention the pending offer from Company A during my interview with Company B. I want to be transparent and ask about their timeline, but I don’t want to come across as unprofessional or pushy. I’m also nervous about potentially turning down Company A without a guarantee that Company B will offer me the internship.

Any advice on how to navigate this situation? Should I bring up the offer with Company B, and if so, how do I frame it in a way that doesn’t hurt my chances?

Thank you so much for your input! 

This is also among the general lines that I would say today in the interview:  

Thank you again for the opportunity to interview; I truly appreciate the time and effort you have taken to speak with me today. Before we wrap up, I wanted to ask about the timeline for hearing back regarding my status in the process. I want to be as transparent and honest as possible. currently have a time-sensitive table offer from another company with a needed response of next Thursday.

However, with that being said, (Company B) is truly my top choice and preference because this intership directly aligns and supports my personal and career initiatives in the X industry, that will allow me to grow as a professional and further develop the skills I need to excel in the field. And again I want to let you know that

1gxbevy,"Salaried employees, I don’t think people understand the concept. ","I have been reading s few threads on this forum and I don’t think people understand what a salaried employee actually means.

It doesn’t mean you can speed through your work in 7 hours and then go home. It means you are paid higher per hour than a person paid hourly with the expectation of doing reasonable overtime.

So reasonable overtime is normally an extra hour per day above the mandated minimal hours guideline.  If you work more then that then you may possibly be able to receive overtime(yes, salaried employees can receive OT)or you receive time in lieu.

If you are not happy with the arrangement of salaried employee then you could ask to be an hourly employee but in many professions you will not be employed unless you are some super star who brings a ton of value above what any other person in your role can do. 

Finishing your duties in 7 hours isn’t anything special. Finishing in maybe 5 and then doing extra work for 3 hours then you are something special.

I've been tweaking my resume to make it more ""generic"" and not oil & gas heavy.

Has anyone out there made a similar transition? How did you navigate it? What steps would you recommend for someone like me who wants to break into tech?

I know this post might seem a bit all over the place, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

Thanks for any advice you can share!",c47v3770,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1732290266,2024-11-22 15:44:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxar9v/need_advice_on_transitioning_from_oil_gas_to_tech/,11,2024
1gxaq9a,Should I be concerned?,"Boss wants to hire a coordinator

I’ve been working for my employer for the last year and things have been pretty good. I was given a nice raise about 2 months ago (15% increase), which I was very proud of. Also, my boss has been giving me a lot of additional responsibilities with coordinating a lot of projects.

Yesterday he asked my thoughts and said this,

“Let me know what you think about this idea: you’re really good at doing all of the coordination, but I’d also like to elevate you as a project manager so you’re doing more engineering aspects of the job. Would you feel sad if we hired someone to handle that stuff? I feel someone wouldn’t need to know the engineering aspects to do the coordination. I wouldn’t want you to view this as a punishment cause again you’re really good at it.”

I said it would not be a big deal to me and so we kind of left it off with that. Today I am now questioning about how I feel cause it sort of does feel like punishment or perhaps I am not doing that great, and this is a way of kindly taking those responsibilities away. Am I potentially over analyzing this? Not sure, but I am having mixed feelings today about it since this makes up 80% of my role.",Nervous_Knowledge_60,1,1.0,2,1732290190,2024-11-22 15:43:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gxaq9a/should_i_be_concerned/,11,2024

","Hi,


A few months ago, I lost my sofyware job and have been applying non-stop, but the job market is really tough. I’ve tried cold-calling local businesses to offer services, signed up on freelance platforms, and even attempted e-commerce, but none of these worked out (e-commerce felt too scammy).

Now, I’m feeling stuck and looking for realistic ways to make money. I have $5,000 in savings and am willing to work hard. What would you recommend for someone in my position? Looking for actionable ideas, not just vague advice.

I’ve got relevant certifications, I’ve got a few years of management experience, and I moved up the ranks fast, but I’m worried I’m getting left in the dust on simply making a change after graduating university instead of always knowing I wanted to be in healthcare finance or something.

1gx7yag,Which career path should I take?,"My experience in the aerospace world is mainly as a quality control dimensional inspector. Recently I made a pivot into NDT doing FPI. Though now I’m realizing I miss dimensional.

People usually mention there being more money in NDT but I feel bored by the repetitive work (though dimensional can be repetitive too). Though I also worry about the future of dimensional inspectors in aerospace manufacturing as I’m only 30 years old and have roughly 35 years left in the work force which I feel like before then that role is more likely to become automated.

1gx7xk0,"New job objectively better, but miss my old job.","Hi everyone, as the title suggests, i recently started a new position and have been in it for just over 6 months. However I can't stop thinking about factors about my old position that I miss.

A little background below, gonna keep specifics out.

 My old position - Process Engineer for a relatively well know defense contractor. Worked there after i graduated college, worked there for about 4 years until I decided to leave for my new company.

  
New position - Larger company where I design custom heavy equipment (as well as general engineering for our standard products, but mostly custom stuff is what I do).

  
So anyways, when I graduated college my dream career path was always to work for a defense contractor, I always had an attraction to the aerospace engineering world and it seemed like when I was accepted to join the process engineering team I would be there for the rest of my career. I'll go over my years there for a better background. My first year (2020) I got a sizeable raise for being as green as I was but coming in during 2020 I was really thrust into much more responsibility than I should have been with my experience, but I was able to succeed relatively well at a young age when most of my coworkers were 20-30 years older than me with much more experience (I was 22 at the time). Ok so first year went great I thought, and i really thought that I was fitting in with the engineering teams on my projects and establishing myself in the company. Year 2, took a turn in a strange direction, my boss at the time was fired unexpectedly, myself the the other process engineers were called into a meeting with our VP of ops and told that we will now be reporting directly to him. Ok whatever no big deal, fast forward throughout that year, it was the first year I headed a project of my own (continuity tester that we used for these giant cable harnesses, really smoothed out production), anyways I get to my second year review really proud of what I had accomplished and really expecting either a raise or a promotion, as alot of my coworkers felt i deserved. I ended up getting a 3% raise. Ok i figured i cant get a huge raise every year, i left that review a little disappointed but didn't let it get to me because i still really enjoyed the work, and the salary was still pretty decent for my workload. Year 3, my coworker another process engineer who graduated college the same time as me just came a few months after me puts in her 2 weeks notice. I was upset because we were really the only 2 in the engineering side that was on the younger side, so we became pretty friendly. She left due to the salary not being up to par with the workload, and honestly i didnt blame her, i felt the same at this point. After she left, most of her projects were dumped on me, i had to be responsible for these projects as well as mine. This year was the busiest one of them all, I often would be working 60-70 hour weeks (unpaid OT mind you), it was pretty common i would leave, go home, gym, dinner, and then open my laptop and work until i was too tired to do anything else, then id get up and do it again. About halfway through this year is when i met my current partner, when we were getting to know eachother we obviously were talking about careers. She is a nurse and I work for a defense contractor (Lots of jokes about opposites attract I know, ive heard em all haha). As we dated first few months she really started to notice how stressed i was all the time, I would kinda vent to her alot about it, she asked me why i am there still if im doing so much work for the pay of one engineer. Thats where it clicked for me. I decided i was gonna stick around for my 3 year review to see how it goes. Year 3 review, 4% raise! this one I didnt react well too, i made it pretty obvious that i thought it was unacceptable given everything i had done for this company over the last year. I expressed in that meeting that i would like to take less responsibility on these projects if im only being paid about the same as i was after 1 year. Yes i know i wasn't expecting a 2x salary increase but i was expecting something similar to what i was seeing some other engineers getting during their review. It was at this time i started looking and interviewing at new companies. I started looking at other defense contractors, interviewed at a few, got an offer from one which I ended up declining since i really didnt want a repeat of the last 3 and some odd months years ( i knew some people who worked there that i met through some mutual projects between our companies), so I started looking for other jobs, I interview at 4 places, all heavy equipment/big name companies. It happens that a good friend of mine who worked for one of these companies was an engineer at where i am now, and he gave me a reference, i interviewed, loved it, my now boss asked me what i wanted for a salary, i told him what i wanted. And i got the salary i wanted! which i was so happy about. Now thats where i am, i enjoy this company alot.



Ok, so that was a rant, why do I miss my old company? #1 As much of a shitshow that place was I almost kind of enjoyed the ""high octane"" pace of things there, from the time i got there until the time i left i was almost always dealing with an issue that needed a solution quick, which I enjoyed. #2 The people I worked with directly were incredible, I honestly don't think that i will ever work with a better team of engineers, my senior engineers were incredibly supportive of me throughout my entire time there and even supported me when i decided to leave. In fact all of them were happy i was leaving, because alot of them were upset with the upper management that i wasnt being paid/recognized as i should be, and that i would leave the same as my coworker the year before me. One of the senior engineers i worked with really closely over the years took me to the side during my last week to tell me, ""Hey, I love working with you and want to keep working with you, but I am glad you're leaving because this company doesnt develop early careers well"" He also made the joke during my last project meeting that ""I'm always welcome back, but to call me first so I can talk you out of it."". I still keep up with alot of the people i worked with, as I didnt have to relocate at all for my new position, im only about 20 mins away from my old companies HQ. I still regularly talk/ get drinks with some of my former coworkers.

  
Now I am in this strange position i feel, I love my new job, I am paid fairly, have a very manageable workload, and everyone is incredibly friendly and supportive as I am still learning this new industry. I am much happier, with a much healthier work/life balance, the only time i have ever opened up my laptop outside of work is on a weekend when i have nothing to do when my partner is working. So I work a little OT (Which im paid a decently high hourly wage for!!) My partner says i seem happier and less stressed, i really am. But some part of me for some reason misses the chaos and super stressful role I used to be in. Maybe its the Stockholm syndrome speaking, maybe its just because it was my first step in my career and I got used to it? 

  
Anyways, I know the right choice is to stay with my current company, which i plan to do for the foreseeable future, but was wondering if anyone else has ever had an experience like this before?

  
TLDR:

Old company cons: shitshow everyday, not paid enough, no work/life balance.

Old company pros: Great people, really good coffee machine, kinda liked the chaos.

New company pros: Higher salary, work with one of my best friends outside of work, good workload (enough to stay busy and not get bored), tons of free swag, huge cubicle, actually have a life outside work.

New company cons: Coffee is mediocre, not really alot of good places to go out for lunch around the office. 

For some reason i miss my old company tho haha.",Ryscotti,1,1.0,0,1732282383,2024-11-22 13:33:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gx7xk0/new_job_objectively_better_but_miss_my_old_job/,11,2024
1gx7oep,I work in an office with only two other ppl (both of whom are my bosses). How do I keep boundaries with them in such close quarters?,"As the post says, I work in a very small law office. I’m the sole staff paralegal for two partners. I started working there the summer before COVID, and we worked together in the office throughout COVID. To a not insignificant extent, we’re trauma-bonded to each other and have become very close. One of the attorneys is wonderful, and we connect really well. He’s respectful of me and values me. The other partner…is less wonderful. 

For the most part, we get along great, but he’s a legit narcissist, and the type to want to be my buddy one minute and then pull rank for literally no reason the next. He feels the need to assert authority over me when I don’t give him a reason to. I don’t ever call in. I get along with the rest of the attorneys (who are all remote). I do good work. I’m completely trustworthy and honest. I don’t get it. It causes me a lot of anxiety and frustration because I thrive with clear boundaries, and the boundaries here are unclear. I’m a sensitive and emotional person who is always looking for a way to connect with ppl, so I instinctively am emotionally vulnerable to others. Him being an asshole to me for no reason just CRUSHES me. 

I really want to make this job work. There are certainly negatives to it (zero career advancement or meaningful future raises, primarily) but there are perks, too: extreme flexibility, a shorter work week, and low stress. 

So how do I have a functional relationship with my narcissistic boss in such close quarters while also not setting myself up for emotional harm? Going in and turning myself off to him (gray rocking, as they say) would work, but it will disrupt the otherwise positive vibes. They’ll notice. It’s hard for me not to try to connect with ppl emotionally, especially in such close quarters.

1gx6bjv,Performance review jitters,"So I've completed almost 60 days in a government law job, and my boss tells me yesterday that we are going to have my first review.  Is that typical for new hires?  No one bothered to mention this review process until we reached the 60-day mark, which makes me nervous.  The guy who had the job before me was let go (for reasons I don't know) during the first six months.

My boss is a nitpicker, but, perhaps more ominously, has gotten less warm to me as time has gone on.  She'll use general detached phrases like: ""The right person in this role would..."" etc. when giving me feedback, seeming to imply I'm not the right person.  She can find flaw in a tub of butter, and I keep feeling like she's waiting for me to make a mistake so she can push me off the cliff.  It's nothing personal, but it's everything personal, you know?

So can anyone comment on a 60-day review and whether it's common and if I'm reading too much into it?  Of course, I'll be prepared, have things documented, etc.  It's just tough when it's not really a fair fight with a fair person.

1gx52sc,Unemployed for 14 months ,"This job market is like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. I was laid off from a tech consulting company in September 2023 and I’m still unable to secure a job. I moved to a new city over the summer, I’ve applied to over 600 jobs, I go to networking events when I can find them, and still nothing. I’m staying with a friend for now but I can’t do this forever because he’s moving into a new house too far away from here in the spring (I’m in Denver currently). 

I’m in marketing, which I know has been one of the hardest hit industries when it comes to layoffs, but come on. I’ve seen plenty of my fellow creatives secure new jobs over the past several months after also being laid off. I know AI isn’t helping things, but I still see a lot of writing jobs out there. Surely they can’t all be ghost jobs. 

I’ve had some interviews, but not that many and I was ghosted by a CEO who interviewed me Monday of last week (2nd interview). I sent him a thank you email and he said he would keep me updated going forward and then crickets. What is going on here? I feel like I’m being blacklisted or something. I got a seasonal job with UPS just to keep food on the table, but they aren’t giving me any hours and it’s a complete joke. I tried applying at Target a few months ago for a retail job and they rejected me. I also just applied at Ulta for a seasonal job and I’m afraid they’ll reject me too. I’m doing Uber Eats when I can just so I can pay my car payment and other small bills. 

I’m really scared that I’m never going to work again and it’s tearing me apart (and my self esteem). I’m only 41 years old. I feel like there must be something wrong with me to be jobless for this long.

1gx46jb,Unsure whether to take a new job..,"I have been at an oral surgery office for 3 years now. I love the staff they are honestly my best friends, I love the doctors, i love what i do.  But the issue is they have an issue with being a low paying office and there are minor things that drive me crazy there. 

I currently make $22.50 and the hours are Mon.-Thurs. 7-3pm. and Fri. 7-2pm. PTO is earned 8 hours a month. 

Pros: awesome hours, close to home, love the people i work with and what i do and im good at it, flexible with leaving early/coming in late/calling in. 
Cons: literally just the pay, some of my days off dont get approved. 

I discussed with them today that i love working there but i had a job offer and asked for $26, they offered $25 and i probably wouldn’t get another raise for awhile. 

This new job is a completely different field. Its still kind of dentistry, but it is a sleep apnea place. I did do a working interview and I dont think it would be something I would absolutely hate doing and could get good at, but it wouldnt of been my first choice. They are very generous. They offered me $29 an hour, $30 after 90 days, they give out a $350 check at the beginning of every month to help pay insurance, as well as a $50 gas card since everyone drives fairly far, and bonuses. 
I have worked with 2 of the girls before at another obvious so I am familiar with them. The hours are much different. They see patients Tuesday-Thursday 9-4. Mondays are catch up days, fridays off. Obviously i would need my 40 hours so I would make my own schedule to be able to get my 40. I was thinking maybe 7-4 Mon, 8-5 Tues-Thurs, 8-12 Fri. 3weeks of PTO starts at 90 days. 

Pros: Wayyy more money, familiar faces, possible 4 day work week, bonuses, easier work, later start time
Cons: longer drive(40+ pending traffic vs my current 22 min), longer work nights, leaving my friends

I genuinely cannot decide what to do. Im overall a very indecisive person and this decision is seriously weighing on me. I really do like my job and I am upset they wouldnt give me $26 (really what is one more dollar) and even with the $25 i would not get a raise for a hot minute and there is a capout of $30 (i think.) I am only 23 years old, but my boyfriend and I have been together for going on 6 years and are wanting to settle down, find a house in a safer neighborhood, potentially even start a family. If we are talking about starting a family, do i choose a place with better hours or the one with more pay? My boyfriend is all for me taking the job but he is all for more money. I am a much more sympathetic type person and leaving jobs are hard for me. He has started over many times and i just dont get how he does it.

I have 2ish semesters left. When I started the program everyone made it sound like getting a job was going to be attainable, but now I’ve had to face the reality that getting a job as a software developer with an associate degree is not going to be easy, and maybe even impossible. I’ve considered switching programs to radiography. I’m open to other things too. I’m trying to figure out if I should finish out this program, or if I am wasting my time and should start a new program.

1gx43l9,Switching from Economics to Psychology?,"Hi everyone,

I’m about to graduate with a degree in economics in a year, but I’ve never truly enjoyed it, and my grades reflect that. I’ve been working as an intern for six months, but I increasingly feel this isn’t the right path for me.

I live in Eastern Europe, in Hungary, and I’m considering studying psychology, with the ultimate goal of becoming a clinical psychologist.

I’d love to hear from current students—what motivated you to choose psychology? What do you like or dislike about it? Have you ever regretted it?

Practicing psychologists, I’d also love your insights: do you recommend this career path? What do you enjoy most about it, and what’s the hardest part?

Thanks in advance!",Ecstatic-Lake-7713,1,1.0,0,1732268113,2024-11-22 09:35:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gx43l9/switching_from_economics_to_psychology/,11,2024
1gx3vhd,It is possible to change career to PM with no current education following this path?,"Hi everybody, here’s some important context of me: 

• 4 years of hospitality experience.

• Joined a big company seeking growth starting from a shit job (not hospitality) but I was never given the chance even tho I’ve done at least 80% of the things the roles I applied for requested. I received only positive feedback, never a reason on why I didn’t pass the interview.

• No education, not even high school diploma.

• London based, Spanish immigrant (legal since the very first day I arrived).

• I am willing to put the hard work and sacrifice needed to earn a huge amount of money. I don’t want to pursue software or IT due to its current job market state (0YoE competing against unemployed 4YoE), but Project Management is in every field and it’s scalable.



Here’s my chosen path to change careers:

• MS Office short course CPD accredited. I’ll take a free course, pass it and pay the certification. I don’t think I’ll learn anything new but I need as much education as possible in my resume even if it’s basic. It lasts 1 month.

• Diploma in Project Management at eLearning College. It’s a level 5 course which certification is from OHSC, which is endorsed by the QLS. It lasts 3 months.

This course will make me meet the requirements to take the CAPM exam: secondary degree (even high school equivalent are valid, and QLS just at lvl 3 is High school/A level equivalent) and 23 hours of Business Management education. 

 • CAPM certification. Not much to say here, I’ll prepare myself to pass it and pay the certification.



Is this a good path? Am I missing something? I am willing to pay for my education so I’m open to listen to further education apart from this 3 courses. It can be Diplomas, Certificates, Courseworks, anything.",UnraveledChains,1,1.0,1,1732267082,2024-11-22 09:18:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gx3vhd/it_is_possible_to_change_career_to_pm_with_no/,11,2024
1gx3o6u,Should I go back to school?,"So I just graduated in May with my Associates, I had to take my national boards exam and passed in July. Since then I’ve been working as a multimodality tech so I do xray and CT. I’m only making about $30/hr working 3 days a week, 12hr shifts. 

I just idk I don’t feel excited about what I do anymore, and I am so anxious that Ive made a bad decision with my place of employment. It’s nothing bad per se, but I don’t like working with surgeons… it makes me incredibly nervous. And honestly being a “new grad” I do not feel confident in most the things I do. And normally I’d understand the whole “everyone gets nervous some times” but it physically affects me. 
I’ve looked into going back to school for radiation therapy but the school closest to me is 2.5 hrs away and it’s competitive so I’m not even sure if I would get in. It sounds really interesting to me though, but I’m worried I’ll not be happy with my choice, bc it seems like that always happens with me. I don’t even know what to do. I want a career I enjoy but I also want to be able to have a family sometime soon, and not have all the financial responsibility on my husband. 

Idk if I’m feeling burnt out from school clinicals  already or what but I’m feeling really down about my decisions with school, I keep thinking I should’ve done this program or I should’ve gone a different direction and never done medical. 

I know this probably sounds terrible but I’m having a hard time adjusting to it I guess. I’ll talk to my husband and he’s very “a job is a job, I go there do what I need to do and I leave” but I just constantly think over my day and if I remembered to do this or that and stress about it. And the biggest thing is that when I’m not terrified shitting bricks in the OR, I just feel meh about it all.

What should I do?,"I’ve been in the automotive industry for the past 5 years selling Subarus topping out my income at around $130k at most, and I have 2 really great career opportunities on the table. Not sure which one to take and would appreciate any advice/guidance. For some background, I own my own home and have my own bills that I share with my fiancé, about $4,500 worth between the two of us. She is not working currently, but will be soon and will probably bring home somewhere around 3k a month. My two potential opportunities are to get back into the automotive business with arguably the best company with the best culture in my state or get into corporate America through Capital One, which is also consistently in the top 100 places to work. I would be selling BMW’s with the dealership job and I would be a buyer (relationship manager) for dealerships with Capital One Auto Finance with the other.

With Capital One, if I hit my bonus target + overtime I’m at $99,876/year, before overtime and bonuses I would make a salary of $73,700, 401k with up to 6% match, blue cross blue shield insurance, gym onsite, physician on site, free nutritionist, stock purchase plan, cafeterias onsite, free mental health services, and tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 a year. All bank holidays and 15 PTO days in the first year and 20 days PTO after the first year. At most I’d be working 45 hours/week. The schedule would be 11-8 which works well for me since I’m a night owl anyways, and I would have the opportunity to work from home Mondays and Fridays after my 90 day training period. 

With BMW I have $6k/month salary for the first 3 months with potential to make $150-$200k+ in income. I’d be doing sales and finance, they don’t have finance managers over there. I get a BMW company car with paid gas and insurance. Blue cross blue shield for health insurance and 401k with a match of 4%, 5 days PTO in the first year and 15 days after the first year. At most working 55 hours/week. They also offer tuition reimbursement and invest a lot into their employees and training. The schedule would be a mix of opening, mid shift, and closing shifts throughout the week. They are open from 8 AM - 8 PM and I would get Sundays and one day off during the week. 

I feel like this is such a huge decision and everyone in my family/my fiancé’s family has been telling me to go the Capital One route and to think long-term. I also want to finish my bachelor’s degree and I want the opportunity to move up and grow with the company. Both companies have told me there is room for growth and opportunity to move up. My head is telling me Capital One because the workload is lighter and I could finally finish my degree and it would look better long term on my resume, but part of me feels like I can’t let go of car sales and my heart is telling me BMW.

1gx2pbl,"First-time manager, need advice.","I work in a small company, with a simple structure. In this company there is a director, 3 managers, and each of the managers have 2 to 5 subordinates.


One of the managers resigned last month and I got promoted to replace her. The thing is, her subordinates resigned, too. Because of that, the company lost 4 people.

To replace the subordinates, the company hired 2 new people for me to supervise. These 2 new people is for me, great people. They are young, both of them are fresh graduates, but they are very eager to learn and I’d say they are adaptive. I really like them.

Now, this is my first time being manager, having someone working for me and become my responsibility, so I kinda need advice.

I want to say thank you and good job to them on their first week working here, because they did work well. I really want to be someone they are comfortable talking to. However, another manager told me if I do this, soon the new people would lose respect to me and think I’m too nice and therefore an ‘easy’ boss.

I wanna know how you guys lead your team. Do you apply friendly approach to your team, or do you guys stay as manager-subordinates and just be emotionless at work? What are the benefits and drawsbacks of your approach?",Lazy-Departure-278,1,1.0,0,1732261730,2024-11-22 07:48:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gx2pbl/firsttime_manager_need_advice/,11,2024
1gx2mp3,Just started at BWW but already considering leaving,"So I just started working at Buffalo Wild Wings as my first real job and I am almost done with my first week training but I am unsure if it is a really good fit for me. I am a cashier which means I am expected to be able to do just about everything that isn’t serving or cooking the food, which includes greeting and seating people, food running and packing delivery orders and answering the phone and processing orders on the cash register. The food running and packing orders I don’t mind but I am pretty socially anxious and am frightened of the idea of needing to help customers order food on my own and struggling with it. Today I had to seat people on my own and struggled a lot with knowing where to put them and someone else needed to take over. I still haven’t taken an order from a customer yet or over the phone and I am dreading it. And all the while only making minimum wage. That all sounds bad but I do like a lot of the people there, they are fun and are welcoming of me and understand that I am still learning and will get there eventually. And I would feel pretty bad to tell my manager that I need to put in my two weeks notice as he’s been among the friendliest and most welcoming saying that I will get the hang of things in no time. And i got a whole shirt that would probably haunt me with guilt for wanting to quit not even a week in. 
For other plans, I got emails from Jewel and Whole Foods today saying they finally looked at my applications I sent them months ago and are willing to interview me. That got me daydreaming about how nice it would be to simply stock shelves or be responsible for a simple cash register, rather then the stressful fast paced world of food service. I am thinking I try to interview with them to see if I get any offers and maybe if they pay better and are a way less stressful environment then I could consider switching. If it matters then I graduated from college last spring and I was an English major and no I don’t have any particular interest in teaching or graduate school. I just want to make a living so i can hang with my friends and play video games and I’ll figure out the rest later. 
I am scared that this is too soon for me to leave when the people at my current job seem set on me staying and would have to go through the hassle of hiring and training someone new because I didn’t want to try to hack it. But I suppose bowing out early could be better then having a meltdown midshift that causes me to get fired. Today really was my first Busy day though so maybe I shouldn’t write the whole job off after one bad day. Especially when I have a pretty good time working when the orders are slow and I have a chance to breath and check my phone.

1gx2eu6,Help Picking Between Two Trade Apprenticeship Offers,"hey! I have been offered two apprenticeship positions and am having trouble deciding on one. 

The first is a big commercial company that wants to take me to a foreman and supervsior role, would be good money as they work on a range of massive projects and would also have potential of travel as they operate in different states. However the apprenticeship is through a third party where I am employed by a recruitment agency instead of the company so im worried that my job isnt as secure and I can just be changed to a different employer just like that.

The second one is a residential business, super great, as good as it can get, does things by the books and dont cut corners. Its a family run business so they are really tight knit sweet people, probably the best it can get for residential businesses but because its a 2 person team that pretty much hires sub contractors to do the rest, im worried there isnt gonna be much room for me to grow but they are  willing to support me into getting building qualifications. Also with any residential businesses it runs the risk of them going bankrupt so im also worried about job security in this sense.

I just graduated High School so im not sure if I should pick a commercial company where theres so much potential to grow and even travel, however be worried about being employed by a recruitment agency and not the employer, or go with a residential business where im more likely to learn more intricate things but only have so far I can go.

1gx1plk,Do I take the promotion?,"I have the opportunity to accept a promotion from my current job to becoming a supervisor of the same role. I’m very torn about accepting it or staying put with my current position. 
I have been in my job for 2 years and 7 months and it was my first “big girl” job after college. Throughout this job I have experienced a lot of changes in my personal life. I lost my Dad to terminal illness 2 years ago. I recently split up (got dumped a little over a month ago) with my partner of almost 7 years, and have recently moved out of the apartment we shared (we’ve lived together for around 3/4 years) and am temporarily staying at my friends house in the meantime. This promotion was brought up a few months ago and was then put on hold and was recently brought up again. I applied around 2 weeks ago and had an in person interview with the VP who would be my new boss and my current supervisor. I was offered the role this Wednesday and they would like me to start as soon as possible. My current work hours (second shift) was a concern for my partner and ultimately led to him feeling disconnected to me and ending things with me. This new position would be 11:00am-7:30pm with potential for some flexibility. The pay would be an increase but not a huge amount. Things that are holding me back from taking it is the amount of stress and responsibility it may bring. Right now I am able to clock in and clock out and not bring work home with me, while the new position I would need to be available a lot more (be on call for issues that arise and cover when short staffed) and may have to help fill in other roles as needed (if a supervisor of a different campus needs off etc). I worry that the money and the new job on my resume isn’t enough for me to sacrifice my peace of mind of leaving work at work, and isolating from my current coworkers that I love to work with. I talk to some on a daily basis outside of work through text and overall get along with/ am friends with all of them. I don’t know if I should change the relationships I have with everyone when trying to navigate this new chapter of my life. On top of that, there are a lot of changes within the department that most employees are not taking well and doesn’t seem to be all planned out, and I would have to be the deliverer of these new processes and navigate learning a new role and these new changes. There’s also not a lot of potential growth after this position in this department. I also debate about going back to school for a masters degree and feel like now may be a good time.

1gx0lmv,Not sure whether the therapy field is for me. Alternatives? ,"Not sure whether this is the field for me

Hi Everyone

I have been struggling with this recently. I am currently in my third year of a counselling degree..I am required to start practicum next year and I am worried whether it is the right decision to continue on in my studies or pivot to another degree. 

To begin, I feel that I have not been able to fully deal with my own emotional issues which have really impeded on my life recently..for instance, I was not able to make it to multiple classes due to social anxiety and avoidance..I would rather sit in my car for hours..therefore I was not able to begin my practicum this year as I had to withdraw from my two practicum related classes. 

I also am in a job which is so incredibly boring, and one in which I have stopped going too as I have started experiencing depressive symptoms, avoiding social situations, instead I choose to stay home, smoke weed and play video games, sleep, or eat..therefore I feel like I am nowhere near in the right position to begin practicum and help others when I am struggling and living so passively. 

I am not sure what to do, as I am hiding what I am feeling from those around me in fear of judgement. I feel as if I should know more about myself and learn ways to fix these areas of my life before even thinking of becoming a counsellor…

I am very lost at the moment as to whether continue my studies, or switch to another degree while taking part in my own therapy. any advice will he appreciated, thank you.

I would have about a 40 minute drive to Steris. I have a job offer from a local dentist. Less than 10 minutes away. Willing to pay comparable to Steris(from what I have heard) and he will supply insurance for me but not my husband. I’m really torn right now. I hate to drive 40 minutes and work 50ish hours per week. If I take the dental job and he retires in 5 years; I will be 5 years older and stuck. I loved dentistry for a long time but I’m not in love with it anymore. But it is so close to home and I would actually have time to pursue other interests. I worked for this dentist years ago. He was very upset when I left for another job( money and benefits). That company went out of business. So I tried other things: online publishing, sales, construction. I have filled in at his office a couple of times this past year. I like him, but I don’t want to leave him high and dry if something comes along.

1gwz0z7,Advice for Interviewing for a higher level position?,"Recently I was invited to an initial phone screening interview for a position that is a step up from my current responsibilities.

I am really interested in the job, so with my lack of managerial experience does anyone have advice on how to realistically sell myself? I know with adequate training I can definitely learn quickly and take on the position if given the opportunity, and I feel that this initial opportunity of a phone interview is a good foot in the door- but how should I approach the interview so that the factor of my current lack of experience doesn't take me off the table?

1gwyweu,Threatened with escalation over small mistake ,"A manager ( I don't report to) said a small mistake I made was to be treated as an escalation.

Essentially, I missed looping a colleague in an email chain response because said colleague wasn't part of the original thread. The colleague clearly complained to the manager because the  manager reached out and said this would be treated as as escalation and there are other instances of same thing happening ( which I can't recall at all...)

I got scared and bridged the situation with apologies, but I am wondering if I should have pushed back and asked for clarification. I should have known, I suppose but the colleague was looped in within an hour of the Email

For context on me, I currently have 2 years of experience at the same company where i started off as an intern and transitioned into a full time role following a brief period of unemployment due to completing grad school.

Anyways, here's the comment below, let me know what you guys think about this. Thanks for your time in advance.

""This is great advice, i just wish I had the option to choose from multiple jobs. I already have a job which pays less than an average SWE makes at my experience level (around 20% less) and I would kill to have the ability to be able to choose between a higher paying job and a more ""balanced job"". I have been applying to many places, working on my interview skills, reaching out to connections in desirable companies and getting referrals, and getting certified in my niche. This is still not enough for me to even get a chance to interview for another job. I suppose I'm glad that my current job isn't too high in terms of intensity so I can spend time during and after work hours sharpening my skills, but if I already had a job that pays better, I wouldn't spend so many hours outside of work trying to get a better job. Id rather have a job that pays better which made me work 45-50 hours a week than my current job which is realistically 30 hours of actual work where I'm spending another 20-30 hours every week preparing for interviews in the hopes I can get that better job.

When I asked about plans for 2025, the response felt vague, which makes me wonder if my role is as clearly defined as it could be. For the record, my job is not in danger, but I want to ensure I’m being as effective and prepared as possible.

I wanted to get out of service industry to have a normal schedule in hopes that it would improve my studies. I found a job in the corporate healthcare world as an administrative assistant. I enjoy the job itself but hate the environment and my boss. It’s an extremely stressful environment where expectations are ridiculously high. It’s been almost 6 months. My boss doesn’t smile at me. They don’t ask how my weekend was. We don’t know anything about each other and we don’t talk unless they’re assigning me a task. I work 40+ hours a week. Most days staying late because there just isn’t enough time in the day to complete everything I’m assigned. I’m exhausted. I feel unappreciated. But the pay is amazing.

1gwwd2o,"I’m awful at my job - should I quit, let them fire me, or is there any hope I stay?","Basically xposed from r/carrerguidance. (throwaway because I don’t want this in my main (mods please don’t delete this!!))

Tl;dr: Been at admin job 3 yers. Went on FMLA twice, second time i felt I wasn’t ready to go back. Currently, my whole life is a mess and it reflects in my work and my mistakes there. I’m very ashamed. My boss and company have been very supportive but I think they are  finally done and thinking of firing me, but should I just quit? I’m so embarrassed.

For context, I (24F) have been at an admin job for three years and it’s the best job I’ve had so far. I like my job. It doesn’t “fill all of my passions” or whatever. It’s just a job.

In the first two years of my employment I had to go on FMLA… TWICE. Once due to a mystery illness (since identified). This leave was intermittent. The 2nd FMLA was when there was a lot of stuff on my plate at work and they also “removed the position” of one of the most helpful employees. My tasks were overwhelming me. Once day, my boss asked me what was wrong, and I just bawled my eyes out. I have diagnosed depression and generalized anxiety disorder (I didn’t tell my boss that, more so that I need to step away for my health).

I went out fully on leave this time. I felt so guilty since my team was struggling without me. But my boss has always been so nice and urged me to take care of myself. During that time, I got hospitalized, went through a lot of med changes during what’s called a “Partial Hospitalization Program”. I didn’t feel ready to go back to work but the short term disability was running out and I really wanted to avoid long-term disability.

Once I was back to work, we took the transition slow and, at my request, an accommodation was put in so that my hours would be 8:00am to 5:00pm instead of my normal 8to4pm so that I had an extra hour break time at my disposal (unpaid). Being back was great and I felt very helpful but slowly, I decompensated. I feel like anxiety and procrastination were my biggest enemies. I’d just put stuff off because it gave me so much anxiety.

Also, my life outside of work is a mess: I have no work-time balance, don’t make time to exercise most of the time, and most of my friends live out of the state and out of the country. I also can’t cook to save my life. I want to start cooking but am afraid to start (procrastinating again). I am on a high dose of anxiety medication, recently realized I have sleep apnea which explains why it’s so damn hard for me to get up, and stress just affects me so much and I know there are other things I can do to help it but they scare me too.

So when I show up for work, I look passable. My Work return time is the same: passable. I often take more than I can handle and I want to be present for the meetings, but there is just so much in my mind I have to constantly redirect myself. Even when things get boring, I just try to suck it up. I really have, but the cracks are clear now: I keep oversleeping and being late to meetings. I fear my boss has lost her patience with me. Understandable so. If I were here I would’ve fired me.

I DONT want to be fired, After an issue today (I didn’t complete something that should’ve been done in the morning) I was working on setting it up, but got locked out of the program we use for that. And then I got locked out of a similar program. I can still access client sensitive information though. In a panic, I emailed my boss “Am I being fired?”. No response. After an hour, I emailed her and asked if she was willing to jump on a call at the end of the day. She said she doesn’t have time and we will meet tomorrow.

(We have weekly check-ins all the time and she had move ours to Friday, at which time I was also hoping to address my lateness (no excuse for it).

I don’t know that I’ll be fired exactly tomorrow, maybe they need some time to make a decision. But, should I quit? Right now I plan to spend the whole evening doig things I should’ve done moooonths ago, because it was my responsibility to and money is not all that matters. I’m indebted to them, specifically my boss, who took such a chance on me. What should I do?

PD:  I take accountability for every mess up. I know this is on me and fully my responsilibty. I am ashamed and wish I had done better. I look to grow from this experience. Any and all advice welcome. If there is any way that I can keep my job (I suspect not), BUT, if you see any, please let me know. Thank you so much.

1gww38q,Am I making this current worry I have at my new job  worse than it really is?,"

Ugh.  I’m worrying if this is a good fit for me. I’ve worked as a financial aid advisor at my current job for almost 3 months, my probation period ends in Dec. I came to this job with almost 2 years of prev experience, it’s a school I’ve been trying to get into for a while. When I trained, I was with the manager and there were no other new hires. The mgr pointed out to the team in my first ever team meeting that I was a quick learner etc and I also got that kind of feedback when we were 1:1. I was eventually passed down to a supervisor and she also said the same kind of feedback like the mgr. 

Ever week, the supervisor and I have a 1:1 where we go over my students and metrics, she wants to talk about each of my students (mostly the ones who need to have their financial aid cleared). When I first started, idk if it was dumb luck but almost every single student was responsive & I felt like I rarely needed her redirection on students needing to be cleared unless I had a separate question. Now, all of my new students are just not responsive or their file is complex etc and it’s discouraging. She gives her feedback/suggestions/corrections on how to handle them, whatever you want to call it & sometimes, she’s either: giving me incorrect info & when I clarify with another dept/student it’s wrong, I ask for her help on something/another pair of eyes and when I submit the file to compliance it’s sometimes rejected & sometimes she just makes things confusing for me. 

I’ll start by saying I know I’m very very new and when I’m wrong well that’s all to it, there’s a lot I don’t know and she clearly has a lot more knowledge than I do. But…why is she unintentionally steering me in the wrong direction at times? I’ve dealt with bosses in the past who made mistakes but the rate she’s been doing them at is more than what I’m used to compared to my experiences with bosses at old jobs. When I was training with the mgr when I first started, I didn’t feel this way & it wasn’t like this. The supervisor tends to compliment me every time we meet but…why is it during our 1:1 I’m getting more suggestions on how to handle certain students? Is it because I just have a lot more difficult ones now? Is it a reflection of my work? Is it because I’m new? Or all of the above? 

Is this the norm with jobs? Or are my expectations too high when it comes to leadership? Or even myself?",Dsg1695,1,1.0,0,1732238758,2024-11-22 01:25:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gww38q/am_i_making_this_current_worry_i_have_at_my_new/,11,2024

1gwvi2t,"My coworker, who has been targeting me ever since she found out I wasn’t gay, might be promoted soon to be my boss.","I know it’s kind of a crazy statement to make, but I’ve confirmed this in a “beyond shadow of a doubt” kind of way, including with a key individual who was involved at the inflection point.

Let me start off by saying I don’t think she’s a bad person, she might not even be entirely aware of what she’s doing. It’s mostly public nit picky criticisms and passive negativity (although there have been a handful of individual slights), but she’s close with the bosses and I’m afraid of what kind of conversations they have had as I’m not great at reading others’ opinions of me. As much as I try not to care what others think of me, I fear the constant passive negativity especially in front of higher ups has already and will continue to hurt my future chances. It’s been a long road bringing my self esteem up from nothing but this is really taking its toll.

As far as the gay thing, we started off on good footing but there was a certain inflection point. From then all this has started and has not stopped. I’ve been documenting every instance I can and I’ve even spoken briefly and discretely with coworkers who confirm the unfair treatment but I’d rather not ever have their involvement known.

We had long standing relationships with them build over the course of years with time handwork and trust but my father tried to help some of his friends by helping them enter the market and stand as their guarantee but they screwed him over they lowered the wastage spat bullshit our mistake was not being aware of the politics and now we stand at 100 karigars with only 2 running parties.

Our capacity is to show production of 30 kgs per month  and we are barely crossing 5kg with savings draining just to keep the business alive. 
The advice i want is how do i find people who are looking for vendors the two things i can assure them is purity of the metal and finishing you can tell when an ornament is made by our karigars we do job work and direct sale also but mostly job work with no making charged only wastage of 8 percentage gold to gold transactions any item ready within 3 days in a week we can produce at least 10 kgs in a month 30-35 kgs without any delay if they give us the metal.

Not sure if this will sound cringe or like main character syndrome lol but this is genuinely how l've felt my entire life. My only goal and dream in life is for it to be exciting as possible, with action and engagement, both physical and mental. I would like to be able to use my own brain and have to problem solve/ investigate (maybe). I hate the idea of comfort and peace for the rest of my life, and I am not at all afraid of danger or physical threat, and want there to be some sort of threat in my job to keep me motivated and feel a sense of purpose in my job. I would not be happy with a job that's only focused on adrenaline or one that doesn't really serve a greater purpose (ie. skydiving instructor, journalist, etc. or something). For other info I am a double major studying International Relations and Biology. I am in shape, go to the gym and on runs regularly, did many sports in the past, and have a few years experience in Taekwondo and am starting to learn Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. I have been looking into maybe working for the FBI or CIA as a clandestine or special agent, but am not completely sure yet.

1gwss3g,Should I keep being productive in my internship even though I might not receive work contract in the end,"I'm currently in my mid-internship program for a software start-up. I love the work, my manager and the CEO, and I have been working on new things every sprint. I've received positive feedbacks from my manager and the CEO and they even wanted me to improve their development workflow. As far as I see, the start-up is doing financially well, but when I asked my boss if there's a chance for my employment in the future, he said they will see at the end of next year if they have more investors to recruit more employees. However, my internship and planned thesis would end before that.

Now, my work motivation has gone downhill. Part of the reason I accepted the internship is because I want to work after graduating. What frustrated me the most was that they recruited one developer 1 month before I joined and he has been a living hell for me. He never tested his work before pushing the features and I have to patch the works. He over-complicated our architecture even though the manager and I  warned him, still, he's persistent that it was the best method, now every time his code breaks, we can barely debug it. He never listened to me when I advised him something until my manager told him. If I or any college received compliments, he passively wanted to outshine us. So in their mind, I've been doing well but I might not be employed but that guy can!?

Should I still maintain my current performance considering it might not pay off in the end? I need some advice.",Whole-Government5925,1,1.0,7,1732229511,2024-11-21 22:51:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gwss3g/should_i_keep_being_productive_in_my_internship/,11,2024
1gwrwop,Don't know where to go from here?,"I had a logistics business from the age of 19 all the way up until now (I'm 27), that I built up from the depths of hell by myself.

I made close to $2.6 million pure profit by the time I was 24, and due to some bad addictions and decisions I made coupled with some unfortunate luck on investments, I lost everything I had and now I'm in debt and had to shut down my business.

  
I don't want to type out an entire thesis statement regarding my lore and backstory, but it's an interesting one to say the very least.

  
Along my business, I've been making music as well for the past 7 years, and make some money off of it and I've garnered somewhat of a sizeable audience and presence on the internet, but nowhere near the amount where I'd say I can comfortably live off of it and sustain my life.

I'm having a huge crisis at the moment in terms of deciding what to do next with my life. Absolutely nothing is sparking my interest anymore and even sometimes I'd say the music and artistic creativity in myself is suffering because of all the other circumstances in my life.

  
I've been looking for a 9-5 for the past 4 months, I've sent over 950 applications since July, have only gotten 3 interviews, and have been unable to get hired anywhere (specifically been looking for into sales oriented roles). I'll admit, in the beginning of my search my ego really prevented me from conforming to this idea but I realized in order for me to survive that it's necessary, but even then, I'm unable to find work fitting to my skill level/soft skills.



I'm losing faith in returning to a 9-5, I don't see a purpose in returning to school as there are no lines of educational paths that I find myself aligning with and finding myself to the agreeance of commitment to them being worth the while.

The logistics business is out of the question for me as I want to completely stay away from it, I made a ton of money while I was in it but it wasn't what my heart wanted and I think that ship has sailed now with how far into debt I have ventured.

I don't know what to look towards now, everything seems dull, there aren't things I have particular interest in, I'm starting to think that every dopamine receptor in my brain has been fried.



The reason I'm posting this here is because I seldom know that I am an ""entrepreneur"" by heart and by spirit. Everything I've done in my life up until this point has revolved around self direction, risk taking, and defying all odds against me.

I don't know where to go from here, and I'm hoping for any advice I can get from other like minded individuals.

I'm sorry if I didn't give enough details about myself to warrant anything helpful from those of you reading, I'm just hesitant in terms of sharing too much.

  
Thanks for reading.

1gwrv2t,Gap Year Internship,"Hello everyone,

I have an upcoming interview for a marketing internship at a Big 4 company, specifically in B2B service marketing. My background is rooted in several relevant internships in the consumer goods sector (FMCG), which means my experience so far has been primarily B2C-focused.

My goal after completing my Master’s degree (2025-2026) is to return to the FMCG sector and ideally start a trainee program there. Now, I’m wondering whether I should accept the Big 4 internship (if I get an offer) and shift from B2C to B2B.

I’m aware that an internship at a Big 4 company is not particularly groundbreaking, but it’s certainly not a bad choice either. Do you think this internship could provide me with valuable new experiences? To me, the role doesn’t seem especially challenging. I’m questioning how relevant or beneficial such an internship might be for my future career.

Should I continue looking for other internships in the consumer goods sector instead? I’ve already applied to several large companies in Germany & Austria. Some applications didn’t progress after a few rounds, and in other cases, I declined offers myself.

I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts on this!

1gwrpzv,Been waiting for an assigned parking space for 3 years. Today I followed up for the third time and was told there are none available when I'm certain there are. I need help responding to my ED professionally without sounding winey.,"I work in a professional capacity on the administration team for a large non-profit. 

I've been here 3.5 years.

Note, we have a for-profit arm who owns the 6-floor building I work in, so a few of the floors are leased out to other orgs/businesses. We also own the Impark (paid lot), adjacent to the building. This info will be relevant at the end.

Now, not to sound like a douche but for those of you who work in corporate jobs you might understand... i work on the uppermost floor where everyone has a spot. The good spots. However when I was hired I was told at that moment nothing was available, but that after my 6 month probation they'd move somethings around and get me assigned something. That was 3 years and 3 managers ago.

When my most recent manager (the Executive Director of the organization), joined the team in January 2024, she told me to put my request in an email after I spoke to her about this verbally, and she said she'd look in to it. I sent it in an email and she never responded.

I waited 8 months before following up. I figured she was busy getting her feet under her and dealing with my parking spot might seem trivial. She never responded to that follow up either.

I waited another two months (until today), to follow up a third time. She responded almost immediately saying this:

""to date there is no open spaces and all of parking spaces around the building are currently leased to building tenants. Other staff lease spots in the Impark lot \[the paid lot\]. My only suggestion is to continue checking with security on a daily basis if an open spot is available. Or, pay to lease your own parking spot.""

Like... fuck... am I wrong to be pissed at this point? I'm not going to pay out of pocket for a spot when I know for a fact that even those who many lease spots in the paid lot get it reimbursed.

I mentioned earlier that our building has tenants which is why i dont know EXACTLY which spots are available, but, what pisses me off is I have seen brand new positions get created, some in this last year, and those people get spots immediately.

We even have a row of 6 spots that are ""first come first served"" spaces that usually get scooped up first thing in the morning, yet magically a few months ago one of those was taken away and assigned to staff member I work alongside. I pointed this out to my manager in my first follow up. 

I need help responding to my ED, and essentially saying ""what the fuck?! Hello!"" In the last 10 months i KNOW spots have been available and it's not like I've been complacent about making her aware that I'm waiting. And it's also not like she doesn't see my face every day. We work on the same floor.

1gwra1e,"Returning to the Workforce After a Sabbatical: Seeking Advice on Job Search, Career Goals, and Skill Refreshing","I’m (28M) a data analytics professional with a Physics degree and Business Analytics master’s, re-entering the workforce after a year-long sabbatical. I’d love advice on job searching, framing my career gap, and targeting industries that value my experiences.

**TL;DR:** I have five years of professional experience with a career gap after a sabbatical. I spent the year solo-travel across Europe, Asia and the US and teaching ski lessons for two seasons. I’m seeking advice and strategy on re-entering the workforce, targeting industries that value my experiences, tips for refreshing technical skills and framing my story effectively during interviews.

# Background

I have an undergraduate degree in Physics and a master's in Business Analytics. I spent five years in data analytics, working for a market research startup and two large corporations. I gained promotions and honed technical skills like predictive modeling, R, and Python. My career transition stemmed from structural changes at one company and a misaligned role at another.

# Why I Took a Sabbatical

Just after my two-year anniversary with a market research startup, the company underwent major structural changes. Half of my department was laid off, including all team leads. I was assigned a new role but was passed on for a promotional move and frankly, the writing was on the wall for my department on the whole. I decided to take advantage of the opportunity and head out on a sabbatical. I moved out of my apartment and went on a month-long hiking pilgrimage.

When I returned, I got a new job within just a few weeks. However, my role didn’t align with my skills or career goals. Previously, I worked in a dynamic, high-tech and challenging environment. I used various types of prediction models, ran calculations on huge data sets and coded in R and Python. I was engaged and excited by this environment and felt like I was always learning. 

But now, I was emailing back and forth excel files with ""version 5.5"" tacked on to the end of their filename to a boss who was extremely disorganized. The technology preferred by the leadership was comparatively primitive and the requirements on my work lacked challenge. After six months, I saw little opportunity for personal or professional development at this company. While the experience highlighted the importance of fit in a role, it also reinforced my passion for innovation and using advanced analytics tools in dynamic environments.

# What I Did/ Am Doing on Sabbatical

As I left my last job, I became a full-time ski instructor. I spent five months teaching people of all ages to ski, including about a third of my schedule being spent teaching kids with cognitive and neurological disabilities like Autism and Down's Syndrome. Following the winter season, I embarked on a more traditional gap year. I solo-traveled across Europe and Asia for nearly three month. When I returned to the US, I spent two months in a camper-converted-SUV driving all across the country. My sabbatical wasn’t a pause in my career but an opportunity to explore teaching, cultural immersion, and logistical challenges, all of which enhanced my adaptability, problem-solving, and communication skills.

# Career Goals

Now, I am back teaching ski lessons but am also spending the winter taking my professional re-entry head on. My sabbatical allowed me to develop adaptability, effective and resourceful communication, logistical planning, and creative problem-solving—all of which I believe will make me a stronger contributor to future teams. I’m passionate about working in roles that allow me to use my technical skills (e.g., R, Python, data modeling) in innovative ways, ideally in a collaborative, high-growth environment. I'm highly interested in leadership, team management and teaching or coaching.

# Questions For Advice

Are there any strategies, resources, communities, or networks specifically for professionals returning after a sabbatical?

Which industries or roles value a combination of data analytics and soft skills gained from teaching and cross-cultural experiences?

I’d appreciate any tips on:

1. Framing a career gap and job changes during interviews.
2. Industries or roles where my skills and experiences might shine or which ones to avoid.
3. How to refresh technical skills like R and Python effectively. Thank you in advance for your help!",newisroutine,1,1.0,0,1732225608,2024-11-21 21:46:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gwra1e/returning_to_the_workforce_after_a_sabbatical/,11,2024

Then, I would say everyone else at the company has never really said anything negative towards me. One time a senior manager in another department gave me an award.

It's like I get really mixed signals about my performance and then on top of it my manager has basically never told me if I'm doing good or bad.

1gwqse1,22 year old needing guidance please,"Hi everyone!

I am still very new to Reddit, so please forgive me if my format or wording is odd. As the title says, I am looking for career advice. I am graduating from Baruch this Spring '25, with most likely a GPA of 3.3-3.4. I used to be a 3.7 GPA student but I slacked like 2 semesters and ruined it a bit.

  
Anyways, I am a political science major and philosophy minor and I am acknowledging now I am not passionate about political science (I started it with the intention of becoming a Congressmen but... need I say more?) I've decided that I want to do something that will truly be fascinating to me, and incites passion. 

  
I have always enjoyed science, particularly physics and neuroscience. Space, how elements particles, and chemicals act, and the brain have always fascinated me. Also, recently I have gotten really into organic architecture. I am a server at a restaurant, at a high volume upscale place, have been learning to cook, and the hospitality industry has honestly been very fun for me. Lastly, I also enjoy writing and want to hone on the skill a bit.

My question is going to be very vague and I apologize beforehand, what advice can you give me if I do decide to focus on ANY of the interest listed above? My favorites do have an order...

1.) Science (Physics first, neuroscience second)

2.) Architecture/writing (These are a tie)

3.) Hospitality (particularly fine dining)

I want to know if I should get a whole new bachelors, essentially restart schooling. If I could get any masters that would accept me. Get a job with my current degree that will in a way lead me to a career I will genuinely like and be interested in. As I said I am asking something very vague. However, any guidance, help, or direction I would be so grateful for.

Got my Bachelor's, attended other industry-specific programs, currently studying for my CPA. I've been in the succession plan for the CFO position for the last 3 years and the CFO is now approaching that retirement date. All I've heard from her and the President has been that I'm a shoe-in and that any sort of interviewing with our Board of Directors will be a formality. I found out today that the job will be posted both internally and externally on Indeed. Like, wtf?? I'm pissed, blindsided, and feel like a carrot has been dangled in front of me only to be jerked away. The only reason I can see they would post externally would be to find a more experienced candidate. Why bother approaching me about the job at all, if that was the case? Other executive positions have been available over the years and posted internally only at first; if no existing employee is interested, then the job gets posted externally. No one has spoken to me directly about the job posting. My office shares a thin wall with the CFO and I overheard the conversation.

1gwpojd,Masters in MQF vs. Computer and Electrical Engineering,"I'm currently a senior CS undergrad at Rutgers with an econ minor, and I'm trying to figure out the best master's program to achieve my career goal of becoming a Quantitative Developer.

The two options I'm considering are:

1. **Masters in Quantitative Finance (MQF)** at Rutgers: It aligns with the financial side of quant roles and would deepen my understanding of financial modeling, risk management, and trading strategies.
2. **Masters in Computer and Electrical Engineering** (also at Rutgers): This would further develop my technical skills, particularly in areas like high-performance computing, hardware design, and software systems—skills that seem relevant for the coding-heavy aspects of quant dev work.

My main question is: Which of these would better prepare me for a career as a Quant Dev? I have strong programming skills in Python and a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures from my CS background, and I'm confident in my ability to handle both financial and technical coursework.

Would the MQF give me an edge with domain knowledge in finance, or would the engineering degree open up broader technical opportunities for implementing the algorithms and systems used in quantitative trading?

1gwpmgj,Need help deciding between a career in IT or finance….,"
i am a may 2024 grad with a computer science degree from a competitive school in NY. I currently live in california w my parents and have been on the job hunt for so long. Thought this day would never come, but I finally have offers! 

The first is for a 2 year new grad finance program. It’s in LA, close to family, and good starting and sign on bonus. The cons are it starts in june 2025, and it’s not related to my major (I had applied because I got desperate with my little luck w jobs in tech). However, I am open to making the switch to finance and have taken and excelled in my college finance courses.

The second offer is a 2 year new grad IT program in new jersey. The program has two cohorts - one starting in january! So yay i wouldn’t have to wait 7 months to start lol. Con’s are although IT is related to my major, i def was hoping pursue the software engineering route. Unfortunately I’m not crazy excited about IT. Also i’m not familiar with career growth and opportunities in IT. The role also pays slightly less than the finance program and relocation is required and the company doesn’t cover that. However, new jersey is close to my college and near nyc where a lot of my college friends work so i’d def be excited to be back on the east coast again 🥹

So my options are for one, I can accept both offers. Then move to new jersey and start the IT program in january and then quit and move back home before june to start with the finance program?? However this will be so expensive in terms of relocation costs. I also feel like a shitty person quitting in the middle of the program lol. Second option is to decline the IT program and work a regular job until the finance program start date in June? Third is to decline the finance program and just move to new jersey and start a career in IT. Fourth is to keep applying to jobs on linkedin and see if i can find a tech role in software engineering that starts now and pays good. but the likelihood of that is so low and i really don’t want to return to the job market. 

What do you guys think you would do? I think my main concern now is whether it’s worth it to switch to finance - specifically in banking - if my other option is IT. Again, i’m not sure how IT is in terms of career growth. Btw I’m 21 and still early career.

1gwpf6g,Career turning point,"Hello everyone 
I'm in the crossroads regarding my career. I'm currently working at a prime position, with near top tier pay in my organisation and in a high prestige unit. I also like my job very much and Im very competent at it. The bad news is that during the past 4 years I've been working away from my wife and kids and see them every 10 days. 
Lately I've been offered a transfer to a place where my family resides. However, it has lower pay by 30% and a lower prestige, other things being equal more or less. The wage is still way above average where I live though. On the plus side, I will be working fewer hours so I will have more time for side hustles that can easily get me a part of the money I lose, plus offering me some income diversification.
Obviously, the other choice is to get my family to live where I work now. 
My question is this: What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I am extremely passionate about the outdoors, I am a natural leader and love to hike/ anything outdoors. I’m very active, I play soccer and when I don’t play soccer I love to run and just completely my first marathon. 

My main areas or interest in school are English and History. I love to read and know more about history, however I’m not sure I want to major in it as I’m worried it might be hard to find a job. I love to debate as well and find philosophy very interesting.

In a very broad sense, I know I want to help people and/or the environment in some way. This summer I’m looking to intern at a conservation corps and do some trail maintenance work. After that, depending on what college I go to, I was thinking of maybe double majoring in philosophy and something else. Then maybe going to law school, but I’m worried I will hate the “corporate world” and continue to dream of being outside and helping the earth.

1gwoxyo,24 and at a crossroads. What would you do? ,"I’ve been in the automotive industry for the past 5 years selling Subarus topping out my income at around $130k at most, and I have 2 really great career opportunities on the table. Not sure which one to take and would appreciate any advice/guidance. My two potential opportunities are to get back into the automotive business with arguably the best company with the best culture in my state or get into corporate America through Capital One. I would be selling BMW’s with the dealership job and I would be a buyer (relationship manager) for dealerships with Capital One Auto Finance with the other.

With Capital One, if I hit my bonus target + overtime I’m at $99,600/year, before overtime and bonuses I would make a salary of $73,300, 401k with up to 6% match, blue cross blue shield insurance, gym onsite, physician on site, free nutritionist, stock purchase plan, cafeteria’s onsite, free mental health services, and tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 a year. All bank holidays and 15 PTO days in the first year and 20 days PTO after the first year. 2 days a week working from home. At most I’d be working 45 hours/week. The schedule would be 11-8 which works well for me since I’m a night owl anyways, and I would have the opportunity to work from home Mondays and Fridays after my 90 day training period. 

With BMW I have $6k/month salary for the first 3 months with potential to make $150-$200k+. I’d be doing sales and finance, they don’t have finance managers over there. I get a BMW company car with paid gas and insurance. Blue cross blue shield for health insurance and 401k with a match of 4%, 5 days PTO in the first year and 15 days after the first year. At most working 55 hours/week. They also offer tuition reimbursement and invest a lot into their employees and training. The schedule would be a mix of opening, mid shift, and closing shift throughout the week. They are open from 8 AM - 8 PM and I would get Sundays and one day off during the week. 

I feel like this is such a huge decision and everyone in my family/my fiancé’s family has been telling me to go the Capital One route. I also want to finish my bachelor’s degree and I want the opportunity to move up and grow with the company. Both companies have told me there is tremendous room for growth and opportunity to move up. My head is telling me Capital One but my heart is telling me BMW.

I’ve been working as a developer for two years. My first year went well, but during my second year, I noticed my manager became increasingly critical and provided a lot of feedback. This caused significant stress and impacted my mental health. I decided to address the situation by having an open discussion with my manager and presenting a plan for improvement. However, after our discussions, the conclusion was that I should start looking for a new role. I was let go at the end.

1gwolc6,Is there any sense to quitting my corp job and take some time off to reset myself?,"Hi all,

I’m trying to get some advice on a decision I’ve been considering for the past month. I work in a marketing role and I’m starting to feel very burnt out. The subject matter isn’t really meaningful to me, our team is extremely lean so I feel stretched thin, and deadlines are very tight and constantly changing. The days are very long and I find myself thinking about work or doing work after hours, which combined with a long commute has become very draining. I had a lot of creative hobbies and I used to exercise regularly, but over the past year or so I’ve slowly stopped doing everything I used to be passionate about/interested in. I’m feeling very hollow. Because of this, I’ve been thinking of leaving and just having a few months to allow myself to reset, get my habits back, and then look for a new position. 

I am a bit concerned about a gap in employment, but I’m also worried that at this pace I’m inevitably going to make mistakes, and I’m worried I’ll end this position with a bad reputation if I keep going while I’m totally spent.

I don’t have any debt, my expenses are relatively low ($500/mo rent, $100 phone/internet, $45 gym membership, and $200 for groceries avg.), and I have some decent savings built up. I am also not a stranger to freelance work as well.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I’d really appreciate some guidance and a sanity check on whether this is crazy or not.

I've been working at a F500 company in the same city as my university for about 5 months and hate it. My managers treat me like shit, the field I got hired for has nothing to do with my major, and the pay is laughable for the amount of work I do as compared to the original job description. I'm basically a data analyst on a teacher's salary after 401k, insurance, and taxes come out.

I want to quit and move cities, but nobody is hiring. I have 4+ internships from high school and college, have founded two semi-successful startup companies (for a 22 year old), and just want to find a job where I don't feel the need to see a therapist about after 5 months (I have never had mental health issues before). 

I don't want to move back home with my parents due to personal reasons, but I legitimately see no other option if I quit this job. Or, I could stay wake up with dread / anxiety every day until I find a new job.

I've put in about 1500 applications in 12 months, obviously including the one I put in to get hired here, but have continued to apply after being hired. 

1500 applications has gotten me 2 job offers (the other one was a sales job, which I don't want), and 15 interviews total. Keep in mind I network and am on the phone with someone new at least 3x a week to see what's out there, but have been told nobody is hiring in my field. 

I just have no idea what to do. I know I'm young and I keep reminding myself this is just a spec of dust on my life's timeline, but I am the type of person who always needs to be doing something and working towards my goals of being successful.

1gwnyta,"Should I Switch Companies Early in My Career?
","Hi All,

I’m currently working at a company called X as a Software Developer, where I primarily work on generative AI and build AI services. It’s been almost 6 months since I joined, and my current TC (total compensation) equals my base salary, as there are no additional benefits or RSUs.

Recently, I received an offer from Y, a fintech company, for an ML Engineer role. The base salary at Y is 1.25x my current base at X, and the overall CTC is more attractive due to RSUs, which will vest over a 4-year period.

At X, my notice period is 2 months, so I’m also considering how to manage this transition effectively if I decide to make the move.

The main reasons I’m considering this switch are:  
\- The higher base salary and overall compensation package.  
\- The potential for better work-life balance (WLB) and the relative stability of MNCs in India, as Y seems to have a better track record in these areas.

I’d love to hear your thoughts:  
\- Is it a good idea to switch companies this early in my career, especially since this would be my first major corporate move?  
\- How should I approach my manager and team to resign professionally, considering the notice period?

1gwmr38,Career Guidance Needed: Building a Cybersecurity Career Without a University Degree?,"I had to leave my bachelor’s degree halfway last year due to a personal emergency, and I haven’t been able to re-enroll in university yet as my situation remains uncertain. I was studying at a UK university but can no longer afford to continue there.

Since leaving, I’ve been self-studying to improve my programming skills and exploring affordable alternatives to build my career. While researching options, I discovered the Cybersecurity MicroMasters from RIT on edX (https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters/ritx-cybersecurity). It seems like a structured way to gain relevant cybersecurity knowledge.

I also recently started using Hack The Box and found it very engaging, especially the paths they offer for offensive security skills. I’m considering investing in a 1-year subscription to Hack The Box for more hands-on practice.

Given my circumstances, which would be more valuable for me right now:

Pursuing the RIT MicroMasters to gain structured academic knowledge and a credential?
Focusing on Hack The Box for practical, hands-on experience and certifications? I could also use some of my budget to buy a better laptop (I currently have an 8GB RAM laptop).
I’m interested in eventually working in offensive security, but this year has been very tough on me emotionally. I feel lost about how my career will progress, especially as my journey is now without a bachelor’s degree.

For context, I did receive an undergraduate diploma in higher education (science) for the credits I achieved during the two years of my bachelor’s program, which was focused on information systems and business management.

1gwme45,Consulting Roadmap - Help!,"I was not very proactive in university, mainly because I was unsure of what I wanted to do and struggled with mental health significantly. I did not do any internships, and all of my undergraduate work experience is as a golf instructor.

A year after graduating undergrad at age 25 with a BscH Mathematics degree, I got a job through a golf connection at a boutique FinTech consulting firm. I was hired as a general ""consultant"", but their goal for me was to teach me the ways of a BA or BSA. I am trying to figure out some next steps, as I have been at the job for about a year, and I am unsure of what to do next. This is how I look at my options:

1. i treat this job as the 'internship' that i didnt get in undergrad, and I look to move into a bigger firm maybe at an associate role (would consider analyst if the pay fits). PROS: i gain valuable experience at a large firm and can expand my exit opportunities into boutique firms again when i move on. i might be able to switch out of IT consulting and move to strategy, which i think i may like more. CONS: im effectively putting myself back into the powerpoint factory meat grinder, where the work is probably going to be way more removed, its going to be much more fast paced and cutthroat.
2. i try to hop to another boutique firm. PROS: familiarity with pace/working conditions etc. CONS: i image the payscale would be much slower to climb, and i can use the money as fast as possiuble rigth now.

i dont know if i want to be stuck working massive days for little pay while i enter my early 30s, but i also am willing to sacrifice some of that time for better exit opps.

We have been through alot in this time - growing the business and learning how to navigate  a pandemic and the forever changing healthcare field. I absolutely love my job and what I do! 

  
Back in 2016, there was doctor, we will call him Dr H for now, for whatever reason, he simply does not like me. I have the support of at least 6-7/10 of them, and the support is from the successful doctors at the center.

In 2022, Dr H marries one of our surgical techs after his divorce, and the interpersonal issues have resurfaced, his wife is now Dr. Wife H, and she demands we respect her as such. What use to be a place I loved, has turned into a battle ground over nothing.

Two weeks ago, Dr. H holds a secret vote to try and get me fired. He was trying to muster up enough votes from other owners and wanted to come in and fire me himself. He went to certain people he thought would be supportive of it. He tapped out at 3 votes and one of the top doctors said, lets have a meeting to discuss the center. All doctors get in the room and Dr H proceeds to explain why I need to be fired immediately and I assume they want Dr. Wife H to take my role. 

The other doctors that support me have come to me and explained they knew nothing and that my job is safe. I just know at the end of the day, doctors side with doctors and it will forever be a battle of me vs them and I will never win. My supporters are telling me ""dont let them win, show them theyre wrong!""

1gwkqif,Mismanagement,"Hi all. First of all, my first inclination is to not get involved.

My company is struggling. I've worked in this industry for several years, including for our top two competitors. 

Today I sat through a presentation by our new chief revenue officer, new role for the company - and he is charged with addressing some of these issues. 

The thing is, just this week I have seen the most egregious example of extreme mismanagement that I've ever seen in my career. It cost us a client. I know that similar situations have cost us two other clients within the past month. 

The people actually doing this are never going to admit it up the chain. This won't be addressed.

I could forward him an email chain and make it extremely obvious why this company is struggling. 

But my direct manager is one of the people who allowed the failure (he's a nice guy but not really competent for his role and displays zero leadership skills).

I don't know the new CRO and don't trust him to keep this anonymous. My instinct is to keep my head down and jump ship if my bonus isn't good this year or things start looking too dodgy. My pay is very good and my job is extremely easy and fully remote, so I'm not inclined to put all that at risk or maybe make people in my direct management line hate me.

I was on boarded at the end of September as a part time sub but they told me it was practically full time and by January we will discuss if I want full time or not based on whether I liked the position. The school campus entails YCC (14 month old- upper el which is like 6th grade). 

I told them upfront in the interview that I did not like working with younger children like prek and YCC. I had worked as a preschool teacher in my past and it was never my forte. Nap time was a huge weakness for me. Well, what do they do? They end up assigning me to YCC younger children for a lot of the time. This makes me look like I am not good at my job to other coworkers and etc, they did not respect my wishes with working with older children only. I figured I would bite my tongue because I need hours and this is where they need me, so I did my best.

I am working full time practically for them at this point. Maybe one day off in entirety of the couple of months I was there. They took portraits for their website of all of staff, which I was not included on. This kind of hurt, even though I knew I was a new hire, I felt like I was not part of the team. I also, have no key, when other staff members do, and was always getting buzzed in the school. Maybe because I am ""part time"" (even with full time hours)?

During nap time one of my coworkers we will call her Emily started berating me because one of the children had to go the bathroom. She asked if I let him go. All preschool students had gone and used right before nap time. I was telling a coworker about what happened when she asked how I was doing and she told me to tell my boss about situation that happened with Emily, they needed to know how I was feeling. I chose to take her advice and spoke up about Emily talking to me in a rude manner. My boss told me they had had a lot of issues Emily how she made others cry but she was a good teacher. She then gave me a hug. This all seemed kind of fake to me. The school literally is built on kindness, it’s in the contract. But, I figured maybe I was being too in my head.

After complaining about the coworker I walked past the director and she gave me the most fake smile like oh you did what you did type smile. Anyways, I kind of regret telling my boss about what happened with Emily but I wanted to listen to my coworker and figured they needed to know.

Anyways I notice online they never took down the job post for my position. They also had new subs coming and getting trained for my position I was hired for as the same time as I was working. This all was a huge toll on my confidence. Now, it has been at this point 3 days they have not needed me to come in. I am naturally concerned as I was coming in daily since I was hired. Is this there way of letting me go? They know I am in need of full time hours. Should I voice my opinions? Or just take the hint of the cut hours and look elsewhere?



She sent me: good morning! Ive been doing a beautiful job and they love having me a part of the school but everyone is healthy. She also sent me today, everyone is healthy and they will likely be tomorrow and for me to have a great thanksgiving and they will likely need me on the Monday after thanksgiving break. 

I was thinking of sending: Hi \_\_\_, what is my status with hours/ do you think this will keep on happening? I need to plan accordingly as I have bills to pay. I notice there are other subs being hired. Just need to know.

Let me know if I should send it, send something else, go to HR, or just move on and look elsewhere for a new job! Also, I feel she might be being very nice in the texts to cover themselves maybe?

Maybe I do not fit there image or they are upset I spoke up about one of the ladies that has been there a long time?",Misspumpkinz,1,1.0,0,1732209574,2024-11-21 17:19:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gwkmsd/any_advice_on_how_to_react_to_drastically_cut/,11,2024
1gwkcn3,Am I being fairly compensated at a small startup?,"I work at a **small healthcare/biotech startup in the Netherlands remotely from Slovakia** as a **Marketing Specialist for almost 2 years**, but I’ve recently been given the ""fake"" title of **Marketing and Digital Strategy Manager (I am not officially manager, just for the ""outside eyes"" :D)**. I just received a raise of **€287/month**, bringing my gross salary from **€2280/month** to **€2,567/month (about €30,804 annually)** starting January. I wanted to ask if this seems fair for my role, responsibilities, and location.

Here’s what I am currently responsible for:

* **Digital marketing**: advanced SEO strategy increased organic traffic by 226.8% compared to last year, managing social media, and email campaigns with high engagement rates (open rates up to 66% and click-through rates of 48%).
* **Content creation**: producing multimedia content like professional video (demo video due to budget constraints), graphic design (brochures, booths, posters, business cards and everything printable), and PowerPoint presentations, saving costs by handling this in-house.
* **Website management**: Maintaining and optimizing WordPress websites, including design, advanced SEO (using SEMrush starting from August), and custom post types. Achieved a 100/100 SEO score and 92/99 PageSpeed scores (mobile/desktop).
* **Campaign management**: leading marketing efforts for multiple startups under the same ownership, requiring constant adaptability and learning about different industries.
* **Strategic contributions**: supporting overall marketing strategies and often wearing multiple hats to meet company needs.

I am doing work for 2 different startups (one in biotechnology and one is pharmaceutical) and third startup was mentioned with website development required from me. While I’ve received **great** feedback on my work (praised too often), I feel the raise doesn’t fully reflect the jump in responsibilities and my contributions. I am also responsible for the whole branding and designs for both startups...

  
After receiving the raise, I politely approached my boss to express my thoughts on how the raise didn’t quite align with the scope of my expanded responsibilities or market benchmarks. I highlighted my contributions and asked if there might be room for reevaluation.

The response I received left me surprised. My boss called me and said he was ""extremely shocked"" by my reaction, as he had given me a **10% raise**, which he mentioned is the **highest percentage increase he’s ever given to anyone before and is considered very high in the industry**. He added that I should be ""grateful"" for this raise and how it’s very generous for the company, considering I live in Slovakia.

**I’d love your thoughts:**

1. Is this raise reasonable given my responsibilities? (I understand I come from Slovakia, but my values exceed expectations as my boss mentioned.)
2. Does my upcoming gross salary (€2,567/month) reflect my role accurately?
3. I have a small freelance besides my work, so I am not completely lost.. What to do next?

Thanks in advance for any advice or feedback! 😊 Appreciate it.",AudienceImmediate671,2,0.75,11,1732208937,2024-11-21 17:08:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gwkcn3/am_i_being_fairly_compensated_at_a_small_startup/,11,2024

1gwjnlw,"My husband has ADHD, chronic depression, and severe anxiety related to his current career in real estate, where clients treat him poorly and expect him to be available 24/7. He desperately needs a change, and we’ve been considering a career shift into the culinary field.","There are so many aspects of becoming a chef that would align with his needs and strengths, especially considering his neurodiversity. A guaranteed income, unlike the unpredictable, commission-based real estate world, would be a huge relief. Additionally, cooking has been a long-term special interest of his, and the idea of working with new ingredients and recipes excites him. The fast-paced environment of a kitchen could also help prevent him from feeling understimulated, which has been an issue in his current job.

However, he has had a history of working in toxic environments that have severely impacted his mental health, and I’m worried that the restaurant industry could be just another harmful place for him. From the long hours to the intense stress, I fear that it might exacerbate his existing issues instead of offering the relief we hope for.

I guess I’m just seeking some advice or encouragement: Is the culinary industry a good fit for someone with ADHD, chronic depression, and anxiety? Should he pursue this career change, or should he run as far as possible from it?

Any personal experiences or insights would be greatly appreciated!

I’m a junior employee, and while I mainly do repetitive, day to day tasks, I’ve asked my boss about shadowing, joining calls, or even contributing in any way to some interesting strategy projects. I’m hungry to learn more and felt a bit stagnant. Even on team meetings, I noticed sometimes im excluded. I’m on an all-woman team as well

She dismissed the idea and became a bit more defensive than I expected, stating “well that’s what you were hired for.” 

I was hoping she would see my initiative as a sign I really want to stay and learn, and I see myself here long term. Unfortunately, she reacted much differently than I was expecting.

I am not used to workplace conflict. I just don’t feel well liked on my team, even though I go out of my way to be likeable and easy to work with. 

I’m just not sure what else I can/should do. Any advice would be appreciated

1gwj3aj,"Intolerable work situation, getting by until I can leave","Man, this company has been a model of toxic insanity. When I took the job I knew, but had a couple of friends that said they'd get me through. First friend--who I worked really well with and got things done--left within 5 months. The other involuntarily got moved. There's a lot more going on with her than I realized coming into the job, and now she's turned on me. Our meetings turn from professional to her yelling and ennumerating her complaints about me. Some of it's pretty personal and unfounded, but w/e. tl;dr, I can't do anything right at this point. Even ""good"" work comes with a list of other grieveances. It's like her job is to get me to leave without them having to fire me or go through the PIP. I'm done. 

My work is solid, long term career. I know it's not me. I'm also at the end of my career, so finding something else is going to be challenging. I'm planning on resigning before the holidays (the company is laying on the guilt for taking off time over Xmas and Thanksgiving, it's framed as ""you will miss deadlines"", and there's the implicit threat that vacation will be denied...completely overlooking that if you have vacation now it's because you didn't take it the rest of the year). W/E. I'm done and won't be giving up vacation or time with my family for this job. I need to get through 3-4 more weeks to settle some other personal issues. I don't know how I'm going to get through, and it's entirely possible I'll be on a PIP before then. 

I feel like I have to defend myself a bit. My last project was ripped apart by a known toxic colleague, and my boss laid into me for it. When she took the time to review it she said it was ""actually really good"", but came back with a bunch of other personal flaws and problems to offset any hint of praise. Another coworker has said ""nobody was ever happy with your work."" First I heard about it, and no specifics or actionable feedback. If anything it's related to following company protocols I've never received training on. Current boss rotates who through she hates, and now's my time. I've seen it enough to recognize the pattern. I could probably stay until she directed her dissatisfaction toward somebody else but I've got enough dignity to recognize there's no excuse to treat anybody this way. I could go on. I know I need to leave. It's destroyed my professional confidence.

Or what are my options?,"It's been 2 weeks since I joined this new series A startup and now I have an offer from a Series F company that will mostly go public in the next 2 years. I am confused because there are so many pros and cons. I am 7 years into my career with SaaS.

**Company A : (current company) - Series A**

**Pros :** Decent pay, fully remote, good product, Great work - life balance, good role and chance to create impact, saving on living expenses and can spend time with Family (parents, I am un married)

**Cons:** No Esops, appraisal after 1.25 years from now, don't like the working accessories provided (although it might seem like its nothing but it matters to me), coming from Series C company at a Manager role, the designation at this Series A company is still Manager - that doesn't feel like a step up, if not a step down.

**Company B : Series F - to be listed in a couple of years**

**Pros:** Great pay (33% above my current pay), Great product, VC backed - lots of business coming in, Brand name, RSUs(equity), better designation at a bigger company from last role, great working accessories, the compensation offered today would be more that what I'd earn at company A after 1.25 years - even after doing my best work.  
  
**Cons:** In office role(hybrid) but would have to stay in a metro city, night shift role - work life balance not as great as in current role, would not be saving on money as in the current role, role would not be as interesting and impact would be limited ( since its a large org).

  
I have worked in night shifts earlier and on one hand -I want to stay at home and enjoy work life balance and better savings, but on the other hand the opportunity to grab a great pay with a great company doesn't always knock your door. plus I am 28 so I am okay not being too comfortable in the job and ofcurse, the best years of my life - would prefer not to spend at a place where there are less opportunities ( non metros)

Well, last year they let our DIvision Manager go, and the Operations Manager became the DM.  She then promoted her daughter from Admin Assistant/Payroll to Operations Manager so I was passed over for the promotion.  At the same time, they changed me from hourly ($21/hr) to salary ($60k/yr).

1gwfkqn,Advice On How to Not Feel Guilty About Leaving Current Job.,"Hey Everyone!

I work in state government for a position that I am passionate about. I do data analytics and I've been in my role for 3.5 years. My role was brand new, so over time I had to figure out what my job duties were and now have fully grasped my day-to-day activites. I love my coworkers and my boss, my work isn't crazy demanding, and I am hybrid. However, the whole reason I looked for another role is due to two reasons:
1) The pay. Government pay isn't great but the work isn't like private companies. However, when 2 of my coworkers left for better opportunities, I ended up taking on their work. It was very stressful to do their jobs, fix any of their mistakes, AND do my job. I have another coworker who does NO WHERE NEAR what I do. In fact, my old coworkers used to joke that this coworker was getting paid to do nothing (which is true). The kicker...I get paid closer to that coworker than my boss...but yet I am doing all this work and training new hires. Government raises are hard to come by, which is why you move positions throughout the agency.
2) I do data analytics but I am not an Epidemiologist. There are limitations on what I can do. However, my director likes to say ""well, can we trust your data since you're not an Epi?"" Like...yes you can it's simple shit but if I need more complex data then I'll reach out to them. It's almost like some of the higher ups don't trust my work due to my title and call me out on it. I have no idea why and it's hurtful and makes me question myself and my work, even though I know I give quality work.

I got a new offer in another agency and it's a bit more pay, hybrid, and folks appear to be really nice. It's in the same field and I'll be a data analyst. The last data coordinator ended up moving up being an Epidemiologist. So I'll still have some guidance and help! However, I'm feeling guilty and don't know how to feel. I'm leaving at a good time where things have slowed down and caught up ALL the work from previous years. So there is nothing to worry about! Idk why I feel guilty. Any advice or can you just tell me I deserve this opportunity.

So I’m going to try and make this post not too long but I wanted to know realistically how difficult it would be to get back into employment with a significant employment gap.


The last time I worked was in 2019 just before covid and was my shortest time ever being employed (3months I think). 

The reason for my employment gap is that two of my family members were murdered one being my sibling who I was attending university with studying the same degree. 

I’ll be honest and say I was in denial and very angry at the time so I continued working and actively pretended like it didn’t happen and they were still alive until I was unable to work or complete the last year of my degree anymore as my mental health had crippled.

In the past on average I stay in a job about 3 years before exploring new opportunities.

The areas I work are usually surrounding offender management. 


Ive returned to university to finish my degree predicted 2:1 so far. 

I’d like to do some volunteer work in family support work, youth work, women’s domestic violence, bereavement support and many more over the next few months and hopefully gain some part time employment with new gained experience and go from there. 

However unlike Reddit I won’t have the opportunity to explain my employment gap. 

Honestly I’m okay with finishing my degree and if that’s the end it’s the end but I’d Atleast like to try and get my life back.

Of course I have diagnosed mental health conditions but I feel I’m in a place where I can return to work and help people. 

My overall goal is to be a school social worker or youth worker

I have great references and I’ve never been fired or let go from a place ever.


So is it possible ?

I can update you guys on my journey if anyone ever reads this but I’m open for advice. 

Thanks so much 🖤🖤🖤

1gwdqo7,Should I Leave My Job After Just a Month for a Role I Actually Want? (NEED ADVICE pls),"I'm currently working as an ORM (Online Reputation Management) Executive, but honestly, I don't enjoy it. I'm just doing it to have a steady income since l recently moved out on my own. It's been only a month since I joined this company.
Before this, I started out as a Social Media Trainee, and I really want to build my career in social media.
Recently, I got approached by another company for a Social Media Specialist position. The role seems perfect for what I want, but it's a small company, and the Glassdoor reviews aren't great. On the other hand, I feel like I'm not growing in my current job at all.
The thing is, I have a great manager here, and I don't know how to bring up leaving, especially since it's been only a month and I'm still on probation.
Should I go ahead and interview for the Social Media Specialist role or just stick it out here for now?

1gwdq5n,Feeling Lost in My Job Search Journey – Seeking Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a tough spot and could really use some advice or encouragement.
	•	I got laid off this past June, but I had already been applying for jobs since the start of the year.
	•	I worked as a lead designer in a marketing company, focusing on web and graphic design. My goal has been to transition into UX/UI or product design roles.
	•	I’ve applied to countless positions (5–8 per day), optimized my resume and cover letters, and even landed 6–8 interviews. But after those, nothing.
	•	To stay competitive, I’ve been taking online courses and recently enrolled in a part-time BBA program. Right now, I’m taking a statistics course on weekends.

Despite all this effort, I’m starting to doubt myself. Am I even good enough to be a UX/UI designer? Is this a future-proof career? What’s my Plan B if this doesn’t work out?

I’ve been so focused on job hunting and learning, but I feel stuck and overwhelmed. My EI will stop in a few months, and I don’t know where to go from here.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Any advice or words of encouragement would mean a lot right now.

He/she would call me into the office, ask me to shut the door and accuse me of doing something that was not true. 

Here are some examples:

**You are leaving early without approval**

**You are lazy and not working hard enough**

**You are treating your coworkers badly and yelling and screaming at them**

**You are not completing your assignments by the deadline**

**You are doing the task wrong**

No matter how hard I try to convince the boss that these charges are not true and even show proof I am in the right, my statements are rejected out of hand.

I have been reprimanded several times by the team leader because of mistakes made by another colleague, who is lazy and indifferent. He was also reprimanded, but they always blamed me as well. In some cases, they accused me of taking time off without consulting them (but I informed them two months in advance). They are always very rude to me, and I don’t want to write a long post, so I’ll stop here. I’ve received compliments for my work from the manager, and the same manager has told the team leader multiple times to assign me more responsibilities. However, the team leader hasn’t done that.

1gwcgz8,"Underqualified, but committed.","I started at a manufacturing facility two months ago as a general operator. I know the hiring manager, so he got me in through a temp agency, but everyone knows… I’m sure there are *some* problems people have with me in the facility. 

I get along with mostly everybody on my own shift, but haven’t seen too much of the others.

There’s talk from the higher-ups that a position higher than mine is going to be opening up, with a pretty substantial pay raise (+/-55%). 

I’m going to throw my hat in the ring with the building manager, but I don’t want to come across as pushy or over-hopeful. I like to think I’m a decently humble guy who doesn’t have problems admitting his mistakes, and dedicated to learning anything and everything.

Does anyone have any advice on how I should approach this? I’m more than willing to provide more context in the comments.

1gwcaw7,Help with handling Human Resources ,"Today, I was working at a branch other than my home branch. About an hour before the branch closes, the branch manager asks me to come into a room and tells me the manager from my home branch wants to speak to me. So she puts ""home branch manager"" on speaker with ""other branch manager"" also in the room. HBM says that there has been a report regarding missing money, and because of the severity of the accusation, I would be put on a suspension with pay. She said that HR would be getting back to me before the end of the week and to hand my keys over to OBM. 

That is all the information I was given, with nothing in writing. I do not know where the money was missing from, what day this happened, or anything. I know absolutely nothing about what I am being accused of. So it is seemingly difficult for me to prepare for this HR interrogation I know is happening soon. All I can do is assume what is going on. I believe it was somebody's personal money missing, and not money missing from the vault or cash drawer. The reason is because if the bank was missing money, they would clock that shit the exact same day. I haven't been at home branch since last week. Plus, the last day I was at home branch, I was not signed on to a drawer. I was mostly on platform.

Anyway, I've been trying to use my time wisely and gather evidence to help build my defense. The problem is that my FI restricted access to ALL my internal online accounts. I wanted to look through my timecard from last week to see time stamps for clocking in/out and taking lunches. I wanted to see any emails with timestamps that could provide an alibi. I wanted to look through the company's policies involving disciplinary action, how investigations are handled, if there is potential for an appeal. But I have access to NOTHING! Which I know is looking extremely bad for me. Like terminated already. Besides building my case, I wanted to look into the EAP program to see if anything there could provide advice, guidance, counseling or some piece of mind in this time of mental struggle. But they restricted access to ALL my benefits as well. Benefits that I have been paying for via payroll deductions. I cannot access my HSA information, my dental/medical insurance ID cards, and so much more. I can't even get to the employee directory to find the right contact info for status of my investigation. To me it sounds like they have already made up their mind to terminate me. And I have not even been given a written suspension notice detailing the allegations reported. I have not been contacted for a chance to explain my side of the story like I was told by HBM. 

I understand that I am an at-will employee so even if I am found innocent, I can still be terminated after this suspension. I have faced that reality and updated my resume & sent out a few applications. But I still want to do what I can to save myself from being terminated. I know that when HR finally reaches out (IF!!) to ask questions, they are going to approach me as if they already found me guilty, that they have evidence against me, and that they can get law enforcement involved. I have been through those types of meetings before, I understand the tactics. I am wondering if I can somehow get an employment lawyer involved with this internal investigation. When HR reaches out, I want to ask if I could have a lawyer present, or request to record our interactions for my own records. If they tell me I cannot record, I will ask if they are currently recording the interaction. Obviously they'll say yes, but I wonder if putting it this way would do anything to alleviate the power imbalance. And if they state they have video footage, can I request to see it? So I can explain whatever it is they think they saw? I know HR investigations do not grant me the right to have an attorney present and that staying silent in this meeting could get me terminated for insubordination or non-compliance. The only reason I think it's important to have an attorney is because of the severity of the allegation. And it's coming from A BANK. This could seriously hinder future employment. If law enforcement gets involved, I am practicing my rights and not speaking to them thats for sure. 

Anyway, I called the generic employee HR phone number to ask whats up with my accounts being restricted. After being on hold for a while and answering questions, they told me my online account was fine and active. They asked me to read them what the error message says, and I told them it says my access has been restricted and to contact my administrator. They told me they would ""put in a ticket"" and email me the results. Which is the email address I cannot access anyway...so no help at all. If I get an attorney involved, can I explain that they are not giving me my paystubs and when I called HR about it, they refused to help me get the paystubs? I don't know the legality of that but from what I understand employers (NYS) HAVE to provide a paystub. And the fact that the benefits I am paying for are inaccessible also has to be some sort of workplace violation right? I've put in a bunch of requests for free consultations with employment lawyers. But if this is a waste of time,I'd appreciate someone telling me now instead of hearing it a million times when i consult with a lawyer. 

Another idea I had was filing complaints with the Department of Labor and other state organizations. While doing all this preparing, I found that my offer letter never provided me my overtime rate (which I guess they're supposed to??). On my first day, my manager told me that I am not allowed under any circumstances to discuss wage/salary with other employees and that it was a strict company policy. Another workplace violation. In the complaint I'd also state the refusal to provide my paystubs and benefits I had been promised. The reason for getting the DOL involved is NOT to get the company in trouble. It's just a safety net I guess in case I do get terminated. I can claim I was terminated on the grounds of retaliation for filing a DOL complaint. I am doing everything I can to try to save this job. If these all seem like terrible ideas, or if someone has better advice I am willing to listen. And because I know people are gonna say it a million times over, I am prepared for termination if it comes down to it. I have my resume updated and applications sent. I just want to know if there is any hope for me at all. I really do like this job and this industry in general.

1gw9ipf,Need some advice!,"Currently have the opportunity to interview with a company doing something similar to what I am now, but for about 10-15k more a year. The catch is that the segment that I will be interviewing for will be acquired by a different company Q1 of next year. This makes me a little uneasy as I do not know what that company offers in terms of benefits, and I would be put in a situation where i’m interviewing for one company but basically getting hired by another. I am also uneasy about potentially getting cut as I understand these things can happen when it comes to mergers and acquisitions. Important to note that I applied for this position in September and they JUST contacted me for an interview and seem to be pretty rushed about the whole thing. 

My current situation is not bad. I have been with my current company for 6 years, have had a few moves within it and I am currently waiting on the results of an interview I had last week that would put me in a SR position with more pay (close to 15-20k) but also more responsibilities. It will also provide me great opportunity for growth and recognition.

In comparing the two I would get more pay if hired for either one, but for the other company I would lose about 5 days of PTO, and would have to restart my FMLA.

I’m thinking of declining the interview as I feel uneasy about the acquisition and losing 5 days of PTO seems pretty significant. At the same time I would love to get paid more while gaining more/different industry experience as the only industry experience I have is with my current company.

1gw9d1b,"31 M, working as pc/server tech for last 3 years. Where do I go from here? Any advice?","I just turned 31 and feel like I’ve wasted the past decade bouncing between jobs with no clear career direction. I don’t have a degree, and my income is stagnating at $46k a year. I feel old and hopeless. I’m eager for advice on how to make a substantial career change. I’m open to going back to college but am unsure how to afford it or balance it with my demanding full-time job.

Here’s a summary of my life and work history:

* **18-20:** Mental health and medical issues prevented me from going to college right after high school.
* **Early 20s:** Pursued a Comp Sci associate's degree at community college while working retail, but dropped out after my parents stopped paying for tuition, and I was too afraid to take out loans.
* **22-24:** Worked in cell phone/computer repair for big box stores. I've always been good with electronics and computers.
* **24-27:** Transitioned into freelance video editing and videography, working with YouTubers and local musicians. I enjoyed this work, I wasn't making a ton of money but it was about as much as any other menial job I could have landed at the time.
* **27:** Went through a difficult divorce, losing everything and starting over with just $4,000 to my name.
* **28-31:** Took a job at a server refurbishing company, building, repairing, and configuring enterprise workstations. I’ve reached the highest position available here and maxed out my pay, but the company’s toxic work culture and environment have put me into a deep depression.

I feel stuck. I’ve applied for similar tech roles in my area for two years, but none offer more than I’m making now, and many involve long commutes. I’ve also applied for media jobs, hoping my video experience would help, but with so many college grads competing, I haven’t had any success.

If anyone has advice, especially if you’ve been in a similar situation, I would really appreciate it. I’m not sure what direction to take next. How can I use any of my current work experience to transition into higher paying work? Do I need to find a way to go back to school? Do I need to find a completely new kind of work?

I have a lot of pressure and expectation on me to get into a prestigious school. For some backstory, I have this family friend who runs a big business that revolves around helping students getting into top colleges. He runs it with his wife, and they are pith Penn as well as Dartmouth graduates. They have gotten students into the ivies as many top 20 colleges. After some consultation with him, he recommend me to apply as an English major in order for the best chances to get into a top college as my literature skills are much better than my STEM (I'm good at biology, but not so great at math). I was a bit conflicted but I understood, so all of my extracurricular activities have been English based. Still, I'm just not sure of how I am supposed to go forward as an English major. I absolutely do not want to pursue a career in English, and I know you can always switch majors and still take the MCAT regardless of your major, but I'm just so worried if my dreams of becoming a doctor will be out of reach if this is the path I follow.

1gw6t4e,Relocate for the second time in a year for a 30% pay increase?,"Title says it all. 28 yo male, I work for a large tech company. I relocated to change industries for my current role, but have the opportunity to interview for a role which will put me in a much cheaper, equally (to me) location with a rival company. The numbers I have from the recruiter call for total comp would equate to a minimum 30-32% pay increase and would get me north of $130k. Schedule/shifts are more or less the same, although with the new company nights are a possibility.

I like my current role and the work culture, but there is very little room for internal upward mobility and I'm going to get to a career (and salary increase) stagnation point here sooner rather than later.

It's a big potential raise to turn down, and I'm concerned about how this would look on my resume to future prospective employers, and while I think my interviewing skills are good enough to sus out red flags, I'm worried about going back into a more toxic, stressful work environment.",Correct-Body8706,1,1.0,0,1732159783,2024-11-21 03:29:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gw6t4e/relocate_for_the_second_time_in_a_year_for_a_30/,11,2024
1gw6p1y,I need advice on a career move as a mom to a toddler,"Alright so I’m interested in two different fields. I’m a mom of a 2 year old and my husband makes about 40k a year. I currently work part time in retail making like 13k lol. We constantly struggle to cover all of our bills and rent etc. 
because of this I’m looking to go back to school! I was looking at sonography, it’s a 2 year program. I applied to school and almost paid for classes BUT realized because of the way the program is set up I wouldn’t be able to apply for the actual program for another year or year and a half so that means I’ll actually be in school for 3/3.5 years. I don’t think I can work and do schooling at the same time but we can’t really live off of one income..
My second option is esthetician school. I would love to open my own suite and do lashes eyebrows facials etc working for myself but I feel like that would be super difficult for me to make a living because of having to find clients. I’m a shy person and don’t have many friends or acquaintances who would want services.

Basically I really want to do sonography school but I’m worried it won’t be possible or realistic while my daughter is still so young and not in school yet. But we need more money for our family and to eventually purchase a home. But without being able to afford daycare I don’t think I can do school full time without working for 2 years.. 🤔 
Being an esthetician sounds fun and rewarding  but maybe a temporary job depending on how much I can make doing it. But it may be the best option for me since school is only 8 months and I can do it part time.

Just looking for any advice if there’s any moms out there who went back to school or anyone in either of these careers? ",Danifannyxo,1,1.0,0,1732159432,2024-11-21 03:23:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gw6p1y/i_need_advice_on_a_career_move_as_a_mom_to_a/,11,2024

1gw6cr2,Just do not give up. ,"I feel so grateful and I want to share my story to give someone out there with similar circumstances some hope. I’m 31F. 

My journey has been nothing short of a ROLLER coaster. I went to college for accounting and had to leave my big name school for a smaller one because I just couldn’t afford it. Big hit to my ego, but I didn’t give up. Pushed through and graduated.

Fresh out of college I found my dream job. Jumped right into my field making an awesome amount of money. It came with a lot of stress and late nights, but I was happy and proud to be young and making money…. until it knocked the wind out of me. I ended up leaving my dream job and fell into a major depression. 

I was stubborn and decided “I won’t give my brain to anymore work because it’s stressful.” So I started to use my body (not literally lol) — but I went back to serving like I did in college, picked up an airport gig (free flights yay but not when you’re broke) and pretty much wore my body and mind out even more.  

Then my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer and passed away. Talk about a whirlwind. My world was once again shook but I kept working my odd jobs and trying to make something out of nothing. I went back to therapy and got back on anxiety meds. I didn’t give up on myself. Even when I would run into old friends and classmates, I would serve them with pride even though I deeply felt left behind. 

About a month ago, after almost 7 years out of the corporate workforce, I decided that I was ready to go back. I made a lot of prayers and asked God for guidance. I weighed out my skills and experience with different careers and decided I would apply for things I knew I wasn’t qualified for but I was ready to take on. I found another dream job. 

I got the job and signed my job offer of $90K a week ago. With bonuses and raises I should hit 6 figures by next year. 

I’m so grateful that I didn’t give up. If you’re anything like me and got burnt out in your 20’s and feel left behind — don’t give up on yourself. Take a deep breath, intentionally apply to jobs that fit what you want out of life, and be adamant about changing your circumstances. 

If I can do it you can too!

1gw62rz,Take the hybrid role or stay fully remote? ,"Hi! Sorry for the long post but I just have a lot of thoughts to work through and was hoping to get some advice. I was recently offered a position to work at a local city government office and I’m trying to weigh it against my current job, while also thinking about having a kid in the next year or so. 

Currently I work fully remotely, but this new role would be hybrid. I worked hybrid before and like the face to face interaction while maintaining some of the flexibility that remote work offers but I’m anxious about losing the fully remote flexibility. The office is nearby but the commute is actually kind of annoying because our metro transit system doesn’t have the best connections to get there, so it would take around 45 minutes each way, which I don’t love. In the warmer months it would be about a 20 minute bike ride which is much more doable for me. But of course those numbers are both higher than my current 30 second commute. 

I would get a nice pay bump with this role, so that is appealing, and the benefits are very good. But my husband is a high earner so it wouldn’t be a huge difference in our HHI. But any extra money before having a baby of course sounds appealing. 

I am hoping to get pregnant next year, but due to when benefits kick in for the new job this would put us back on our timeline for growing our family. But, this role has 4 additional weeks of paid parental leave compared to what I get from my current job. So I’m kind of wondering about the benefits of working remotely vs going to the office when pregnant or having a little kid, as this would be our first child. I currently have a great work life balance where my job isn’t overly demanding, although some of the more frustrating aspects of it impact my mental health - but that seems likely at most jobs. 

As for career advancement, this would be a lateral move in terms of title and work, but would be a good opportunity for learning about city government, would get me connected more with the local network. My remote work is for an out-of-state organization so it’s harder to see how I can leverage it into future career moves.

So any thoughts on what you would do? Thanks for reading all of this and for your thoughts!  ",guacamole-gardener,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1732157533,2024-11-21 02:52:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gw62rz/take_the_hybrid_role_or_stay_fully_remote/,11,2024
1gw56dp,Is it imposter syndrome? How to overcome?,"I was let go earlier this year for performance issue. I've been reflecting to figure out what went wrong and what could have been better.

I'm hestiant to put all details here but: last couple years in that job has been very challenging. I was in my early career, joined a team that I didn't expect through a general hiring process (there was no team matching, I had no choice), a series of layoffs happened every year, and a constant reorg (happened every 6-9 month, starting from a month later I joined the company) had me 4-5 new managers. Constant anxiety that I wouldn't survive, I was falling behind the work, and competitive rat race within a team. All these events made me really insecure and brought imposter stuff. I admit that I struggled learning materials that I didn't really enjoy and overwhelming processes. I was too naive to expect managers are on my side and would be supportive to help me through. They acted as if all good in front, but now I think I should've been on my own. I also experienced I was being managed out at the end of my time there, but I was too exhausted to get out at that point when I realized it.

Although I'm not with them anymore, I'm still seriously questioning if I'm really capable of working, given that others did well and still working there. I'm not sure if I just suck or if I just didn't fit for job. Experience at this job has been seriously affecting my confidence. I've also built a very low trust in people at work.  

Now, I somehow went through a series of interviews and will start soon at new job. I'm already concerned about it, whether I can do the job well or not. What should I do?

1gw51ci,Hoping to get into FP&A in the future.,"I am an undergraduate student who will be graduating this winter. Throughout college I admittedly wasn't able to secure the greatest internship experiences. I would love to be able to find myself in an FP&A role for a F500 company at some point in the future. Right now, I have 2 job offers:

1: Sales Analyst at a decently well-known/respected analytics company, I'm not sure what my day-to-day will look like once I convert to full-time but it would be in the realm of identifying sales trends/sharing insights with sales leaders along with other mundane tasks. 

2: Accounting & Finance rotational role for a smaller and less-known industrial manufacturing company. This opportunity will give me more of the corporate finance skills I am lacking experience in but I fear this position may gridlock me due to the industry. 

If I were to go with option 1, I wouldn't get the direct corporate finance experience but would be able to pick up on some transferable skills and I may be able to pivot horizontally one day to the finance team of the company. 

If I were to go with option 2, I get the experience but in an industry and a company that may not get me a lot of looks post completion of the program.

1gw4n5i,My Manager was just fired. His last act was telling me I'm getting fired too. Now I'm scared.,"My manager got fired. His last act was telling me I'm getting fired too. 

A few days ago my manager was let go because of ""job abandonment"", he got pneumonia, got sick, and our higher ups used it as an excuse to get rid of him. 

Now, he and I were in the exact same boat - when I was off my medication, my attendance record went down the toilet because I kept showing up late. These are called ""occurrences"" in my company. You get 3, it's a write up. 3 write ups and your fired. We both had 9. He was able to strike a deal with HR and our old (now gone, also thanks to same said higher up) district manager so that we wouldn't be fired if we could get those occurrences down. An occurance goes away after 60 days. I'm not sure how many he had, but I went from 9 down to 6, and as of next week that number will go down to 5, by mid January, I'll have a clean slate. 

Today, he came to pick up his stuff. He pulled me aside and told me that I was going to be next, and that the ""secondary position"" they're looking for, for my job, is actually my replacement. I basically have however long it takes until they find my replacement. He claimed the real reason he got fired was because he had proof that a person who is higher up in our company was forging documents, said person is now in charge of our office, and we, basically the grunts, are now all collectively terrified. 

I'm at an impasse and have no idea what to do. We have a meeting this Saturday to discuss all the changes going on. Do I trust what my ex-boss said and start applying for other jobs? Do I ignore what he said and just continue to go about my work? I already asked about possible further training, which I was informed to talk to the person who fired my ex-boss about further training. Right now I'd be less scared to talk to an actual grizzly bear.

1gw4k5d,How to ask my manager for a cubicle or desk ,"Good evening Calgary managers! 

I posted before but I can not for the life of me find my posting. 

I am mid 30s woman who has spent a significant part of my life as an admin. But I have NEVER done a reception role. I was recently hired on by a fantastic company as an accounting/office administrator. I will be doing payroll eventually. 

I have been seated at the front reception desk and other staff have called me the ""receptionist"" 

I did not accept this offer thinking I'll be the reception in addition to my role/title. 

The job description did say ""greet clients"" but we don't have anyone outside of scheduled appointments coming in so I don't feel i need to be up at the front all day. It's distracting, I don't always wanna make small talk, we have construction happening outside that plans to take months, and I feel like I sit in a snow globe. 

In addition, and I'm saying this as I am human. I do not want to, at this point in my life be a Receptionist- I feel like I'm doing an entry level role all over again and it's making me feel really shitty about myself. Like I spent all these years doing admin work to now in my 30s be a Receptionist again? Not how I planned this. I'm not asking for an office- but a cubicle or a desk at the very least. The previous office coordinator didn't even have her own name tag where she sat. She was in this role- THE SAME role for 15 years!!!! 

How do I bring this up to my manager? I am 100% okay with an arrangement where I spend some time at the front desk but I don't want to be there all day. I don't feel I'm productive, I feel like garbage, and it's making me resent my job when actually I really do like my coworkers and company. 

Is honesty the best policy here? What would you all do?

1gw3zy4,Would you quit your part-time job over holiday leave?,"Hi all,

Long story short, I'm a 20 y/o college student working two jobs part-time in addition to full-time school. I've been working one job for a few years and have no intention of quitting. It's just pretty low hours, but it's ramping up now.

My second job is retail that I've only had a couple of months. Last month, I gave notice that I would need time off for Thanksgiving and Christmas since I'd like to go home then. Probably my fault for giving only a month-ish of notice, but I've been frank with them from the start that I'm a student and am not from in town. There's been a lot in my family lately between a death and an illness, so it's important for me to spend the holidays with them.

Retail job is refusing to let me have set time off for Thanksgiving (definitely) and most *likely* Christmas/winter break. I've worked with them on it multiple times, and the answer always comes back as ""probably not, but I'll keep it in mind"". They don't let anyone book these dates off. Am I wrong to interpret that as a polite no?

I'm pretty over the job in general, but considering staying since I'm really scared to find a new second job and obviously school is expensive. Without getting into detail, the current job is kind of sucky between last minute/inconsistent scheduling, low pay for the area, and a culture of pushing employees' boundaries until they just quit. They also don't let employees call off at all w/o discipline, even if ill/with lots of notice.

I get that it's retail and famously sucky, but what would you do in this situation? I'm pretty stuck and could use some advice.

1gw3ril,Career advice for a 22 year old drop out going back to college for medicine,"I dropped out of college a few classes short of an associates due to some mental health issues. I've spent the last two years in dead end bullshit jobs. I have no prospects, no money, a very few transferable credits from my original degree. Art 🙄 I love art and it's my passion, but it's not taken off and I can see where it will take me. Which isn't very far. 

Thankfully, I'm at a cushy, easy job that pays 18 an hour with hella overtime but it's a depressing retail job. I work at a self checkout kiosk and its easy but so meaningless. I want a career.

Thankfully, I did good in college (minus dropping out) and did great in high-school and on my acts. I know I'm smart and capable, and I don't have any other choice but to fix my current circumstance which is very motivating. 

I just am not sure what to do exactly. I'm very interested in medicine to the point i considered going in for mortuary science since it jelled well with my art major. The technology and science aspect are very appealing to me and I've been looking at careers as a lab tech, but it seems like it doesn't pay too incredibly well. Maybe an X-ray tech or anesthesiologist? 

I don't think I have the guts to be a nurse or in trauma. My friend is and the stories she tells are incredibly interesting but gruesome. The idea of doing cpr on an elderly patient makes me feel sick, and I know hesitating in those dire moments could get someone killed. 

I think I'd do great on the sidelines or behind the scenes, where results are dire, but not milliseconds to act dire. 

I've got it financially planned out to return to my old college in the fall and I can save enough for an associates within 9 months and finish it debt free if i save every extra penny. Tuition doubled since I last went but so did my salary. 

I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to go back to college and set myself up for a career. I'm just not 100 percent positive what exactly. Money is an issue but I'll get that degree class by class if I have to, so I have to be 100 percent sure of what path I take.

I'm smart, I'm a hard worker, and I'm capable. I don't want to spend my life stuck behind a counter doing meaningless work that pays like shit. I want to do something meaningful that can truly help people in the long run, not just offer them a bag for their overpriced airport food. 

Do you guys have any career options or advice? I've got 9 months to decide, and a choice will be made. Second chances are hard to come by, so lll make my own and make something of myself.

I’m a landscape designer with 4.5 years of experience, and I’m also a mother to a special needs child. Recently, I was let go from my job of 3 years, where I thought I was doing a good job. They told me I didn’t meet their expectations, but I was never made aware of what those expectations actually were. It all happened suddenly and took me completely by surprise.

Long story short, I’m considering a career shift, as I need a remote job with stability. I’ve been looking into AI and machine learning, but I know absolutely nothing about programming. My question is: Is it worth it to look into this field at my age (40), especially with no programming background?

I know learning AI/ML will likely take at least 6 months to a year, but I’m wondering if it’s the right move for me. The way I was let go felt like a stab in the heart, and while I know my performance had plateaued, I was never behind on deadlines and always completed my projects. I want a stable remote job that I can rely on, but I’m uncertain if shifting careers now is too late.

Has anyone made a similar shift, and what advice would you give me? I’d appreciate any insights on AI/ML and remote work opportunities. Thanks in advance!

I am 36 yo and currently work in the natural environment field however jobs are far and few in-between in my area (moved around for them when I was younger but need to be closer to home right now) and many are contract or seasonal, like the one I am in currently.

 I am very passionate about this field of work however I'm looking for something more stable as well as a better salary. I have had to perform financial tasks in previous jobs as well as managing money and working with spreadsheets and data and it is something I enjoy. I also enjoy budgeting and financial planning in my own life. 

I was thinking of taking an online Accountng diploma program while working. The job outlook for accounting jobs in Canada based on the govt marking report is moderate to very good depending on the province. I live in SW Ontario.

So, I'm just wondering if any of you have made this career change, and how it has been working out for you? Also any tips or advice is appreciated.

I worked for this company from 2019 to 2022 when I had a baby and quit because I could not work from home.  I started looking for a job now in 2024 and they contacted me about returning to a work from home position.  

All of my other job applications have been rejected.

HR called me to chat and asked for a salary number and I said 65k which is more than I was making in 2022.  They were like ok great.

I got the offer in writing on monday and I am looking to counter.  Do I have leeway here to counter offer?  Maybe I can say I am looking for 65 plus the cost of the health insurance which is alot!  Insurance for me and child would be $1500 a month.    Or can I counter for no reason?  Like I did more research for comparable salaries.

I feel stupid.  I know youre not supposed to say a number first but I was caught offguard and unprepared.

1gw0506,To stay or to go?,"To preface, I have a few options already outlined about what to do but curious to hear some other perspectives.

I’ve been with my company for nearly 4 years. I originally joined in 2015 as part of a graduate program, stayed for 4 years and left for a more senior role for about a year. So if I hadn’t left I’d be marking 9 years with them in December. Since I’ve rejoined, I’ve been promoted three times, got shining performance reviews, and despite being at a manager level, sit on the senior leadership team and do far more than what my job title is (Communications). This October during our annual performance review, I was positive I would get promoted (of course based on conversations with my manager throughout the year.) I had gotten a certification, completed a leadership development program and generally just worked really really hard all year. I got an outstanding rating but no promotion, just an offhand comment that ‘in a year we can look at moving you to the next level.’ I expressed my disappointment and asked for clarification as to why it couldn’t be this year. I got a disappointing response that I had to be compared to my peers across the org, they consider age, tenure, etc. My boss was understanding and said that instead of a year, we can set some targeted goals and consider a promotion during mid-year reviews (around February). At first, I was okay with this but lately I’ve been feeling demotivated and undervalued. I genuinely liked this role and my team so I never really thought about leaving but I’m concerned about my trajectory and future at this company if they look at people’s age as a detractor. So the question is, if you were in my situation, would you sit around and wait for the promotion or would you leave? For more context, this is a F500 company with 50k employees - the team I sit on is global, with offices in eight countries and about 3000 people. Our current comms team is 3 people soon to be 4. I report to a senior exec who is the head of the global team.

1gvy3zi,Should I continue this internship?,"Before I start with this, don’t hate , I just need advice even if it is my fault 😂

A few months ago I applied for an internship at a major record label. I want to say I was partially just seeing if they would reach back out to me which would be crazy. I applied because I never thought I would have this high of an opportunity. I was convinced they would never call me back or acknowledge I applied. A month later, to my surprise they actually called back and wanted me in for an interview. I was kind of nervous and was convinced they would call back and say I didn’t get the job. At the same time I kind of did a fair job at making my case and what I could offer, so it was not a total disaster.

Fast forward, I went in for training and it was pretty neat but they also were pretty unorganized with the training and seemed super low effort. It is not a super professional place to begin with but at the same time, there are many strict rules which is expected. After my training days were over, I was still unsure on many things because I feel I was not fully trained on everything.

Getting to the point I am unsure if there is any point in continuing this internship. I live about an hour away so it is a hassle to make it there. It is unpaid so I am spending money on gas along with working super late hours getting home around 3 am. I am expected to make it there 2 times a week. I work another job about an hour away as well but I am getting paid and really enjoy it (been working there for 3 years now) To describe what I have done so far, I really just help them clean up after studio sessions and help people to the proper rooms. I am cool with this because even audio engineers have to do this in a studio environment. I am in audio school and work another job along with managing my life. I have smaller jobs too during the week which involves managing my internet business and running a small neighborhood dog daycare. 

I guess what I am asking is should I continue this? Since then, I have dreaded making it down there because of the drive but it has made my current life so stressful. I feel like I am managing too much with trying to do well in school. I feel like I have lost so much free time. Is it worth it for an unpaid internship where I am essentially a studio janitor and inebtween just sit around on my computer??? I am grateful for what I have experienced so far and I have learned a lot more about this particular industry/what working in a studio is like. It is my fault for accepting this and even going this far into the process. When I am there I actually enjoy it a lot but I think the cons outweigh the pros . Just want some input on what the yall think. Thank you


TL:DR

Applied for a major record label as an audio engineer thinking I wouldn’t get the job. Now I realize it is a pain to make it there along with my life getting much more stressful. It is my fault maybe I wasn’t entirely serious",Particular-Mix-4995,2,1.0,1,1732131441,2024-11-20 19:37:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvy3zi/should_i_continue_this_internship/,11,2024

Im suppose to write to trainer support when I need help and one of the trainers that began helping me just so happens to be an a\*\*. She responds passive aggressively, specifically searches why you made the mistake then writes out what she had to do to solve the problem (she makes it sound like she moved mountains and endured a whole lot of labour to help you) and I started giving her raw responses.

Responses that were respectful but honest like ""I guess I should've done this right after receiving the email and for that im sorry if that's what youre looking to hear"". Now, another trainer (her friend) started looking at my cases and she CC's that other women for absolutely anything I touch.

Today, I decided to send her friend a harmless email saying ""hi, I was just wondering, why is such and such always CC'd on my cases ? is she someone I should be going to ?"" then she says ""hi, she is a specialist. please do not go to her for help. She is just tracking some of the emails that I am handling on more complicated cases"". I say ""if you don't mind me asking, judging by what you've seen, is she tracking the emails to write something negative about me? I don't know her all to well so im asking you instead"".

1gvxssk,I have a lot of anxiety about making mistakes in a new position,"I JUST finished my first month at my new job. I love it here. Everyone is nice enough and my manager is so cool and accomodating. 

I however have general anxiety and I find that I have a hard time accepting the mistakes I make (Im a perfectionist which makes me feel even worse). I dont make a lot of mistakes but I do make them. Some are general oversight like the mistake I made yesterday where I put an event start time as our arrival time in the calendar. Some are because Im just not familiar with the processes yet and its a very involved job. 

I know mistakes are normal at this stage, and my manager tells me frequently that Ill get there and that this is the time to make mistakes and that Im doing fantastic. However, I cant help beating myself up over them. I dwell on them and beat myself up. I even ruin my weekends feeling anxious about what is usually nothing.

1gvx9ps,Am I getting fired?,"Note -I work in commission. 

So long story short, we have new management and one of the new guys seems to have a target on my back. He is extending my workload more then the others that hold the same position as me and he's openly expressed his plans on getting rid of our staff to replace them with his own hires. He doesnt comply to a worklife balance and expects hours to be put in outside of work. I have been compliant and happy to feel out his new objectives assuming it'll eventually die down but thats yet to be the case. Infact its only gotten worse.

The other day I refused to work outside of my shift, he confronted me about it of which I told him that I'd be happy to continue the workload when my shift starts to which he responded by telling me I can no longer take leads for the rest of the month. I told him thats not happening and he threw a fit then walked away. Not even 10 minutes later he grabs someone to take me to his office and tells me I am being written up, I told him I wasnt signing it as I dont beleive I did anything deserving of that and he lost his mind and sent me home for the rest of the day. I came back into work the next day (thankfully he was off) and everyone was up in arms, angry and upset. I could go on for days but I'll end it here and answer any questions in the comments.

  
I have been here for three years. He has been here for a month and has killed any bit of motivation or morale in the workplace. I will be seeing him back at work tomorrow. What do I do?

1gvwns6,Dental school backup career options?,"For the better part of the last decade, it's been my dream to go to dental school, but I'm now getting serious concerns that I just won't be able to make it happen. I graduated from Wofford College (Spartanburg, SC) in 2021 as a Chemistry Major with a 2.94 GPA. I had a slightly below average GPA for most of my time but it really took a hit during COVID. I worked as a dental assistant and lab technician in my uncle's general dentist office for 3 years after graduating. I am currently in a 1-year Masters program in Medical Sciences that started in the Summer. I decided to do this program to overcome by subpar college GPA but now I'm realizing that being out of school for 3 years, along with my apparently worsening ADHD, is making me really struggle and might actually be lowering my chances.

I've grown to really love the dental field and have been saying for a while that if I don't get in to dental school, I still want to do something in dentistry, or at least healthcare. My problem is that I'm not really sure what my options are that can still make use of my degree. I would hate to have wasted tens of thousands of dollars getting my bachelor's when all I needed was an associate's or less, especially if I still have to get a different degree anyways. And also that would make enough money to provide for a family (obviously nothing would make as much as a dentist but I still want to eventually afford a house). My girlfriend (soon to be fiancé) is a teacher so I feel like I need a career where I can at least eventually make $60k+ for us to be financially comfortable, especially if/when she takes off work when we have kids.

My job with my uncle was pretty much a jack of all trades but master of none, so I have experience with a bunch of different aspects but not enough to qualify me for any specific job without more school or a lot of training. I definitely don't want to be a hygienist since it seems too monotonous for me and would require 2 years of school. I don't think I could be a dental assistant because I'd be constantly sitting across from someone who achieved what I couldn't, plus there's basically a salary cap of around $50k. I have front office experience but it seems like there's a similar salary cap issue outside of being office manager for a large multi-doctor/multi-office practice.

My favorite part of my job was the lab work, especially once we got a 3D printer and lab grade CAD software, so I could definitely see myself working in a dental lab. Plus lab techs seem to make decent money. My concern is that I don't have enough experience. I know how to design and print/fabricate models, retainers, occlusal splints/brux guards, orthodontic aligners, digital wax-ups, temporary crowns, and simple partial dentures/flippers. The problem is that a lot of labs still do things by hand and most of my experience is digital, and even that could still be considered limited. I've made temporary crowns for multi-unit anterior cases, sometimes with 1-3 posteriors, but I would be out of my depth trying to make permanent restorations for a full mouth case. I also also have basically no experience with dentures besides the short-term treatment partials I've made that just have to fill a gap until the lab makes something permanent. I feel like I might be able to get by with on the job training but I'm worried I'd be passed over for someone who's actually been to lab school.

I would definitely consider working for a dental supply company like Patterson or Dentsply Sirona. I did a lot of troubleshooting with our computers and other equipment but still not enough to qualify me to be a technician or IT specialist, especially without a computer science degree. Maybe a remote support specialist. I've gotten to be pretty knowledgeable about a lot of the dental equipment, materials, and other technology on the market, but it seems like most sales and management jobs require a business degree and prior sales experience. Product research and development could make use of my chemistry degree but I haven't seen a lot of job openings in the US. Plus I'm worried I've forgotten most of the chemistry I learned in college.

Outside of dentistry, I've thought about PA school but that would require me to do a lot more shadowing and I probably wouldn't get in anyways with my academic performance.

I'm curious what others who have been in my position ended up doing. I would love to hear any insight about my concerns or any career opportunities I haven't thought of.",C_Hutch,1,1.0,1,1732127917,2024-11-20 18:38:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvwns6/dental_school_backup_career_options/,11,2024

1gvvx2y,How to find a career in your 30's?,"I’m 34 and at a point where I need to make a big change in my life. Right now, I’m working two jobs—college admissions and adjunct teaching at a remote trade school. Together, they bring in about $48k a year, which just isn’t enough to support my family. I need to make at least $27 an hour, and I’m tired of juggling multiple jobs just to make the bare minimum to pay our bills.

My background is a mix of things. I’ve spent the last 15 years mostly in customer service, with a three-year stint running a small sporting goods store that I owned. Before that, it was manual labor and farm work. I’ve got a bachelor’s and an associate's degree, but because of a disability, I can only work remotely. It doesn’t affect my ability to do the work, just my ability to travel or commute, which is why I had to step away from hands-on jobs.  



Lately, I’ve been thinking about going back to school to get a master’s in Organizational Leadership or HR. I’d love to land a remote HR role or a leadership position where I can feel proud of what I’m doing—and make enough to feel financially secure. But honestly, I’m not sure if that’s the right path, or if there’s something better out there that I haven’t thought of.  



I’m just looking for advice, ideas, or even a little encouragement. I’m so ready to get off the phones, stop working two jobs, and find something stable—a real career that I can feel good about.

1gvv7yh,Need Advice! Will you apply for this job on this situation?,"Hello,



I really want to work in an organization's A team, but now its B team is opening a position. Should I apply for it?



Background: I have been building relationships with the organization's A team for a while. I have talked to the A team's team lead, manager, and director. I once applied for a job in this A team, but due to a budget change, the director told me that the position was on hold. He encouraged me to keep an eye on this team and asked me to check back with him in December. At that time, they originally wanted to hire two people for that position but eventually selected an internal employee for the role and put my application on hold. This situation makes me think it would be beneficial to become an internal employee first to increase my chances of getting the position I want. Therefore, I am wondering if I should apply for the B team's position to become an internal employee.



The A team's position is more suitable for my background and offers a better salary than the B team's position. However, the A team's position is more of a managerial role, which is higher than my qualifications. The director of both the A and B teams is the same person who encouraged me to check back with him in December.



What is your opinion on this situation? Should I reach out to the director for suggestions?",Federal-Ad1353,1,1.0,0,1732124396,2024-11-20 17:39:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvv7yh/need_advice_will_you_apply_for_this_job_on_this/,11,2024

2. Join finance team in a non-accounting firm but PT. Can only do 1 accounting qualification & I gotta pay for it (£500-£1,000)


Now I have a small business that i wanna do on the side (just market stall on a Saturday) but I want to be a CA and to be one I have to do the 2nd qualification in option 1. To do this 2nd qualification I have to be at an accounting firm as it requires work experience and to be funded by an emloyer.

I can do my PT option 2 finish the first qualification and look for a role next yr where I do the next qualification if my small business fails.

But I just don’t know

1gvtxxp,Struggling to Understand Job Application Feedback in a New Culture,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some advice on a situation I’ve been navigating at work. I recently applied for an internal job position in a different branch of the company and have been feeling quite confused about the feedback I received throughout the process.

Coming from a different culture, I sometimes struggle with non-verbal cues and the subtleties of communication here. Before applying, I spoke with my manager, who seemed uncertain but reassured me that everyone could apply and I would hear back from HR. After three days without communication, I reached out to our HR partner, who confirmed they had received my application.

A few days later, I mentioned my application to my manager again, and he was somewhat reactive, saying he was still reviewing CVs. As more days passed without updates, I felt overlooked and asked him to follow up with the recruiters. He called to say he was still reviewing applications, which made me realize things might not be moving forward.

After a month, I learned they were interviewing someone else from our team (who was ultimately not selected). When I asked my manager what happened with my application, he mentioned that another candidate had more experience and that HR didn’t see me as a strong candidate. I expressed my continued interest and belief in my candidacy, but he indicated that they would wait until the end to interview me.

Eventually, I decided to step back from the process. I kindly shared that I prefer clearer communication and that sometimes his efforts to protect my feelings resulted in a lack of transparency. He seemed surprised and asked why I changed my mind, but I kept my response focused on self-improvement.

Now, I’m unsure how to interpret this situation. Is it common in the U.S. workplace to withhold direct feedback? Did I misread the signs? Any advice on how to handle similar situations in the future would be greatly appreciated!

The HR manager who is supposed to onboard me quits the week before I start. I find out after waiting at the office for over an hour and none has any idea what’s happening (main office is 2 hours away and they were bringing a laptop to me). The CEO calls and says the HR manager quits. 

Go to lunch with group - at lunch coworkers says “you eat a lot of salad, that’s why your body is so fit”

End of day 1 still no working laptop 

Day two no working laptop. Did research on my phone. Person working on my phone leaves before my laptop is all set up. Find out that they’re not rehiring an HR position at all, maybe an office manager in southern office. The company has 180EEs across the state. I’m doing all HR responsibilities (minus whatever I can throw in our Office Manager) 

Day three laptop set up at 11am. 

Nobody has a clue about what is happening. You ask them if they do everify, they say yes, and then when explained to them what it is they say no. I feel like I’m being set up for failure here. In my previous roles as a director I at least had a business partner to help out. 

It sounds like a great opportunity to start from scratch with things but the amount of work that needs to be done is overwhelming and the CEO has Champaign taste on a beer budget. There is also additional work for compliance because the majority of employees are here on a visa. I’m looking for different work but this is rough. I’m open to hearing thoughts and suggestions.

1gvstaz,I can't work effectively unless someone tells me what to do. Am I stupid?,"Forgive the slightly tongue in cheek title. I do have a sense of humor. But I'm not stupid, at least I don't think so. So there must be another explanation :D

**Me:** I'm early 40's with a two-year technical degree, living in the southern USA. I managed to cobble together a stable career by moving from IT/sys admin, to craft/trades worker in electrical, then growing into ""knowledge work"" in the same field, where I currently work.

**My problem:** Through painful self-reflection, I've concluded that I'm really bad at a lot of traits that lead to a ""successful"" career in any industry, from manufacturing to performing arts: things like long-term or even medium-term planning, strategic thinking, leadership skills, and being self-directed. I thrive when tasks are clearly defined, either by another person or defined by some external requirements (codes, design plans, whatever). Translated: I need someone to tell me what to do. At most, I can co-create the plan with other people. But not by myself.

In my \~40 years of life experience, I've learned (rightly or wrongly) that people who need to be told what to do cannot excel. That there's a ceiling, both for income and for access to interesting & rewarding work. Is this true? Is anyone out there making a decent living, supporting a family, while working as an ""individual contributor"", as it's called in some circles?

1gvq8ws,Negotiating for signing bonus in lieu of RRSP matching? (Canada),"I'm expecting an offer from a company that I'm in the process of interviewing for. Had my first call today with HR for a screening and they laid out their benefits program for me to begin considering. Benefits program seems good, but when I asked if they have any RRSP matching program, they admitted that they don't; they realize this is a weakness and they're working on getting approval for one . She made it sound like maybe a year from now they might be looking to have one, but nothing certain in sight. I've been lucky in that all my jobs so far have offered RRSP matching (4% at my first job, 7% at my more recent job). 7% corresponds to an extra 6K of payment from my previous companies on top of salary. From a [poll in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/x3bbnf/comment/imojv2t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), it seems like 5% matching is the median - corresponding to closer to 4K at my salary. I see a statistic that 67% of Canadian engineering companies offer some degree of RRSP matching, so I feel within reason to expect this. I had two ideas:

1. My first thought was to ask for an additional $5K (halfway between my previous match and the national median) in my salary to offset their lack of RRSP matching. If they agreed, awesome, but I wouldn't expect them to because this skews my salary in the event that true matching is added a year from now.
2. To respect their claim that they're working on it, my next thought is to ask for a $5K signing bonus equivalent to the RRSP match that I wouldn't be receiving in my first year with them. I'd happily suggest that this bonus come with a stipulation that I stay with the company for one year, to ""earn"" that full match. But if they still don't have RRSP matching after one year, then the bonus only got me ""matching"" for one year.

Has anyone had success negotiating such a bonus in lieu of RRSP matching? Should I start by asking for the offset in salary? If I did start with that and they decline, would it be unreasonable to follow that up with proposing the bonus idea?",SeanStephensen,1,1.0,0,1732111548,2024-11-20 14:05:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvq8ws/negotiating_for_signing_bonus_in_lieu_of_rrsp/,11,2024

1gvpgob,Difficulty learning at a new job,"It's my second week at a new job and the resources and instructions for learning how to do tasks are really poor.
My closest colleague and the manager have been juggling the workload alone for the last 6 months and I was told on day one that it would take a long time to learn everything and that there was no pressure. This was refreshing to hear since I had the opposite experience at my last two jobs, however the learning feels like it's almost going in reverse and their lack of teaching is frustrating.
There's a lot of work that the manager and colleague are trying to get done before deadlines, so the focus is on their tasks. I'm rarely sitting with either of them to learn or shadow even though they said that would be happening. I've been encouraged to look through process documents and to explore previous tasks folders, however the processes are not written in a way that someone new can understand and the folders/filing are a mess.

I'm a hard worker and can pick things up relatively quickly, so this situation is feeling quite demotivating. I'm happy to show initiative and self-learn where I can, but I have no idea how to make progress with or without them.
Also, the manager and colleague have their own clique, so I'm apprehensive about trying to talk to my manager about the situation. This is my second job change in the last 6 months so I'm determined to try and make it work.

I know this since I have access to information as part of my role. 

I am also aware that the reason her role is getting impacted is more political in nature, since the head of the business does not get along with her and using this program to get rid of folks who don’t align with his way of doing this. 

Now, I am keen to offer her position back in my team. However, I am also concerned that this will be viewed as a direct challenge to the decision of the business head - with whom I need to work closely going forward + he has organizational power.

1gvp3oe,Unproductive Feedback,"Curious how you'd handle this.

It's that monthly one-on-one but it's actually my 2nd one in 6 months with my new boss. His boss sat in on it to make sure my boss was doing his job. 

The only positive thing I was told was I have excellent work ethic.

I was told some other staff members noticed I had a lot on my plate and asked their supervisors how they can help me. I'm not a supervisor but I have supervision over these people. My boss tells me I need to manage my stress better, that these individuals say I wear my emotions on my sleeve. I asked for examples so I'm more aware of what I'm doing. None were provided to me. So I have no genuine idea of what I'm doing other than assuming. I will admit I was stressed out very infrequently weeks ago but I didn't stomp around, and I verbalized playfully that I had a lot going on. Nothing rude, or strongly verbalized.

I was also told I need to remember I was told to advocate for staff. I'm not even sure why this was mentioned. I encourage them to send emails to leadership with their ideas if they feel comfortable. If they don't, I offer to bring it up. I check in with my crew daily. I offer help daily. If someone says they're feeling burned out, I break up their workload/assignments. 

Eventually I was told the comments made about my emotions were from weeks/a month ago. This was during a time I tried being respectfully vocal to my boss about my work partners negative attitude and at times reluctance to help (she was on her way out of the company). He told me at that time he'd talk with her. She doesn't care for him. It's been well known that this woman behaves a certain way but it's never been fully addressed with her.

(There's also a supervisor, my work partners boss) who literally wears her emotions on her sleeve frequently I never know what mood she'll be in. I known Im nowhere near how she protrays herself in person oe by email.) Use this as a comparison. 

At the end of the one-on-one, I was told that my boss sees me using my leadership skills. But nothing I am doing is different other than asking to do a team building exercise. 

I'm lost. I'm frustrated. I feel defeated. I can't wrap my head around what I'm doing wrong.

1gvou8o,I've stumbled into a 1 month break between jobs - should i take it?,"I'm an Account Executive working in the Indian IT market. My current job has been in an extremely toxic and unstable work environment which is why I've been looking out for other offers. I got an offer from another organization about 15 days ago, the role and company seem promising and I'm excited to join them. 

I put down my resignation notice about 12 days ago. My official notice period is 2 months, I've communicated this to my future employer and they're comfortable with me joining 2 months after my date of resignation at my current company. 

My current company being as toxic and unpredictable as they are, reached out to me today informing that today is my last working day. I saw this coming and have an emergency fund saved up exactly for a situation like this so finances are not an issue plus I'm excited about this break as I had 0 days off between my previous job switch and became burntout as a result of that.

My question is: should i go back to my future employer and tell them that I've been let go? If i don't and they find out later will that reflect poorly on me? If i tell them that I've been let go and still want to join them at the previously agreed upon joining date will that reflect poorly on me? 

TLDR: I have agreed upon a joining date of early January with a future employer. My current employer has dishonored the 2 month notice period and let me go today.

1gvmwvt,I'm failing socially at my first good job,"I need to vent and get a new perspectives on my problems. Maybe someone can relate and provide helpful survival tips.

I'm 27 and all my experience is in foodservice. Something snapped in me earlier this year because I felt both exploited and underutilized as a cook making $15/hr. I applied to community college and went through the endless resume tailoring and interviewing process to improve my status. I knew I could leverage my hospitality experience into *something*, so I applied pretty much anywhere I had a shot at convincing someone it translated. I successfully managed to get hired as a concessions supervisor at an NFL stadium and I've been there about two months now.

I actually think I'm pretty good at my job! The part that matters anyway. I try as hard as I can to make events go smoothly for every individual worker in the teams I supervise. I defer to their internal team leaders for small problems, push their big problems up the chain, and am not above sweating my ass off beside them. Someone honestly told me I was the best ""red shirt"" they had ever worked with because I was actually there for them and that sentiment is keeping me going right now.

My problem is that I can't stand socializing on setup-inventory days. It's 5:1 alone with only other managers to actually doing cool football stuff. I'm solidly not neurotypical. I'm the only trans person in the building. I'm 20 years younger, or 10 years older than any of my coworkers. We clearly do not share political sensibilities based on the amount of times someone has told me what would happen to me in a men's prison. I do not want to hear their opinions about what language the cleaning crew speaks. I just want to put my headphones in and actually do my work, but there's a pervasive pressure to slow down and burn an unbelievable amount of downtime.

There isn't a way for me to find more tasks or just fully fuck off and bring a laptop in and do schoolwork. I'm not meaningfully on call or supervising the set-up crews. I just exist, with people I dislike, in awe of their ability to have family and relationship drama developments so frequently. I know everyone hates their job, and I really need to make this work because of the opportunity it represents, but I'm sleeping in broken 90 minute stints and waking up having panic attacks over what's supposed to be the easy part of my job. I really cannot handle the drive to work knowing I'll see them again.

I was already forced to talk to HR about it because one of my coworkers was uncomfortable with my presence and I allowed myself to be moved departments to avoid the conflict. They told me they won't keep doing that though and I have to make it work. 

Examining the situation as if the problem was entirely me. Maybe I'm just having a really hard time adjusting to my first management job. Maybe I'm overburdened from school and I'd be able to slow down and get along with my coworkers if my mind didn't drift to what I could be doing instead of talking. Maybe I'm sensitive and I just need to learn how to handle people who are different from me in the same way I expect my coworkers to handle my differences. I just want to make it work. At least long enough to put it on a resume and move on.

I just want to cry. The difference in my experience on the days I actually help the company make a ton of money vs the days I'm forced to putz around with coworkers is so stark.",NeuroticCoworker,1,1.0,4,1732100393,2024-11-20 10:59:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvmwvt/im_failing_socially_at_my_first_good_job/,11,2024
1gvmqfd,"Advice needed: Stay in a relatively safe job in a new role, but company is expected to close down in a few years - or leave the company and get a severance compensation equalling to 12 months salary and find a new job?","Hi all,

First time poster here.

Would love to get input from you.

About me: Just turned 40 with wife in low paying job and 2 children 1 and 3 years. Been at the same company for 7 years. 

The situation: My current manager position is being made redundant, but the company has offered me another role which is different(non managerial), but being allowed to keep the same compensation package. 

If I'm not to take up the new offered role, I'll have to leave the company, but the company will have to pay me a severance package of 12 months salary.

The company is expected to close all its activities in the next few years, meaning I'll have to find a new job anyway...

Pros and cons about the company:
Pros: 
*Allowed to work from home 2 out of 5 days
*Holiday package is one of the best in the industry in the country I'm from (6 weeks)
*Up to a week of child sick days, where I can stay at home with the sick child and get full pay. 
*High pension paid by the company
*Easy to get to the office through high way with little to no traffic
*Relatively good salary (~9,5k USD pr month) plus year end bonus and pension and paid holiday
*Health and dental insurance
*Free fruits and coffee

Cons:
*Salary increase is low
*Opportunity for personal growth is low
*Workload can be high at times
*Overtime not compensated in cash (You can leave earlier on a day with low workload)
*Could be a dead end job relating to the new role due to low opportunity for growth


Arguments/reasons to choose to leave with severance package:
I kind of grown tired of the company for the wrong decisions it has made over the last 5 years leading the company to its demise. Secondly, some colleagues who wants to take the severance package are not allowed to for the foreseeable time, because their position is still needed, but once a different person is able to free up the want away person's time, then he would be able to leave with the severance. So if I were to take up this offered role, I might get stuck in the company for a longer time and won't be able to get the severance package even if I wanted to at a later stage... Lastly, would be good to change the environment and look for more interesting jobs. 

Downside of this choice is that I need to find a new job, and I'd prefer that the compensation package is more or less in line or better. Lack of clarity for what the near future brings. 

Arguments/reasons to choose to stay and take up new role:
Stability and being able to take care of my kids, when they get sick and still be able to enjoy the perks of the company. Knowing what the day brings in the near future. 

The downside of this might be that I'll be demotivated in the job and stuck in the company unless I quit, where I won't get the severance package. Giving up opportunities of applying for more interesting jobs while getting a nice payout.

1gvlyo3,"Need advice: Stuck in IT support, should I switch to development or try for an internal transfer?","Hi everyone,



I’m currently working as a Service Desk Analyst at a big MNC. I’m a fresher and joined this company because of its brand name, but now I feel stuck. Before this, I had an internship at a startup where I worked on a C# and .NET MVC project, which I really enjoyed. I even worked there for two months, but I left for this MNC without giving it a second thought, assuming the brand name would open more doors.



Unfortunately, my current role is purely IT support, and there’s no development work here. I miss coding and feel like I’m losing touch with my skills. Internally switching roles in big MNCs seems very tough, and I’m not sure how feasible it is.



To leave this company, I’d have to pay ₹50,000, but I’m wondering if it’s worth it to look for a new development role outside. I’m really torn about what to do.



Should I:



Stay in this MNC and try harder for an internal switch?



Leave the company and start fresh in a development role, even if it costs me?



Any other advice you’d suggest?



I’d really appreciate your insights. Thanks in advance!",eatheroutforonce,0,0.5,0,1732096121,2024-11-20 09:48:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvlyo3/need_advice_stuck_in_it_support_should_i_switch/,11,2024
1gvkzod,Always feeling 5 steps behind in my career…,"Looking for some guidance. Details about me below. I’m sorry this is long. Here goes..

My situation seems completely stupid as I type this out. But I literally don’t have anyone in my life who can give me real career advice.

I’m hoping someone has better foresight than me or a better perspective as to what the future holds…


At every job I’ve held I feel like I’ve missed the real opportunity for growth/stability by 3-5 years. 

Then I get laid off (3 times). First, it was an operations role in 2018, then another in 2020. Followed by a layoff while working as a UX designer in Jan 2023.

At each time, these specific things were past their prime, became hyper competitive, and technology/AI was disrupting in some way. 

I bit the bullet in 2023 and learned full stack web development, while gritting my teeth realizing that coding jobs had a 60% decline in postings. I don’t regret it. Just wished I’d done it in 2015.

In 2024 I decided to get a second bachelors in cybersecurity engineering - but I’m now realizing how flooded the market will be next year when mass layoffs come to government. 

I just feel like I’m going to be stuck in this cycle of unemployment forever - Or constantly getting laid off.

I know my experience is all over the place, but I can’t get a job - and insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly expecting different results. Right?

When I find a time when she’s not talking to other people (she’s a executive so there’s always someone who needs to talk to her) I will ask if there’s anything I can do or if there’s there’s something she needs getting done.

For anyone who doesn’t know what the job entails, it’s a lot of sales (yourself and your clients), networking, business development and strategy, all in the name of guiding the careers of actors/writers/directors/etc. This is a very basic description. 

I’m being let go from my job at the end of the year and instead of trying to find another agency/management company to go to, I’m seriously considering getting out of the business altogether. I’m 39, married, have 2 young kids, and want to be able to enjoy a decent quality of life and hopefully regain some of my mental health and humanity that I’ve lost over the past 15 years.

I’m not super precious, I’ll do whatever I need to in order to provide for my family, and I feel surviving in the biz for as long as I have plus taking what I’ve learned in this industry will eventually help me crush whatever job I do in the future.

I may or may not have the option to switch the exact same job that I have to the Bangalore office but only if I request it. 

I have always wanted to stay in different cities around the globe but I just didn't expect it to be so soon. I don't have many friends in hyderabad(only 1 who is far away from the city and is busy). And as much as I want to start a new life in a new city from scratch, I'm going to miss the familiarity and comfort of bangalore. And the fact that my entire group of friends are going to be in bangalore and it's only me who is going to be so far away just hurts. But at the same time I really don't know if requesting for a role change to bangalore would mean that I'm hampering my growth potential. I really want to experience different cities but idk I'm so scared. 

I'm very 50 50 about the situation and I only have few days to accept or decline the offer. Please help!

1gvidrl,Job/ Major ideas for a college kid.,"Hello, first Reddit post ever.
I’m about to graduate from a 2 year community college and I’m still undecided on my major, for when I transfer to a four year. I just can’t think of any jobs or careers i’d like to go into.

I like multitasking, hands on work, I’m good with attention to detail, and like working efficiently. I learn best by observation and hands on work, which is what I enjoy. If trained correctly I think I’d be good at almost anything, so I don’t want to get stuck at a job I can do well but don’t find fun.

I don’t like doing the same thing everyday, I can work in a team but I’d prefer not to 60% of the time. I generally do well in all my classes even the ones I don’t like which is why I never know how to answer the question “what are you good at” when talking to counselors about next step.

I don’t like anything in the communications, public speaking, language arts side of things. I’m wouldn’t consider myself a creative person so nothing in the design areas either. Really dislike history classes. I wasn’t a fan of my coding computer class but I did enjoy my high school computer class where we basically copied the teachers example to create fake posters and information sheets. 

Don’t have many hobbies. I watch YouTube, Netflix, etc. Do my class work, go to work, recently started making stuff out of clay but it’s not good (wouldn’t consider myself an artist at all, it’s just fun).

I mainly like algebra and science classes but I’m not sure how that would translate into a job or major. I like science classes while I’m in them but immediately forget everything later.

Any jobs or majors y’all think I would be interested in. I should be applying to college atp but I still don’t know 🫣. As of right now I may just pick a broad science major and go from there.

1gvic01,What can I do against unfair treatment in the workplace? ,"Here’s the context: My teammate and I started at the same time as technicians but I’ve noticed some differences in how we’re treated and recognized by our manager. A few examples include:

1. **Travel Opportunities**: My teammate has been given opportunities to travel to other offices, but I haven’t been offered the same, even though I’ve expressed interest in gaining more experience and exposure.
2. **Unequal Expectations**: I’ve been told I need to train on additional skills or meet specific criteria to qualify for certain opportunities, but my teammate hasn’t had to do the same. Behind my back my boss told another peer that he just didn't trust me.
3. **Workload and Performance**: Over the course of our time at the company, I’ve completed **500 more tickets** than my teammate, in addition to taking on more responsibilities like which other teams praised me for (Praise my manager never mentions). Despite this, my contributions seem to be overlooked. During meetings I'll mention I've got certain ticket areas to historically low numbers for our company and my boss just says I need to do better.
4. **Employee Evaluation**: During recent employee evaluations, I learned that my manager graded me lower than my teammate. We're not supposed to know how we were evaluated but this has a direct impact on my raise, which is frustrating given the disparity in our workloads and my additional responsibilities.

I’ve been documenting my work and accomplishments, but it feels demoralizing to be treated this way. I'm unsure how to move forward as anything I've said to my manager in a 1 on 1 seems to have fallen on deaf ears and escalating the issue to HR will obviously change my work dynamic. I have a monthly 1 on 1 with my manager's boss on Thursday and I'm wondering if I should bring this up with him as well.

1gvi45p,Are these work traits I have observed common across all jobs in America?,"Greetings Redditors,

  
 I'm in my late twenties, early in my career. I work as a product design engineer, (dream role I landed a year ago), at a large organization in America.  I earn fair salary for my skillset. The company has products designed and built here in USA, but also takes Chinese product and re-brands them as their own and sells them in the U.S. For Canada, they take the Chinese product and re-brand, so Canadians don't get their own domestic built product. Before I came into this role, I worked 7-8 years spread across internships, auto repair, and HVAC/R/electrical repair. I was used to hourly, technical work with my hands without the meetings, corporate politics, and non-sensical engineers who make life harder than it has to be. The reason I came into this role is to use my degree more rather than my body (BSME). I figured at 28-29 (age), I would be a fool to spend the time getting the degree and not take full advantage of it, and so here I am.

  
\- When I started this role, I learned that the workload is tremendous. I'm making about 8.5% more in pay than my last hourly, chill and straightforward job as a technician. But I quite frankly feel they are literally working me to the bone.

  
\- My boss gives me lots of assignments, but everyday there are meetings that get added to my calendar, and it's really difficult to focus and put my best foot forward. I do well in situations where I can spend 1-2 hours of quality time on ONE thing. I do poorly multi-tasking. I keep notes in one digital place, to track projects.

\- The principle engineer left and retired months ago, and I've had to read up and study what he was working on too. The principle role is a heavy duty role requiring deep knowledge of our products, something I just don't have at this stage in my career; the principle engineer was a guide stone for when we got trapped in the dark. We are having trouble recruiting a new replacement, and I am bit aggravated the company didn't even consider interviewing people BEFORE the guy left. He gave us a 1 year heads up yall. This makes me frustrated knowing that they have ALL THIS MONEY, but wanted to be cheap and not hire cause ""hiring is expensive"" (probably, not sure just my theory on why they didn't invest time or money). If they hire some guy who has never fixed a piece of refrigeration equipment, then I and my team-mate will need to ""coach him up"" while he's being paid almost double our salary. I want someone who I can look up to as a leader, someone who is able to need minimal intervention or training about the field he or she is in. I don't expect the new hire to be a PERFECT fit, but am I being too harsh to say that a principle engineer in the industry he or she is hired in, needs to have depth of product knowledge? Why should I tell my boss to invest and hire someone who is not fluent in the field, because our team may take a hit? I'm no fool to just settle for anyone. So far we interviewed 3 candidates and they all were NOT good fits, as I wrote to my boss, and my colleagues too. I think it's safe to say we won't be able to find someone for at least 2-3 months. I've had to go out and reach out to former colleagues to spread the word to help find a hire for the role.

  
\-The now retired guy got away by handing work off to other engineers to handle and did not pull his weight. Apparently he had ""extensive HVAC/R experience."" We are hoping the new replacement for him will be more software savvy and tech-savvy.

\- The previous principle guy didn't even do Solidworks or anything remotely tech-savvy related. It was frustrating for me because I had to come in and learn the PLM side and (already knew Solidworks). 

\- Is it toxic where I work? I kind of feel like me having to pick-up the slack for the principle guy should be temporary. We have interviewed 3 candidates, and I have said NO to each and every one cause they lacked the refrigeration experience we need. My boss has genuinely failed at finding candidates in this market where we live, and the company won't pay what they ask. We had one guy who was a great fit, but was ""too expensive.""

\- I thought the role would be more structured. For example, we just got a new VP of engineering, and our job titles are changing soon and the company is under-going change, or so I was told. They are instituting a new replacement for product life management and CRM, so nothing is stable. 



\- And then you have to deal with change requests people across the org. put in, and manage the ""fixes"" they'd like. There's one lady in purchasing and materials who always brings up really long conversations at the end of the 1 hour change request meetings, and pro-longs the time by 30-45 minutes. She loves attention and trying to deflect responsibility. 

  
\- MEETINGS. I get having a meeting to stay updated, but everyday I have at least 2 meetings. On some days, I have 4. It's difficult to get work done and submit deliverables when I am getting sucked into meetings constantly, and then forgetting where I left off.

  
\- LACK OF ORGANIZATION - files. I can't even begin to describe the lack of care that went on for the last older principle engineer. He got away with a TON of things simply cause he was liked by management. For example, the stuff he handed over to me was spread out all over the place, and the file tree for our engineering product line for my product is EVERYWHERE. I have had to spend weeks learning and deleting old stuff, re-naming and organizing. It's so bothersome that there was a double standard between him and me. I for one, get paid less, but still had to learn the PLM software we use. 

  
\- Finally, I have a few questions:

\- Have you ever actually found a unicorn job? Like a job that you can go in for 8 hours, come home stress free, and have minimal toxic culture?

\- Is it safe to assume American work culture has people who won't speak on things because they are afraid of being wrong? In context, let's say there is a question asked in a meeting. Nobody has the balls to speak up cause they don't want to be wrong. What happened to people's word? Why cant we have more courageous people these days who can not be afraid to make a mistake and admit it? Part of growth is taking a risk. OR, ""I dont know but I can find out.""

\- And is it toxic to constantly be pulled into side-assignments and not be allowed to actually get work done?

  
\- Do company C-level executives act manipulative by telling managers below them to create bullshit meetings one after another? I mean; is there really a need for huddles every freaking day? Is this a way to politely micro-manage people without telling them they are being micro-managed? I dont feel micro-managed, but I sure do feel worn out from having to expend valuable and finite brain energy from fixing designs and submitting deliverables, to getting side-tracked by questions, rabbit holes, and other stuff I quite frankly DONT feel responsible for.

  
Sorry to make it long, but I really need some advice from more experienced redditors. Are these things common place, or should I start job hinting? I know that in the end, corporations care for profit; often times shareholders are the most important shot callers, But is it even possible to find a company where there is structure, organization, and a way to just go in, do quality work with minimal distraction, and clock-out with mental sharpness daily?  I ask only people in their 30s and beyond answer this please.",Fair_Description1604,1,1.0,1,1732079526,2024-11-20 05:12:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvi45p/are_these_work_traits_i_have_observed_common/,11,2024
1gvi2v0,Update on coworker I’ve never met made inappropriate comment ,"Link to original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/bRe8XiWUSC

First of all I want to thank you all for your advice and feedback. 

Secondly I want to say I was so unbelievably hesitant to figure out how to approach this because of prior experiences and how companies HR departments work. 

Thirdly - I was able to speak to my direct manager today, in person. We discussed the nuances and the situation and I want to say I am extremely thankful to have a manager who actually cares for the first time, and a company who values women / diversity / inclusion / respect. Etc. 

He was utterly shocked by dudes comments and discussed what I’d be comfortable with or if he needed to speak to him. We decided to send the guy an email so it is on record from me, to the superintendent, with my manager bcc’d. For records purposes. 

Upon explaining my hesitations my manager said “I have my teams back, I will sink with this ship if I have to, if you get retaliated against so do I, and you don’t have to worry about losing your job, only he should be.” 

Superintendent read the email, called me, apologized, we discussed the situation and I believe we’re on the same page now. Obviously with the email in the system the incident is on the record and only my direct manager and him know about this so HR isn’t going to be involved unless he decides to act out of line again. 

I think this has been resolved to the absolute best case scenario!!! 

Again I truly appreciate all of your insight and comments. Thank you. ",royalfire798,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1732079400,2024-11-20 05:10:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gvi2v0/update_on_coworker_ive_never_met_made/,11,2024

1gvg0wj,Certificates for social media marketing liable for career start? ,"
Hello all, I’m an inspiring chef with a huge background in the restaurant industry, from serving to hosting, bartending and expoing.. i have never cooked in a kitchen but I do cook from home . I sell chocolates and assortment boxes on holidays too. Unless I’m learning a new dish, I don’t follow recipes because I make my own .  I have passion for making restaurants better I even became an elite on yelp (haha) (iykyk)

Anyways my point is, is getting a digital  media marketing certificate with the goals of becoming a social media manager for restaurants, worth it? Due to my

1gvfaxd,I feel lost in my career & don’t feel like working for a while,"I have been in social media for over 5 years now. 
Recently joined a reputed agency with a relatively new digital division. 
Indian agencies suffer from lack of boundaries, permanently low resources, lack the of any processes & procedures that they follow, making everything basically a climb out of the deepest trenches of hell. 
I’ve done this in the past, and there’s only so long one can do this. 
I felt because this agency is so reputed for their PR work, they would be process oriented, unfortunately they are led by a clueless leader and hence they’re not. 
This year has been up & down for me career wise and if I leave this job, I’ll have a gap of year on my resume. But going or even the thought of going to work gives me literal nightmares, anxiety attacks and makes me throw up, even if something might not be wrong. It’s the environment here. It’s the whole high school clique vibe here with children running the gamut.

1gvf5vv,Working in their time zone sucks…,"In my job I have almost always been working with people a few hours behind me. I’m fine with that. Most of time I would be working from 11 to 8.

Until I got transferred to a new team 6 months ago.

Their time zone did not change (all of them are from the same country) but they have a habit of starting work later than usual, and ending work really late. It’s still a 2.5 hour time difference, yet it feels like a 5 hour difference. Now I am working from 1 AM until who knows. I rarely had to work past 9 before, now I’m still working past 11 PM most days. For 6 months and counting. It’s affecting my lifestyle, I’m either too tired for hobbies outside work, I wake up and sleep later than everyone else, due to this I even lost weight from skipping lunch. 

Additionally, we have 3 days RTO so on those days, I go to the office at noon, spend a half day, then go home to continue work.

I know that the general expectation is that I should follow their work schedule especially that I am the only person from a different country, but I don’t know if this is something I can continue to do for the next couple of months.

I only put up with it because I was told it was temporary, but due to a company reorganization, I’m permanently allocated to them.

I’m a senior consultant/project manager for a Fortune 500 firm. I learned late last month that the project I was supporting lost funding, and I was one of the staff members who will be cut off. 
I was getting bored with my project and wanted to get staffed in a new project anyway, so I was fine with it. I am struggling to find a project at the moment because I’m not a SWE or a data scientist, but I know from my network that we may have more openings next month.  

However, the timing was pretty bad. I was planning on buying a car for my birthday (next week), but now I changed my mind because I’m concerned in making that big of a purchase while on the bench.

I currently live at home, and had plans to get my own place next year. Now those plans are halted until I can get a new project or an even a new job. My mom won’t even speak to me because of my situation. 

My mom worked as a nurse for over 25 years and she wanted me to pursue a clinical career, however, I didn’t want to and I decided to pride health administration instead. Even after I graduated with a 3.8 GPA, got a Masters from a top 5 in the country, she is still adamant that I will regret my choices when I turn 40. She won’t even speak or look at me, and she makes me feel like a failure. Today she told me, “I had no purpose” since I don’t have a project.

I feel horrible, and I don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: my mom is making me feel bad for not being staffed in a project at work and being in the bench, says that I will be poor and will regret my choices to go into corporate instead of the medical field.

I am in a somewhat small industry in a somewhat smaller city. I got let go from a job a few years ago - I was only there for about a year; for a bogus HR complaint that a coworker filed to knock me out of the running for a promotion; they never really gave me a chance to defend myself - they didn’t want to run the risk that any of it could be true. They told me when I left that they only use a third party verification service for employment because legally they can’t disclose anything minus dates worked; and they told me that I can collect unemployment if needed which led me to believe they weren’t going to say it was for cause. I’ve left every other job on my own terms, but I know I have at least one disgruntled coworker and some of my other jobs who may take issue with me because we just personally didn’t get along. No issues I have had at work have ever been performance based and a majority of people generally tend to like me, so I am a little flabbergasted if they called someone else they knew in the industry who didn’t like me or if one of my previous companies is talking negatively about me.

1gve5k1,How to turn things around? ,"I am 34, working for minimum wage as a bartender and (reluctantly) staying with my Mum. 

This situation was supposed to be a temporary fix to allow me to retrain in a new industry, but it has 3.5 years and my mental health has declined significantly. I am now significantly burned out and probably very depressed. 

I am now no longer able to focus/concentrate outside of work, I am mentally/physically exhausted and I no longer have any interest in socialising/hobbies etc - including the gym, which used to be a big part of my life. In fact, I find it very overwhelming and negative now. As bad as this is, I am also unable to focus on retraining/upskilling/improving my situation as I’m so burned out. 

Currently, I’m debating whether to quit my job and spend the next couple of months focusing on restorative rest and eventually, retraining. I have the privilege of cheap rent for a couple months and feel I should capitalise on this while I can. However, I fear quitting a job with no plan may obviously lead me into a worse position. 

Things have just declined to a point where I’m finding it hard to continue - both professionally and personally - but I can’t work out a ‘safe’ plan. 

The most time I can currently get off at work is 5 days in a row.

1gvdn3f,What would you do in my situation?,"I am 19, I speak English, Russian and French, I rely on my parents mostly, but do have work experience (Facilitator (essentially a glorified janitor) and a photographer). I love the world of photography and film and for me that is my passion, but when I entered uni I decided that something like that does not really need a degree so I decided to get my degree in economics, something I actually like theoretically, but now kinda slowly coming to the realization might be even less degree dependent and less interesting in an actual professional setting (not that I would know, since nobody hires interns anymore apparently). I am studying abroad in Paris and when I return to SF I will graduate when I'm 20 just before I turn 21. I also have had a really odd thing happen in my family and essentially through inheritance type of way I now have about 150k sitting in my bank account. 

I'm at odds with what the fuck I am supposed to do. I am currently making a short film on the side with friends and some pretty good equipment and plan to submit it to contests and stuff but outside from that I have no idea how that business works. If I could use the money to somehow accelerate this project I would love to hear about it.

The money smart people will say I should put it away in a high yield savings account and not touch it, which would be really the smart move, but thing is I don't depend on it, I have my parents and they pay for pretty much everything (and I do plan on doing the same for them when they get older). 

I was thinking on maybe starting a business or invest in some start ups, but how would I do that? ( not a business guy so I do mean invest, not start, I am under no illusion of myself carrying around a million dollar idea or anything) 

On one hand I could keep grindning at finding internships related to econ and finance in the city while I finish my degree and maybe keep pursuing the film/photography shit on the side, but if I can full send it on what I actually would kill to do in life why not send it? 

Another thing is that I do plan on leaving America once I graduate to do a Masters in Europe so I don't really give a shit about shit like buying a house here.

I am just now realizing I don't like IT. Or anything stem-related at all. I don't like anything involving business or finance or any soulless corporate job. I have no interest in the military or any kind of role like that. I do not tolerate any jobs that are directly involved with this stuff. I also don't like to drive (so many psychopaths on the road in the United States). I do not tolerate any kind of fucking job that requires you to work insane hours or deal with either toxic environments or toxic people. Computers for me are fun tools to play and discover with, not a ball and chain to enslave you with. I tried social work and studying for an MSW, but hated the bureaucracy that came with it. Tried linguistics and wanted to become a professor in it, but I hated the cutthroat political chickenshit games that academia plays. Tried the trades, but apprenticeships are fucked with many wanting a union career (lEaRn To CoDe BeCaMe LeArN a TrAdE). Trades full of machismo cultural bullshit of men wanting to outdo the other in terms of much they can fuck up their bodies and make fun of you as the FNG. Experienced this in landscaping, construction, ironworking, and electrician. 

I took the Holland Occupational Codes test, on Onet, specifically, and the only area I scored high in was Artistic. Every other field and interest sounded horrible to me. Also used ChatGPT and funnily enough, it pretty much solely recommended careers in that artistic field like Illustrator, graphic designer, author, graphic novel artist, and on.

So far I've spent a lot of time talking about what I hate. As far as what I like, it varies, but overall I would say I lean heavily towards creative avenues. Drawing, writing, painting, reading, playing video games, playing and making music, making short films, and so on. I wrote a novel a while back, and while I haven't sold anything really, I felt more accomplishment and satisfaction doing that than any bullshit job that I can think of and have worked in. I like working alone and being alone. I like to knap and make small wood-crafting projects. If possible I would like a career that offers some mobility in terms of leaving the United States.

I understand if there are no careers or jobs that can sustain me. In which case I have a backup plan. Once my savings run out, then I'm offing myself. If there is nothing for me here, it doesn't make sense to stay where I am not wanted or needed.

1gvbsx0,Clarification Needed Regarding Pay Structure and Cell Phone Deduction - Plz Help ,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out for some guidance on a couple of issues with my current job. I’ve attached my year-to-date earnings for reference.

When I started in April, my offer letter stated that I’d be earning a salary of $65,000 per year. However, when I check my pay stub on the HR portal, it shows that I’m classified as an hourly employee at $31 per hour. I’m having trouble figuring out if the math aligns with my salary expectations or if there might be some discrepancies.

Additionally, there’s a $750 deduction listed under ""Cell Phone"" on my paystub. I don’t receive a company-issued phone and am required to use my personal phone for work purposes, so I’m not sure why this charge is applied.

Also, my boss has mentioned on slower days that I’m expected to stay until 5:30 pm. For context, I work in property management.

Has anyone else experienced something similar or have any insights on these issues? I’d really appreciate any feedback or advice.

1gvbl5a,Does 1 YOE help/thoughts on career pivot ,"I’ve recently secured a full-time software engineering job with a $98k base salary and a $20k bonus. I’m incredibly grateful for this opportunity, especially in the current market, but I can’t help but feel uneasy.

I’ve applied to hundreds of other positions and barely heard back. It’s been a long and exhausting process, which makes me wonder:

Will it be significantly easier to find a new SWE job after gaining 1 year of experience (1 YOE)?

Or will the tech market always be this difficult to navigate?

I’ve always considered medicine as an alternative career path. I’m 22, so it’s not too late to pivot if needed, but I also recognize the intensity and commitment required to go down that road.

For those who’ve been in the industry longer, how much does 1 YOE change the game? Is the job search grind just as hard after that? And for anyone who’s made a switch to or from medicine, how did you decide what was right for you?

1gv8plq,Are there any industries left that a graduate degree actually results in a job? ,"I want to go back to school for my Masters or Ph.D but it seems like all of my fields of interest have reached or passed saturation.  Google only gives me lists of fields that I know for a fact are struggling. I’m hoping to find a new area of interest that I hadn’t considered/maybe hadn’t even known about. 

I don’t want to spend a ton of money and time just to end up sifting through job offers that want grad degrees but pay $11/hour. In my adulthood, I’ve watch the jobs become oversaturated for people with bachelors in English, psychology, business, etc. I have friends struggling to find work with MBAs and MS in Clinical Psychology. I see talk of oversaturation from recent law school grads.

1gv5gjg,Feeling isolated at work,"A little under a year ago I started working at a regional office of a midsized company that does urban planning and engineering. When I started, the office had three people including me. Long story short, one coworker left the office to work elsewhere within the company, and the other one is frequently on work travel or in meetings.

Basically, I’m feeling a little isolated. I don’t really have anyone in my office who I can relate to and regularly interact with anymore. The rest of my core team is based in other cities, and we often interact on Zoom, but it’s just not the same. I’ll always be a little bit of an outsider compared to the rest of the group that works closely together in other cities. I fear that this dynamic is also going to limit my professional development opportunities over the long run.

I’ve heard they might post a new job listing in my division soon, and the job could be based in my office, though it feels more likely it would be based somewhere else.

1gv41j7,My boss doesn’t like me on a personal level - and I can’t quit.,"Not a native english speaker, sorry ifthe writing’s dull.

I (F30) work in publishing. A year ago I started a new job in this new, young publishing company, and I was strongly recommended by one of the bosses, who I had previously interned for in another company.

He used to be nice, although (i don’t know how many of you know how that work environment is) publishing is pretty toxic and he has a lot of those characteristics.

At first, actually, we had to talk a bit about his behaviour with me because he would try to flirt and make comments, but I made it clear that I was a bit unconfortable with it and he stopped. We were still friendly and we even travelled together for work and everything was fine.

(Mind that we work in a very small and informal office, we are all very friendly and we hang out a lot.)

Lately, I started to feel like something was off. He always has very high and unrealistic expectations, and I do my best but he always makes me feel like I’m not doing enough.

He also makes me feel excluded, especially when we are left at the office with two of our colleagues (one is his best friend, and I actually had a chat with her about this issue) and the other is an ex intern who he became really close with, I think he consider him one of his close friends too. They have a group chat and they’d giggle about things while I’m in the same room with them, meanwhile he became increasingly impatient with me and dismissive about everything I say.

I decided to confront him, because my job and his depend a lot on each other, so I asked him, since we have to work together, to tell me if there is any issue with me, because I woukd do the same if I had any problem.

He said no, everything is fine, and told me he is just stressed and he’s sorry I got that impression.

Now I feel like nothing changed, I’m struggling with mental health issues (anxiety, grief, depression), I really don’t want to think about that too.

Everyone else is really nice and really happy with me, but for some reason this makes me really anxious. In addition, I’m not in the position of changing jobs right now. I feel trapped. And the worst part is that I feel that he doesn’t like me on a personal level, and I shouldn’t care, but we spend so much time together and it makes it impossible to make me confortable.

How can I co-exist with someone like that?

1gv3yil,Hiring Friend,"I am a specialist on a team that has an open role. I recommended my friend and they made it through to the final candidate list but there’s apparently apprehension from people above me in hiring my friend due to it being a “conflict of interest.” Am I being overly sensitive to think this is a little…. Ridiculous? 

Just to say it, we would be essentially the same level. I would be training them but there’s no power dynamic… it would be as co-workers. I’ve always been the top performer on my team, so no signs that it would affect my work. If anything, if they’re hired I would be more invested because I want them to succeed. I was a part of interviews but have said that I will not give feedback on my friend, I told everyone up front this was someone I knew and was close to, and at the end of the day I am not the one making hiring decisions.

I’m confused why they would even let my friend interview if they felt this way. They haven’t made final decisions yet, so they could still be hired which is the main reason I’m not overly upset. I guess I’m just confused by the reasoning. I’ve never considered something like this a conflict of interests.

I’m soon to finish grad school and wound up in a position where I had to very quickly find a job. I interviewed at a place about a month and a half ago, and while I was waiting to hear back from other companies, they unexpectedly gave me an exploding offer that would require me to relocate. They didn’t seem open to pushing the deadline by more than a week, and I didn’t have any other options, so I signed. My start date won’t be until next March.

Since then, my husband got a more lucrative job that requires him to stay where we currently live, and almost at the same time, another offer in our current city landed in my lap from interviews I had a while ago (before I signed the first offer). We can’t financially afford to split our lives between two cities, and his family is also local, so the most logical option for me seems to be to renege on the first offer and take the second. 

I’ve gotten this exact advice from several friends and professional contacts already, but I hate the idea of reneging because it’s burning an early-career bridge in a field that isn’t that big to begin with.

1gv2b61,Transition from corporate recruiting to public sector HR? ,"I've been in biotech recruiting for 5 years and I've moved up the corporate ladder quickly. Added a few professional certifications and have been doing well. My salary has increased ~50% in the last 3-4 years. 

I am not ambitious. Honestly, I've always just wanted a comfortable low stress life. I'm married with a young son, we own a house, and have a comfortable mortgage. I would be more than happy with stability and low stress, as long as I don't need to worry about finances. 

After the layoffs started and recruiting got hit hard, I started plotting out a long term pivot to public sector HR for the benefits and stability. I wasn't planning on transitioning just yet, but I saw a job opening at a local college that is walking distance from my house while I was on paternity leave, applied, and now it's looking highly likely that I'm going to get an offer. I'm struggling with what to do. 

It would be roughly a 10% decrease in pay but better benefits and on-site childcare. This is a campus I already walk around at almost every day just while getting my steps in. I'm now struggling with the idea of shortchanging myself though. I'm not ambitious but I know I'm capable of more. I applied for a handful of jobs during my leave and another city made me an offer that I turned down due to the commute. 

The fact that I'm getting two offers after applying for 5 jobs after not putting in any applications for the last 3 years makes me think I'm capable of more. My industry is very volatile though, with companies constantly getting acquired and there being layoffs. I could be out of work in a year or two, or I could very easily get promoted during the merit review early next year, get another 9% increase, and then parlay that into an even higher paying job in 2025 or 2026. 

I'm struggling wondering if I'm being selfish and if I'd regret not making the move. A few years ago, I would've killed for the offer I'm anticipating. Now I'm wondering if I should be pursuing big career jumps or looking for long term stability. My previous supervisor has a better resume than me and he's been out of work for well over a year after getting laid off. I'd never forgive myself if I turned the safe job down then found myself in that position. 

Any input? Is public sector the way to go? Is HR safer than recruiting long term? ",SkiMaskAndA45,1,1.0,1,1732036400,2024-11-19 17:13:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gv2b61/transition_from_corporate_recruiting_to_public/,11,2024
1gv1t10,How would you respond to being called out in an all staff meeting? ,"Hi! I need some help responding in a professional way. 

This afternoon we had a all staff town hall meeting, there was approximately 150 people on a zoom call. Someone from another team raised that they are getting questions via email related to my area of work and it was causing them a headache. Her director jumped in to say it's inappropriate and unfair and that they've been blindsided by additional work (it was one email chain 🙄) and that I need to find new ways of working. 

However, the email chain they are talking about I was copied into and redirected the person three times in the thread. The member of staff who raised this ignored my responses and kept on engaging. The director also had sight of the paper and funding request the person was talking about before the work kicked off and the same team was asked to comment on the paper before it went to the board for approval. So plenty of time to raise concerns. It's also one person who seems to be confused about the main point of contact and it's not actually generating any work other than email responses which shouldn't be happening anyway.

I wasn't given the opportunity to correct in the meeting and the directors have set up a meeting to discuss. I haven't been invited.

It's much more of their habit, and they like to talk and manage rather than do the tasks themselves, which take only a few minutes to do.

1gv0da8,Need help talking through some options,"Thank you in advance to all who comment. 

I’ve been looking for a job for several months and things are looking up finally. Currently, I have 2 final round interviews in the next week as well as a somewhat flimsy offer in hand. I need some advice on how to proceed, especially if either of the final interviews lead to an offer. 

I’ll start with the flimsy offer. This is with an appliance company based in Florida (I live in Florida w/ parents right now for context). I first interviewed with them pre-hurricanes for an Operation Coordinator role. In my conversations I was of the understanding I would’ve started by 1st or 2nd week of November, however, the hurricanes delayed the opening of both new locations. I’ve finally heard an update from them stating that the 2nd location (where I would be based) is scheduled to open in late January latest & that they “would like to know my schedule and when we could get you on board- thinking December 16th.” Those were the words from the email. We had discussed pay and other details previously, but I’m unsure if there’s a solid number that’s been decided. For this role, I would need to move closer to the location as the commute is too much from my parents. 

First final round interview is with a logistics company as a logistics coordinator. Essentially, the role is sales support for a logistics account executive. I’m not super excited by this option, but I’ve been saying yes to just about anything. Pay here is $21/hr plus a 0.5% commission of the account executives book of business. The person I would partner with has just under 1 million in his book, so that’s an extra $5k as far as I understand. 

Finally, the other interview is with a Real Estate Investment Trust as an inventory specialist. I really liked the guy who would be my manager during my last interview, we seemed to click very well. This job, as I was told by the recruiter, will be paid hourly, and that the last person in the role was making $55k/yr. I assume I will start around that number so let’s say $26/hr. 

My main questions or points of guidance are 
1) what do I say to the appliance company to get them to give me a bit more time and to get a concrete offer letter? 
2) what do I do if either of the final round interviews offer me the job and give me a short window to respond? 
3) how do I value the different roles in terms of career long growth? 

Thank you again, I’m just feeling somewhat overwhelmed with all this after so long of searching and could use some sounding board assistance with making my decisions.

1gv02f9,Fired by my bestfriend,"I’m 22 (F) and I got let go of my Job of 7 years yesterday. I’m conflicted on what I should do about it. 

My bosses are a couple, The girl boss i will call Summer she’s 29 and her husband is 34. 
I feel like the age difference is important, and the business I work for isn’t exactly legit. We’ve been in the marijuana industry for years and I started under the age and also get paid under the table.  
Things have been slow for us the last 2 weeks and have been waiting on new packaging to land and yesterday I was supposed to be on standby, which I knew that but I hadn’t heard anything and it was in the middle of the day so I asked if I was going to be coming in to the office today since my sister invited me to go to the mountains, and that made Summer mad. 
That my priorities lie elsewhere and if I knew to be on standby then to be available. 
She came at me pretty abrasive for asking and told me not to come in so I didn’t. 
We continued to go back and forth and ultimately she told me that they are going to let me go. 

Outside of work we’re best friends and have gone on many vacations, I was even a bridesmaid in their wedding. She also had my location so she gets upset if I’m out late on a night I have work the next day, and controls who I am friends with. I’ve allowed them to have so much control over my emotions, and I’m so emotionally invested in this job just because of our friendship. I feel at a loss and I did try to fight for my job but she felt like I didn’t try hard enough and even though she told me not to come in that I should have gone in anyways. 

It’s not like I can go to HR or any other coworkers because it’s literally just the 3 of us that work for this company that they built. I told them if I had better communication about when we will be working and what time to be in the office that most of the misunderstandings between us could be avoided. I only have stayed working for them for so long because of the friendship, but as bosses they aren’t very good, because they don’t pay me on time. They still owe me my paycheck from the 5th of the month. 

I know they are working today and she’s still sharing her location with me and I don’t know if I should text again and ask her if they need me. I guess that’s what I don’t know what to do about. My parents think I should just let this job go and figure out my own hopes and dreams but it’s so hard to just walk away. It’s almost like leaving an abusive relationship that you can’t get out of.

1guxj9b,Coworker I’ve never met made borderline inappropriate comments? Not sure how to resolve.,"Hi all. I’m a 27F working in the construction industry within supply chain. I am relatively new to the company with about 4 months under my belt. 
For some background I buy things for construction sites around the country that my company supports, I work in direct coordination with the on site, SM, PM & civil/mechanical superintendents. 
One of my superintendents has been super helpful with my work so far, usually he knows what’s happening and can give me answers and if he can’t, he will absolutely get me results so I can keep doing my job well, more than my SM or PM most of the time. 

Lately, when I call him he’s been super funny/flirty almost so my red flags started to go up, but nothing to the point of unprofessional. 
I spoke with my boyfriend about it and he said to not do anything because we have to assume this is him acting professional the best way he knows how. 

Well, yesterday, upon calling him regarding a safety related issue - he answers the phone saying “hold on everyone it’s my girlfriend calling” which threw me super off guard, I avoided it and just proceeded to discuss what I needed to. When I told him I called him because he knows what’s happening on site most of the time he proceeds to say “that’s a great compliment but I would’ve preferred handsome”…. And I’m at a point now where I’m unsure how to approach? Oh by the way I’ve never met this person in real life, he is in a different state entirely but I will have to eventually visit. 

What would you do if you were in my situation? 

- text him or email him and remind him to remain professional and that the girlfriend comment was out of line? Risk him retaliating and have no evidence for hr if it ever gets to a harassment point 

- record my calls with him, with my other phone in the meantime? And not say anything to the guy hoping he got the message that that crossed a boundary? 

- tell my manager in an off the record situation and keep track? 

I’m afraid because I’m new I don’t want to get HR involved unless it becomes a harassment case and I have proof - I don’t want to lose my job because a tenured superintendent can’t control his other head.

1gux7a8,How's the Private Sector Job Market?,"I'm an administrator at a private high school, I've been here 10+ years but there has been a revolving door of leadership since Covid and a 50% turnover rate in the faculty during that timespan due to poor pay and frustrating working conditions.

1guvv5v,Should I look for other jobs or stay a year,"Hi, I (24F) am working in my industry of choice, in a really place that manufactures traditionally crafted products (don’t want to give too much info in case..). However managment is terrible and a lot of my colleagues have left. 

Terrible organisation is leading to me and my teammate having a crazy workload and making up for some people’s lack of competence (this isn’t me being petty, there’s another team that passes the orders onto us that leaves a lot of mistakes that we have to make up for, bad timing that leads to rush, etc…). 

Manager is also just unprofessional, not listening to our team’s grievances and prioritizing the sales peoples. As well as putting pressure on me while I was sick for me to come and work, just using guilt tripping and implying that others were coming despite being sick.

I am aware that the company relies way to much on me and my teammate without giving us much recognition. 
When I got the job, it was a blessing because I was living in a shitty flat with terrible flatmates, and had to rely on my gandparen’ts help because I was working hourly paid jobs. 
I really don’t want to be in a position where I’m asking them for money again as they have their own health troubles on their minds (they are quite wealthy so its not too much about money but more that I don’t like to make them feel like Im unable to get stuff done myself)

I am quite friends with a former colleague, who’s a bit of a dad to me, who has worked in this industry for a long time and is pretty sure that the company is going to be bankrupt soon, from losing costumers and stock due to fuckups. 
The thing is, I’ve only been there for 8 months, and rent is a bit crazy. I wanted to stay for a year so that it doesn’t look weird on my CV, but my teammate told me that he will quit soon and that he’s only staying there because we get along. I’ve been applying for other jobs as well, but I’m not sure what is the best thing to do, April is the tax year month so if the company closes, it will be during that time. Do you guys have any advice on what to do? Should I stick it out until April or just try to leave now?",klxslyy,3,1.0,4,1732018897,2024-11-19 12:21:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1guvv5v/should_i_look_for_other_jobs_or_stay_a_year/,11,2024

1guu968,It's getting overwhelming...,"I work as a travel agent in the on-the-spot complaint department of an online travel agency....It's certainly a stressful one; however, I got used to the workload and I do like the ""making someone's dream vacation better"" aspect.

Recently, they brought in this new guy to be my back up, in case I'm absent or when the workload becomes unmanageable.

Of course, I had to assist him in the beginning. I genuinely showed him everything I knew, so that he can maximize his performance, as our salaries rely a lot on our performance....

Fast forward, this guy starts stealing my cases and taking credit for them...He leaves his own files and goes to mine to show off and prove that he is ""better"".....The funny part....It's working, as even the manager now no longer sends me anything to work on and doesn't even tag me when he shares the day's tasks....

It's getting overwhelming to a point where I'm considering quitting...because even the manager is on his side. I have already complained about what he was doing, yet it seems to only be getting worse...I'm 3 years his senior....yet I was pushed to the side with no prior notice, and he suddenly became the main agent in this department. Also, even though he steals my cases, I still score better than him...and that's the irony of all of this...on the top of the fact that I speak more languages than he does.

I followed my boss to my company and while she has my back, my workload is unbearable. I’m managing multiple pieces of business with zero team under me. Some of this business is with another leader at my company so my boss has zero jurisdiction. After speaking up I got a very junior person and one more person I need to onboard. I’m leading internal and clients meetings, and driving the work, have no time to think.

I’m so angry and it’s affecting all aspects of my life- snapping at my kids, no desire to do anything.

I secretly wish I’d get laid off (my company is notorious for annual layoffs), have been applying to jobs for months (but don’t want to stay in my industry and not sure what to do next).  

What keeps me from rage quitting is my responsibility to my family - I earn more than half our income and I carry all my kids health and dental insurance.

Every day I look at the next day’s calendar and it’s daunting with multiple meetings that I need to lead, with zero time to plan or process info. I can’t think straight and cry a lot.

I’ve never been unemployed since graduating college - in fact, stupid me has never taken time off between jobs (other than a weekend between leaving old job and starting new job).

1gut6eb,Free Advice from Someone Who’s Been Around the Block (Even if I’m Still Young) ,"Hey everyone, I just wanted to share some insights I’ve picked up from my time in corporate jobs, startups, and just generally observing life. Take it as free advice, or don’t—it’s your call. But here’s what I’ve learned:

1. Peace, Family, and Health > Your Job
At the end of the day, it’s just a job. No matter how much you stress or how well you perform, that appraisal might not even reflect your effort. So, chill out. Even your CEO doesn’t stress this much, so why should you? Protect your peace, spend time with loved ones, and prioritize your health.

2. Job vs. Financial Freedom
If your goal is true financial freedom (aka not having to sell your time to earn money), a job probably won’t get you there—no matter how much you invest in stocks or ETFs. Jobs are great for stability and security, and if your plan is to stay in a role for 20-30 years and retire comfortably, that’s awesome. But if you’re aiming for freedom earlier in life, entrepreneurship is your best bet. Just know that it requires a lot of effort, creativity, and strategy—and it’s not for everyone.

3. Do What You Love
The dream is to find something that doesn’t feel like “work.” Whether that’s a job, a business, or a creative project, it should feel fun and exciting—something you’d do even if you weren’t getting paid for it.

4. Don’t Take Life Too Seriously
Life is unpredictable, and taking it too seriously often leads to stress and burnout. That’s how you end up becoming the toxic boss you swore you’d never be. Relax, let life unfold, and see where it takes you.

If this resonates with you or if you’ve got more points to add, feel free to share your thoughts below. Let’s make this a conversation!

1gus88w,Girl that I'm into has a new job at Primerica,"We talked on the phone a couple of days ago but conversation got extremely heated and she ended up semi-blocking me (blocked my phone number but kept me on other messaging apps). I didn't think much but she told me and our conversation goes something along the lines of her saying ""I want a job that will last. Forever."" I tell her that those jobs don't exist anymore (at least in most cases) and that if she wants to progress she's going to likely have to job hop down the line. She then tells me that she understands that, but ""I'm young so I have the leverage because they are willing to take me and teach me if I work hard. So I'm here for the skillsets and not for the money. And I hope you do the same."" She was referring to me personally because I keep talking about money as a guy lol (still in college).

I was thinking she was getting a banking job (but she didn't go much into detail) she just simply stated that she was applying to a banking positions that were open but didn't go into specifics because she's okay with talking to me but I guess she feels a little distant from me because she found me frustrating to talk to. (RIP). She also has a degree in mathematics so I was also assuming maybe she was getting into a quant maybe down the line. For a week now i was thinking maybe she just wants to get into finance because she didn't really know what she wanted to do with her life (and that's where a lot of our arguing came from rip even when I tried to support her with my words 😭). She messaged me a couple of days later saying that she got the job but literally said that and NOTHING specific.

I stalked her fresh instagram account. She follows 2 people that work for this company called PFS Investments. Okay, sounds cool, so she's trying to get into probably becoming a financial advisor of some sort. Cool. But then after clicking on those profiles something just felt like, off? Like they're just posting their lifestyle and motivational quotes and honestly they have nothing to do with finance. And their stories and just about them working out a 5am in the morning and making a banana smoothie for breakfast. One of the profiles has a link to their main YT channel that. I find both some videos with their names with them giving speeches to a group of students (I mean idk what they are called). But the videos themselves are .... repetitive? Like one of the women she follows keeps talking about ""expanding your network"" and ""recruiting more people"". Okay that seems like a good thing to be comfortable doing. I mean who doesn't want to make new connections because that leads to better opportunities in life right? The dude she follows keeps talking like he found some motivational quotes online, used ChatGPT to rephrase them and made 12-minute compilation of morale of nonsense. Like he was speaking English but using another languages way of describing things. Honestly at this point I felt super off.

Then I look up PSF investments and find out that it's actual name is Primerica. So here I am in this subreddit, not knowing what an MLM is. But now I kind of do know. Apparently the general consensus is that it's a scam. I don't want to believe it. But I mean this girl has gone through some shit. And I mean some terrible shit in life. So she was probably easily targeted. Then the words made sense. ""they are willing to take me and teach me if I work hard."" So idk if that day she was referring to her getting the job at Primerica all along.

Maybe I'm overthinking this because she did tell me like I said earlier that she's not looking for a job that pays a lot but rather a job that can teach her something so that she can apply down the line. So maybe she's just joining them to build connections? Maybe she knows it's a scam but she's just joining them knowing it's a scam so that she can meet new people? Maybe she's thinking strategically and playing the long game and will ditch them and use whatever she learns there so that she can put it on her resume and get a better job?

Honestly, I want to warn her about this company, but she's semi-blocked me. And tbh I don't think she's stupid so if I message her saying she should leave without knowing her true motive for joining, I could piss her off even more. I don't want to strain our ""situationship"" even further..... wth do I do?????",sst2119,0,0.2199999988079071,4,1732003295,2024-11-19 08:01:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gus88w/girl_that_im_into_has_a_new_job_at_primerica/,11,2024
1gus35n,Job that laid me off wants me back…,"I was laid off from my job about 5/6 months ago, which was heartbreaking as I absolutely loved it. I’d only been with the company for 6 months so it was a ‘last in, first out’ situation. Both myself and my boss cried during the meeting when he told me I had to go. 

For further reference, I’m autistic. So the job hunt and finding a corporate environment that was suitable for myself and my needs like that job was has proven to be extremely difficult. At that job, a lot of others in my team were neurotypical as well so it truly felt like I belonged. However, I know the cut-throatness of the corporate world doesn’t care about any of this. 

Anyway, I worked with a team of 2 (myself and one other guy). I received a message from the other person stating they’d handed in their notice and would be leaving by the new year. They had mentioned because this would leave them with no one on that team anymore, they’re considering asking myself back. However this time, I’d be doing the job of two…

Would you go back? Am I a fool to return? I’m just so exhausted with the job market and trying to find somewhere I fit in…

1gurfct,"Got a pretty good offer, got an interview at a company I'd frankly rather work for but for a lesser position. How to approach?","I am really struggling with how to approach an interview where I kind of need to ask for more?

I've got a conditional offer at a job delivering chips for $64,000 a year. 50 hours a week, limited time off, extremely random and odd hours. 

I've got an interview for inside sales rep at Yelp. It's 37k a year base, plus commission. Target around 50k-65k. 

Frankly, I applied to two jobs at yelp, the other was a strategic account sales Representative.

 The delivering chips job I've got a conditional offer from is obviously a step up in salary from the entry level inside sales rep job I've got an interview for, but a step down from the strategic account sales rep (65k base, plus bonuses) I also applied for. Frankly, that strategic account sales rep job is what I'd actually love to get, it involves sales to the restaurant industry which I've got experience in and am a bit more passionate about and think I'd do better in.

I'm trying to decide... How do I approach this interview? I'm tempted to play out the interview and then at the end if I've felt it has gone well be frank and explain the situation. Ideally trying to push for the higher end position at Yelp if possible. Is that fair to do?

I would rather be at Yelp which offers the better hours. I don't hate the other job, and a 37k base plus commission that's much more variable and has less of a chance of meeting that salary... Hard sell.

The other problem though is I think the Yelp job, even the entry level inside sales rep, probably has more appeal to other companies and looks better on the resume.

1guqb8z,Last Semester of College & I need advice!,"So I’m in my last semester of college and I need some career advice/ideas!!  Sorry in advance for the long post 😅. 

So background, let me start off by saying, this would be my second degree. I have a BA in Business Management with a concentration in Music Business. This second degree is due to me being bored 😭. So instead of me finding a hobby, I decided to be a glutton for punishment and go back to school (don’t judge me). 

I am what one would call a “nontraditional student.” I work full time and I am a full time student. I am majoring in Media and Communications and volunteer as the school’s music director for its syndicated radio station. I am also interning at the station for the professor/station manager who happens to be one of the best professors I’ve ever had the pleasure of having. 

Anywhoooo….I thoroughly enjoy interning there and working with the professor. At the beginning of the semester I KNEW I wanted to work in radio, writing & recording promo scripts, live reads and liners as a career…  I just knew it. But after having the opportunity to work as the music director, I realized that maybe I want to do more than just write and record scripts and what not for radio stations. My professor believes I can do more too, so he’s been training me the last few months on the ins and outs of radio stations music department (he’s pretty known in NY’s talk/news radio).

I’ve been working with labels (both major and independent), booking artists interviews and getting new music to be played on our station. I pretty much get college credit to listen to music and book talent for interviews. A dream come true honestly. 

So this is where I need help. I am meeting with my professor later this week to update my resume and talk about career options. BUT he wants me to give him 10… not 3 or 5 but 10 careers of my choosing, it doesn’t have to be in radio but something…..and I got nothing 😭. 

I don’t know what to do. It’s not like I can just pick 10 career options off the top of my brain. It’s funny…but like not at the same time. I don’t even know where to start 😭. Help! The pressure is getting to me lol. 

Ps: I realized there’s probably a lot of information you all probably didn’t care to know. But that’s kinda my thing when I’m nervous. I tend to “over inform” when I’m nervous. I’m working on that with my therapist 😅.

1gupzca,Post Graduation First Job Situation,"Hey, so I am in a situation with my first ever post college position, and I need some guidance. For background, I recently graduated this past spring with my degree in electrical engineering. I accepted an offer from a defense contractor, and unfortunately the security clearance did not go smoothly and I was just granted my clearance today. Roughly a 6 months investigation period. However during that time, I still chose to apply to different positions and I am in the interview process now for a couple positions. Couple of these positions are better suited for my career paths and my interest of what field of engineering I want to be in. 

My current defense contractor employer reached out, and asked to set a start date, but due to my relocation assistance, the company claims the start date should set based on a 4-6 week timeframe that will be needed for the professional moving company they use for my relocation. Based on that timeline and where we are in the year, it makes sense to start early next year. 

So my issue, is that the other positions that I am interviewing for is better aligned with my career goals, a significant increase in salary, and potentially better location of job. If I get the offer I would like to take it, but at the same time the decision realistically will not come out for at least another 2-3 weeks. But I cannot exactly withdraw from the position and gamble on the fact that I will get another offer. Would it be a good idea to go through with setting a start date early January of next year to give myself some time, and if I get an offer, withdraw from the position? Would it look bad to pull out very close to the set starting date? Would it possible that the defense company would never consider hiring me in the future because of this?",db1227,1,1.0,0,1731993964,2024-11-19 05:26:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gupzca/post_graduation_first_job_situation/,11,2024

Obviously because my coworker was an outside hire he got paid more, but it's so unfair that I should be paid less just because I started at this company. The experience my coworker had was not useful in our job at all and we have both essentially learned at the same pace and do the exact same job despite him being a senior. I think I do our job better and am taking lead on most projects or having to clean up his mistakes. 

I want to have a discussion about this with my boss, but how can I convince him to pay me what he paid my coworker. I know people say to not mention what your peers make but I think it's just so ridiculous. What should I do? I love working here and don't want to change jobs, but if they don't pay me fairly I will have to.

1guookp,Should I resign or is my ego just bruised,"I work for a family business, and have been there for over 8 years in various roles. 12 months ago I was offered a great promotion which has made me the head of my department. 

Now for context, this is a highly recognised well established global business, so it's certainly no small ma & pa operation.

3 weeks ago, the owner of the business told me pulled me into a meeting with the CEO, and another Senior manager, who is company owners nephew.

The owner of the company said:

""You haven't done anything wrong, there hasn't been one complaint, everyone loves the work you're doing and everything is performing better than ever...I just prefer to work with my nephew"" and went on to repeat multiple times ""it's not you, it's me""

In this meeting, the company owner and his nephew went to outline how the nephew would be taking a good majority of my job role and that this had been decided. 

There was no HR in the meeting, and I felt completely blindsided. 

4 days following the meeting, I wrote an email to all that were in the meeting and included HR. Noting what was discussed and asking for the new job role to be shared with me so that I could prepare a handover document for the nephew. 

The response from the company owner was:

""emails are not the place for this sort of discussion, let’s all chat in a positive way forward.

Things brought up were my perspective only, happy to speak in depth about why I think it has always been so important to share the roles."" 

Following this, I have then been brought into another meeting with the CEO, the nephew and HR to say 

""Your job role doesn't change at all, you now just need to go through the nephew for any questions directed to the company owner and the nephew will then relay to you the decision from the owner""

For context, the nephew was previously in my current role, but was removed because he was incompetent, lost the company a lot of money and put them at risk with multiple decisions he had made on the companies behalf.  He is terrible at communicating and 1 week into this new 'process' I'm feeling increasingly frustrated by the lack of efficiency and his inability. 

The company owner suffers bio polar & depression, so he can often act in unexpected ways.

So should I resign knowing that there is no chance for me to continue to grow given that no matter how well I perform, it won't make a difference because I'm not family. Or am I just feeling like my ego has taken a hit because and I need to ride it out.

TL/DR: Now know after 8 years of working for a family business that I don't have any opportunities of growth because I'm not directly related or married to anyone in the family, even though my performance far outweighs anyone's in the family.

1gunu8c,"Funded research position ending soon, where to take my skills? ","Hi all, 

I graduated from a tribal school in the United States with a BFA in Creative Writing within the past year - my final year of which was done remotely. I am published and have won a few awards for fiction, but the pay from this is not nearly enough to pay the bills. I have a fiancée and dogs and cannot afford to be a starving artist.   
  
During the final year of my program and into the present, I have worked as a researcher at a large public research university in a lab focusing on the ecology of infectious diseases. I was originally hired for communications, but due to more than a decade of experience in programming (open source contributor, hobbyist mostly), I quickly assumed the role of a lab technician. I perform 'data science' tasks, employing various modeling techniques (gradient boosting tends to be my silver bullet). I have been performing these tasks for the better part of a year, despite my official title not having been changed, and I am quite good at it. 

My funding will end at the end of the fiscal year. My boss has asked me to become his graduate student. Though I have enjoyed this work and have learned a great deal (a lot of legwork on my part, as I had no formal background in ecology prior to this), it's not something I see myself pursuing a PhD in. He also expressed to me that though he would like to continue working with me, if this is not something I wish to pursue, he will write me a glowing letter of recommendation. Additionally, I will have a handful of peer reviewed publications with various collaborators before my tenure here is done.

I have long planned to to pursue a JD. Based on my GPA, background in grassroots language revitalization within my tribe, and LSAT practice scores, I think I will be a compelling candidate to the schools I am interested in. That said, there will be a significant gap (>1 year) between the end of my funding and starting law school if all goes well, as I will be applying next October, and I will need something to pay the bills between now and then. 

I've been interested in Information Security since I was young and have a strong foundation in linux fundamentals and networks. I am considering acquiring the OSCP or CPTS certifications over the next few months in order to make my resume more competitive in that field. I already possess the CompTIA Security+ certification. 

Does that idea make any sense at all? I feel like I'm torn in too many directions. Any advice y'all might have would be greatly appreciated.

1guml0p,Is it better to work a simple job or a more intense one? Assuming everything else is even,"The job I work now is a hellscape of extreme alpha males that are constantly fighting. We step on each others toes to no end and are all convinced we are right. My worklife balance is nil, we work holidays, weekends, miss important family events, even if you are scheduled off you still get calls from the others on the project because its what we all do. Tempers flare pretty much all the time as each member needs to be in charge of everything. One would say we must not be an effective team but we do incredible things. The proof comes at the end of the project when we all stand back in awe. 

In a moment of anger when a recruiter called me I picked up and was basically insta granted an interview. Now I'm staring down the barrel of an easy job. A simple job where I would get to go home at a reasonable hour, work from home, have a routine, be able to start a family. 

And I'm stuck. I've taken the easy road before, I've worked for normal companies in the past. Its a good life but unfulfilling I know this because I've left many good jobs before. Speaking with the team at the new job I do more in a month then they do in a year. I solve more complex problems weekly then they solve in their entire career. Maybe its the Stockholm syndrome talking but I don't think I can take the jump back to normal. Please convince me to take the easy path before I rot away as a workaholic and missout on an entire life.

I will be working 10hrs 4days/week.

1guloiu,9-5 Life Is Making Me Hopeless (22M),"I recently moved far away from my family after graduating college to work for a big corporation with more than enough entry-level pay to me (mid-60s). I saw it as a great opportunity for personal growth. But, it has been one of the worst periods of my life. I am not very career driven yet feel like the job/industry I am in almost requires you to build your life and personality around work to a greater extent than others.

While I have had a tough time being alone in a big city, it almost feels like even if I had friends and a community and stuff, I wouldn't care. This life feels so myopic and lacking of hope and spontaneity. I feel myself becoming a much worse person since I moved here. Just more apathetic, anxious, and unsociable. I lost most interest/hope in hobbies and creative pursuits and the community building my life was so enriched by in college. I feel pangs of shame and guilt every time I wake up and every moment for one of two reasons: Either I am being a cry-baby for complaining about a position most people would kill to be in, or on the other side of the coin for continuing to trudge through this path I have no aspiration for.

If I got promoted I wouldn't even care. More money wouldn't make me happier. If I had a spouse and a family or something that I was motivated to provide for then it would be different, for better or for worse. At least I would have motivation to keep waking up and putting myself through this every day. If you told me this is how it was going to be for the rest of it, I would not see the point. Time has passed so quickly in this lifestyle with nothing happening. It's like I am cursing time and throwing this life away and it's becoming harder every day to forgive myself for that.

Sorry if this post sounds ungrateful and/or like something that you read on here every day. Or if I didn't articulate this well enough to be authentic to my real feelings or give enough context. Just putting it out there somewhere because I got no one I feel comfortable talking about it to in real life. I would appreciate anyone's stories, advice, or thoughts if this resonates with you.

1guks2o,"Might be getting fired, is there anything I can do?","TL;DR - New job, new field, new business. Haven't ramped up fast enough and messed up a few time. Asked if I am still welcome and boss told me there is an internal discussion on what the next step is. He left the door open for me to ask more questions/discuss anything. Just wondering what can I do?



Long post but if you'd like context: 



I started a new job 7 months ago in corporate finance. I have worked in the field previously but still at an analyst level. Before this job, I was on a almost 2 year break where I independently consulted for a bit after a layoff. 



Current job is an a completely different industry and field. (Prev - Retail Expenses. Now - Tech Revenue). I really am/was excited about the move and the team. Unfortunately, it's taken me longer than I or the team expected for me to ramp up. Another complication to that is that my manager is extremely removed from what I do day to day and doesn't even know the definitions of some of terms I look at daily. I have been trained by another analyst (who just got promoted to manager). 



4 months in I was given a 60 day plan by my manager who said it wasn't a PIP but would be the next step if the 60 days didn't go well.



General outline of 60 day plan pieces that I didn't do to well on - 



1. Being on time to meetings/not missing (I missed my alarm and missed 2 meetings that I really needed to attend and was late a few times because I didn't get a notification/missed it/etc)



2-4. Couple of key deliverables that I needed build from scratch, complete, reviewed, and put to use on time and effectively. (They felt I wasn't effectively showing ownership in my work yet).



There were other items I did fine on. However, on these two points I did mess up. 



1. I missed another call sleeping thru it (I feel so dumb). This occured after the 60 days but it shouldn't ever happen I know.

 

2. I was in a long call (2 hours) when 30 minutes in my dog decided she absolutely had to go outside immediately (she got sick). I joined the call from my phone and took her out but the call ended early, and the SVP, CFO and few others were to stay back for a confidential discussion. I had left my laptop in the meeting and they had to kick me out, which ofcourse is a terrible look in front of the CFO and SVP. I was running back to my place from the dog park to end the call on laptop but it was already too late. Stupidly, I didn't think too much of it and didn't say anything to my manager, which is what he is upset about.



3. The deliverables I had were good, and people found them helpful. However, I was late on a bunch of things at our quarter end (quarter ends are extremely busy times). I was running the show mostly for my area, but 1 file I used to check my numbers for our big presentation was not properly setup when I originally made it at the previous quarter end (my first one) to handle exceptions. This made one of the things I was responsible for take way longer than it should, which then snowballed into a few of my deliverables being 1 day late and stressing out both the analyst training me and my manager. 



4 - Additionally, manager and other analyst left a bunch of comments in the slides of one of the presentations I was building out late one evening but I didn't respond to them till after noon the next day because I was focused on another deliverable that was more pressing. (this could have been avoided if I hadn't been delayed by the previous fuck up probably). However, my manager noted I wasn't online in the morning and didn't show urgency (I worked on the more important presentation the night before between 9-11PM and in the morning from 10-noon). 



\-----------



1 & 2 - are definitely complete fuck ups and I own that, and I know I can never let that happen again, whether I get to stay or have to find a new job.



3 - I feel like manager would have cut me some slack but was pissed when writing up the notes of what I messed up in the 60 days from the first 2 points (both happened in the same time). I really feel that the check file I made being hard to update wasn't completely my fault as we had changes in our data that I had to account for but didn't when building it for the first time. Feels like something you only understand when you see the data changing.



4 - I was literally talking to my manager the night before and sent him screenshots of me being online that morning and actively working on our main presentation. Feels like the comments are a little harsh but I don't want to argue on it. 



We had our weekly one on one, and at the end when he brought up the 60 day plan I asked if I was still welcome the team - he said they are internally discussing it but don't have an answer right now.



Is there anything I can do here? Should I try to defend myself a bit on points 3 and 4? How do I approach it? Or do I just let it sit, and wait it out? I'm definitely a goner right?",chicagoswag,0,0.33000001311302185,1,1731977623,2024-11-19 00:53:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1guks2o/might_be_getting_fired_is_there_anything_i_can_do/,11,2024
1guklxv,Over a month into new job and I hate it.,"I’m really at my breaking point here and need to vent. It's been over a month since I started my first full-time job, and I honestly hate it.

I recently lost my brother to cancer, and I thought starting this new job would be a distraction. Instead, it’s only making everything worse. The job itself isn’t terrible, but the constant lack of work leaves me alone with my thoughts. It's been slow since I started—there’s not enough work to go around, not enough stations for everyone, and I’m constantly battling boredom. When there's nothing to do, I sit there thinking about my brother—the pain he went through, how strong he was, how much I miss him, and all the things I wish I could’ve said to him. This job was supposed to distract me, but it’s only amplifying my grief.

When they were hiring, they made it sound like they were in urgent need of people, so I expected it to be busy. Instead, I’m left with nothing to do for long stretches of time. I work with confidential information, so I can’t even use my phone or browse the internet on the PC to pass the time.

The Assistant Manager walked by one time when I briefly pulled out my phone to change my music (it’s allowed as long as phones aren’t near documents). Unfortunately, when I unlocked my phone, it happened to be on my texting screen. She saw it and told me no texting, no phone. The next day, she sent me an email reminding me not to do it again, or we’d have to ""talk."" I only take my phone out briefly because I see other people doing it, but of course, I’m the one who gets caught. Typical.

Then, today, she saw me doodling since there’s literally nothing else to do again, and they won’t let us leave early or even walk around. From behind, it probably looked like I was on my phone, so she thought she’d get a chance to catch me and give me the talk. But nope, I was just doodling. She then told me I couldn’t even do that and should watch training videos instead. God forbid I try to entertain myself or get creative. Every day I’m just pretending to be busy while the hours drag by.

And more stupid rules: we can’t leave early, not even by two minutes, but she expects us to be there 15 minutes early to set up and be ready at our stations by the start time. I’m not paid for those 15 minutes. Pay me for that time, and I’ll be there to set up. And I’m physically at the office for 8 hours and 45 minutes every day, but if I’m there 15 minutes early, that’s technically 9 hours. She’s also said we can’t have more than four unexcused absences in a year, or it’s the ""talk."" Are these policies 'normal,' or am I just naïve as someone experiencing my first full-time role? I know these kinds of work environments exist, but I honestly thought they’d be less common nowadays. Is this really how it is? I know I sound young and stupid.

Im just suprise by these kind of offcie envionement because my last job had more creative tasks and was less like the stereotypical office grind. It felt more human, and I actually enjoyed what I was doing. But here, parts of the place actually remind me of The Backrooms. I left my last job because there was no room for growth, but I loved the people there (aside from a few difficult clients). I need the money now, especially to cover the costs my brother used to take care of. But this place feels like a prison.

This job is draining my mental health, and I honestly don’t know how much longer I can keep going. How do you survive?

1gukjyk,Can’t decide what career/degree,"Sorry this is a long one but I am very conflicted and sont know what to do. To preface, I have always had an interest in biology and ancient history, specifically evolution of humans. I was accepted into university for a bachelor of arts in biology and remained in that program for two years. In my second year, I took a class about the evolution of western science, which included some information about hominids. at a younger age, I wanted to be a paleo anthropologist / archaeologist, but I decided to go into biological science because I feel a need to help preserve wildlife and climate change etcetera. I transferred to a bachelor of science and have been playing a game of keep up with the missed science credits. It is my second year into it. I’m not particularly interested in my classes which is fair because of the content being chem physics math, which has had me second guessing my career choice. Now onto my current issue. Recently I have become more interested in archaeology and human evolution, and I have been thinking more and more about it. I know I would feel fulfilled because the bio related career I want would be helping the world more, and I like most of my bio classes when I took them before, but I am not thoroughly enjoying what I am doing in school right now. I have another year left because of switching to a bachelor of science and classes I need to take, so I am like four years deep. Can I even go into archaeology (and yes I know I would probably need further schooling) with a bachelor of science in biology? I have been feeling lost for like an entire year and uncertain and I don’t know what to do. I’m also taking some ancient history classes next semester because I just need more credits to graduate as I have reduced course load.

1gukh54,How to become an Engineer 6 years later?,"I got a degree in Biomedical Engineering in 2019, right before Covid.

1gujuue,Finding Fractional Roles,"So, this job market is absolute horseshit.

I have been laid off for 9 months. In that time, I’ve had over 200 networking calls (I keep a spreadsheet), more than 50 initial interviews, and about a dozen multiple interview scenarios.

At one point, I interviewed 5 different times with a company and had a tentative offer only to get a call a month later to say that the role was being delayed indefinitely.

I hired a company to rebrand me and do some outsourced networking to augment my efforts.

No dice.

I got so frustrated that I gave up and have instead begun building my own business. It’s moving, but it’s a healthcare organization and so takes a bit of set up time check various boxes in order to launch.

With all the above sob story out of the way, I have bandwidth for fractional roles.

Very specifically, I have a background in building early stage companies and am looking for fractional operational modeling, business integration, concept to delivery, or similar roles.

I routinely look at LinkedIn for such positions and they are scarce. Most of what I see on Y Combinator are engineering roles. I have some technical background, but dev ops is not my strength. And “fractional” on sites like Indeed means “delivery driver.”

Has anyone here had any success landing fractional positions, and if so I’d love to figure out what stones I’m not turning.

1guju75,If you were offered a voluntary resignation opportunity would you do it? ,"My company is offering an opportunity for people to volunteer to leave and get a package. Based on how many years you've worked there they are offering up to a year's salary. They've announced it but I haven't seen the full information yet as they are launching it in a couple of weeks. 

I'm seriously considering it because, frankly, I've been through this before! 

In 2006 I worked for a company that was significantly downsizing and at the time I was a working mother of two kids, one was headed to university the following year and I frankly could not afford to be fired or to leave my job. Either way people were being let go all around me and all I was getting was more work. More work for no more pay. 

I did look around for a new job because I could see the writing on the wall and wanted to leave on my own terms. 

But here I am 18 years later and I'm in my early 60's not ready to retire financially but I am really REALLY tired of work. I'm also in a position that could be cut due to financial constraints; others around me are being let go.  

Someone I work with said it would be better if I waited and let them fire me as I'd get a better package. But based on my experience, I won't be the one they let go! I'll just get more work for no more money!  I'm seriously considering this package deal.  I need to wait and see if it's truly a good deal or not but if you had this chance would you do it? 

If I were to take the money, I'd take a brief break because I'm exhausted and then I'd put myself out there for short term contracts as an independent contractor (I'm in project management).  Any thoughts or insight from people who did this?

1gujqnn,When should I quit my job,"
I accepted a new job two weeks ago that I’m SO excited for. My start date is the last week of January. 

In a perfect world, I would quit two weeks before Christmas with my year end bonus already account for, but unfortunately this timeline does not exist. 

My current job is stingy when it comes to time off around the Holidays. They offer no days off other than Christmas Day and New Years Day, with no work from home option or PTO. I will have to travel back and forth between states via airplane to be in office the day after Christmas, fly back to my hometown two days later for a scheduled family wedding, and back again after the wedding. It’s a ridiculous waste. This job has not allowed me to spend any extended amount of time at home with my family over the past 3.5 years. 

If I put my two weeks in before Christmas, I would have the time off that I’ve been arguing for around the holidays. I have enough in my savings to sustain 5-6 weeks of unemployment and wouldn’t mind the time off to rest, spend time with family, and finally get things done that have been put off. 

My dilemma comes in regarding my year end review and bonus. 

Option #1 is to quit two weeks prior to Christmas during my year end review to rip the band off. This risks not receiving my year end bonus.

Option #2 is doing the review without giving any indication that I’ll be resigning in literally a month in order to secure my bonus, which will likely be around $8,000. The bonus will not hit my bank account until January 1, meaning I’d put in my two week notice almost immediately after the bonus lands. This leaves only two weeks between last day of work and starting the new job. 

Long story short, the question is do I suck it up for 8k or say fuck it, this job has never been worth it and quit when I want to?

Yes, this is the first corporate job I’ve had to quit and would appreciate some perspective. ",Glittering_Hat_3150,1,0.6000000238418579,5,1731974719,2024-11-19 00:05:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gujqnn/when_should_i_quit_my_job/,11,2024

I've seriously thought about quitting for the last few weeks now.

It's a lot of stress and frankly too much pressure for me to take. I know I shouldn't care so much but I do. Also I really don't think I should ever be put into a situation where the person in charge hasn't received any training and doesn't know what they're doing so I'm constantly having to go beyond my capacity to help out.

1guiate,"I'm looking to get a new job, but don't know where to start.","I've been at the same job for 2.5 years and I've only gotten 35 cent raises every year, so I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Graphics Animation and Web Development with a minor in Art and Design. When I first got out of college, I wanted to work in the games, graphic design, or animation industry, but after a year of applying to countless jobs, I had to suck it up and take a factory job. I thought I would try again after a couple years, but considering how terrible things are right now in films, tv, and games (I.E. Layoffs, the threat of AI, cancelled projects), that's just not a safe option anymore.

So I thought about getting a certificate in CAD modeling, since I've already got extensive experience with 3D modeling in software like Maya and Blender, and I take an introductory course to CAD modeling as an elective. But I'm really not good at math above high school level, so I don't know if I'd be a good fit for the job. Plus, certificates can get expensive, so I don't want to waste money on something I won't be able to get a job with.

I'm also not the best at coding, as I struggled with that during a lot of my web development classes, and barely survived a lot of them.

I'm not against learning a trade, but I've got back problems and not the best with extensive physical labor. I'm also not the best with talking to people, so a customer service job might not be the best fit.

Though one thing I'd say I'm good at and don't hate doing is taking inventory and collecting data. I had to take inventory of every game and movie I own before I moved for insurance, along with their price listings on Amazon and Ebay, and I was able to do that for hours without getting tired. I was also good with recording expiration dates and inventory during my time in a lot of part time retail jobs. But I'm not sure what sort of well-paying jobs would relate to that sort of skill, or if there's a specialized career for it. If there is, I'd like to know.

1gui9k2,Finally found a job in my new field but have a really bad boss - suggestions on how to navigate,"I worked almost my whole career at one place for 18 years, which I left to complete my PhD in a different field. I found a job in my new field a few weeks after completely by PhD however, I was looking for 2 years (PhD is NOT required for my job).  

The PhD was mostly a personal passion that I hoped could transition into a new career. I also have  many transferable skills that I can take to any job or sector (e.g., project management, stakeholder engagement, research).  I also have a lot of volunteer and community engagement experience and certifications (e.g. PMP).

The job itself is great but I have (what I learned is) a narccistic boss.  Even though she was super happy/eager to have me join during the interview process (where I beat out hundreds of applicants), right from the beginning she has treated me poorly (no training whatsever, talking to me like a child, purposely omitting information, not communicating, not including me in emails, meetings, etc., ), intentionally setting me up to fail so she can berate me in a condescending, shaming tone). I'm convinced she's doing everything she can to force me to quit. 

Because this is a very small organization, there's not much I can do about it (e.g., talking to her boss, HR) - plus she knows how to behave with higher ups. The one time I tried setting healthy boundaries with her in a professional and respectful manner, she went ballistic. She said some pretty horrible things, which her boss was copied on - the only thing I'm left to believe is that he condones her behavior especially b/c she has done some great work for the org and won awards.  

While I""m the only one that reports to her, it's not just me she treats this way - she's like this with others who she deems that are inferior to her. I've read up a lot on narccistic bosses (she fits it to a tee) so I understand she's like this because she's highly insecure person, and it's a reflection of her not me.

I'm job searching again as things are only getting worse but given I've only been at this job for 6 months, and have limited experience in my new career it makes it really challenging. I'm also looking for jobs not in my new career but I've put in myself in a real bind because I'm highly educated but my work experience is almost all in one  job - so I can't be considered for junior or senior. I feel like I keep getting overlooked for jobs that I think I'm qualified for. 

As I'm job searching, it brings back bad memories from the first time around. I also feel directionless on what to do and I really feel like a looser b/c of my inability to get interviews and offers.  **Any advice on how to maintain my sanity while working for a person like and also for the job searching process would be appreciated.**

1gui5o9,(29m) have been in lossy prevention for 11 years with not much room to move up. Any idea on next steps?,"
I have been in loss prevention since I was 18, it was my first job and I guess I just got comfortable and haven’t left. There is only one level up from base LP at my job and I got it 2 years in, anything else requires a degree. 

My current position is called “mobile loss prevention” and I just walk around the store and am in charge of a small team of loss prevention (2-3 people depending on season). 

I have been here 11 years and only make 18.78, about $1 above my states minimum wage (CA).

Education wise I finished my general education at a community college and transferred to a local 4 year that was easy to get into. I dropped out after my first semester due to some family issues. 

Is there any higher paying jobs/careers I might qualify for with only loss prevention experience without a degree? 

Should I go back to school and finish my degree? Will be tough financially but I can get it done. My original degree was sociology, but since I only did one semester so I could switch degrees pretty easily if needed.

I am a mechatronics engineer graduated a few years ago and now I would like to work in the field of industrial or collaborative robotics, so I migrated to Europe (for its industry more oriented to what I am interested in). I have had a few professional experiences in my home country but within them I have not had any in these fields.
I have applied to a few positions of this style now in France and I pass the first interviews with no problem, but when I get to the technical interviews I fall short due to lack of specific technical knowledge (it should be added that I saw my last semesters during COVID💀). That's why I'm thinking to follow a master program where I reinforce those gaps, at the same time that I work in alternation in some company dedicated to this kind of technologies (according to me would be an easier way to introduce myself in the labor market in the branch I'm interested in).

But some friends have told me not to worry if I lack certain knowledge, since I could directly apply to large companies, which usually train their employees in the specific area in which they require them. In other words they said I should not waste 2 more years of my life studying since it is not necessary, besides my engineering degree would already have a level equivalent to the master's degree in France (BAC +5) so following this master would not add years of study to my resume. 

I want to know if they are actually right and this is just a case of imposter syndrome 😅 or should I really spend two more years studying in order to get a position in my dream job.

1gugf8s,Employer denying vacation 6 months in advance ,"Hi All-
So I have a job at a small family owned acupuncture office in NY. I’ve worked there almost 2 years now. I get 5 paid vacation days and 5 paid sick days a year (no clear indication/limitation of unpaid time off). My grandma wants to visit our family in France for 2 weeks in April-May. I’ve never been out of the country and would love the opportunity. My coworker is even offering miles towards my flight. I sent the dates to my boss a few weeks ago and he responded that those dates looked good and he would give me official approval in person. Also just to note: I’ve never taken my vacation days (they don’t roll over into the next year) and I am CONSTANTLY covering hours/vacations for the other receptionist. 

In person, he then tried negotiating cutting my trip down to a week or a week and a half. I explained that these are the dates my grandma gave me and that I haven’t been out of the country before so cutting it short wasn’t okay with me. My coworkers are overhearing this and getting involved, advocating for me and at this point it’s awkward. The other receptionist said she’d be able to cover all my hours so it should be no problem. My boss then asked me to make it more convenient for the company to take the vacation monday-monday instead of tuesday/tuesday. 

I confirm that with my grandma and we are ready to buy the tickets. I go into work today and the other receptionist tells me that my boss said he thinks i’m “taking advantage” and that I am only allowed 10 work days off. (Mind you, I’d use my 5 vacation days for the first week and the second week would be unpaid time off with coverage). But it’s strange to me because the other receptionist goes on 2 1/2 week retreats twice a year (which i cover for her) and no one blinks an eye. 

This entire situation is making me feel uneasy, under appreciated, and in a way seems to me he is favoring some employees over me. Am i overreacting? I was already thinking of quitting and finding a job with better pay/hours but this situation is driving me over the edge. 

Any advice on what to do/how to go about this?

1gug1h5,Should I take a pay increase with potential downside?,"I’ve been offered a job with a $20k increase over my current role (from $75k to $94k). The new role seems similar to my current position in terms of responsibilities, but there are some key differences that I’m unsure about:

- The new job involves shift work, I believe it’s 9-5 and 11-7, plus one day of weekend work, which is a change from my current standard 9-5 Monday-Friday work schedule.
- The role is fully in-office, while my current job offers the hybrid flexibility I value greatly.
- I’m a bit worried about job security at my current role due to ongoing budget cuts and possible redundancies, which is why this new offer is tempting. If I wasn’t concerned I would probably turn this down and keep looking.
- My partner is firmly against me taking the new job as we won’t see each other as much, and I’m conflicted. While I think the extra money could be a big help for us financially, I also want to consider the impact on my work-life balance and personal life.

1gufor6,Breaking into IT Support for Law Firms: Tips and Tricks for a Lucrative Career,"I’ve worked in IT support for various law firms over the past decade, and I’ve learned that supporting the legal industry has unique challenges and rewards. If you’re interested in getting into this field, here are a few key insights I’ve picked up:
	1.	Master Legal-Specific Software: Law firms use specialized software like document management systems (e.g., iManage or NetDocuments). Familiarizing yourself with these tools gives you a huge edge.
	2.	Understand the Criticality of Security: Lawyers deal with highly sensitive information, so knowledge of cybersecurity principles is essential. Even minor breaches can have major consequences.
	3.	Be Ready for High-Pressure Support: Attorneys often work under intense deadlines, so the ability to handle stress and provide efficient, reliable support is crucial. Developing your communication and problem-solving skills pays off immensely.
	4.	Get Familiar with Remote Work Environments: Post-pandemic, many firms have embraced hybrid work models. Mastering tools like Citrix and VPNs is a must for seamless support.

For those curious about exploring this niche further, I’ve put together a free newsletter where I share:
	•	In-depth guides on legal tech tools
	•	Tips for acing IT interviews in law firms

The 5 years are almost up and the company is set to sell 7/1/25. All employees with the company at the time of sell will receive a Long-Term Investment Plan (LTIP) Bonus. While we are told no layoffs will happen, it is hard to believe. Company had a large layoff almost a year ago and there were multiple small layoffs when the company was sold 5 years ago. I live in a small rural community. Good local jobs are hard to find. While I am told it's unlikely I will loose my position at my current employers after the sale it's not guaranteed. If I do lose my job, who knows how long it will take to find something close to the salary. 

Also important information:
I finished getting my second degree three years ago. It is in accounting. The position at the new company would be an internal accounting position at a small local competitor of my current employer. It's a great opportunity to gain experience and on the job knowledge in the accounting field vs just having my degree. There are opportunities to grow within the new company. 

The counter offer at my current employment would come as a promotion/department transfer. New supervisor. The more difficult detailed work I would continue to do (maintain and manage federal funding for specific clients), but all of my easy work would be replaced with helping the new team I would be on. I am ""told"" it would be more financial analysis and reporting duties, but I have a feeling I would be doing collection work for delinquent customers. I don't see any growth opportunities at my current employment, unless I am willing to move even farther away from my accounting degree and more in to customer service. Not exactly what I want to do.



I am currently making $50K Salary. 32 years old. Currently saving 8% of Salary for 401K.


New Job New Employer 
$55K/Year - Hourly. OT seems likely.
4% Salary 401K contribution no matter what + 6% Salary Match 401K contribution for a total 10% Salary 401K
Health Insurance is $50 Cheaper per Month. Employer will contribute $6K to Health Savings Account/Year.
PTO is less, but after 3 years tenure it will be better than what I am currently receiving with 10 years tenure.
Annual Profit Sharing Bonuses and Yearly Merit Salary Raises. 

I know a few people in the company. A couple are actually old coworkers, but they are in other departments. I have been told the upper management is much better than where I am at now. And that yearly bonuses tend to be pretty good in the past. Normally 10-15% of Salary and 4-6% is the average merit salary increase each year.

Work in office, with the option to work remore or hybrid after a year. Office is 5 minute drive from my office. Was told in interview that they would consider waiving the year remote rule sense I have been working fully remote the past 3 years.



Current Employer 
$60K with the opportunity to do training (TBA) to increase salary to $65K in a Year - Salary 
Max 401K match contribution of $1,250/year.
$50/month more expensive insurance and no HSA contribution.
Yearly Merit Salary Increases. 2-5% is the average merit salary increase the past couple years 
Yearly Bonuses based on Company Performance Goals. But company has not reached its goals the past couple years, so bonuses have only been 5-7% of salary
Fully Remote.
Guaranteed One Time LTIP Bonus this upcoming summer. $20K minimum, but can be more depending on the valuation on the company when it sells. Per management it's estimated at 150% now so bonus is might be $30K
 ***Special note. I was only supposed to receive $12K minimum, but they are increasing it to $20K to try to keep me****

Am told by current management that hopefully benefits will get better once the company is sold.....


I am leaning towards the new job due to the much better benefits, the opportunity to receive actual accounting experience within a company, and slightly better job security, but it's really hard to turn down the large LTIP Bonus and high yearly salary with current employer.

1gueky4,How to provide services without a certain title,"There are ways to provide certain functions at a job that you create without the actual title. For instance, you can actually legally get involved in investigating disappearances without being a private investigator without the title, as long as you don't do certain things that only PIs can do. Another example: you can help people in your community or even as a job with giving them lists of resources ... This is 100% legal and similar to what a social worker may do for some of their duties. You just can't call yourself a social worker legally and you can't access certain databases or records that they may access. 

Anyway, I am starting a company that can help people transition out of jail and mental health institutions. Many of these companies already exist. I wanted to help people as a support specialist-- not as a social worker. I only have an AS degree in Psychology. I can't access databases, but I can legally help people on Zoom to provide assistance with offering guidance on where they can live, or even helping them get a place... Or helping facilitate, finding them a social worker, putting them in touch with a social worker, and then following up with them to inquire about the social worker. I may not be able to help them get insurance if they don't have it, but I may be able to put them in touch with someone. Basically, I want to facilitate the whole situation and even follow up with the SWs. It's private info so they may not be able to tell me but my goal is to simply help the flow of the process get going the best I can. 

What could I call myself? I'm thinking a support specialist, a support assistant, a behavioral tech (that one I need a certification for, and I'm in the process of getting that), etc. Or should I make up my own title?

1guefzq,MPH or Rad Tech?,"Hello,

I’m currently at a crossroads in my career and could use some guidance. Here’s my situation:

I have a bachelor’s degree in Health Administration.

I currently work for a health insurance company(Cali) as a coordinator, earning $29/hour.

My company offers up to $8,000/year in tuition reimbursement for education.

I’m considering two options: pursuing a Master’s in Public Health (MPH) or going back to school to become a Radiologic Technologist (Rad Tech).

Here’s my thought process so far:

MPH: It feels like a natural next step from my bachelor’s and could open doors to leadership or policy roles in public health. However, I’ve heard mixed reviews about job prospects and salary outcomes especially without a clinical background.

Rad Tech: This would be a complete career shift, but I’m drawn to the hands-on nature of the work and clinical experience. From what I’ve researched, the field seems to offer decent job security and competitive pay, especially with specialization.


I’m feeling stuck because I enjoy the stability of my current role, but I also want to build a long-term career that’s fulfilling and financially rewarding.

For those with experience in either field (or both!), I’d love to hear your insights:

What are the pros and cons of each path?

If you’ve pursued either, how has it impacted your career and quality of life?

Is there anything you wish you had known before making a similar decision?


Thanks in advance for your advice! I really appreciate any input you can offer.

1gucq6s,Work-Life Balance Struggles,"So I am considering another career change. Emphasis on ""another"" because I am 29 and have made more than a few switches in my 7 years since college. The fields I have primarily worked in are; college athletics, high school education, and currently in surgical device sales. 

The reoccurring issue with every job I have had is the work-life balance. In college athletics, my primary work hours were evenings and weekends. As a high school teacher (and soccer coach) I was clocking 60+ hour weeks every single week and was too busy/tired to have a life outside of work. In my current role in surgical device sales, as I have grown my business and developed my territory, I have been having to spend more and more time traveling and overnight work trips. I have to have my phone on me at all times, even on vacation I am still getting calls and texts and emails, and I have to stay ready to drop everything and drive 3 hours away for an emergency procedure. And it would appear that I as I continue to become more successful at my job, I will continue to have to sacrifice my personal time. 

So my question for everyone here is this; **what jobs/career fields have the best work-life balance? Where you can show up/login, do your job, then leave/shut the computer and not have to think about it until the next business day?** I feel like I am relatively smart and am a hardworker, I have found success in all the fields I've previously worked in. (I left each job by my own decision to pursue something else.) 

Now, I'm just tired of my life being consumed by my work. I've accepted that I don't need to be passionate about my job. I just want to work to afford to live comfortably, and **I want to have time to enjoy my life outside of work.** ",Effective_Plane_6009,1,1.0,0,1731956969,2024-11-18 19:09:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gucq6s/worklife_balance_struggles/,11,2024

1gucdqi,Is Lean Six Sigma certification worth it? What could be other options for someone working in healthcare ,"I’m an OR nurse with 1.5yrs experience. I already know that this job is not sustainable for me and the benefits are not really worth the effort I put into work compared to the risks and exhaustion that comes with it. I have been thinking of slowly shifting towards changing my career path away from bedside, maybe even away from healthcare, but I have been lost on how to get out or which way to approach. I have been thinking of taking masters but master degrees opportunities for nursing will still involve me directly into healthcare (but seriously considering it even though not sure which specialty or where). Also been thinking of doing something aside from that and slowly growing it, I heard a lot about the Lean six sigma certificate and I’m really into problem solving and insuring quality and efficiency but as a nurse and no other background in any different field I don’t know if that’s going to be useful for me.
I will appreciate any advice regarding if it’s a good idea and what are my opportunities if I decided to get this certificate and willing to any other suggestions that might be more suitable for me.

1gubw5u,How do I choose the right path? ,"Here’s a polished version of your message:


---

Hi everyone, I need some serious advice about what to do with my life right now. I just graduated in July with a B.S. in Exercise Science and an A.S. in Kinesiology with the expectation of going into OT School, but I feel completely lost about my next steps.

Currently, I’m working at an outpatient occupational therapy clinic in Georgia. I love the field of OT, but I’m already feeling burnt out in my role as a rehab aide. On top of that, I’m responsible for a lot of the administrative work, which I really dislike.

I’m at a crossroads, unsure if I should go back to school due to the stress—especially since I’ve started experiencing seizures because of it. I’ve been considering an OTA program close to home, but I’m questioning if it’s worth the 15k  investment . Would it be worth going back to school for a career that typically pays $25/hour? I’ve also thought about becoming an RBT or exploring more homeopathic/naturopathic routes since I’m drawn to holistic approaches. However, ND schools are all out of state for me, and I also need job security that I feel ND wouldn't give me. 

To complicate things, I’m dealing with several health issues that make it hard to know if I should stick it out in my current role, look for a different job, or pursue further education. Many OTs I’ve spoken to say the field involves a lot of work with no life outside of it plus a significant financial investment for an average salary of around 45-$70k/year depending on OTA or OTD. I’ve also read countless posts from OTs online talking about burnout and feeling underpaid, which makes me hesitate.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1gub6sj,Is it me or management?,"I 31F have been working for my employer for 8 years. I started out in the lowest entry level position available and worked my way up to a low level middle management position. I worked hard, stayed late, and tried to take any advice provided to achieve my success. During the last 5 years of my employment I’ve “significantly exceeded” expectations in my yearly review. During Q4 last year I received the best performance among staff award. Due to the amount of success I was achieving I decided it was time for a change as I wanted to help support and develop new teams. I was offered and accepted a new opportunity with a different department in May of this year. My new supervisor left within my first 2 months on the new team citing personal reasons. She was the one person who knew the bulk of my job. Her training was piece meal but thorough. Unfortunately, it was never really completed before she left. 

Here’s where I’m starting to wonder. Until my original supervisor left I heard no complaints and received the occasional recommendation on how to improve. My new supervisor is positive and consistently provides coaching. She asks what she can do to help but when I ask a question it takes days to get a response  because she has to ask someone else or a pointed finger to a different person. I feel as if all I ever hear is you made this typo or that mistake should have been caught. These are small errors such as an extra letter in a word or misunderstanding an ask. I once used the term “we” instead of “I” when handling a matter and was told that upper management wanted to see ownership, but I was owning the project and completed the project on my own. I use “we” because for most of my career I’ve worked in team environments where you give credit for everyone’s efforts as it was just you who did all the work. These are things that never occurred in my previous positions with my last 5 supervisors with the company. 

So is it me or is management?

1guazp1,Am I being overly sensitive?,"I have a job that is completely remote. It’s a pretty independent job, but one that draws in a lot of extroverts. While I’m definitely less extroverted than my coworkers, I’m the top performer based on the metrics we use. I really enjoy the position because I get paid a decent amount and it gives me a ton of work life balance. I get plenty of time to do chores and workout throughout the work day, which gives me more time for my family afterwards. Plus my wife is hybrid, so I can spend time with her a few workdays as well. The job in itself is really easy too.

My problem is that I can tell a lot of my coworkers don’t like me. I feel like I’m kind of a joke to some of the members of my department, especially the people that are higher up and have been here the longest. To be fair, I can totally see why they’d feel this way based on things I’ve said and the way I’ve acted in the past.

The kicker is that I only actually have to sit with these people in zoom meetings for about 45min to an hour a week. These meetings are purely meant for us to socialize with each other. I absolutely dread these meetings. Outside of that, I keep it strictly professional when I need to communicate through teams. 

It seriously bothers me though that I have this shitty reputation. While everyone else has managed to make friends with others in our department where they communicate with each other outside of the required meetings, I have no one.

1gua6ty,Asking for a raise...,"Hi all,

Hoping for some advice specific to my situation..

I have been working at a luxury resort (rooms 1200 a night) for 2.5 years. I have 16 years experience bartending and serving. I give impeccable service, am knowledgeable about spirits and food, and get 1-2 specific name mentions in our review system from guests every single week.

This is an hourly job- not tipped. When I applied they offered $20 an hour which I declined due to my experience. Ad said 20-25. They called back and said 25. I have received a $1 COL raise since starting that does not apply to my serving rate.

I now have moved to serving. I needed a break from bartending. I get paid $22 an hour and I love that the younger staff gets paid a good wage but I'm making the same as the 18 year old servers who come to me for guidance. The managers also come to me for alcohol related advice because I'm knowledgeable about wine, spirits, etc..

We get incentives for how many drinks we sell/name mentions we get so I'm hesitant to ask for a raise. I also dropped my hours while going to school this past year, so lost all of my benefits. I'm looking at regular bartending/serving jobs because I know I can make far more somewhere else. My last paycheck was 800 for 2 weeks. They also cut hours for winter.

One server makes $28 an hour but got the raise when they were desperate for staff. I would like to ask for the same but would be ok with $26 an hour- no less. My manager is notorious for denying raises.

Any advice?? Should I ask. How would I word it? I'm not necessarily looking for much more responsibility either- a bit would be okay. I really adore working here/my coworkers but won't stay for 22/hr.

Thank you for reading!!",diepecanpie,0,0.5,1,1731950837,2024-11-18 17:27:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gua6ty/asking_for_a_raise/,11,2024
1gua1r2,"30 hours part time, 15 hours as an independent contractor","I really really like my job. I used to work as a restaurant server so this is way better. Throw away account and I'll be somewhat vague about it just in case my coworkers are reading this.

My job is front desk but has a lot of responsibilities. It's similar to a daycare. It's a small business and the owner relies on us to communicate with clients (parents). It's the first job I've ever had that I'm getting paid 20/hr. 

I'm currently working part-time with no benefits. Then I got a raise and a promotion, and I'm at 30 hours a week. Now the owner is asking me to add 15 as an independent contractor. So I would be at 45. No benefits, no health insurance. My partner is telling me that she's taking advantage of me, and I think I agree. But I don't want to lose the job, and because I don't have much experience, I have no idea how to negotiate, and what is reasonable for me to ask. Please be kind, I'm doing my best lol.

1gu9cm4,I’m not sure what more I can do,"I’ve already read and experienced how the job market is hit or miss with recent grads. I’ve only had two interviews out of 50 jobs I’ve applied, and the rest were rejection or ghosting. I want to apply to more but right now I’ve plateaued and waiting for new job postings. I’ve only been looking in my state because I’m broke and cant afford to move.

I have a BS in Biochemistry and no related work experience. I have the degree, some undergrad research, studied abroad (not related to biochem) and plenty of customer service/fast food/front end manager experience. I feel like those jobs hinder me being a strong applicant because it doesn’t relate to my degree. I believe that my resume is structured fine as I have had it looked at for help several times. Though I’m told by many people good things and that I have plenty of transferable skills, which I do try to highlight in resume and cover letters, I feel they are just blowing smoke up my ass. I read somewhere to only put on your resume what is relevant to the job you are applying for. But if I remove all my shift manager and front end manager jobs they I will not have any work experience on my resume.

I have been looking at entry level jobs to try to gain experience but nothing is truly entry level; I also hear entry level is very competitive. Some say BS with 0-2 years experience… but we all know companies would take someone with 2 over 0 years of experience. I’ve even applied to jobs that sound complicated enough to require a bachelors only to say that a high school diploma is required (ex: Biopharmaceutical Associate 1, DNA Purification Tech 1, QC associate 1- required AS degree). But those I was rejected for, no interview. 

Even 2 people in my network recommended a job that they did at a hospital, as a specimen management technician that works under MLTs, so I could get out of customer service and gain some sort of experience. This job only says high school diploma but my two network friends had bachelors degree in Biology and got them and did the job years prior. I was rejected for this job recently, no interview. 

I will say that my initial reasons for pursuing biochemistry have changed but also that I am nontraditional student, older than the peers I graduated with, because I  took years off from school because I was flunking from mental health and drug addiction. I made a promise to go back and finish 30 credits I had left, because I am first generation and dreamt big but also was influenced by the notion that a degree meant status and upward mobility. But career wise I have no idea what to do and have no passion at the moment. All I know is that I still enjoy science and want some experience. I want to use my degree and not be a cashier for the rest of my life. I had more drive when I was younger in school but life happened and now have a more realistic, cynical, complacent view on life. 

In the near future I will be participating in a bio-manufacturing workshop which will give me lectures and hands on experiences for microbiology and engineering of fermentation for scale-up relating to gut microbiome and biofuels. Though I can’t put it in my resume yet since It’s still months away. I am excited to participate as my old professor (who is partially running it) will be there joined with people from industry as trainers. My professor has graciously waived all fees ($3500) and is providing travel cost. So it’s something to look forward to. Other than that I am not sure what more I can do. 

For those in there quarter life crisis after college, hang in there!

Hello everyone, 
I made a post similar to this one in an another community and I’d like to share it here to get some advice. I have been a longtime Reddit lurker and commenter, but never made a post until now. I graduated this past May and I have been looking for jobs left and right. In the past 6 months, I have only received one rejection letter and nothing else beyond that. I am currently working full time at the job I had when I went through school and as time goes by I feel that I am not adequate enough to get a job within my degree. I feel unmotivated to apply to any jobs because I’m not really sure what I want to do. I feel more confused when I start job searching every day because I don’t know what I’m interested in. It’s come to the point where I don’t have any interests in anything and feeling like a robot. How do I get out of this funk and how do I actually find what suits/interests me?

1gu90bi,Frustrated with my career trajectory and thinking about a Master’s degree for a career change,"I'm a 28 female who graduated with a Bachelor's in Communications in 2018. I changed majors quite a bit before deciding on communications to just graduate and finish with a GPA above a 3.0. I had some interest in working in journalism after college but had a very hard time finding a job in that field. I've since worked in retail management, a call center job, I was briefly a teacher's aide, an administrative assistant and now I work in local government doing contract compliance. Due to low paying jobs over the years I have accrued about $15k in credit card debt and even making $53k a year now, I need a second job to help me pay my bills. 

I'm still experiencing job dissatisfaction, the work is boring and slow. I am now exploring a master's degree in Data Analytics or Finance, I feel like I could get a stable, good paying job and have lots of opportunities with either of those degrees.

But my concern is that even after obtaining a master's degree, I'll end up still not making enough (no ROI), barely getting by and feeling unsatisfied. My other concern I've never stayed at job more than 18 months due to low job satisfaction and low pay but that doesn't look great on a resume and Im still trying to figure out how much this will impact me as I approach my 30's and being in the workforce for 5+ years. I essentially don't want to invest $20k on a degree that doesn't end up doing much for me in the end. If anyone can offer some insight on if I am on the right track with thinking a career change and investing in a master's is necessary I would really appreciate it.

We need to see dramatic performance improvements by early January.

Leadership: Ensure that you are leading the businesses in (department) engagements providing clear recommendations (and valuations), escalating to LT if there is working team push back, and that you are notching up your thought / process leadership in the group.

Time: Ensure that you are clearly demonstrating your time commitments to each team and prioritizing completion of tasks.

Presentations: Leverage the (consulting firm’s logic model) in all deliverables so that teams can clearly understand the main objective and subsequently follow the clear logic to outcomes / recommendations.

If by the beginning of January, we do not see marked performance improvements we will need to escalate the conversation to HR and begin the HR Process.

1gu5e5q,Got an offer- but the new company has been laying off and current company WILL do massive cost cutting should I stay or go?,"Got an offer- but the new company has been laying off.  Current company WILL do massive cost cutting.

I’m a single dad, 45 , in very competitive IT, pretty good WFH job for 10 years -fortune 50 company.  I’ve always been a top performer with glowing reviews.  But I’ve got no fallback if I were to lose my job and I would have to be extremely careful to jump to another job/ company because I can’t risk getting into a bad, toxic team and be made to quit. Or laid off.

Almost certain massive cuts will come in early 2025.  The company lost half of its value in the stock market and lost revenue and will continue to in the coming years.  I am not sure of the time horizon.  Minimal info shared in town halls. I’m kind of freaking out with so many unknowns. What are the chances I’m retained?  So I started looking for a new job outside of the company - and got an offer - higher responsibility and better pay - BUT - it’s at another fortune 50 AND in the same industry.  They have conducted layoffs too last year and this year.  So I’m hesitant in taking the plunge.  Why - I’m a single dad, taking a risk on income is very hard.  Since the new company has conducted layoffs I could be targeted too in the near term and more so as being new.  I’m tired of working in fear.   
Any suggestions?  Is there something I haven’t thought of?

The new company, read reviews on Glassdoor that they had conducted layoffs and reposted the jobs at lower pay.

And my current job - Let it play out and if get let go draw unemployment?   What about trying for a higher position at the current company, is it worth it? 

 So with offers I’ve gotta let them know quickly and if I don’t take it, another one like this is not guaranteed later especially when I need it and with this job market.

1gu4ziw,"When you prefer email, but someone who isn't your boss wants a call: how to be polite?","I hate phone calls.

In my job, I am paid by the hour (think accountant, consultant, etc.), I am an introvert (thus I hate talking on the phone, although not all introverts share that trait) and I keep track of things by filing away emails in the right folder.  If I have a call, even if the call is only 10 minutes, it takes a lot longer than that to prepare for the call and then turn back to my work.  So if someone simply needs to provide information to me, I want it by email.  

However, some people who aren't my boss refuse to email and instead want to talk on the phone, even just to provide information to me.

For example, I'm in a leadership role at an industry trade association. Someone in another company emailed to say that they have ""an idea"" for an upcoming event.  Fine--email it to me.  The person refuses to email; the person keeps wanting to talk. We've been going back and forth for a week; I keep saying, to try to be polite, ""I'll need to run this by the rest of the leadership team and we meet by email, so if it's easiest, please feel free to email the idea to me"", but the other person says, ""Oh, I can wait until you are free for a call.""

**In this situation- if email works best for me but someone simply won't email, what's the most polite way to handle it?**

In this specific situation, I guess whoever has the most to lose by not having the communication will give in, but it's so annoying!

If a boss or a customer wants a call, sure, I'll do a call then.

Thanks.

1gu4w59,How do i know a passion is strong enough to turn into a career?,"Hi, I'm a 20F with multiple interests but still no clear direction in life. 

Growing up i quickly realized that traditional schooling wasn't for me and that i had no interest in following typical university courses with my multiple learning disabilities. I'm not very 'book smart'. I knew i would need to center my education around one of my creative interests, and i chose baking as it was the one i invested the most time in towards the end of high school.

For multiple different reasons i wanted to live in my home town but there weren't any baking/pastry schools nearby so i turned to hotel management with a focus on culinary arts. But after two years, the management classes did me under and i had to stop. Following that, i fully turned back to baking and decided to travel slightly further distances to get to my classes. 

Once i found classes and a job in said field, I quickly found that my motivation to pursue baking and pastry making didn't extent past my home kitchen as i found myself enduring everyday of work with little to no excitement except for when i was done for the day.

I really thought that baking was a 'passion' i felt strongly enough about to pursue but when i got to it, i was miserable. Now I'm looking to re-route to another one of my interest and i am starting to entertain the idea of moving countries or maybe just moving closer to my countries capital city to have access to more options. I like creative writing, sewing, dancing, music (singing, and flute), nail art, and hairstyling. But now I'm starting to doubt how much i like these things and I'm scared of once again investing money and time into a course only to find that i wasn't that into it after all...

Pursuing passions can be expensive especially when it requires you to uproot your life to go to somewhere with better opportunities. what if i move across the world, start on a fashion design degree only to hate every second of it and once again waste tuition money. I don't know what i want to do with my life. and i don't think i trust myself to take risky commitments on my parent's dime. I can't help but doubt my interests when i keep seeing stories of people being obsessed with drawing since they where in diapers or styling their dolls hair and clothes from a young age fighting to pursue their dreams when their older, their life path clear to them.

1gu40xy,Stuck in a high paying job,"TLDR; I'm overpaid for my low-level job, can't grow within my own company and don't know how to find a better job without a huge hit in income.



Let me start by saying I'm super lucky to be where I am in my career, in many ways. I do pretty easy work, it's super flexible with regards to hours and remote work, the commute is fine and all the benefits are great (both salary as well as secondary stuff). Great colleagues too.

However, the work itself doesn't challenge me in the slightest. Not ever. There's weeks where I can get my work done in 2 hours and just kind of hang out the rest of the day. Which is great one way because I do get paid for those hours of doing nothing, but it also isn't very fulfilling.

After getting my degree (in a pretty useless subject I'm afraid, but still university masters) I kind of.... floated around for a bit. Worked some random jobs, for one or two years at a time, never staying long enough for any chance of serious career development or promotions or anything. Then I started working in my current company 4 years ago in a job far below my level, but thinking it was a nice start and I could work my way up.

Well... there really isn't a way up within this company. My job right now is most similar I'd say to something like office manager (not really, but I don't know what else to compare it too) and although my salary is really good for the type of job, I really haven't learned anything from doing it. I've tried developing myself professionally outside of work, but since I don't even really know in which direction to go from here, I haven't done anything serious (as in, paid courses or something).

  
So basically, I feel very much stuck. Within my own company there's nowhere to grow, but if I look around elsewhere, all the jobs I qualify for have a far worse salary because I'm kind of overpaid for the job I do right now. I could take a small hit in my income if I found my dream job, but again I don't even really know what that would be and I can't go down too much with salary because cost of living is really high where I am right now.

  
The only option I see is to move pretty far away where it's cheaper to live, and find a job there, accepting that I'll still have less money to live off in the end but maybe have a more fulfilling job. But then again, I also have young kids that I don't really want to drag around for nothing.",Oeleboelebliekop,14,0.75,28,1731934449,2024-11-18 12:54:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gu40xy/stuck_in_a_high_paying_job/,11,2024

My current position has the DC pension and the new offer has the DB pension.

We are also going through negotiation with my union so chances are the pay will increase once more when it renews.

However, my parking cost is currently free and with the new job it would be $300, 3 days in office (compared to 2 with my current job).

I would start with 4 weeks vacation compared to 3 with my current employer. 

They also have flexible work schedule so they have compressed weeks and shorter hours in the summer and longer hours in the winter.

However, I currently do enjoy my current position. I have an amazing management, extremely supportive and understanding.

1gu3vh4,How can I build a software dev portfolio while on a master's degree?,"Hello everyone! I graduated a month ago in biomedical engineering and I'm pursuing a master's right now. This might seem unrelated, however where I'm from (Italy) the biomedical field is extremely oriented towards software development (especially Python), so I've come to terms with the fact that I'll probably become a software developer in disguise, it's actually very common for people with this degree to land a job in software development here.

Not that I mind though, CS and programming have always been an interest of mine so I've had plenty of experience developing projects and whatnot for fun. I was thinking of coming up with a portfolio while I deal with my masters so that I have projects to show off however I don't know where to start. I have some old tiny projects that I could put up on GitHub but they're not exactly related to my field so I don't know whether it's a good idea or not, for example a couple of years ago I made a Spotify clone in Python (Django, I'm in the process of learning FastAPI right now), for my bachelor's thesis I had to develop a web application that based on patient data would detect the most likely illnesses and suggest a treatment for each, while also providing personalized help through an LLM trained on medical data once a treatment got approved (the result was about as good as you'd expect, tons of hallucinations :D).

I was wondering if recruiters actually look at these kinds of projects even if they're not exactly related to my field. Of course I'd make sure to go back and rewrite them where the code is messy and get rid of any sort of garbage/spaghetti code.

Also, just to get this out of the way, the reason why I've used Django and I'm learning FastAPI is pure personal interest. I'm well aware that they have little to no use in this field.

1gu3qp9,21M Norwegian Trucker,"Im 21yo previous equipment operator, and currently truck driver. I drive asphalt from April/March-October/November, making around 100-120k. I usually work 4-3 schedule (Mon-Thursday work, Friday-Sunday free), so i have alot of free time. If i want to work in the winters, i can do snow plowing and probably get close to 150k in income. If not i have 3-4 months vacation.

I have alot of deadtime during my workdays in summer, aswell as winter since im only working when its snowing.

My goal/dream until recently was to start my own trucking/construction company and invest everything into real estate. But as i have started learning more about politics i realised its pretty much impossible to get succesefull doing this in Norway. The country is extremely socialist/communist, and its only getting worse. They government are introducing stricter and higher taxes every year, and are basically killing entrepreneurs. There is also a new \`Exit Tax\`this year which prohibits you from moving out of the country without paying 38% capital tax on all your shares, within 12 years of leaving.

Because of this i realised i need to get out of this country before i build any big wealth. In order to get a job overseas i probably should take advantage of the free education here. There is a few online bachelor programs i can take over 4 years. which i could probably take while working fulltime. My options is to take a degree in Economics and Adminstration (BBA in USA) or  BSc in either Civil, Mechanical, Process technology, Satelite technology engineering. The one I\`m most interested in is Civil, since i have experience in construction, and want to be doing Real Estate investments. But I dont know if the education will be useful in other countries. If i went with Civil i would probably apply for MSc in US for the OPT visa

I Also have the option of doing any degree at a physical college, which is a 3year program. (1year faster).  but then I would have to quit my job, and get a lower pay part time job. If i went this way i would probably do a BSc in comp sci and apply for MSc in US 

I speak English, and Norwegian fluently and low level German. 

Im open for ALL suggestions so if you have any advice on any career paths or best countries to relocate/ways to do it, and just life tips in general, i very much appreciate it.

1gu2g15,Need Career Advice: Stuck in Limbo in Consulting – What Should I Do?,"Hi everyone,  
I need your advice people as I am quite stuck with current situation and I am wondering what is best to do next smh. Here’s a quick breakdown of my background and where I’m at:

I’m a 31-year-old finance graduate who has spent my entire professional life in consulting. My career so far:

* I started with an internship at a Tier 3 consulting firm (Big 4), where I felt undervalued, overworked, and frustrated by the lack of recognition.
* I moved to another Tier 3 consulting firm, partly due to limited options but also 'cause they were offering a better role. This move turned out well as I grew both personally and professionally and picked up valuable skills.
* After three years, I joined an American healthcare-focused strategy boutique, where I’ve now been for three years.

Here’s where things get tricky:  
At my current firm, my career trajectory has been unusual. I’ve struggled with authority and often clashed with seniors because I don’t naturally “play the game” of corporate politics. While I’m smart and well-liked by my peers, these issues have impacted my position.

About a year ago, I was moved out of the strategy division (frankly, they were happy to see me go) to take on a commercial role directly working with the CEO, who really values me personally. Now, I’m in this odd middle ground:

* **The positives**: I’m well-liked by the senior leadership (CEO, COO, CFO, CCO all value me as a person), I have lots of freedom, and I’m no longer stuck in a hierarchical team structure.
* **The negatives**: I don’t have a team or direct reports anymore, I don’t feel like I’m learning or growing professionally, and networking opportunities feel limited. Essentially, it feels like I’ve been put on the bench without realizing it.

I’ve raised concerns about my lack of responsibilities and career growth, but so far, nothing has changed. I’m trying to figure out my next move and would love to hear your thoughts:

1. **Option 1**: Stick it out in my current role and push harder for meaningful responsibilities and projects. The leadership likes me, so there might be a way to make this work.
2. **Option 2**: Look for a new consulting firm and take one last shot at consulting. This would mean starting over at middle management and navigating the painful transition process.

Has anyone been in a similar position or successfully transitioned firms at this level? How painful is it to change consulting firms as a middle manager? Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be massively appreciated.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to ask for clarification if something isn’t clear—it’s a complicated situation to explain!",XoiposTheos,1,1.0,0,1731928542,2024-11-18 11:15:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gu2g15/need_career_advice_stuck_in_limbo_in_consulting/,11,2024
1gu2ea6,How do I kindly quit?,"Hi! Long story short I have never quit a job before and was wondering if there were steps to take to ensure a civil and amicable leave?  What should I say to my boss when I do rip the bandaid off?

I have been at my job just short of one year and I have loved working here. It is a job I got during a long, tiring search post-grad and it is in an industry I never thought I’d be part of. I went to school for communication, music, and business yet somehow ended up working in a hospital. The job itself is fine, but the people are really what make working here so great. I love everyone I work with, my boss is nice and fair, my hours are ideal. The pay though …. trash. Especially for the amount of work I’m doing, my job is beneficial to the workflow of the clinic I’m in. I’m also covering for a higher up who is on leave yet receiving no compensation for that. I am told by coworkers a lot they are so grateful to have me here and don’t know what they’d do without me. These kind words make it even harder to leave without feeling guilty. It’s also nearing the holidays, making me feel selfish to leave now. 

An opportunity has recently fallen into my lap that I have been going back and forth on but ultimately I can’t pass it up. It is in the industry I am passionate about, the pay is SO much better, and all the coworkers I’ve met have been so nice and welcoming. I wasn’t going out and applying for jobs, I wasn’t intending to leave where I am so soon. Granted, I didn’t want to work where I am right now forever but I assumed it’d be another couple of years at least.

So my dilemma: how do I put in my two weeks in a way that won’t blindside my boss/ coworkers? I am planning to meet with her today but I have no idea how to even start the conversation or what to say!! I have been trying to come up with different talking points but all in all I don’t know where to start. I don’t want to burn a bridge or be a burden on those I work with, leaving them with extra things to do while searching for my replacement. But this new job is my dream! To do what’s best for me is to take this job (which is what I’m doing) but it isn’t what’s best for my company right now and I’m having trouble dealing with that. It’s the people pleaser in me I guess… thank you for any and all advice!

1gu1puw,LinkedIn Resume Builder: 100% Free,"This week we ([CVGist](https://cvgist.com)) published a LinkedIn Profile to Resume tool, free to use, AI Generated into an ATS Friendly Resume Template, and downloaded as a Word doc.

If you’ve ever downloaded your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or resume), you’ve probably noticed it’s not ideal. The format is clunky, key details like skills or projects are missing, and it’s not Applicant Tracking System (ATS) friendly. Honestly, if you’ve ever submitted your LinkedIn profile for a job, chances are you received zero interviews. 

At [CVGist](https://cvgist.com), we’ve built a completely free [Google Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/linkedin-to-resume-by-cvg/bhdcmampnnhholkenaahdeaddmodmeem) that solves this problem. Our tool takes your LinkedIn profile and turns it into an AI-generated resume (leveraging ChatGPT-4 and our AI Resume Builder), ready for download in Microsoft Word. It captures all the information from your LinkedIn profile and formats it into a clean, one-column, ATS-friendly resume. This ensures your resume is easy for ATS to parse and for recruiters to read. 

The best part? It can be fully edited in Microsoft Word. Unlike LinkedIn’s static profile PDF, you can tweak it to fit any job you’re applying to.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

* It’s FREE – No cost, no catch. Just install, navigate to your profile, and click “create resume""
* Fix LinkedIn PDF limitations – Add missing sections like skills, projects, and more.
* ATS-friendly – Avoid formatting issues that could get your resume filtered out.
* Download in Word – Make edits and tailor your resume for every job.

I need some advice regarding my career progression.

I’m a 22-year-old Industrial Engineering graduate working for a foreign company in the Home Appliances industry. I’ve been in this role for about a month, focusing on an R&D esp. Label design. I plan to stay here for at least 1–2 years.

Considering economic trends and the current job market, I’d like to ask for your advice:

1. Does R&D offer a good career path globally and within most companies?

2. Does the department I’m in matter for long-term growth? Honestly, I don’t see great growth opportunities in my current department. What should I do if the department plays a critical role in career progression? (If you’ve worked in foreign-owned companies esp. East Asian, can you share insights on the work culture?)

3. Is the Home & Appliance industry a good one to stay in for career growth? If not, what industries would you recommend for someone with my degree and experience?

4. From what i've observed, foreign company managerial position mostly filled with their own county worker. Would working for a foreign-owned company provide better opportunities,, or would a local company be more advantageous?

5. Since I'm basically still fresh graduate. If i see stagnant in my departement, should i search for new job or should i at least hang on it at least 1 year? Is it more advantageous or not?

Now this position is a **General Clerk III**, and so annually it will be a take-home pay of around **$36,670.40**. I feel like I'm being low-balled here, and the job position will resided within Texas. I'm about to wrap up with my security packet and will then receive the job offer to then being contracted to work for the federal government.

I've checked the averages on multiple sites and of course the Texas's Salary Audit for this kind of position. It is **$32,332 - $47,355** for a level 3 type. I have 5 years of experience with clerical work duties in a State University and the amount of work that I inquired from that DHS office seems to be like it's going to be a lot for the upcoming years.

In addition, the only reason I'm taking this job is because I have actual experience with clerical stuff but mostly because of failed ventures into the Tech sector. I graduated from University with a Computer Science Degree 2 years ago and the past 2 jobs have laid me off. The recent one really screwed me over since it was $74k but got knocked down to $45k and after finishing the project, was then laid off after completing it within 3 months by myself- an integration for a CRM to a Virtual Call Center. Safe to say, the tech market is very abysmal, and this year was the worst in me trying to even get interviews/calls for anything related to software/engineering jobs.

Anyways, I want to ask for **$45,000**, so that is like **$21.63** per hour. With all that is said, is this reasonable to open with for that kind of request? I just don't want to be taken advantage anymore. I've spent 6 years getting a degree, stuck with $20k in loan debt, poor health for the past 5 years because of other stresses- and never had more than $3.75k in my bank account. I just hope that If I do open up for negotiation- that they do not rescind the offer because of it. I really am in no position but at the same time, I feel like I want there to be some level of respectable pay rate for this kind of job level. I don't know, my life isn't really going the way I've imagined when I was an 18-year-old.",Subject-Statement845,2,1.0,2,1731912302,2024-11-18 06:45:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gtyuk4/wanting_to_negotiate_the_salary_whenever_i_get_my/,11,2024

Advice please!","I am a psychology graduate with a business studies minor and my interest has been consumer behaviour for the last few months since I graduated.

1gtxzdi,Is asking for delayed start date by 4 months AND higher salary too aggressive?,"I'm early in the search for a new job, but happened to get an exciting offer from a ""dream employer"" that I honestly wasnt expecting  this early in the process.

I asked the hiring manager in the interview about start date flexibility and all they said was ""Sooner rather than later but we are willing to work with the right candidate"" and we left it at that. I planned to discuss desired start date in the final interview, if I made it that far, but they decided to cancel the final round of interviews and sent me an offer instead. 

I got a job offer with a proposed start date in December. The HR recruiter also said January would be fine

According to the offer letter, the salary includes the 2025 raise which makes sense from their perspective but I would effectively lose the raise from my current job, so I'd like to counteroffer and ask for a bump in the offered salary, maybe like +7 or +8%, and hope they can meet me at +5%. 

More importantly, though, is the start date. I cannot start this new job until April.

I was very aggressive in negotiating terms for my first job but I care a lot more about this new job so I don't want to screw it up.

Is it realistic to be granted a 4-5 month delayed start? Furthermore, should I even bother counter offering with an increased salary or would that be asking for too much if I'm already asking for a delay?",careeradviceaccounts,0,0.4300000071525574,9,1731908939,2024-11-18 05:48:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gtxzdi/is_asking_for_delayed_start_date_by_4_months_and/,11,2024
1gtxtgf,Please help me get out of a mindblock ,"I'm 29, working a job that can barely pay off my rent, in a company that is always having layoffs. I've worked here for almost 4 years, without a promotion, while all my colleagues (especially the men) got promoted on time or switched to better companies. And here I am, not bothered nowadays about the work assigned to me, somehow surviving Monday to Friday. I literally grinded myself in my previous team, working through weekends for bare minimum pay, and then studied my posterior off to move internally to a different position within the same company. Now I am in the team where I always wanted to be, but I think I'm burnt out now. I'm hetting the assignments I always dreamt of, but I have lost the excitement or eagerness to even work on them. I'm sitting idle most days or finding ways to avoid work. This is like su!c!de in a company like mine which is always laying off people. I'm consciously putting myself in a risky position. I don't know why this is happening to me. 

I'm busy fantasizing about delulu stuff when I should actually be at my desk. But no, I keep finding creative ways to waste my time. I do have an aim, but I have lost all the motivation I once had. The last half of this year has been so professionally unproductive for me. I've had a major escalation from my skip-level manager recently but I'm still unfazed.

I recently completed an MBA (finance concentration) but feel unfulfilled in my current role in marketing. I don't enjoy constantly driving leads, subjectives of brand building, creative direction etc, but I value stability and career growth, pay, and the parking with numbers, on strategy etc. I also hate meetings, and prefer 1:1 meeting settings. I have worked at different organizations including ones where culture was amazing.

My wife and I have two kids and stability is important for her. It is for me too but I don't want to be unhappy or on edge forever or get laid off in 50s and struggle to find a corporate role. As such, I'm looking to pivot to find something:

- Future high earning potential ($150-200k range in Canada)
- The chance to develop specialized skills and knowledge I could use to start my own business someday
- Less emphasis on meetings and brand-building

I have $50k in student debt and am looking for a path that balances family needs, financial growth, and personal fulfillment.

1gtu2vt,I’m being falsely accused of Sexual harassment while on probation,"Hello,
I just needed some advice, Bit of context,
Ive been working a new job for around 3 months, After leaving the military. On the very first day I met this girl, she seemed very bubbly and easy to get on with so we started speaking often because she would help with work or when I was stuck on something.

She is currently seeing someone and they're looking to get engaged soon. I'm currently single but was seeing someone a few months ago. We have a very good work relationship and frequently spend the best part of the day talking about work bits or just some personal stuff in our lives, around 1 month into my job, my car broke down, I live 20 min drive from my house and she drives past my road everyday to and from work.
She offers to take me home in the evenings, I gratefully accept and this has been on going for 2 months, Strictly just driving me home, nothing else.
We normally chat about work and then say goodbye. A few weeks ago, I met her boyfriend for the first time, he seemed like a cool guy, maybe not the sort of person I would hang around but none the less seems alright, though he did mention that I look like a ""neek"" or a posh boy For no reason. Again, our friendship is purely friends, nothing more, if anything we text outside of work, about other stuff in our life or I will speak about dating someone l've been speaking too. Unfortunately today this all changed.

I was in a meeting today and noticed her boyfriend was in our office, this isn't uncommon as sometimes he comes in, but today was her day off, so I wasn't really sure why he was there. As I've come out of our meeting, he has asked me if we can have a chat, We go outside and he basically said if I interrupt him, he will fuck me up. He said, I don't appreciate you speaking to my girlfriend, she doesn't like you, but feels bad for you, If I catch you speaking to her on text or in person at work, I will fucking kill you and bring all my brothers down to mess you up.
Now at this point I'm genuinely confused because I spoke to this girl the day before and she hadn't mentioned anything, he said I don't like the jokes you're making with her, she came home crying last night. Which took me by surprise because I didn't say much to her yesterday as I was in a meeting for a few hours and then left.

The last chat we had together was, I will see you next week as I'm off for the rest of the week, she wished me well etc. then I sent her a text about a girl I was on a date with about 6 hours later. She didn't message me once to say, ""Hey I didn't appreciate the joke or anything"", if she has an issue, she would address it. Now due to severalty of this I decided to block her. I'm not sure what to do, I was told to make a police report or report: our managers. Out of respect for her, I don't want to involve the police. But I think something has been misheard, coming to my place of work, I think is highly inappropriate. 

Today I was called into my managers office, they have suspended me with full pay pending investigation. She has accused me of sexual harassment. (Im guessing to protect her partner) I’m very worried as I’m currently on probation. I have a meeting with my manager and the HR officer coming up. I feel like they’re going to terminate me.

problem is that i have no idea what i want to be or do. i’ve always wanted to do medical (paticularly dermatology, plastic surgery, or being a pa) but i don’t think i can survive that much schooling. im also really worried that ill waste my 20s in school and stressed. also because im not 100% that’s what i wanna spend my life doing, and ive heard that unless you’re incredibly motivated, it won’t be worth it.

i genuinely don’t have any dreams or aspirations. if i could, i would just have an unlimited bank account and spend all day doing nothing. 

i’ve always had a very good imagination and loved english and writing, but i think looking into salaries and years of high school bs english has fizzled that out.. 

making a lot of money is also the main priority for me. i think i could be happy in any career that isn’t too much work for too little money (which i know, rare).

1gtqcda,Someone made AI generated audio of me and sent it to my manager and company,"I'd really appreciate some advice on this because I'm freaking out.

Right now I'm currently working a corporate job. Out of nowhere I got an email and text message from someone saying that they made AI generated audio of me and sent it to my manager and company.

I listed to the audio clips and it sounds realistic. They made 3 different clips of me saying incredibly offensive words towards different groups of people. They added background noises too to make it more believable and one of them has another voice to make it seem like I was having a conversation.

I don't know who this person is. Their email and phone number looks like a burner. They didn't ask me for anything either and all they said was that they hope my career is over.

I think this person might follow me on Instagram because I post videos with me talking sometimes. I also have a youtube channel of some videos from 3-4 years ago that I recorded for my classes. I'm not sure if that's how they got the audio to make it. Still, I have hundreds of followers and no suspect immediately comes to mind.

I also know that they did actually send it. They attached screenshots of the emails they sent to various company inboxes like HR. They also somehow made a connection with my manager on LinkedIn and sent it there.

What do I do? I don't think this will slip by without my company or manager saying somerthing. I haven't worked long at the company too so I'm not sure if anyone will vouch for me.",Secret-Specialist751,1,1.0,1,1731884737,2024-11-17 23:05:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gtqcda/someone_made_ai_generated_audio_of_me_and_sent_it/,11,2024

I get into a state of total panic when I even hear a notification on my phone or any unfamiliar sound from my laptop... my work has suffered greatly because of this... I feel horrible because I was so looking forward to this job and now I'm just missing deadlines and taking leave after leave. 

In December I am moving to another place and I expect things to become less intense... I was wondering if it would be okay to ask my manager for 2 weeks of unpaid leave until then because I feel terrible for constantly asking for sick leaves and a reduced workload....

Like in conversation he goes ""you're just like my wife, so XYZ (nothing nice - quick to anger, argumentative, nagging, whatever). We talk about weekend plans, he manages to complain about her. We talk about cooking, I learn what a lazy bitch she is, only cooking a couple of meals on repeat...

The first few times, I laughed it off as ""old guys banter"". Later on, I responded with ""oh, surely it isn't so bad"", ""oh, but you must be exagerrating"". For a few months now, I only respond with silence to the remarks, but the behaviour persists.

I mean, c'mon, I am not his beer buddy or ""one of the boys"", why is he telling me that? How could he possibly think that badmouthing ""a sister in womanhood"" to me is appropriate? I feel bad for her and I am losing respect towards him. How do I make him stop, without completely ruining our professional relationship? Or worse - is he ""grooming me""?

I’ve been working with a guy in the same role for almost two years now. I don’t have any major issues with him, although he’s quite dedicated to the job, so often gets very good feedback and is pretty well-liked.

We had our quarterly review, where we present on our work/targets, which is an important meeting for salary reviews, etc. I took the opportunity to get the edge on him by hiding his laptop down the side of an unused desk in the office in order to make myself look better by comparison. This worked out really well as my presentation was very well received, and it seemed like management was a little frustrated and annoyed at him for not having his laptop and being able to present. 

As of now, he hasn’t even been able to find the laptop, so had to get a new one issued by IT which I know my boss really has issues with.

Does this make me a terrible person, or was it a smart business move?",Eamon4TheStars_,0,0.5,0,1731881046,2024-11-17 22:04:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gtozrg/need_advice_on_a_situation/,11,2024

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to participate in the Erasmus program, so I don’t have the advantage of international experience but my english level is pretty good (c1 level).

1gtm2h7,~2 years HR Experience- where do I go from here?,"For some background: I am currently my healthcare company’s Talent Acquisition Specialist for our state. I have been in this role for about a year. Outside of recruitment, I have also led several project management task forces, negotiated with stakeholders, taught at supervisor/compliance trainings, etc. Just a lot of miscellaneous things that are outside TA tasks but I have done anyway lol. I was an office manager within my company for about 8 months before I was promoted. Before that, I was a store manager for a different company for about 4 years. 

While I enjoy my current TA role, the money just simply is not enough to compensate for the workload or live as comfortably as I would like to. We’re a fairly large company. I make about $39k after taxes and the cost of living in my state (AZ) is pretty high lol. That being said, I plan on moving to Ohio in May 2025 and need to:
a) Make enough money between now and then to cover moving expenses and afford my current expenses within my state 
b) Find a company that is located in both AZ and OH that would allow a smooth transition between locations. A remote position would be ideal for this reason as well.

My main issue at hand is although I have years of management/HR experience, I do not have a degree. I do intend on getting SHRM certified but intention is probably not enough to convince a company that I’m the right fit lol. I have some college years under my belt, but ended up getting very lucky with my jobs and decided to run with that instead.

Where can I go from here? Does anyone know of any companies/positions that are attainable with what I have? Are there any steps I can take between now and May that would allow myself more opportunities? I’ve considered requesting a title change from my current company but it is very unlikely that it’ll happen. I would like to have a new job by February at the latest. 

I might be overly optimistic here but I am in my mid 20s and would like to keep my momentum going within the realm of HR/management. I’m grateful for the experiences I have had, I would just like to keep reaching a little higher.

1gtlgvf,2 job offers,"I've been with my current employer (small bank) for 10 years. I work in a branch as a loan officer. My current work environment has gotten to be toxic, due to changes in upper management and office drama. I received a job offer within my company in a back office department at head quarters. I'm currently in school and thinking about a career change. This job back office is more in line with what id like to do once I have a degree. They have agreed to match my current salary. I have 5 weeks of paid vacation, great health insurance and hybrid option to work from home 1 to 2 days per week. 

The other job offer is a branch manager at commercial bank. Salary is 15k more annually. I have a friend at this company and they told me that work load is minimal and the branch is low volume. This job would definitely be much easier and higher pay. I'd have 2 weeks vacation to start and high deductible health insurance. Both employers offer tuition reimbursement. 

My family thinks it's time for me to move on from my current employer and take the job with higher pay. I've been unhappy with my job for years and took a significant pay cut this year when job positions were restructured. I was in a sales role and they did away with commission. I don't enjoy working in the branch with the general public anymore. I'm leaning towards staying with my current employer and going back office. I'm hopeful that back office isn't as toxic as my current environment. But part of me agrees that higher pay with a lower work load doesn't sound that bad, especially while I'm finishing school.

1gtjokb,Does anyone have advice/success with thriving in the good enough job and making your life fulfilled outside work?,"Background:  
I left education because of a family situation and have been applying to jobs outside the field for over a year. I live in an area where now, 15 years in, I make very good money, I have all the school holidays, original pension, and I am not a traditional classroom teacher so no grades, parents, take home work unless I want to volunteer for a committee etc. 

But...I felt awful every day. The boredom got to me, I wasn't able to enjoy life outside work, I got tired of the look on people's faces when I said I worked in a high school, and every day I felt like part of the problem. Don't get me wrong I had tons of ideas how to fix it (I'm a fixer by nature) but nobody would take me seriously and honestly anything that suggests we don't prioritize being consistent, guaranteed government funded daycare over fixing education is shut down. Anyway, I felt like I was living in The Matrix and it was unsettling.

Sadly, it didn't work, I have to have a job and it seems like in this market especially we really are viewed as babysitters with no skills. So, I am giving up.

I work on a task. Then she pretty much gaslights me, belittles me, and tries to insult my work in front of the team. I always come up with a plan, that she never bother looking at and always changes goal posts once I meet them. 

My coworkers aren't close. Which is fine. I trusted a person, who turned out to gossip about me, and tried to get into the limelight. I genuinely don't care about being noticed, as long as I can do my work and get paid on time. She hates me. It's obvious. Idk why. 

Another coworker, ignores me for the most part, which I'm thankful for. The stars must have aligned. Because he initially tried to boss me around, but backed off. 

Then, this other coworker seems like the shady guy who pretends to be nice, but is playing mind games.

1gtj2ln,Is the public sector hurting me early in my career?,"Hello, I’m currently 26, and have been working with a public sector company in Ontario, Canada since graduating with my business degree in 2021. While I do enjoy the work life balance, the ability to work from home, the government benefits / DB pension, I’m finding the work to be incredibly boring, and I feel as though I’m not learning anything that’s transferable to other jobs as my job is sort of a niche. The pay is just “okay” as well currently. I make $75k at this point in time, and should be at around $85k in 2-3 years time. After that I’ll be around $100k in the next 10 years or so. $120k - $130k would be possible later in my career. 

I feel like I’m being pigeonholed into staying with this company for my entire career as the deeper I get, the less transferable my skills become without having to start over from entry level stuff if I want to change. I’ve talked this over with friends / family and some tell me to try out new things, while the rest say I’d be a moron to give up a DB pension nowadays and would kill for that and work life balance. 

I understand I have it pretty good, I’m not struggling by any means but in today’s world $75k doesn’t get you very far. I also know I shouldn’t look to my job for satisfaction in life but I also think I should at least be doing something a little more meaningful than sending out property tax notices to homeowners just to get yelled at everyday by people who think taxes are stupid. 

I’ve sort of narrowed my options down to 3 choices…

1. Return to school for something I’m more interested in (likely a second degree part time in computer science or engineering (civil or mechanical) or an entirely different path altogether by going to school to become an aircraft mechanic)

2. Attempt to upskill with online certifications in data analytics (master excel / SQL / python etc) and use that to transfer to an analyst role in the private sector. 

3. Stay where I’m at, enjoy the benefits / pension I currently have.

1gtishm,What’s the biggest raise you’ve received without getting any additional duties?,"My workplace is small, <10 people. One guy quit for a better position, the other is getting fired at the new year, their salaries make up 110k. The guy that’s getting fired is the senior position of what I am (he actually trained me). 

Once he’s fired I’m going to ask for a (hefty) raise. Mostly because I’m underpaid, they now have the financial space for it, and they couldn’t replace me if they tried.

That being said, I’m hoping for a 10-20k raise. What is the most you’ve asked for without any extra responsibilities being given?

1gtijbr,In a field I don’t like confused on what to do next ,So basically I graduated with a degree in radiologic technology a year ago and I’ve been working as an X-ray technologist for the last year. I’m unhappy going to work everyday and I believe I’m just not passionate about what I do. I don’t like patient care and I’m not really interested in the job itself. I think healthcare is just not my thing. I would love a job where I could work from home or even something like hybrid. I classify myself as an introvert so preferably something where you don’t really have to work with other people or atleast not often. I’m just so stuck I was thinking getting an online associates in IT but I’m just so afraid of wasting my time and money again for something I will be unhappy with. I wondering if I should just enroll and try it for a semester and go from there. I could see myself working on a computer but also I wanna atleast be content with what I’m doing and not dread work everyday. I’m too young to be feeling this way and just want a big change in my life. Does anyone have any advice ??

1gtig8k,What to study?,"Hello! Next year, I plan to enroll in university, but I'm currently trying to decide what kind of education to pursue. I live in Latvia and have completed technical school, where 95% of the time was spent on writing documentation, studying math, physics, and other subjects that seemed largely irrelevant to me. Only about 5% of it was truly practical and valuable. Because of this, the idea of pursuing a Computer Science (CS) degree intimidates me—I don’t want to go through that kind of ""hell"" again.



At the moment, I work as a web developer, and I enjoy my job. However, I understand that, over time, I might need to work more with servers, networks, and DevOps areas, which I’m not particularly interested in. I’m concerned about the possibility of burnout or becoming less relevant in the job market since I’m not keen on developing further in the DevOps direction.



I’m currently considering two options:  

1. \*\*CS degree\*\*, which I know would be very beneficial for my career in IT, especially if I wanted to work abroad. It would also help me better understand DevOps topics. However, I dread the thought of going through studies where a significant portion feels unnecessary.  

2. \*\*Management degree\*\*, which could expand my career options and help me achieve higher salaries in other industries if IT is no longer my main path.  



As part of my ""Plan B,"" I’d like to try working as a real estate agent, taxi driver, or car sales consultant, as these professions appeal to me to some extent. If I pursued a management degree, it might make it easier to secure a position as an agent or sales consultant, and it could also open doors to management positions within the IT sector.



What would you recommend? Are there any educational programs that could be valuable for the IT field and also serve as a good Plan B? Or am I just overthinking this, and there’s no need to stress so much about it?

1gthq1f,Help me pick a job,"I am 22 years old, and will graduate college in 6 months with two bachelor's degrees. It took me five years to earn them both at the same time and I am still stunned that I somehow managed to do it. I double majored for two reasons-- 1) for job security and 2) because I couldn't pick between the two when I was 18, and I just never dropped one.

I think at the time I assumed a job opportunity would appear in front of me and I would know what I wanted to do by the time I was in my 20's. Long story short, I was wrong.

My first degree is in education, and I am being offered a teaching position in my hometown that is very secure-- the last time it was open was probably almost 30 years ago. The guy in the position has been talking to me about his retirement for a couple years now, and really wants me to take his job. My parents still live there, as does most of my family and my long-term girlfriend, so there's definitely a lot of security in staying there. The cost of living in this town is very low, and if I taught for 25 years I would have great retirement benefits as a state employee, and could even apply for federal student loan forgiveness. On the flip side, it's not a position I see myself staying with longterm because sometimes I find teaching to be very mentally draining. I love it, and I care about the kids in that community and their success very much, but there are times when I am shadowing him where I feel completely annoyed and exhausted. If I went with teaching, I would definitely go the administration route and work my way up the totem pole, because I just do not see myself lasting in a teaching position for 25 years. It also doesn't pay very well, but like I said before, the cost of living in that area is lower than most places so it's still a livable wage.

My second degree is kind of niche, but the best way I can describe it is kind of like a business degree that specializes in non-profit organizations. I am a total nerd when it comes to administrative work, and a part of this degree a couple years ago was that I had to complete an internship. I went out of state for a summer to do it, and I ended up completely falling in love with that organization. I had planned to stay there for just a summer and then never see those people again, but it just didn't work out that way. I just couldn't stay away. I'm going into my third year there now, and last week the CEO of our company sat down with me and let me know she's planning to offer me a job. This state is a 7 hour drive away from home. There are many pro's, like living in a state I absolutely love, for an organization I love, with TONS of opportunities to travel and network and get to know people all over the country. It's honestly something I never thought in a million years I would have in front of me. But, while they do offer insurance for full-time employees, they do not have the state employee benefits that teaching would offer. They have agreed to match whatever the education position offers me salary-wise, but the cost of living in this area is much higher, so I'm not sure that's fair. I would not be able to apply for federal student loan forgiveness, and I would be 7 hours away from my whole family. My girlfriend has said she'd consider moving with me, but that she's not open to the idea of long-distance, and I'm just not sure if we're far enough along yet for me to ask her to do that for me. There's just... a lot to consider. For both positions. And I am completely terrified.

I am so fortunate to have these opportunities. 15 year old me, as Gen Z would say, would be completely gagged. But I am so scared that one wrong move could completely screw me over.",FeelingPerspective82,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1731862011,2024-11-17 16:46:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gthq1f/help_me_pick_a_job/,11,2024

1gtgqit,Need advice on pivoting my career ,"I graduate 2 years back as a CS graduate with a lot of interest in web development. I got placed from campus in an MNC. I joined the MNC as an unpaid intern and was trained in health insurance. I left it within 2 months because there was absolutely no coding and a lot of theory to memorize. It did not align with my interests. 

Then recession came and took away everything. I interviewed for many companies which included so many start-ups but always got disqualified after the technical interview. They were happy with the take home assignment work but expected so much in the technical interviews. I tried my best but failed. 

Then after trying for 6 months in 2023 I decided to join a train and place agency for employment. They trained me on MERN for close to 8 months. Later I cracked a job offer in 2024. And was happy that finally I would get to be a developer.

4 months after working I had to leave the job due to some serious issues. So after leaving it became difficult to find jobs due to obvious reasons like gap of 2 years. So few months passed by. 

Then I came across product management internahip opportunity by accident. Out of curiosity I just applied. It was a fintech company in growth stage and I managed to go till last round and got rejected. While doing the assignment for the internship opportunity I was fascinated by what product mangers do. It was completely different from development. Here the focus was more on why and what rather than how. And to add on I liked researching too. Being curious seems to be highly rewarded in this field. 

In the past 3 months I had 3 interviews for APM /internships and got rejected.  

My question is should I keep searching for opportunities in product management with no experience and 2 year gap ? Should I really pivot? I'm genuinely interested in this field but because of the above stated reasons I'm finding it hard to stay motivated and keep searching not to mention how brutal the job market is. Genuinely looking for some assurance and advice from the community (I'm an introvert but do strive in team setup with time) . Thanks in advance.

1gtdw8r,Three job offers - Not sure which to take ,"Hello!

I have been interviewing this week for roles in Recruitment and have been offered 3 roles (I was offered 4 but turned one down) and I'm struggling to decide which one to take - Any help would be appreciated! For reference I have 3 years Recruitment experience but only in the healthcare sector.

All of the jobs are the same location wise so that doesn't matter as such. I'm also based in the UK.

Job one:

- Legal sector 
- Starting salary of 25k, after one deal it rises to 27.5k, then another deal after that it rises to 30k then that's it until promotion 
- commission starts at 10% then goes up to 50% depending on billings which is insane, but I have to bill my starting salary until I see any of it
- Never used their CRM before
- January start date 
- Pretty big company, one of the market leaders in their sector
- 8am-6pm Monday to Thursday, then 8am-12pm on Friday
- UK team that does their calls in the morning etc, US team that mainly does Linkedin/emails etc in the morning due to timezones then calls in the afternoon
- I like this one because the salary is the highest and the commission is the highest (but with a 25k threshold), 

Job two:

- Education sector
- Salary of 25k, then no increase until after promotion
- Top biller earns around 300k per year, lots of scope for big earnings with high fees
- commission wise there is no threshold so my first deal I would be billing, commission starts at 10% then up to 30%
- I have experience using their CRM and really like it
- January start date
- Big company but only founded 6 years ago however they're growing at a rapid rate, one of the market leaders 
- 8am-6pm Monday-Thursday, 8am-4pm Friday
- Big social media presence, do a lot of charity work, B corp certified 
- The reason I like this one mainly is for the overall vibe and feel for the company - The whole recruiting process was amazing, everyone is really nice and it has a big family feel, they like to mold people into who they want to be and really progress them in their career. Lots of awards won 

Job three:

- IT and Tech sector
- Salary of 25k, no increase until after progression
- Commission wise similar to above, 5k threshold on perm, no threshold on temp, up ti 30%
- I have experience using their CRM and really like it
- ASAP start date (likely week after next)
- Small company - Only founded June this year, only the director and one other person working there so far. Plans to grow up to 5 heads by Jan
- Even though it's a small company, the director has really invested into big tools to be able to help them succeed, and is a really laid back guy
- 8:30-5:30pm Monday-Friday
- My personal favourite office out of the three (Barista on site)
- The reason I like it is because the sector and market he told me I'd be working on sounds really interesting, and he told me he wants someone with experience such as myself who can eventually down the line have their own team and really grow in the role long term so good scope foe progression on it.

1gtcmju,Burned out,"I've been in the veterinary industry for 6+ years now, primarily in an administrative capacity. 

I'm a rehire at my current place of employment, but I find that there is less accountability and consideration for me as an employee. 

I have one coworker who in the little time that I've been there is constantly calling out. They recently went on what I suspect was a vacation when I was obligated to work five consecutive shifts, and when they're on site, they're constantly taking trips to the store, or babysitting my office manager's grandchild, and socializing with coworkers in the back in between exam times. They're constantly late, which in turn places the bulk of the morning duties on me (ie. Morning register, clearing emails, patient call backs, referrals, labs, appointment confirmations, pulling charts etc.). By the time they arrive, everything is done.

There's no use addressing this with our office manager for the reasons already cited. We received notice that we should arrive on time for our shifts, but that hasn't been followed through on by anyone. Furthermore, communication with my office manager is hit or miss. It's effectively an ""Oh you'll figure it out."" Of course I know that these are my responsibilities, and I do them diligently, but I find that my reliability is being taken advantage of under the circumstances. As long as the task gets done, that's what matters.

I am a junior studying economics at unc chapel hill. I have no work experience in the field. The only thing I have is that I am familiar with financial statements and stuff that is stocks related. But that’s it

My gpa Is 2.8. I neglected college becuase I dint really want to go but my family said I have to so I did. But I neglected college and worked like doordash and at the dinning hall. I put all the money I made into stocks becuase that’s what I am actually jnterested in.

Now I understand how important gpa is. Most hiring companies want someone with 3.5 gpa and experience. 

I hope that the people that are older than me and have experienced more can give me any word of advice. My goal is landing an economic related internship like I am willing to do anything becuase my family really want me to get an internship.

1gtcaou,a manager doesn’t like me for no reason? ,"I’m not sure what to do, I started working at a small family business 4 months ago, the work is good, my co workers and alot of the managers are also good, but there’s one manager for another department that doesn’t like me, or atleast seems like she doesn’t, for no reason at all, and im not sure what to do. 

she’s teased and poked fun at me, generally just an unfriendly presence, will come over to check on me and make sure i’m not doing anything wrong even though it’s not her responsibility whatsoever. 

i’ve noticed she hangs around other people she’s “friends with”s work spaces a lot, but no one ever does the same for her. she was away afew weeks ago for over a week, and no one mentioned or said anything about her the whole time. she seems to just insert herself into peoples cliques. 

people have called her “scary” etc before, so maybe it’s just how she is when you don’t know her well, but i don’t know. I’m unable to go to the boss as they’re very close and i’m not sure she’d listen. 

is there anything i can do? or any ways to even help cope with it even lol. any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you",destroyaa2,4,0.8299999833106995,2,1731845706,2024-11-17 12:15:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gtcaou/a_manager_doesnt_like_me_for_no_reason/,11,2024
1gtbq3p, Is it better to reject offer or don't go to the technical interview? ,"I live in country A and I have applied for several positions in a company. This company has offices in many countries, including country A (where I am currently located) and country B (a country I could see myself moving to, but I have no idea about the salaries and cost of living).

A recruiter from this company contacted me regarding some positions in country B. During the interview, she informed me about the salaries, cost of living and other information about the position and then we scheduled a technical interview. After processing all the information I got, I decided that moving to country B is not worth it, at least at this moment.

The technical interview is in a few days and I was wondering what is the best strategy regarding my situation. I don't want to move to country B, so I don't want to accept an offer for any position if I am offered one, but I also don't want to close the door on any opportunities that may arise in the same company in country A (the recruiter in country A is a different person, but I think they know each other).

So, as I see it, there are two options,

* Attend the technical interview (and subsequent rounds) and if I get an offer, decline it.
* Cancel the technical interview.

I hope it's clear enough :) Thanks in advance",Sethplinx,0,0.5,4,1731843431,2024-11-17 11:37:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gtbq3p/is_it_better_to_reject_offer_or_dont_go_to_the/,11,2024

I'm a chemical engineer, graduated 2020
Got an office job for the government/public, in environmentals department since 2020.

I wanted to stay maximum 3 years then change to an actual engineering job in industry, but it's been 4 years and no luck,  they keep wanting either industry experience or fresh graduates.

Not sure what to do from here tbh? I expected I'd be somewhere else, and not gonna lie I feel brain dead it's just a mundane repetitive job, the best projects I managed to get involved in were intl treaties but they ended so I got that exp at least

And honestly my thing with private sectors is they got great development plans but in public there's barely any

I figured do FE to refresh my mind, but I don't need it? So idk if that's useful 

I figured do BOSH NEBOSH OSHA certificates, but again, not really useful to my job

I also thought to go back to school for engineering masters and phd, but again it's not useful here

So I thought I'll take a graduate certificate in environmental science and test the waters from there onto what masters and phd I'd want, but at least it'll develop me somehow? And it'll be useful in the job

Completely blind here, didnt expect this. Help me shed some light please. Thank you.

1gtb957,Worried about my politics being discovered at a government job,"I have been applying for jobs in my city’s government administration (nothing partisan just civil service/social work). But I have a nagging concern that I can’t seem to get over. I am a conservative and live in one of the most liberal cities in the country. And I figured that since it’s a job in government, politics will inevitably come up. I’m usually honest with my views as I don’t believe it’s right to lie about such things. And even when I don’t talk, people can piece together roughly what I think.

If/when I do get a job, I worry that people will find out about my political opinions and it will be harder to make friends/get along with my coworkers and it may potentially jeopardize my chances of promotion.

Is this fear unfounded? If not, how can I navigate potentially being completely surrounded by people with completely opposite view points if politics comes up? Should I just shut up and play stupid?

1gt9g0i,Do you want to resign?,"Here’s a little advice I’d like to share, especially for fresh grads navigating their first jobs. Starting your first job as a fresh graduate can be a whirlwind—surprising, overwhelming, and sometimes downright exhausting. It's often nothing like what you expected, and for some, the initial challenges might make quitting seem like the easiest option. But here’s the truth: most workplaces come with their own share of difficulties. While there are companies with great environments, finding them can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.  

I’ve been there myself. Since graduating in 2022, I’ve worked at five different companies in just two years. At first, it wasn’t too bad—most employers understood I was a fresh grad still figuring things out. But now, with more fresh grads entering the workforce and my resume showing a pattern of frequent job changes, finding a new role has become much harder, especially a work-from-home one.  

When I was unemployed for a month, with bills piling up and no savings to fall back on, I had a wake-up call. I kept jumping ship whenever things got tough, thinking the grass would be greener somewhere else. Looking back, I couldn’t help but think: “What if I had stayed longer, remained optimistic, and worked harder to excel in my first or second company?” Two years could have been enough time to earned a promotion, gained deeper expertise, or made a real impact. But instead, I kept choosing the easiest way out—if it was hard, I left; if it was inconvenient, I left; if it was toxic, I left.  

Now, I’m staying put in my current company—not just because I love it, but because I’ve learned the hard way how difficult it can be to land a new role once you’ve developed a history of job-hopping.  

So before you decide to resign, ask yourself: “Do you really need to leave, or are you just looking for peace of mind?” Because chances are, the next company may have its own challenges, and you might find yourself repeating the same cycle I did. It’s worth thinking through.",Physical_Sky5093,19,0.8299999833106995,24,1731833308,2024-11-17 08:48:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gt9g0i/do_you_want_to_resign/,11,2024
1gt8w8b,How do i move on from abusive boss?,"Hello reddit
I recently ended my apprenticeship in a company ive been working at for almost 3 years. I work in carpentry and I have approximatly 4 months left before u have a full education as a carpenter. For the past 3-4 Months my former boss has been massively emotionel and verbally abusive towards a couple of colleagues and myself. There has been lots of new people coming in and out of the company, so lot of the past 3 years has been mainly me and former boss working together. 
Anyways, so for the past 3-4 Months my former boss has basically been tormenting us, which caused 2 of my colleagues to leave the company a couple of months ago, and a young new apprentice of ours to leave work crying to never return. I left shortly aften.

Things he'd do regularly:
- Micromanage every screw and every cut
- Complain about employees to other employees
- Compare us to each other/try to put us up against each other
- Throw tantrums where he basically picks you apart for literally an hour straight (once 3 hours almost). And will afterwards give you a ""treat"". Tell you he thinks you are really good at what you do and that he can help you become the best. That it wont make any difference to switch to another company, because it will basically be the same. The grass is always greener....yada yada..
- Show us how to do certain things, then get mad because he want things done differently than the way he showed us.
- Overcomplicate simple tasks so nobody understands, then tells us how even his 14 year old kid could understand said task
-Threaten to getting booted everytime a mistake is made

At this point im starting at a new company and im filled with dread, because i no longer feel confident in my abilities or capable of performing, or learning, like i used to. I feel ive lost everything i used to love about the trade and fear same treatment from my new boss. I dont want to start my new job with this mentality and potentially screwing everything up for myself...
Hope someone can give me some advice. I'd love to hear your stories as well.

Thanks a lot

1gt81ce,How do I control the anxiety around public perception?,"I’ve recently started my own business selling high value products. I have a background in high-level executive management and consider myself a very resilient person. I’ve never worried about the opinions of other people and find I am very confident and comfortable in my own skin. 

Since starting my business, negative feedback really gets to me. Badly. For instance, if a product fails and the customer yells at me, or takes it out on me, either in person or online, I take it really personally. It just hurts me. It’s not a choice, I just can’t help letting it get to me all of a sudden. I’m constantly anxious about things going wrong or being disliked (hated) by my customers. People can be so brutal. And by anxious, I mean anxiety freaking radiating off me like static electricity, all the time, especially when Im trying to sleep. If I could hook up a lightbulb to myself I could power it with anxiety. I feel like I’m on the verge of a panic attack 24/7. I’m even constantly worried about how my staff perceive me or what they think of me. I’ve never cared for being like before, so what’s changed now?

Now, so many people must be in the same situation as me but worse. Politicians and influencers are two examples. Those groups must have entire followings of haters. 
So what do they do to let the negativity, hate and anxiety bounce off them? 

I need suggestions. I’m ready to close business over this. ",Tinkererering,1,1.0,0,1731827067,2024-11-17 07:04:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gt81ce/how_do_i_control_the_anxiety_around_public/,11,2024

1gt7n1v, Seeking Advice: Should I stay or look for a new job in Japan?or try to stick it out for a year? Or try for jobs in other countries ,"

I’m currently working at a good company in Japan. The salary and work-life balance are fine, but I’m struggling with job satisfaction. I studied engineering and  was hired for a technical role but was placed in a team where focus is not on programming  , I had a perception that engineering role meant programming but that wasn't it , it's feels non technical to me but my colleagues consider what they are doing to be technical, the job description asked for programming knowledge in various languages which they don't even really use. I’ve been told opportunities in my desired field would happen soon and I can transition at that time but after shifting here I realised soon meant it'll take 4-5 years to materialize here so it feels I'm wasting my time.

Additionally, I’m in a team where no one speaks English, and I’m struggling to communicate effectively  I'm at N4 level as asked by the company but ofc it isn't enough.
My peers are in English-speaking teams, and this makes me feel isolated and limits my growth.

I want to work in a role related to my degree, but I worry about the negative perception of changing jobs within a year in Japan, And this is my first ever job so I don't want to create an impression that I can't stay in a job for long.

Would it be better to stay and wait for internal opportunities or start applying elsewhere? I’d appreciate any advice from those with similar experiences in Japan or in transitioning roles early in their careers.

problem is, i have 0 idea of what to do as a career.

i’m in 2 classes this semester: HVAC and forensic science. i like both, i just hate the way im treated in my HVAC class, if i mess up in the slightest i am laughed at and i know people are judging me for being a woman and taking the class.

i don’t like dealing with death, so forensic science would not be for me. as interesting as it is, it’s a pass.

i’ve always been good at school, i’m a strong writer. science has been my strong suit, and i like math because of it having one answer. i like money and doing stuff with money. i work as a cashier and the service desk at kroger and i like handling money. 

i’m not a people person, it’s very draining to work with the general public. i am also autistic. 

i like a lot of things. art, writing, cars, and music. there’s money in maybe dealing with cars. i would like to design cars and help improve them but from what i hear in engineering it is hard to get a job.

1gt2o1v,I have ADA accommodations that have not been working and they blindsided me with mutual separation,"I have bipolar disorder and it significantly effects my ability to come in to the office some days. I've had the same position for almost 4 years (3 years at a previous company and almost 1 year at my current). I've been in a depressive episode for most of my time at this new job and I have accommodations to be able to work from twice a month but I often need more than that. They suggested applying for a new role within the company and I did. I was interviewed twice, the last one being 1.5 hrs long. I was so confident about it and it was a hybrid role so it would have worked so much better for me. I hadn't heard back in 3 weeks and when I finally got the news they're not interested, I was also met with a mutual separation agreement affective immediately.

I was in complete shock when I found out I didn't get the job because my interview went so well, the hiring manager was talking as if I was already apart of the team. I never considered the ""last resort"" ADA accommodation of reassignment. But now I feel like even if I do get a written request from my doctor for it, they're not going to put me in that position because they're looking for other candidates.

I feel as though my disability is too much of a hassle for this company and they just want to get rid of me instead of trying to work through different accommodations. 

They didn't give me enough time, and they sold me this agreement as what is best for me, but it isn't. I like where I work and I liked my manager. I knew that the role wasn't a good fit and there was another role that was. Should I even try getting a reassignment request from my doctor?

1gt2fda,kpop group order manager — what should i pursue as a career & in college?,"hi! high school senior here. been hosting kpop group orders for around 2 years now. little insight on it here to explain what it is (taken from chatgpt):

>*A* ***K-pop Group Order Manager*** *coordinates the purchase and distribution of exclusive merchandise for fans worldwide, managing logistics, finances, and marketing. This role develops key skills for careers in entertainment project management, merchandise operations, and global logistics. Responsibilities include supply chain coordination, cost optimization, and fan engagement, aligning with roles like merchandise planner, event manager, or marketing specialist within the K-pop industry.*

for college, hospitality management and business management/entrepreneurship are two of my interests, however i am also looking into international business given my experience, interest, and dedication to my work as a group order manager, possibly with a minor in supply chain management/focus in marketing.

my only issue with international business is that the general consensus seems to be that it's a useless degree for careers after college. with the need for efficiency and fluency in a second language, i would assume i'd need to take off running in order to set myself up for success in this major. not sure how much room i'd have to turn around if i decide to drop this, or change my mind some time into college to pick it up.

it would be a dream to convert this hobby into a career considering how many hours i've spent doing it. i would also love to work abroad, but i'm just curious what careers could stem from pursuing international business. should i be looking into something else entirely?",throwaway29576245,5,0.8600000143051147,0,1731806951,2024-11-17 01:29:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gt2fda/kpop_group_order_manager_what_should_i_pursue_as/,11,2024

1gt1ps9,Over a year - No CS Job,"Here is my background:
In California.
Currently in my mid 20s.
I obtained my bachelors in Computer Science with a concentration in Game Development over a year ago.
I have only 2-3 internships from a nonprofit organization called CodeDay - Open Source Projects.
Most of my undergraduate projects are game development related (I have 1-2 projects with web development and software development but they aren't as big)
I took 3 months after graduating focusing on finding a CS related job. Only got like 2 interviews each month.
Got a part time job as a Customer Service Associate. Still continued to look for a CS related job but I definitely slowed down on my job search.
Got fired after 6-7 months for breaking company policy (I stopped someone from stealing).
Took another 3 months searching for a CS related job but also took an IT related course  on Coursera to hopefully strengthen my resume (no interviews).
Got a full time job as a Front Desk Agent.
Still searching for a CS/IT related job since... (recently just got an interview for an IT position but didn't get the job because of my lack of experience/knowledge)

With that mentioned:
My current job is really nice but I've been feeling depressed thinking that I've wasted 4 years of my life for nothing. I have quite a bit of money saved and I am living with my parents. I've been thinking of just outright quitting my job to full sending my focus on finding a CS related job and doing some projects. Although, knowing myself I wouldn't know where to start when it comes to making projects. At the beginning of my CS education, I felt really passionate learning all the technologies I was being presented. However, I now feel overwhelmed and don't know where to start. Especially since my CS knowledge is obviously degrading as more time passes by.

I don't know what to do anymore and while it makes me happy that I recently just got employee of the month at my current job, it makes me feel disappointed that I am still not utilizing my computer science degree. At this point I am just venting...",MasonJason23,3,0.7200000286102295,4,1731804783,2024-11-17 00:53:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gt1ps9/over_a_year_no_cs_job/,11,2024

1gt1cwq,Should I reach out to the hiring manager? ,"Should I contact the hiring manager? 

I recently interviewed for a company that I, under a completely different project, went through a RIF with a month ago. 

As part of our off-boarding, it was mentioned that (as our direct supervisors were also going through the RIF) we would be given a number to provide prospective jobs with if we needed a reference/employment verification etc. 

(This is where it gets confusing) 

I assumed that this previous number was just for employment verification ie. “Did this person work here? For how long?” etc. 

So I asked my supervisor if I could list her as a reference - she responds that she’s not able to as discussed in the meeting where they provided the number. I’m confused but kind of shrugged it off because I already had a job lined up and was just asking for a reference as a fall back. 

She comes back like a week later and drops in the group chat for the entire team that we can list her boss on any applications we do. A coworker asked if we should use the number provided to us or her boss’ direct line (let’s call her Betty.) She responds that either is fine. 

Skip ahead to now - the job fell through (funding hadn’t been approved for the position.) So now I’m back to applying. I did an interview for the same company I just left (where Betty still works) and (as I understood it) listed her as one of my references. 

Now I’m panicking because one of my other references just got back to me - the questions are not the type that Betty would be able to answer (I’ve never worked with her - she was my boss’ boss.) I’m blaming it on desperation for not thinking this through but I genuinely thought the questions would be more to the tune of “what was this person’s position?/how long did they work there” sort of stuff that all jobs have to answer for employment verification ie. I didn’t ask before I listed her because I thought it was for employment verification purposes ie. “Can we call this employer?” etc. 

How would you approach this? I *really* need this job. Betty still works there and (GET THIS) is the hiring manager’s supervisor as well. She asked me during the interview if I knew Betty well because that’s her boss (this really should have clued me in lol.) 

Seeing as my other two references received their employment verification emails - I’m assuming she did as well. 

I’m very concerned by how unprofessional this looks that I 1. listed my previous supervisor’s boss as my character reference without informing her and 2. Now need to email both her and the hiring manager about my mistake.

1gt110b,"I regretfully lost my job, quite stressed but also wondering if this could be a blessing in disguise","Throwaway for some reasons

Not long ago, I was under investigation at work which led to them finding that I have breached the contract (serious misconduct). I was behaving in such a way because I thought I wouldn't be caught, I was a good employee performance wise and I probably went overboard with it. Expecting termination based on evidence and my admission, I instead ended up resigning before the final decision was made as that will sound better than being fired. It was sad because it was a good job for me and my personality, it was flexible and I was getting paid decently.

I have a mortgage and bills, but thankfully I am a frugal person and have my partner and a decent amount in savings to fall back on if needed.

On the other hand, I was also lucky enough to have landed a temporary backup job straight away while I search for my next role. This is a warehouse pick packing job instead of my usual corporate and it feels a bit demeaning to me but I was desperate to take anything for some income for now. I have also applied to as many suitable jobs in the meantime.

I did my first shift at the warehouse and it was not too bad, I felt it was a nice change of pace from being in the computer all day, however its definitely not something I want to do career wise.

I spoke to my partner and we were discussing the possibility for me to learn a new skill through completely different entry level roles and I thought it was a good idea as my work experience from the past 8 years is almost quite niche and I was lowkey getting bored of the role.

To remain optimistic, I was considering if I should seek other opportunities within this warehouse role as I learn more about it and also to find some basic data entry roles through connections. It would definitely be a good idea to expand my skills so I have more roles to apply for.

Is it worth taking a temporary pay cut while I expand my skills through this warehouse role or something else? Should I also continue signing up for roles relevant to my field? My priority is to land a permanent job as soon as possible (and its hard in this market) but at the same time I want to gain new skills.",AwayCalendar5389,2,0.75,2,1731802716,2024-11-17 00:18:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gt110b/i_regretfully_lost_my_job_quite_stressed_but_also/,11,2024
1gt0qa4,Do I reach out to my old boss? ,"Hello all, 

I need some general advice about to handle this situation. So I have been with this company for the past year as a part-time employee and I really love my job. This job is high energy  and requires a lot of networking and interpersonal relationships. I absolutely love it and my reviews have always been great in my previous part time position. 

 I recently had the opportunity to interview for a full time position and I got it. I’ve been there for the past month and the vibes have been friendly with my new team and we are all supportive of each other. Admittedly I am not perfect am learning further job responsibilities but I think that’s part of learning a new position. 

However, my concerns about this position are getting more and more extreme. 

Firstly, almost two months into my position my boss conveniently keeps “missing our appointments” to finish my onboarding. 

Secondly, My boss has made numerous snide remarks about my education level (I have a BS, while most have a masters degree) 

Thirdly, My boss has also critiqued everything about me to the point my coworkers are starting to comment on her treatment of me. She’s corned me multiple times and commented things from my laugh to my personality being aggravating to her to my face. 

Fourthly, my immediate supervisor (the person below the manager) has come to me and let me know that I need to keep my head down because she’s also concerned about some of the comments she’s heard about me from her. 

My question is, my old boss (who has seniority over her) reached out to me and asked me if I wanted to set a meeting to talk over how things are going. Would it be wise to bring up these difficulties to her? Or should I just start applying to other jobs? HR is generally useless in this company and I don’t see the point in even contacting them. I am just exhausted of this treatment. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",Ill-Macaroon9807,3,1.0,12,1731801841,2024-11-17 00:04:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gt0qa4/do_i_reach_out_to_my_old_boss/,11,2024
1gszfkm,Would you stay with your current employer for a potential promotion or leave for a new opportunity?,"I always love reading career 'dilemmas' so I thought I'd submit mine! 

I'm in a bit of a career pickle (again!), so I’m curious about which offer you would take. Obviously not basing my decision on Reddit haha, but I find the responses interesting!

For context: I’m 25 and have been working in advertising for 7 years. I currently work at a large company (where I’ve been for 2 years) and was recently told by the SVP that he plans to promote me into a global role next year, reporting directly to him. The delay is because he wants to give our new manager a few months to settle in before making any changes. 

HOWEVER, while scrolling on LinkedIn (sometimes I can't help myself!). I came across a similar role to my current one, at a cool brand that’s remote first (1 mandatory office day per month), which would save me a ton in travel. I applied, got the offer, and now I’m deciding. 

* **Current role:** £43k salary, plus freelancing which brings my gross income to \~£53k. I commute to the office 4 days a week, costing me around £3k annually. I also get an annual 3-5% pay rise.
* **New offer:** £45k base salary, with the potential for a 10% annual bonus (dependent on personal and company performance). It’s remote-first, so I’d save \~£3k in travel costs, and I’d likely have more time for freelancing. Gross income could go up to \~£59k assuming I get the full bonus and maintain my freelance workload.

  
Stay with current employer 

Pros 

* Said future promotion would report into SVP, a lot to learn and have guidance from 
* I'm comfortable at the company, get along with everyone and enjoy my job 
* A global role would look great on my CV 
* Global side of the business is growing massively, with lots of new roles so I shouldn't impacted by restructures

  
Cons

* Not sure when exactly this 'promotion' will happen and how much the salary would be 
* Potentially working outside of regular hours due to time zones and more hours 
* 4 days per week in the office 
* Intense office politics, and wider redundancies every year and many people I speak to seem to be searching for new jobs/want to leave 
* 6 heads of departments have left in 6 months after long tenures which I find worrying



Take the new job 

Pros 

* Cool brand and company which allows me to do more in-house marketing in the long run
* Payrise and remote, with the potential to work a 9-day fortnight 
* More time for my hobbies and the opportunity to work anywhere in the world 2 months of the year

  
Cons

* Feels a little more like a sideways step in my career
* Potentially turning down a promotion by jumping ship now
* Will need to build up relationships again, which may be harder being remote 

  
So... I'm curious what would you go with?

1gszaqz,Bad bad boss,"Hello reddit
I recently ended my apprenticeship in a company ive been working at for almost 3 years. I work in carpentry and I have approximatly 4 months left before u have a full education as a carpenter. For the past 3-4 Months my former boss has been massively emotionel and verbally abusive towards a couple of colleagues and myself. There has been lots of new people coming in and out of the company, so lot of the past 3 years has been mainly me and former boss working together. 
Anyways, so for the past 3-4 Months my former boss has basically been tormenting us, which caused 2 of my colleagues to leave the company a couple of months ago, and a young new apprentice of ours to leave work crying to never return. I left shortly aften.

Things he'd do regularly:
- Micromanage every screw and every cut
- Complain about employees to other employees
- Compare us to each other/try to put us up against each other
- Throw tantrums where he basically picks you apart for literally an hour straight (once 3 hours almost). And will afterwards give you a ""treat"". Tell you he thinks you are really good at what you do and that he can help you become the best. That it wont make any difference to switch to another company, because it will basically be the same. The grass is always greener....yada yada..
- Show us how to do certain things, then get mad because he want things done differently than the way he showed us.
- Overcomplicate simple tasks so nobody understands, then tells us how even his 14 year old kid could understand said task
-Threaten to getting booted everytime a mistake is made

At this point im starting at a new company and im filled with dread, because i no longer feel confident in my abilities or capable of performing, or learning, like i used to. I feel ive lost everything i used to love about the trade and fear same treatment from my new boss. I dont want to start my new job with this mentality and potentially screwing everything up for myself...
Hope someone can give me some advice. I'd love to hear your stories as well.

Thanks a lot

What duty do I have to always be networking, going to events, shaking hands, volunteering, applying for higher level roles, moving for work, etc.? 

I am 38M and a new manager. I am a registered professional, white collar type work. I'm satisfied with where I am. I don't really care for networking. I also don't really know how I got where I am professionally or where my motivations really came from. It's almost as if I have been going with the flow of career advancement, gaining more education, chasing more money and responsibility, but I don't know if that's really what I want. I feel burnt out. It has caused me a lot of stress, although it's getting better now that I'm settling in. But I'm now wondering where I see myself in 5-10 years. Will I just carry on and stress myself out more to take on more responsibility for more money. I would rather just play golf and have more time for my family lol. I like what I do for the most part, and it could be a hell of a lot worse, but just wondering if it's okay to settle into my role and do an adequate job until retirement. Is that sad?

There is a chapter of the professional organization that I'm part of that host events all the time. I'd rather just stay home, but do feel that I have a responsibility for my current role to be connected with others in the industry. I don't want to isolate myself. I may need these people at some point. 

I also am looking at LinkedIn and see the president of prof. organization writing books, going to retreats in Europe, presenting at conferences all over the place.

1gsvuao,"White collar, blue collar, or..?","I’m from the U.K. (20M). We don’t usually use these terms but seeing that there’s a lot of US peeps here. 

I find it quite difficult to adjust to a set career since leaving college/high school (at 18). I’m not sure what I want to do career wise.

I have so many aspirations and goals yet I’m afraid of not achieving them because I’ll be stuck in some sort of office. Not sure if I’d enjoy it. I know I can always change though.

But I’m looking towards breaking through into the law industry to become a solicitor hopefully. But law itself doesn’t travel. I love to travel and aspire to live abroad in my other country. 

I also have this inclination to do a skilled labour/manual job. With the potential to start my own business. Since being into entrepreneurship.

My interests include both physical work but also intellectually engaging work. I would love a job to be a “digital nomad”, make good money and be flexible. I’m not sure of how I can achieve this.

I’ve been taught to become a professional, since I possess the potential—having been told—and a background in business as a subject.

So I’m just finding it hard to balance my interests and opportunities. Provided that time is moving on and I haven’t decided yet, so I’m wasting a lot of really valuable time and potential—further frightening me. 🙃",neznam47,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1731787871,2024-11-16 20:11:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gsvuao/white_collar_blue_collar_or/,11,2024

I'm from the Middle East and recently moved to Malaysia for a job (2.5 years so far). However, I've had enough of the constant bullying and targeting, which has led to severe burnout and depression. I've taken several days off to escape this toxic work environment, but I fear that I may be fired as I cannot provide concrete evidence.

Leaving on the spot could hinder my ability to return to Malaysia or obtain visas for other countries, as I need to finalize my taxes and avoid potential visa issues.

1gsug0j,Any ideas? ,"Hello, just looking for career advice. For my background, I graduated with a BA in English while minoring in Sociology. I intended to teach with this degree but substituted during college and realized quickly it was not for me. Still, I wanted to finish my degree but had no idea what to change it to so I just finished the English track. I have been out of college for about a year and a half and have been in the same retail job I do not want to be in for the rest of my life. I enrolled at my local community college hoping that I could do an AS in Sonography but don't think I could complete it since it requires a full-time commitment between clincals/classes and I am unable to go down to part-time in my job at any point as I have to support myself still. So, I am stuck. I am willing to go back to school for an AS, I can't really go into a master's program due to the expenses. I am looking for a track where I can have a M-F type of schedule, out of retail/being on call, and make a decent amount of $ for one person. I currently make about $35k a year, I would hope to make somewhere around 50k, or more. I have been looking at programs at my community college and found the AS in criminology interesting, as well as broadcasting, and medical options. However, I don't want to choose something that will just be another piece of paper and I don't want to choose something that requires a time commitment I can't do. So, any ideas? Whether it's an AS, something I could do with my BA, etc.. I am open to hear all. Please be kind, I am trying but lost. Thank you.

1gsu0vp,Hitting a Ceiling at a Job I Love,"I have a completely remote position in which all metrics that our department uses to track performance shows that I’m the top performer (out of 9 people that do the same thing as me). While I have a reputation as a ridiculously hard worker, I can actually do my job well enough to where I get plenty of free time during the day to focus on hobbies and chores around the house and still out perform everyone else. The work-life balance that this provides is amazing. My biggest issue is that I lost the office politics game a long time ago and am a bit of an outsider to the people that matter the most. I got a disorder in my late 20s called schizoaffective bipolar, which heavily impacted my social skills. However, I’m what doctors consider to be “recovered” since 8mos ago, meaning I’m symptom free off my meds. I can slowly feel my confidence coming back, and thus am improving socially as well.

At this point though, I believe I’ve pretty much hit my ceiling at this company. I’ve been here a little over 3yrs, and while I have been able to use my performance to leverage a couple of promotions, I highly doubt I’ll ever get another one in the future. I’m currently making 78k in a HCOL area, but recently asked for a raise because it’s a highly opportunistic time. Some people were recently promoted, and I feel it’d reflect negatively on them if they lose their top performer so soon into their new roles. I asked for more, but believe I’ll probably get about 5k. This will probably be the last significant raise I’ll ever get here.

I guess at this point my biggest issue is that I feel like I can achieve more with my confidence and social skills coming back. I’ve performed well at other companies too, so I don’t believe this to be a fluke. It’s a tough pill to swallow that I may have hit a ceiling in my early 30s, especially considering that I took my time in college, received 2 bachelor’s and graduated in my mid-late 20s, so I’ve only been in the professional work force for about 6yrs. However, I love my work-life balance and my wife does pretty well for herself, so we live comfortably from a financial standpoint. I can also honestly say that I’m a genuinely happy person on a day to day basis. On one hand, I feel like the point of a job is to give you the ability to be happy in your personal life, which I definitely am. On the other hand, I’m worried that I’ll regret staying stagnant in my career as I get older. Any thoughts or advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated as I’m extremely conflicted with this situation.",OddSurprise9056,3,1.0,0,1731782917,2024-11-16 18:48:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gsu0vp/hitting_a_ceiling_at_a_job_i_love/,11,2024

1gst5m7,Feeling Stuck in My Career: How I Found a Way Forward,"  
Early this year, I found myself in a tough spot. As VP of Product at insuretech in India on the path to IPO, everything was laser-focused on profitability. And while I completely understood the importance of that goal, it came with a cost—innovation was put on hold. That was hard to swallow because innovation was what I loved most about my work.

I started feeling drained. Every day felt like I was just going through the motions. I kept asking myself, *Is this it? Is this what my career is going to look like now?* I felt stuck and unsure of how to move forward.

Eventually, I decided I couldn’t keep feeling this way, so I reached out to a career coach. Honestly, it felt a bit awkward at first—I didn’t even know what I wanted to ask. But during that conversation, something clicked. The coach helped me step back and reflect on what excited me, what I was curious about, and what kind of impact I wanted to have in the future.

That’s when I realized I’d been fascinated by AI for a while but never gave myself the time to explore it. So, I decided to dive in. I started learning—taking courses, reading, even experimenting with small projects on the side. It felt like a spark was reignited.

Not only did this shift give me new energy, but it also gave me fresh ideas to bring back to my organization. I started looking for ways AI could support our strategic goals while keeping a sense of creativity alive in our work. It was like I could finally see a path forward, one that excited me again.

This experience taught me something valuable: It’s so important to have a clear vision for your career and to carve out time to reflect on where you’re headed. Even just an hour a month can help you recalibrate and rediscover what matters to you. And these days, there are AI-based tools that can guide you through this process if you’re not sure where to start.

If you’ve been feeling stuck, I encourage you to give it a try. Here’s one I came across recently: [https://promptbase.com/prompt/career-clarity-coach-vision-path-goal-2](https://promptbase.com/prompt/career-clarity-coach-vision-path-goal-2)

1gssuqs,Missed Job Opportunity and Drowning in Regret,"Hi,

I would appreciate any and all advice and warm, reassuring words.

Recently I passed up a job opportunity that was perfect at this stage in my life. It was a service position that was a perfect fit for where I am. All my intuition told me this was where I should go.

Why did I pass it up? After I was offered the position, I allowed fear and anxiety of finding housing in a small town get in the way of my life goals. I panicked and declined the offer after accepting. It was an amazing opportunity.

Instead, I decided to stay at my current job which was in my comfort zone. I was lucky to get my job back, and I have a step down from what I had because I put in my two weeks notice, only to come crawling back.

After I declined the offer, somebody reached out to me to rent a room. Everything fell into place perfectly...but I was not patient enough. My faith in myself was weak.

I feel terrible. I was doing well in life and now I am backsliding.

I am grateful I still have a job, but it will not provide me the growth that I was planning. Now, I am deeply regretful and hurt.

Yes, there are many opportunities out there and life will guide me towards something else. But this position was perfect timing and is not typical of what you would find.

For those wondering, it was a 10 month AmeriCorps position. It would have given me what I was looking for.

I made a poor decision out of fear of the unknown even though I thought staying at my current job made sense. I chose the easier path for no reason.

How can I NOT be hard on myself for missing out on an amazing and unique opportunity?

1gssmqh,Sidelined from leadership role,"Last year, I joined an engineering consultancy firm in a senior management role. Few months ago, I was assigned to a project, with the understanding that it would be a leadership role. For a bit background, the client is a government entity and the project is in litigation due to a dispute with previous contractor. So, the client has new consultants and contractors on board to take the project forward after more than 2 years of stoppage.

The entire project leadership on client's side has practically no experience in executing large projects, come across as incompetent and their work culture is toxic and bureaucratic. Not surprised that things went downhill with their previous contractor.

So enter my consultancy firm. Over the past few months I have helped them on a range of topics, helped furnish their procedures and work-practices as they enter into a new contract with a different construction firm. But I noticed that their leadership presents all of my work as if they developed it, without acknowledging me. And they quickly filled all the leadership roles with their own employees.

The client has this integrated project leadership approach where consultants and their employees work together to execute projects. So, yesterday they issued an org chart and I was in the bottom of the chart in a support role.

Well, this is definitely not the work environment I want to be in. Since I work for a consultancy firm, my options are to either reach back to my corporate management and ask if they have another project with a role that fits my experience and expertise. Or I go back to job hunting.

1gsr4f6,Transitioning to remote tech jobs - Seeking advice for success,"**I believe this can help many others like me, but I've been feeling stuck with a very positive attitude believing that things will change if I push and truly manifest it.**

I’m 28 yo and was born and raised in Türkiye. I studied software development in high school, mainly focusing on C# and SQL, but I eventually switched paths because I wasn’t enjoying the pressure from my teachers. Although I was pretty successful, unfortunately forgot about it all since not practicing. I ended up pursuing a Bachelor's in Business Administration at a well-known university in Türkiye (and no, I’m not being sarcastic, it's a solid school).

About three years ago, I moved to the United States, and I've adjusted pretty well since I was raised by a westernized mom. I recently tried to break into AI prompt writing jobs but struggled after the interviews and haven’t heard from them at all. I’m now picturing my future-self working remotely and really enjoying it. Looking ahead, once I become a U.S. citizen, I’m considering moving somewhere with a better cost of living and overall welfare, like Thailand, and yes it is about the weather too.

I’m fluent in Turkish, French, and English, and I have no issues adapting to different cultures. I’d love to continue working for U.S. companies because, the sky is blue, they pay way better than most others. But the thing is, I’m not sure where to go from here career-wise. I don’t have a degree in tech or anything beyond my high school diploma. My computer skills are decent, and I understand how different systems work, but I know I need to focus on a specific field if I want to land a good job.

So, I’m looking for advice. What kind of career path should I pursue? Is there a particular degree or certification I should be getting to set myself up for success in remote work? My ideal future is working for an American company remotely, setting my own hours, living in Thailand, and just enjoying life to the fullest.

To be honest, America has been a wild ride for me. I really don’t want to end up driving trucks, working in food service (which I’ve done and burned out on), or being stuck in a job that doesn’t match my values like happened many many times. I prefer to compete in the Championship League and be everyone’s favorite, rather than just playing to avoid relegation in the Premier League. Football fans will know what I mean. No offense meant to anyone who enjoys those jobs, I respect what people do to make a living, but I’m hoping to find something that aligns more with my goals.

Any recommendations or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much. Love you all!",houris9,0,0.5,0,1731775014,2024-11-16 16:36:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gsr4f6/transitioning_to_remote_tech_jobs_seeking_advice/,11,2024
1gsr17b,25m taking risk on new career? ,"Ok here is some background, apologies it is all over the place, lots of context needed to help:

**Current Job:**

I am currently employed with a state agency as a policy analyst and have been for 15 months. This is my first long term job since I graduated my masters program. This position aligns with my education and most of my work experience. I love this position but feel like I am losing motivation. Let me explain. I love most of the people I work with, and I love the population of folks we serve and the work is complex, interesting, and not stagnant.

However, my decreased motivation comes from a LOT of factors. To start, we are perpetually understaffed and upper management never seems to care, they just pile more work on the high producers and expect equal outcomes. I liked this at first, but as I have gained experience I get pushed into higher priority projects with more independence and very little support. To dive deeper, the understaffing recently has been a result of a new director that was brought on in 2024. Lets call her Riley. RIley has 25+ years of experience at the agency, albeit in a much simpler topic area and she still openly admits she is learning our topic after 8 months of being here. RIley is kind of a know it all personality, but cant back it up. She enjoys the authority of making decisions, but often does not weigh in the opinion of the subject matter expert. It is a difficult situation for all staff.

Furthermore, the office has lost 10+ employees (about 8%) since Riley was hired. I know, with evidence, at least 4 of these were a direct result of working with Riley. Since then I have had increased contact with her, and have seen the real issue she is to work with. My specific team (7 people) was left with 3 staff after the first major crisis post-Riley. They left laterally to different departments. We recently hired 1 of those positions which was her pick, despite my manager insisting on the more highly qualified individual. The other positions remain unfilled until further notice.

**New opportunity:**

I was contacted recently by a recruiter for a different agency to do government relations for the upcoming legislative session. Hire date is December 1, and I have yet to tell my current job about it. This role is not aligned with my education 100%, but is aligned with my past experience as a lege staffer, and the project management experience I am currently getting. It is also closely aligned with my passion to be in/around the building where decisions live or die.

The position offers a lot, but most notably a possible 30% increase in pay. On the other hand, it is a temporary position through August 2025. I think the government relations role is easily transferable to other agencies or private sector but am not confident. I could also always go back to my current role, although that is safe and would defeat the reason I am leaving.

**The ask:**

Is it acceptable to take this level of risk at 25 yrs old? Does it make sense to jump into a temp job when I have a stable career right now? Does the higher pay make the risk worth it? (I would stockpile extra cash to ensure the transition next year can happen) Is there anything I need to consider with my current job since this transition will happen ASAP if I am selected?

I think that is all. Feel free to ask questions if that doesnt provide enough detail. Thanks yall.",Jazzlike-Parfait4452,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1731774767,2024-11-16 16:32:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gsr17b/25m_taking_risk_on_new_career/,11,2024

>>>held down and worked ASS off across all integrated marketing efforts beginning to end, creative+strategy+analysis across paid media, email, social, website, ecom, tradeshow, retail, print… you know how the ‘one person’ creative team goes

>>>ongoing challenges: visibility/internal communication, under-utilized resources, inefficient spending, delegation/workload imbalance, marketing attribution and execution intricacies, etc

>>>leads to consistent executive scrutiny despite impressive advances going over their heads. Two roles within department are being reworked, but rather than hiring for director+ to replace the VP I directly reported to, posted ‘senior marketing manager’ role without even internal consideration or discussion 

>>>goes to HR expressing dismay and interest, as there must be a disconnect if I wasn’t even considered for one step up despite existing qualifications and demonstrated skill. She gives many pushbacks such as leveraging employer advantage in current job market to secure ‘director+ level’, saying I could apply but essentially rejecting any ‘strategic input as company insider’ I had to offer out of ‘fairness in evaluation’ to others

>>>despite told by HR/VP/COO that I wouldn’t even be considered and clearly wouldn’t get the job, still applied for the audacity and opportunity to at least show my value more, was excluded from hiring process input for junior role in the team out of potential ‘fairness’ but still never even got interview

>>>expresses dismay to CEO, who does better job of assuring that new leader is suppose to help advocate/advance the whole team more, including my own career, and would be open to potential raise 6 months after new leadership. Despite only wanting a chance, I make peace with their more traditional safe sensibilities and know there’s plenty of room for learning under a more knowledgeable mentor… if they actually manage to find someone better than current VP

>>>fast forward to new ‘Senior Marketing Manager’ coming in guns ablazing, clearly with predetermined guilty verdict, solely critical lens, and aggressive one track mindset parroting the same ‘sole focus on organic socials, need to go viral, paid media is too expensive, marketing dept practically doesn’t exist’ 

>>>claims to be all ‘organic search/social’ but main credentials are 126k astrology YouTube channel with 2-6k views… had audacity to tell our Ecom DIRECTOR that she should be in charge of her dept and to move from Shopify to Wix…. WIX

>>>immediately demonstrates ALL the bad: didn’t even introduce herself in first meet nor for ours, doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about yet do so loudly and proudly, especially has little grasp on digital marketing landscape and integrate multi-platform efforts, even general B2B vs B2C strategies and basical technical capabilities, unable to even execute her own ‘organic social’ efforts without uphill battle

>>>also turns out she’s not just a ‘casual referral’ but close friend to HR, the one who declined me even a chance and insisted on ‘blind interviews’ without seeing resume and only asking from a generic answer bank. When requesting business cards, HR already puts ‘Head of Marketing’…

Things are BAD… and many of us are collectively reacting. The wheels are turning and we’re not sure how it’ll play out but hoping for at least restructuring where we can even work with or around her, but absolutely not under her.

1gsqotf,Just want to share some fantastic career advice from a highly respected senior leader at my work.,"You're bound to do things you enjoy and don't enjoy over the course of your career. but either way make sure you ""knock it out of the park"" because people will see it and recognize your capabilities. and you'll be a natural choice to take on more responsibilities in the future.

The leader told a story from many years ago. at the time, he had spotted a problem with a client. so he raised his hand at a townhall meeting and brought it up .as he finished his spiel he expected to get brownie points for his acumen. but his leadership simply asked: “ so what have you done to try to solve it? ”The message was clear. don't just point out the problem. you are fully empowered to assume agency. and that's the whole idea of extreme ownership.

Challenge yourself to think about what you enjoy and don't enjoy doing. (And it's ok for that to change over time.) because opportunities will come up over the course of your career. and if you don't have a solid view of what you're optimizing for you won't be able to ""pull the trigger"" and make those big decisions that might transform your career for the better.",Logan_Seraph,25,0.800000011920929,25,1731773829,2024-11-16 16:17:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gsqotf/just_want_to_share_some_fantastic_career_advice/,11,2024

So I work part time at a job that have an agreement with part-time employees of either working only one day of the weekend (you get to choose which day) or working every other weekend. 

I have the first agreement with them, and I work on saturdays. I specifically told them that I was not available on Sundays. 

This is where I might not have been the best employee. They usually post schedules a month in advance. However, since I have a very thight schedule, I'm usually scheduled on the same shifts each week. So, I didn't think to check my shifts for next week, the first day of the week being tomorrow: a sunday. I noticed I was scheduled to work that day.

I feel like I already told them that I wasn't available and that they should have asked if it was okay to schedule me. It is not the first time that they have violated this agreement with other employees as well.

However, it was definitely my responsability to check if everything was okay with my shifts.

I have never done this job before nor i have proper experience in the ""company"" life as in i just got out of college and everything is new to me.
I am actually in a training period that lasts 3 months and I've been there for a month and a couple days now, however i'm a slow learner and i keep making mistakes even though i focus... 

I have been summoned twice by my boss since i've started this job last month. He told me that he didn't understand that even though i have a master's degree i still struggle to understand and apply whatever tasks they make me do and said i needed to focus and stop making mistakes. I've been there for literally a month, it's my first ever real job and they knew it during my interview before i joined them, and they agreed to train me.. I've been summoned again yesterday and this time there were 2 of my colleagues + the boss. They said that they didn't understand why i struggle to progress considering i had done long studies and that they don't want an employee whom they have to explain everything to everyday, that I need to understand the first time they explain something and get it done.

This whole thing took a toll on me and my confidence, how can i be good at something i have never done in my life in just one month?? They agreed to train me and now they told me that it was an ""express"" training period and that I'd be fired if i didn't make any progress in 2 months (aka the end of my training time).

Should i quit and look for another job?

44M, married, 1 child
BSE + MBA (top 10 both) experience in operations and project management with exposure in manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, and most recently (and currently) in healthcare.

Title: PMO Director, TC 175k, work about 20-30 very low stress hours per week, and have 30days PTO + holidays 

Location: in a Midwest college town, but WFH.  

Problem:  Some would consider my situation the perfect gig, but I need a change (8 years same company, 3 years same role).   I stopped learning a while ago and I’m bored at work.   I see a lot of ppl with similar experience with much higher comp - granted some are in other industries and may have a more demanding schedule.  I would love to change industries and would be willing to work more as well, but can’t find anything that I’m qualified for that is remote and pays at least my current comp. 

I feel stuck, and I’ve been looking for a while.  I’m not all that as a professional, but I do a good job.  I have great credentials and present myself well - no red flags or huge gaps in skill, and willing to learn anything new.  

I would really appreciate any advice you have on mid career pivots.  Are you aware of any remote roles or companies that encourage WFH? What’s your take on my situation with 25-30hrs at 175k in the Midwest? Should I pursue a side gig? Any ideas and insights are welcome.  Thank you!

If you're unfamiliar with the role, it requires you to oversee all the day to day operations in a nursing home. This means developing and training a department head team, pushing for revenue and census, improving quality of care, managing outraged family members and handling customer care issues quickly, improving systems and processes, managing contracts, hiring/firing, driving the corporate vision and mission statement, leading profitability, and managing state/federal regulations. It's a tough job that requires your attention 24/7.

I feel like I've gained great knowledge and skillset and have a lot to offer however I'm struggling figuring out my next path. I really did feel fulfilled in the position and never complained about having to go to work. It was fun and challenging, something a former athlete like myself would appreciate. The parts I enjoyed the most was growing and developing a team to produce a great product that the community was embracing. The part I enjoyed the least were dealing with the abuse and neglect allegations as they are urgent, never-ending, and require a great deal of investigating, training, and writing for each small allegations. I know it's imperative to the role and did my best to protect and serve my residents, however dementia residents love to say the most outlandish things often.

I also found Alabama (mechanical) and North Dakota (chemical or mechanical) also fit my requirements.

Are there any other online engineering degrees that are ABET and only require a few in person labs?

1gsmm1q,Feeling of dissatisfaction with a job that is quite chill and colleagues are nice,"One of these venting / thinking out loud posts about my job which objectively is pretty good. The workload is manageable, my manager is pretty chill, and my colleagues are nice. There's not that much pressure compared to other jobs I've had in the past but except now I'm doing that typical grass is greener thing of wanting a bit more pressure and challenge, as sometimes it feels like the work we do is not that meaningful and none of senior management really care that much about it. Having said my manager is chill, I also get the sense that sometimes her only focus is just not getting any criticism or additional tasks from her boss or other senior management, and she doesn't have any passion for her job other than getting through the 9-5. It also gets really annoying when she just doesn't understand stuff I tell her, or forget it days later, and seems to know less about some things at the company when she's been here 9 years and I've been here 18 months, which is again why I conclude she just tries to get through the 9-5 and then everything just goes in one ear and out the other as soon as the day ends. 

I'm not sure what progression I could have as well, as she hardly ever mentions anything related to this outside of annual review. One meeting for about 30 minutes a year, that's it. We are understaffed in my opinion for what the optimal output we could produce is, but she also seems totally nonplussed about this, fuelling my view that what we do is not afforded the right level of priority by senior management.

1gsg4r6,Is Carnegie Mellon AI Master's Right For Me?,"Hi everyone, 

I'm currently a Business Analytics major in undergrad. For those unfamiliar with this major, it's basically applied Statistics for business problems. It's spreadsheet modeling, machine learining, simulation, predictive modeling, optimization, etc. I also am working on a Computer Science minor, and I'm planning on taking data structures and algorithms, software engineering, fullstack web development, etc.

My problem is that I want to capitalize on the AI movement, and I don't think the classes I'm taking are going to give me much exposure on that end. I want to help implement new AI processes in business operations, like supply chain, CRM, ERP, and the like. But I don't know if this is a good enough reason to pursue a Master's. All of my advisers say that you need a good reason to go to grad school, and I haven't even graduated with a bachelor's, but I think that if I go to industry with a bachelor's, I won't be doing the kind of work  that I anticipate doing. I'll know the theory, but I want an opportunity to actually learn how to incorporate it using AI tools. I've participated in a data science competition and got to learn Microsoft Azure's AI products, but there's nothing like that in my degree.

I found the Carnegie Mellon AI Management program, and I think it will fulfill what I'm looking for. Sure, it's going to cost more, but I think I can find a way to fund it. Does anyone have any thoughts?

1gsdofu,Do you guys all work like this? ,"I spent over 6 years in a managerial position at a company that had very relaxed approach to everything, people went out of their way to create a friendly atmosphere,you could chat to anyone, seniors were taking one maternity leave after another and it seemed like everyone's focus was to creat a comfortable life. I just felt like I am wasting my young years on something not very ambitious, especially as there was not any progression from my role and decided to explore over workplaces that could provide me with better career progression and challenge me a bit more.
I left for a small company that offered more money and opportunity to build and lead my own team as the company grows. Turned out it was very very different to what I was used to, culture wise. I was completely ignored by my manager, was not given any onboarding, any check ins on my progress etc. Meetings would be put in my calendar but when the time comes the manager would physically hide from me and avoid any eye contact while treating the rest of employees as you would expect. Everyone was working until late sometimes past midnight barely moved from their chairs or spoke to each other. The place was not fit for having such a big team, people would take client calls in the bathroom and never complain about basic things like lack of space or drinking water. If I tried to initiate some small talk often people didn't even know how to respond. It was very awkward. I left the company after few months for other reasons not mentioned here baffled by the whole thing.

I knew I needed to find something different perhaps a bigger organisation with established career progression and processes in place. I was offered a fully remote job but at a more junior non-managerial position. People at my interview panel very lovely and my manager seemed very kind and welcoming so I expected the company culture to be similar. It started getting a lot weirder soon after I was assigned to my projects. First of all the entire company works remotely but nobody ever turns on camera even for the client meetings. I havent seen how any of my coworkers looks like despite spending most days on calls. When joining the projects nobody even bothered to introduce me or acknowledged the fact that I am new in any way. It's been over a month and I haven't heard a single line of small talk or any kind of non-work related conversations. People join meetings without even saying greeting each other and wait in silence for the meeting to start. Anytime I ask anyone a simple question to help me with tasks that I am completing for the first time I'm getting borderline rude and defensive replies. Juniors that I am overseeing are completely clueless and are unable to complete task a child could despite being in the company for 5+ years. Basically any kind of minor issue I am having I have nobody to ask for advice and if I do ask someone, they tell me things like ""I had to figure out everything on my own"". I'm trying to best to stay on top of my responsibilites with 0 oversight or support and just got into a big trouble for a typo in a minor document that wasn't even finalised yet, as the client complained about it. By getting in trouble I mean I was added to extra 2  weekly check ins with very senior manager, to report on all aspects of the project- all because of a typo. During the first meeting she didn't even know if I'm an employee or a contractor, and no the company is not that big.
Was my first workplace really an outlier and everyone is used to working in the conditions I just described or was I just very unlucky? I just can't wrap my head around how both of the places I ended up in mainly have employees that stayed there for over 5 years. It's just seems like hell to me.

TLDR: after working in the same place for over 6 years I decided to try myself in a different workplace. Ended up switching two jobs in last 6 months. Both places had very weird dynamics with no supervision and employees generally not caring if you live or die. Last one has extremely impersonal approach to work by being cameras off remote company. All employees seem defensive and quite rude when you politely approach them with questions. Is this the average workplace or was I unlucky?

1gscx46,Should I look for another job or wait a little longer?,"Hi all, so I am in a little dilemma. I got a new job six months ago as an engineer for a manufacturing site. 

The first six months is like a honey moon period for me. My boss care about his worker and he would teach me step by step as I am fresh to this type of role. Unfortunately he was fired as senior management want to push for number and my manager bump heads with them about their unrealistic demands. 

Once my boss is gone, everyone just start making demand to our site. As my boss is gone, me and another engineer who is also new to this site take on all the heat. We were criticized by multiple senior management about how we are bad at house keeping, quality, production speed, etc. Basically EHS complain in the morning, business complain at noon, and quality complain at night. And I couldn’t get them a good answer since they would ask why our stuff 4 years ago are no good and why your plant couldn’t fix it even though I was only here for six months. They are asking for drastic quality improvement to take place in a couple of months that would take years at normal speed. 

There are a lot of opportunities for improvement that I want to take place but it would take time. But apparently no one want to wait as I explain the reality to them.

I am just venting but it was just frustrated with all this. I shouldn’t say this, but the contrast between my manager here and not is night and day. It is a little hard for me to adjust for it to be honest. I am not a confrontational type and I would rather just get a lower pay role then fighting with everyone and get ridicule by them everyday. 

Do anyone have similar experience that want to share? Does it get better if I pull through this transition period?",hellohello_2010,0,0.5,0,1731722668,2024-11-16 02:04:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gscx46/should_i_look_for_another_job_or_wait_a_little/,11,2024
1gscoyp,Want to move into new career but old career has many more opportunities,"So I recently finished my degree in Occupational Safety and have some experience in my old job using said skills. However, I come from a background in aviation maintenance and there are MANY more job opportunities within that field compared to Occ Safety. I am getting job offers from aviation maintenance almost non stop compared to basically nothing from the Safety side of things. All of which are either the current pay or better than my last aviation maintenance job. My question is, should I just take the job offers for aviation maintenance now and wait for something to come up in the future for safety? Or just stay on unemployment hoping for something to drop in the future?

Note: I do not mind being a aviation mechanic, in fact I do love working with my hands. My theory with this thought process of just staying on unemployment is just to keep on track to transition to something new and more on my career sided choice. Even recent interviewers mentioned this as such where I was not denied a choice position with them if I chose to be employed with them.

1gsc8c1,How do I resign from a toxic workplace?,"I’ve been in my current job for 18 months. Without getting into specifics (who knows if my colleagues are on Reddit), I work for an event management company, owned and run by a woman who has been in this field all of her adult life. 

In my time here, 2 people have resigned, out of a total of 10 employees. When I took the role on, my boss told me that it would take at least 2 years to get up to speed with the details. I later discovered that 13 or 14 people have done my job and left over the last 10 years. 1 of them quit after only a day.

The work is challenging but good, the problem is that my boss, and by extension the others I work for, micromanage my work every day. Every email, every letter, must be drafted and sent to them for approval, and every one is always sent back as not being good enough.

Last week, I sent a “draft” of two separate emails to my boss and a supervisor “for review” both were sent back as inappropriate. I then pointed out that they had written those emails last year for the same event. It proved to me that they are deliberately undermining me. Since then my boss, who is offsite and not available by phone, has not responded to me. The supervisor in the office is snapping at me every time I ask for clarification on work assigned to me. We’ve spoken maybe 50 words last week.

I’ve spoken with a colleague who says that it’s got nothing to do with me and that my work is faultless. That’s not entirely true, but I am very competent at my work. Despite what my boss claims. 

One of the offside supervisors keeps claiming my reports and their own work, but I have clarified that repeatedly with my Boss. 

I received almost training when I took on this job. I was repeatedly told “Look at what we did last year and just do that.”

There has been extensive workplace bullying happening from about my 3rd month here, but I genuinely didn’t understand that this wasn’t normal or acceptable workplace behaviour (my heater being removed so my boss could warm her office, my chair being swapped out so that the prized officer worker could have it, no headphones provided to take calls, expected to purchase my own, no reimbursements for fuel, saying one thing and then doing another, asking me to fly with them to another city for work, and then cancelling my ticket after I’d cancelled my holidays with no explanation.

Anyway, I’m not perfect, and in no way claim to be. There is no HR to go to and nothing will ever change here. So I’m going to resign. 

How do I write a letter without addressing all the harassment and bad behaviour? I ask this because I just want to walk away and not engage anymore. I don’t want an offer of more pay, or “let’s work things out”, I just want to leave in a professional way with what’s left of my dignity intact.

I've worked as a sales assistant in a department store here in Australia for 15 years.

I want to get out of retail and find a full-time job, but am unsure what kind of jobs to apply for that would have transferrable skills from retail. I'm open to anything at this point - I would prefer a job that doesn't need a ""customer service"" voice as I have depression and it can be quite emotionally taxing after a long day of pretending lol

I was having a tough time getting a job in the small city I am from because of COVID so I moved to a bigger city and was able to land a job in Civil Engineering. It was not something I intended in pursuing but was open to explore the opportunity.

1gs8rwe,Hello Awkward Company Holiday Parties!  Network Advice?,"It's that time of year again... The awkward work parties at your job or your significant others, where you stand by the snacks or bar and pretend to love every minute.  It is even more awkward when you're newer to the company, and the conversations just drag.  

I've recently adjusted my mindset this year... instead of thinking about it as a social obligation I'm going to treat it as a network event.  It's a good chance for me to talk to leadership, boost my significant other's network as his wing-woman... Basically I'm going to make it *work* for me (or us, in my SO's case)!   

I wrote down some Do's and Don'ts that I'm going to remind myself, but I'd love to hear more tips on how you network and survive these parties :)  

**The Do’s:**  
✅ *Do* smile and make eye contact  
✅ *Do* have a few easy conversation starters ready (travel plans, holiday traditions, pets, etc)   
✅ *Do* introduce yourself to someone new. (Stepping OUT of that comfort zone!)

**The Don’ts:**  
❌ *Don’t* spend the whole night glued to your phone.  It will not be my security blanket.  
❌ *Don’t* stick with the same group all night.  (Well... just my boyfriend, he can stick with me ha!)

We've been applying like crazy to places and get a few rejections, mostly just get ghosted, it is quite terrible out there right now.

Back in September I signed a contract with a company to do some consulting for them on a project, remotely and in a different state. The contract specifies no more than 15 hours of work a week, to be done for the duration of the project, which they estimated to be around January. I have to be available during the work week, no weekends.

However, last month it got put majorly on hold until the end of November because they realized the project would conflict with another event, AND a bunch of staff were taking holidays. So although the hourly rate is high, I only did about 10 hours of work the entire month of October.

I FINALLY just got hired on part time for another company. We're running dangerously low on money and I got denied for benefits, due to only seeking part-time work instead of full time. My consulting job is supposedly going to pick up again soon...I'm just worried they're going to bait and switch me AGAIN. 

Should I just cut my losses and ask my new job for more hours/look for a second job, and just break my contract?

I work overnight shifts in a warehouse, and because we are often understaffed, I frequently have to do physical labor. With the holiday season approaching, mandatory overtime is coming up, and I am not looking forward to it.

Recently, I was offered a role as an Assistant Store Manager at The North Face. After negotiating, I increased the initial pay rate to $26 per hour—still $5 less than my current hourly rate at Amazon, which is a significant pay cut.

I have three years of retail sales experience from working at Apple, a job I truly loved because I enjoyed interacting with customers. My ultimate goal is to become a Product Marketing Manager at a big tech company.

What should I do next? Should I accept the role at The North Face despite the lower pay? Should I stay at Amazon and look for other opportunities?

1gs62k8,I sort of feel stuck in my career in terms of career progression. Would you have any suggestions based on a summary of my resume?,"Education: B.S. in Computer Science

Work Experience:
3 years in a Software Quality job
2 years in Software Development job
2 years in IT Support job

I would say out of the 3 jobs I probably did the best as an IT support person. Then, for the other 2 jobs I would rate my performance as ""meets expectations"". I would say I didn't stand out at all really in the other two jobs.

It's like I don't really stand out by one skill if that makes sense. I would go back to school for a Master's if it made sense. I'm about 30 years old.

I would say my goal is to make a little more money. Probably about $20,000 more per year or so. Also, to have some more valuable skills in general.

1gs5ryf,New role opened up at my company,I currently work for $24/hr. A new role just opened up in our organization making around 74k yearly which is great. On paper I know I can do the role. Skills wise. My coworker who is going to apply literally said I’d probably be a better fit than them. But for me I don’t want to do it bc of the social dynamics of the role. Right now my current role although I still don’t love it. It’s low stress. I get to be alone most of the time and left alone. Whereas this new role is more involved with people. It’s more corporate. And you have to sit in one spot vs moving around. Honestly when he broke down what you’d be doing I felt like the pay should be more. But who am I to speak as I’m only making $23/hr right now. I just know me and stress don’t mix. I left my last job because of stress and I already have a health issue I’m trying to keep calm. I have a solid resume and certifications but this job market is hard. A part of me is like suck it up and apply for the role the money is good. But I know me. If it gets too stressful I will quit. And at that point I will have lost the new role & cant go back to my old role. So I’ll be broke lol. I know I need a role where I can be alone and fulfill my tasks. Which is what I am applying for.

1gs5got,I got an exciting new job offer but want to join the National Guard/Reserves soon - accept or decline the offer?,"**TLDR:** I'm 25 years old, no kids (yet). I wanted to be military pilot but probably wouldn't medically qualify, so I studied engineering instead. I never really stopped thinking about joining the military. Now I have a job offer from a dream employer but also want to enlist. I'm not sure if I should accept the offer, start the job, then enlist while risking my professional relationship, or if I should decline the offer, enlist first, then try reapplying for similar jobs in the future.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was my lifelong dream to be a military pilot. That ended in college after I signed up for ROTC and learned about the strict medical requirements. I took it pretty hard, but tried to move on.

I studied mechanical engineering and wanted to get a job in aerospace and defense. I ended up in a different (less interesting) industry, I thought mostly because I don't have a security clearance.

I'm now 25 years old, seriously dating a girl that lives in another city. I'm preparing to find a new job and move.

At the same time, I never really got over my original dreams. I often think about what I missed out on. I was thinking of quitting my job in early 2025 to enlist in the National Guard or Reserves.

Occasionally, I fire off applications to aerospace companies even though I don't have a security clearance and never hear anything back. To my surprise, I recently was invited to interview for a engineering job at one of the top 10 prime contractors. I got an offer.

I don't know what to do. On one hand, I have an offer from a major player within my dream industry. On the other hand, I still want to enlist and I'm not getting any younger. I could accept the job and then enlist shortly after, but I'm scared to jeopardize my relationship with my new employer. I know legally they cannot fire me, but I can't imagine every manager is going to be happy when they find out a newer employee is suddenly leaving for 6 months. I have learned that the particular role for which I applied involves 1-3 weeks of travel every 2-3 months (traveling to testing grounds like White Sands), and I can only imagine what a pain it would be to work a drill weekend into that schedule. Or I could decline the job offer and enlist asap, hopefully the company would respect my decision and I could use my now established relationship with them to apply for other positions that open in the future.

I am unsure of what to do and am hoping some of you could offer some advice.",careeradviceaccounts,0,0.5,1,1731701417,2024-11-15 20:10:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gs5got/i_got_an_exciting_new_job_offer_but_want_to_join/,11,2024

I am on target to make a little over $100K by the end of this year, including commissions and bonuses. I am the top producer on my team, but my company is tiny (like 10 people) and there is no internal mobility. on top of that, my bosses are extremely dysfunctional, emotionally abusive, and I am really not growing as much as I probably could be. But I like the amount of money I am making, and I have found ways to keep them happy with me by kissing ass. 

I just finished my final interview for an SDR role at a 100% remote company. However, the base pay is only like $55K, and in the first year i'd probably only make like $75K total, that is if I am the highest performer possible. however, I do like that it would bring me into a more supportive environment professionally, give me opportunities for upward mobility, and give me experience in tech sales. i think I might have to go backwards in order to go forwards. however, I really don't want to take that kind of pay cut. especially because I feel I am over qualified for this role. 

what should I do? i have made tons of connections through my current job, however, it might screw me over if I were to ask them for referrals in the chance they might tell my current CEO. if my current bosses found out I was looking for new jobs, they would fire me immediately because they can't handle rejection, they feel that they need to fire someone before they leave them.

1gs0dg0,Reference Advice,"Hi everyone. I'm looking for some advice on how to proceed here. I recently left a job I had been at for 5 years for a new opportunity. I was extremely unhappy at that job because I was facing harassment and bullying from my manager, and she went out of her way to destroy the reputation I had built over the years at that employer, to the point that she isolated me from any contact with outside teams and went out of her way with HR to ensure I would be ineligible for internal transfers elsewhere (it's a large organization, but somehow I'd mysteriously be a top candidate for a position after interviewing yet not get the job, so I realized eventually I would have no choice but to leave). It was very depressing because I had previously loved working there, and it destroyed my confidence in myself as a professional.

I eventually found a new job that I really love at a similar government organization about four months ago. I've regained a lot of confidence in myself and management is really happy with my performance. Unfortunately, my position is likely to be eliminated in January due to a jurisdictional transfer, and based on my tenure it's extremely unlikely I would be protected and moved to another department as there are other staff who take priority over me. It's something I've addressed with my director but she has said that unfortunately there isn't much she can do to protect me as the process is beyond her control (and her position is also likely to be eliminated entirely). The reality is we will not know until the spring at earliest if I would be able to stick around once the jurisdictional transfer takes place.

My dad was recently diagnosed with an aggressive thyroid cancer so my tolerance for risk has unfortunately changed and I am seeking new employment. I interviewed for a position that honestly would be my dream job, which I had applied for on a lark not thinking in a million years I would make it through the interview process (which consisted of in-person assessments and multiple rounds of challenging interviews). I am now at the reference check step in the process, which for this employer is the final deciding factor between the final two candidates in order to make an offer. 

I feel confident that I am the hiring team's preferred candidate, however, they are very prescriptive in what they want from a reference. They are only willing to accept supervisory references from the last three years, from either my current employer or my previous employer. I reached out to a few managers from my previous role but I was completely ghosted. I cannot ask my current supervisor as it would make my employment situation extremely precarious (despite the fact that many of our staff are jumping ship due to the announcement, which is extremely understandable, and she's an otherwise lovely manager, she just has a very low tolerance for people who ""abandoned the Titanic"", as she says, so it would not be taken well if I asked).

Other things to note are that I was honest with the prospective employer about the jurisdiction transfer being the reason I want to leave a job I started fairly recently and they were understanding. They are also aware of my dad's cancer, because beyond this being a dream opportunity for me they were very understanding that I may have care responsibilities as he enters treatment. I did try talking to them about the reference process and asking if I could use older references or peers but they are not flexible on this. In terms of my current job, it wasn't an issue as I was able to use references from my previous roles before my last job.

Looking for advice on how to proceed here - I am desperate to get this role because it would be a permanent full time opportunity to do something I love, without having to worry I'll lose my job in the new year.

1grzrar,Career advice: A bit at the cross-roads,"Hello everyone,

I've been surfing the net and researching a potential career path for myself, and I’d love some advice from this community. For some context, here’s my journey so far:

I completed my undergraduate degree in 2022, majoring in Accounting and Finance. After that, I worked for a year at a Tier-2 consulting firm specializing in pharma consulting. The experience was a mixed bag for me, as the work leaned heavily toward market research and wasn’t closely related to finance, which is my core interest.

Post this, I pursued a Master's in Business Analysis in the UK (from a top 5 ranked university). During my time there, I developed a keen interest in valuations, financial modeling (not necessarily traditional investment banking), and financial consulting, thanks to my coursework and participation in various case competitions.

I applied for roles in the UK after graduation but, given the competitive job market, decided to return to India. Currently, I’m exploring opportunities here and have been offered a role as a Valuations Analyst at a well-regarded firm (\~Duff & Phelps, Alvarez & Marsal, or a Big 4-level organization).

I’m at a crossroads and need advice on how to structure my career path moving forward:

1. **Short-term:** How can I make the most of this Valuations Analyst role to build a solid foundation in finance and consulting? Are there specific skills, certifications (e.g., CFA), or experiences I should focus on?
2. **Long-term:** I’m considering pursuing an MBA down the line (potentially at a top school like ISB or a global program). What steps should I take now to strengthen my profile for such programs?
3. **Career trajectory:** I am excited for the opportunities and adjacent fields like corporate finance or strategy consulting. However, how do I keep my options open while gaining relevant expertise?
4. **Age anxiety**: I am currently 24, and the age thing scares me whether am I doing anything right or wrong, or will it be too late?

I’d greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or experiences you could share that might help me navigate this journey. Thank you so much in advance!",Few_Fun_2622,1,1.0,0,1731686858,2024-11-15 16:07:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grzrar/career_advice_a_bit_at_the_crossroads/,11,2024
1grzd01,When you need a mental health day but company is very traditional- using WFH?,"My company culture is such that sick days are looked down on and everybody who’s been here for many years like I have (3-10 years) has like seven weeks of sick time accumulated. I looked back and I took zero work from home days in 2020 through 2023. Part of this was the wfh mandate Lasting until sometime in 2022. 

I’m a person who only ever takes sick days if I’m genuinely contagious and sick, which is not that often because I’m a healthy person. Thankfully. But in 2020 for the stress of this place started to wear on me and I think I’ve taken six? Again not that many especially since I’ve been there almost 6 years.

The culture is such that people who skip their sick days or even skip their vacation and small work from home allowance or rewarded. People coming to work sick and they laugh about it. My peer came to work sick as a fucking dog and said he had a 102° fever and my manager laughed and said at least it’s not 103 am I right?

One time I was sick so I took three consecutive days of work from home, trying to be a team player rather than taking three sick days during a busy time. Each and every day a more elevated manager messaged me to say if I wasn’t sick just come in. I had to re-emphasize that I was sick and because the seniority of the manager increased with each day, I just came in on Friday my final day of the week And got that same manager extremely sick. So I guess they finally believed me. I’m obviously looking for a new jobs and I had a really good interview last week.

I guess at this point I just wanted a mental health day, that would probably be my first or maybe second mental health day of six years. However, today I wasn’t able to build up the courage to just take a sick day even though it’s not that busy there are still tasks that are due and I’m not under the delusion that I’m so essential they couldn’t be covered, but I think I was just too afraid to lose credibility and these peoples eyes especially especially since I haven’t gotten my performance review yet, which is told to be good .


I even had a sit down with my manager that when he walks around bragging that he hasn’t taken a sick day in seven years, it makes me scared to get sick feeling like I couldn’t take a sick day if I really needed to. He told me that I didn’t have anything to fear and if I needed one, I could take a sick day because that’s our benefit. He also snapped at me and told me I was not a doctor and it was disrespectful to tell him that he was sick the other day when he was sweating and coughing and looking like hell. We sit at desk, our job is not essential in the sense that anything will collapse.


I grew up with child abuse so I think I was just conditioned to put up more bullshit than the average person but I’ve been doing therapy for the last 20 months and I finally got on some medication which has helped me get out of my functional freeze and into a job search with interviews .


I’ve done it before where I just take a work from home day, part of my small allowance and then treat it like a sick day. I don’t think anybody ever notices especially because I do get my tasks done and I usually do this on a slow day anyway. 

I would love if anybody has any advice if they’ve been in similar cultures, obviously the solution is to get a new job, but this was my first one out of college in terms of corporate setting and I thought maybe this is just how it is. Obviously my leadership is not leading by example because they skip paternity and maternity leave even though it’s provided for four months by the company, they skip sick days People skip sick and vacation days and those are those who are promoted. 

I just feel dead inside that I’ve allowed myself to become this corporate cog but then I brushed up my résumé and I feel pretty good that I do have experience. Today I just was not able to buck up the strength to say hey I don’t feel well. I’m taking a sick day today. Even though it would’ve been received well, there’s never any pushback, I just know it will diminish my credibility because my managers Simply do not take sick days off.

How I see it is that the company is paying me the same amount of money either way and if I run out of work from home days, I can just use a sick day if I’m seriously burnt out or sick in the future before I get a new job. Like I’m not actually impacting the cash flow of the company if anything I am stealing my own accumulated time off from myself.

I think I just feel sad and ashamed that I wasn’t able to buck up the courage to take a day off because when I legitimately had Covid a few months ago, even though my body felt horrible. My mind felt at peace, related to illness. I didn’t feel afraid of the illness at all. What I was afraid and stressing about was if my management would believe me and if they thought it was valid, blah blah blah. So stupid has anybody been through this is this really common?

1grz8n0,Ghosted After Multiple Interviews and Promises,"I’m at a loss as to how unprofessional some companies can be; fake names for anonymity. 

I had a phone interview with Jeff at a company in a different state and they offered to fly me out the next week which I accepted and went out (they paid for flight and sent me the info). I thought it went great with Jeff who is the majority owner;  we discussed the job, salary, and the plan for moving and starting over six hours. He took me out to dinner that night with one of the clients they had in town and put me up in a hotel that they use to own. I get back and talk to the minority owner Mike and he invites me back out as well. He recommends a trail at first for 2-3 weeks where they will pay for everything for me and my wife (she works remote) and goes on to explain that he wants both me and them to be fully comfortable before we fully commit and if we decide for any reason I don’t want to work there no problem. The only thing I wanted before we went out was to get the salary set and bonus structure before I come out which Mike and Jeff both agreed so there is no complications afterwards. The hotel I checked into needed a credit card on file for incidentals which I gave and they charged the hotel room to. I explained it to Jeff and he asked if it would be okay if he zelled me and I can have the credit card point which I agreed to.

Jeff told me they would get back to me by the end of the week with more information. End of next week comes and goes with no information. I called, emailed, and texted once at the beginning and end of the week. I get an email the week after that Jeff had covid and that he would get the contract over to me later that day. The rest of that week goes by with nothing.  End of the next week I finally get him on the phone after a couple of probably too polite emails and two calls where Jeff tells me he has a call with Mike in two hours where they would finalize the contract and he would call me an hour after that. I tried call him three times, left a text, voicemail, and email and got no response. 

Here I am a week later and almost a month after the initial interview and have mentally moved on from the job. I am beyond frustrated because if they don’t want me they could at least have the courtesy to tell me. But the poor communication and the fact I have not been reimbursement for the hotel room is appalling and unprofessional. I sent a far more blunt email asking for a reimbursement including everything I purchased down to sodas and asking for an explanation. My wife thinks I should let it go and just do a charge back but I do not want to get black listed from the hotel for the chargeback (Marriot). I look at it as all good will between us is gone and I should not be out anything for the unprofessionalism that has occurred. If they keep ghosting me the only thing I can do is go through small claims in my state and hopefully that will get their attention.",Clark_Kent_Imposter,2,1.0,0,1731685510,2024-11-15 15:45:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grz8n0/ghosted_after_multiple_interviews_and_promises/,11,2024
1grz5n7,Thinking of leaving my job but I get the rest of my student loans 100% forgiven in 2 years,"I work in local government and have been a probation officer for over 8 years. I am currently enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) plan that would allow me to get my student loans forgiven after 10 years of service. I have recently started thinking about doing a complete career change but am torn about the possible loan forgiveness I am invested in. I have about $30,000 of student loans left to pay off. 

I am thinking about leaving due to my superiors openly telling me that they don’t see me “moving up the ladder” in this department and hold me a to a completely different standard than everybody else (knit picking my work, when others make the same or even worse mistakes). The head of the department has also told me that he doesn’t like my aura and says I think I am better than everybody else. Outside of that, it is the most toxic workplace I have encountered, and the office politics and drama is unprofessional and absurd. Only certain people get reprimanded and it always seems the toxic people get off freely. 

The pay is not good, especially considering I have been there for 8 years. I have looked around at other jobs and have come to the conclusion that I can absolutely get an entry level job making more than I am now and I would be able to leverage my time as a PO and get an even higher paying job if I wanted to stay in a similar field. I could also try and work for another county and continue on with the PSLF but I would most likely take a pay cut and that is something I cannot afford. The only thing that keeps me second guessing leaving is the fact that I have a decent amount of student loans that will be forgiven in November of 2026. 

TLDR: toxic workplace and low morale and have me thinking about leaving my job but I have 8 years in and I get my student loans ($30,000) forgiven after 10 years. 

Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated.

1gryw7c,"Advice on Career Growth: MBA, Job Search, or Stay Put? (Marketing Specialist, 28M)","I’m at a turning point in my career and would really appreciate some outside perspectives. I’m 28, working as a Marketing Specialist in a VHCOL area and making around 85K total compensation. I’ve been in my role for almost 2 years and feel like I’ve been pulling all possible levers to make an impact—advocating for growth, expanding my network, and tackling various cross-departmental projects.

My concern is that my role is flexible to the point of lacking clear definition and the lack of direction sometimes leaves me feeling like I’m not making the most of my time or skill set. Although my efforts seem to be valued, my contributions haven’t yet translated into additional responsibility or compensation, both of which I’d like to see soon. However, I like the company that I'm currently at, the team, and my manager. Ideally would like to grow internally, but with org changes, I feel like there might not be an opportunity in the near future.

**Options I’m Considering:**

**Transitioning to Product Marketing or Product Management:** I’m interested in transitioning into a PM or PMM role where I can own product decisions and contribute more directly. Right now, I support GTM and sales efforts, but I don’t have direct product ownership, which I know may be a hurdle. Any advice on how to make a case for this shift or strengthen my experience without formal product ownership?

**Pursuing an MBA:** I’m considering a regional MBA program. My main concerns are around the ROI and whether it will broaden my job reach in the ways I need. I’m debating between part-time (while staying in my current role) or a full-time program. For those who’ve chosen regional MBAs, how has the experience been in terms of career outcomes?

**Exploring new job opportunities or advocating for growth in my current role:** Despite being a profitable business, layoffs have already affected other departments, and given the flexible (yet undefined) nature of my role, I’m concerned about stability. I’m debating between updating my resume and testing the job market or wait it out until my 2-year mark to see if a promotion or raise becomes more feasible, given my contributions. Any tips on navigating this conversation or deciding if I should stay vs. look elsewhere?

Am I being impatient with myself? Happy to provide additional context. Any advice on making this transition, pursuing an MBA, or navigating internal promotions would be great. Thank you so much in advance for your thoughts!",Vichingo7,1,1.0,0,1731684592,2024-11-15 15:29:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gryw7c/advice_on_career_growth_mba_job_search_or_stay/,11,2024

1grygp2,Which path I should take? Any advice ,"Hi! I’d like to share a bit about myself and get some opinions. I’ve tried out a few different paths but still don’t know exactly what to aim for in the future so I would like to hear your opinions. 

I studied Linguistics, with the original goal of moving abroad, but honestly, I’m not very hopeful about making that happen through this field. I live in a non-English-speaking country, so being bilingual is probably my strongest asset. With that in mind, I see a few options:
	1.	I have the necessary certifications to teach English, though I’d need to study for about a year and take a teaching exam. If I become a teacher, It doesn’t pay extremely well, but it’s stable with a decent income. I wouldn’t say I’m passionate about teaching, but I do have experience and am pretty good at it—I don’t dislike it.
	2.	I worked for a year in foreign trade and got some good experience. I also completed a distance-learning program in this field. If I stick with it, I could earn well, but it’s the private sector, so there’s no real job security, and dealing with bad bosses and long hours can be a drag. I feel pretty neutral about this field—it’s not terrible, but choosing it just because it’s the easiest option doesn’t feel great. I can also do masters in IR here, it can be tiring but without writig a thesis maybe it won’t be too hard. 
	3.	I could do a master’s and try for academia, though I’m not very interested in my original field anymore. I’m more drawn to International Relations. Doing a master’s and landing a job later on seems pretty uncertain, and it’d require a lot of time and effort. I might enjoy it, but the uncertainty is a bit discouraging.

1gry2q2,2 years career break ,"Dear all,
I (35f)am wondering if I can be honest in job interviews, my last full time ended Jan 2023 and since then I had been taking break from an injury, and also, healing from the work bully I had from the job, I had been working part-time and got a license on physical instrcutor while I regularly working on my mental health for the long run and I am in a much better mental state now.

I started job hunting casually this year and turned down a few offers as I spotted traits that reminded me of the last toxic job I had. However, when I am asked about the break that I had, I wonder what I can tell them now that the break is getting long. I don't want to bad mouth at any workplace as it seems really unprofessional. 

I understand a 2 years break can look bad professionally, but I really got to understand and work on myself that i am much more resilient now, I am actually thankful, on a personal level that I took the break.

What do you guys think?

1grx39p,"Is it too late to pursue radiology? If not, is a radiology career worth it?","Hello. Current business student here. With my future feeling uncertain and the political events that have been playing out in the United States lately, I’ve been spending the last couple of weeks researching a career in radiology. 

Currently, I am in my second year of community college working towards a general business degree. With this, I was going to pursue my passion of going into concert production management, but with the job outlook not looking so great and a salary that doesn’t seem practical, I’m starting to think that I should pursue something in college that is more serious and reliable rather than doing something I love. I want to be financially stable in life, and I’m afraid if I keep working towards this business degree, I’m not going to have the stability that I’m hoping to have. The cost of living in Missouri is around $80,000 a year and the typical salary of going into concert production management is between $50,000 to $80,000. So now I’m looking into the healthcare field of radiology. 

I think I could do radiology because I’ve always done well in science classes I’ve had to take, and I believe I have the dedication and energy to take rigorous classes and exams. I’ve always had a high gpa and eagerness to learn and excel in academics. Also, the more business classes I have to take, the less I like it and it’s starting not to feel worth it anymore sadly. 

So if anyone has any advice for me going into radiology, it is much appreciated! This is a very different career path than what I originally pictured myself doing, but I think this is an interesting and important career I can go into and be satisfied with if everything works out like I hope it does. Music is something I can always do in my leisure time. Thank you.

Job 1 (the job I have now):

* Been here for ~5-6 years
* Medium COL city far from family
* Started out making 60K, now making 80K
* Love the team & community at work, have great friends at work, and the job has a lot of ""fun"" perks
* Not a lot of career growth potential, company-wide raises have been 3-5% for the last 2-3 years
* My current position doesn't have a lot of space for advancement, either in pay or title
* Working much less than 40 hours/week. Sometimes this is nice, and other times I feel incredibly bored

Job 2 (potential new job):

* ~180K in a high COL city closer to family
* Job wouldn't be as ""fun"" or come with the same type of community - more of a ""normal"" job
* The job function would be more intellectually stimulating, but the industry and environment would be far less exciting
* New city would be more fun, with way more dating opportunities 

Is Job 2 a slam dunk to pursue? I feel sort of like I've ""maxed out"" my potential at my current company (and in my current city), but I do love the people and organization itself and don't know that I'd be able to replicate that anywhere else.

1grveqk,How to choose between two appealing job offers?,"Hello! I would really appreciate some advice and guidance - all opinions will be appreciated. 

I have recently accepted a job offer that is external to my current employer. The job I have accepted is a software engineering role that is very flexible and has a good salary however it is fixed term for 1.5 years but I have been told this won’t be a problem. The dilemma I am experiencing is that my current employer would like to retain me so have offered me a new position that will match the salary of my external offer. This role is not identical as it will be a digital management position that is operational and not hands-on/technical like the software role will be… however this will be a permanent position. 

The problem is this.. I am on course to start my new role imminently but the role my current employer wants to port me into will not be ready for sometime (maybe months) as it requires a lengthy HR process and there is no guarantee it will materialise but it likely will eventually. I want to make sure I am making the right decision.. I have around 4 weeks to decide if I should follow through with my external offer… it may also be worth mentioning that both roles are extremely flexible but will require some office time",Fickle_Bathroom_814,2,0.75,0,1731674257,2024-11-15 12:37:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grveqk/how_to_choose_between_two_appealing_job_offers/,11,2024

1grusfl,Co-op student insecurity ,"Hi !

I'm french, I'm here to talk about being a student who's working to fund their studies. I need to pay my two last years of school, witch is quite expensive. So to cover the cost, I had to find a job that allows to switch between school and work, so I can learn faster by applying what I learn in class to real-world situations. 

The problem is that we are students and we have to pay our rent, the food, electricity and water etc.. Obviously the pay is really not important so we can't really try to save money. In addition, we doesn't have the right to have the french helps in the case that we loose that job. 

So the situation is really stressfull, especially in companies that don't truly value student workers as learners. In the case where the situation is not bearable for the student and he want's to leave beacause he have to much stress. He first have to find an other firm who wants to hire him. So if his situation is urgent, he can save his mindhealth but he will have to live with no pay for the time he doesn't find a new job.

What's your mind in that kind of situation ?

1grsl1k,"2 months into a new role and I’m coming home crying almost everyday from work. I’m feeling absolute stress, overwhelm and imposter syndrome","I just started a new role 2 months ago and I feel so so in out of my depth! I’ve never been this senior before in my life and feel completely not ready for this kind of role. My onboarding was terrible, I have had no proper training or handover and have just been thrown straight into the deep end to a role that should be done by 2 if not 3 people. 

The more I get to know the role, the more I begin to realise the person before me did EVERYTHING and set no boundaries, and was an absolute yes person. Things that I shouldn’t be doing are being expected of me by the wider team and I’m feeling like I have a fire hose to the face with the amount of things on my plate! Also the company has grown tremendously recently but they haven’t kept up with hiring for that growth, so just more and more keeps being added onto my plate. 

I’ve never felt this stressed in my life and have been coming home crying almost everyday. Today I finally reached breaking point and cried in my bosses office. I’m feeling so embarrassed!! But at least she knows how I really feel now. She was kind in her response but ultimately I need more people and more help to be able to make this work. Right now I’m really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel! 

I’m not usually one to give up and can be pretty hard on myself, but I’m starting to think this isn’t healthy for me and is going to cause me a mental breakdown from the stress! 

I’m worried if I start looking for other jobs, how do I explain why this role hasn’t worked out? I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle it or am job hoppy? At what point do I call it and say enough is enough? I’m wanting to give it a go for at least 6 months but I’m really struggling and it’s taking its toll on me - making me loose my confidence and absolutely consuming me. Appreciate any advice, TIA!

1grru6o,How to choose between a promotion now vs a future promotion,"
The team I currently work with has offered me a future promotion (by the beginning of 2025). 
Another team is offering me a promotion right now. 

My dilemma is that the future promotion is a higher position which comes with more pay and is my goal position. 

The promotion I am currently offered is a stepping stone to my goal position, still a pay increase but less. I would possibly need another promotion after this one before I could reach my goal position. So reaching my goal would take longer on this team. 

I’ve worked with both teams and have no issues with either one. I have great working relationships with both teams/superiors. I would have very similar perks (same amount of remote days, same office, etc.)

I would like to barter the promotion I’m currently being offered to hopefully move up the timeline of my other possible promotion or to at least get something in writing. But I’m worried that could come back and bite me in the ass. 

Also, I’ve been told the promotion I am being offered was specifically created for me. If I decide I don’t want it, it will not be posted/filled by someone else so I can’t accept and then rescind if my team offers me the other promotion early without burning bridge.

Any advice is welcome. ",Interesting_Move_846,0,0.5,2,1731659174,2024-11-15 08:26:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grru6o/how_to_choose_between_a_promotion_now_vs_a_future/,11,2024
1grrc3i,Retirement — there is no real escape from work!,"Your understanding of retirement is wrong!

Why do retired cricketers turn to commentary?  
Or retired footballers become coaches?  
  
It’s not just about money.  
So, why do they step into another kind of work?  
  
Because retirement gives you lots of free time!  
  
Now, think about it for yourself.  
  
If you quit your job today, what would you do with those extra 9-10 hours? How long will Netflix, travel, or partying keep you engaged? You’d get bored. Very quickly.

Your brain needs engagement in the form of problems to solve. This brings me to an important point.  
  
THERE IS NO REAL ESCAPE FROM WORK!  
  
Understanding this can help you escape work you hate much earlier in life. Because you don’t have to save till infinity. Instead, save for 2 to 5 years to build a safety net.  
  
Then start working on what you truly love.

With 2-3 years of consistent effort in any skill, you’ll almost certainly be able to monetize it. I urge you to think seriously about this.  
  
Retirement isn’t about stopping work—it’s about freedom:

• what to work on  
• when to work  
• who to work with  
• how much to work  
• and where to work from

It’s exactly why retired players, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates are still working.

The problem isn’t work—it’s the lack of freedom!

I have a powerful quote to summarise it. 

>""Retirement is not the end of the road. It is the beginning of the open highway.""

1grqvck,"Career advice: New role with higher pay and responsibilities, but new title feels off","Hi everyone , I’m looking for some advice about a career change at my current company.

I’ve been working in a Data Analytics team, doing a bit of everything over the years. I started as a Senior Analyst, working on Power BI and RPA solutions, and later moved into more of a functional role as a Manager. My current title is Manager, BI & Analytics.

Recently, I found out I’m being promoted—but it’s a bit complicated. There’s been a gap in our team for a Product Manager role, and they want me to step into that position. From what I understand, the responsibilities are higher, and the role is aligned with a Senior Manager level, so it’s technically a promotion. I also really like the new role—it’s exciting to take on something with this level of impact—and it comes with a higher compensation package, which is great.

However, my concern is the title. The position is called “Senior Product Analyst,” and I’m worried it doesn’t reflect the step up in responsibilities. For context, my current title is Manager, BI & Analytics, which feels more aligned with my career goals. “Senior Product Analyst” sounds more junior, even though it’s not.

What do you think? Could this title hurt my CV or LinkedIn presence in the long run? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I’d love to hear your thoughts or advice!

I previously went to college for a single term before I dropped out and went into trade school for HVAC. 
I wanted to ask, what would be the best path for this over a long term? 
Would this be a good pathway to a better future where I don’t rely on my body for the rest of my life? 
Is there a better option/degree to pursuit?

1grp7ib,Got a job offer from a place I'm unexcited about. Is there a way to just get a raise where I'm at without raising flags? Should I just take this offer?,"I work as a Data Analyst for an e-commerce company. Been there about 4 years, one internal promotion. I recently got my Master's in CS and have a Bachelor's in Management. I'm strong in SQL and Data Viz tools. I have experience with R, Python, and Javascript / D3. I wouldn't say I'm a pro, but I've done independent projects such as creating an NLP dashboard with Python within a week having never done it before.... I can learn pretty quickly. These days it's a lot of ad-hoc work with other teams 

Right now, my job pays $78k. Feels low. I've begun struggling financially as my partner makes much less than I do and life is more expensive. I want to pivot from e-commerce. I know there aren't really ""safe"" industry to work in the US, but the layoffs, rotating door of leadership, and general mismanagement are extremely tiring. As for my main boss, as much as I love him personally, I feel stifled as he's not a delegator. Our whole team has been a bit stagnant because we've never been properly onboarded. We get little face time and he's kind of just gone. Overall, I'm stressed and disenfranchised.

I started applying elsewhere in September and did well. It's slowed down since. I assume nobody's hiring at this point in the year. I got one offer a few weeks ago for about 25% more, but the company was on a downward spiral. Benefits were worse, the team didn't seem like one I wanted to work for, it didn't make sense. I do have some weird sense of loyalty to my existing company and co-workers I love. I turned it down. Which worked out in my favor because a big lawsuit dropped shortly thereafter and layoffs happened fast.

This week, I got an offer from another company. $96k. Benefits are standard. The only change I hate is I go from unlimited PTO to 18 days, with sick days included in that total. Right now I have unlimited and my boss is great about it (i.e., two weeks ago my pet died and I needed 3 days, got it no questions asked). They are a direct competitor. They have had a difficult time financially compared to where they were ten years ago. But it's still a reputable name. I liked who I've spoken to, but have had more questions the more I look into it. For example, this job I got an offer for has lived under 3 different departments in recent years. There's been 3+ CEO changes as well over the last three years. They did offer remote work, which is the most important thing to me, but did say to truly grow you'd need to relocate. So it really feels like a placeholder. I know I said I don't want to remain in e-commerce, but I did apply to a few ""safety companies"" just to see what pay would be like and if everything else was similar to my current company, I'd jump. If this job were $105-$110k, I think I'd suck it up and take it for sure.

I haven't made a decision, but I lean no. I'm stressed because I am underpaid now. It's hard to get a hold of my boss especially around ""holiday"" season. I have big life changes next year including an insane student loan bill, wanting to get married, wanting to finally move to an apartment that isn't 700sqft. I need change. Everyone at my company really likes me and I think suddenly giving my notice would put them in a really bad spot. It'd shock them. So I have value, but don't think there's much opportunity to get a raise and if there is...I just don't know how to go about that conversation. Sometimes I think I'm dumb for turning down more money outright, but I just feel like I'm entering the same exact kind of company with even more turbulence.

I don't really know where the question in all of this lies. I wish my current company would just boost me to a salary I deserve and don't know where to go with that convo. And I feel dumb turning down another opportunity, but I cannot get excited about it. To know benefits are worse, growth is stagnant... I mean, that PTO feels rough. I think more money may alleviate that, but not sure what I can negotiate - they mentioned how competitive this role is and want a decision before the weekend. I guess I'm just looking for advice as things slow down in the job market as I begin to lose some hope and am confused if I'm doing this all correctly. I've never been in a position before with any kind of leverage and had the freedom to say no so this is all a bit new. I just feel like for how much everyone where I work calls me a ""rockstar"" that I'm severely underpaid, yet the people offering me jobs aren't really at the top of my list.",Hefty-Kale-9588,1,1.0,0,1731648203,2024-11-15 05:23:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grp7ib/got_a_job_offer_from_a_place_im_unexcited_about/,11,2024

So to clearify, am 20 and about to get in uni, med school is my dream, but my entrance result test failed me to get in med school, but it was not a complete failure  for i did ended up in a dental school, when i went there i tried my absolute best to be there and like it there, but my heart always was for med school, so i tried once more while being in dental school but again i ended up with same results.

Now i have 2 choices either to continue with dental school or quite dental school and give my last 100% for med school exam.(last cause if i failed in 3rd attempt I'd have to just simply go with what ever career options are open for me cause financial stress would be much greater if i tried for 4rth attempt) 

The thing is am on a crossroads, i do want to try for med school, but what if i failed? I have to give up what i already have in my hand and i will lose what i already had in my hand. But if i do continue with dental school in next 10 years what if i greatly regret not having tried for med school? To put it in short i have no self confidence. 

One thing i know i do reallly badly want to try for med school, but i have no self confidence and even if i do have what if i fail still? And even if i do choose dental and if i do end up loving it but when i would entre the real deal what if i just dont want to do it? 

I'll make it clear, i have never discriminate between dentistry and medicine i belive both are equal and as important as each other. Without medicine humanity wont be able to lead a healthy and happy life and without dentistry humanity still wont be able to lead a healthy and happy life. Its just am scared drained and what not. Its already been a gruesomely long year and right now i want an answer a decision to follow. 

I can not do it on my own, please guide me through it, i have tried everything and at this point am exhusted.

Sorry for the very unprofessional manner of this post, am not depressed or anything just exhusted my life feels like a standstill right now as all my fellow friends are at same age as me or maybe a year or two younger and already on their happy career paths. And am stuck. So am just frustrated and want to get ahead. But this fog in my brain, it just is not clearing up. Thats why i am seeking help here. In real world i did went to a therapist, did took advice from my parents and guardians and alll of them said you are the one who needs to make a choice and am unable to do it. 

Am not saying to make a choice for me. Just guide me through it, give me some insight about what is rignt and what is wrong.

1groljs,New job and commute,I have a possible job offer (interview next Friday) that is a much better career for personal growth and double the salary in the long run with better benefits than my current work place. Im currently a diesel mechanic working in a super toxic shop thats constant drama all day every day and it’s honestly mentally killed me to a point where my spouse has noticed my mental state decline. Ive been here 3 years almost 4 now. The offer is in aero space and pay would be anywhere between 35-45 starting with a raise every 6 months till at maximum salary which is 55+. I make 27 now. Better benefits and I’m in union after 90 days. Only downside is the commute is 60-70 miles one way depending which way I go and an hour fifteen to twenty obviously traffic depending mostly all highway. Me and my girlfriend have already been discussing buying a house closer as we live in an apartment now if it all works out in the next 1-2 years that would definitely help with my commute. But wanted to see some reddit input on this and read some other experiences. I went digging through old threads about long commutes but wanted to add mine.

1gro9jo,Thinking of sending this email to a co-worker,"Title: Professional Conduct and Communication  

To The Attention Of [Title FirstName LastName],  

Following our recent conversation yesterday, I have determined that it would be most appropriate to maintain a strictly formal and professional approach in all future communications. Should you feel that this approach does not align with your expectations or may impede the objectives of my [Topic] training, I encourage you to address this with [Boss] or any relevant authority. However, I consider this specific discussion to be concluded and will not be revisiting it further.

Over the past several months, I have observed a recurring pattern of interactions that have complicated establishing a constructive working relationship within this environment. Indirect exchanges and escalations, which at times have seemed intended to compromise my standing, are of particular concern. Additionally, the expectation of privacy is applied selectively, with mine not receiving the same consideration as that afforded to others. Such dynamics frequently resemble an exclusive social structure, which I find at odds with a collaborative and professional workplace.  

While I acknowledge my part in this dynamic, the consequences I have faced are disproportionate to my actions. Whether or not you share this view, these recurring issues have substantially reduced my confidence in our working relationship. Consequently, I will be adhering to a strictly professional and formal framework for all future interactions.  

I anticipate that our meeting on Monday, 18 November 2024, will be conducted in a productive and professional manner, focusing exclusively on [Topic] objectives.  

As this correspondence reflects my final position, feel free to share it with any relevant parties if necessary.

I started looking at job listings and found that pretty much all of them want a bachelors. I knew many of them did before, but I thought some beginner positions would accept an associates. 

I'm so frustrated because I got an associates degree in graphic design after high school, which I realized I actually hated in the last semester. Then I switched to programming, and now I feel like I've wasted another two damn years on a degree that won't do me any good. 

On top of that, I feel like I don't have enough knowledge to hold a job. I've learned a lot, but I'm so scared it's not enough. It's like I know how to code decently well, but I don't understand a lot of the fundamentals (i.e. algorithms, anything cloud). 

I know tech is also super competitive right now, so my chances are probably even lower. Should I go back and get a bachelors, or will I be able to find an ok job? 

I'm freaking out specifically because I put my two weeks in at my very accommodating, consistent part time job, and if I'm going back to school I'd like to keep it. I still live at home but I'm going to need to pay for school out of pocket. 

 (I know its dumb to put your two weeks in without having another job lined up. The only reason I did is because it's my last semester, and I wanted a week or so off to finish my last project. I gave my boss the option, because 1. It would be a huge ordeal to find coverage and 2. It's my last semester and I didn't know how long it would take me to find a job. She asked if I was comfortable putting in my two weeks and I said yes.) 

Please help, any advice you could give would be great! I know a portfolio can help, I plan to show the Java app I'm building in my last class, but I don't have any others that are good enough I fear.

1grnuv0,Intervieww in 15 MINSSS! ,"I’m currently working as a Tax Associate and have been in this role for about two months now. How do I answer ""Why are you leaving so soon?"" tbh, there are a few factors, mainly the low pay.

TB - during the interview, my current employer mentioned that the company was ACCA-approved. After joining, I found out that they had only just registered for the process and are not yet approved. It’s unclear why the approval is taking so long, and I’m unsure if it’s even going to happen anytime soon. The company is very small, with only two employees including me, which limits growth opportunities as well. 

My question is: How should I frame my response without coming across as if I’m bitching about my current employer? I want to stay professional but also explain my reasons for looking elsewhere. PLEASEEE HELPPP

1grno7l,"If it feels like I’m being taken advantage of at work, am I?","I’ve been at my job since May of 2023.
My title is, “Sales Support Administrator” however, I do everything.

Since I’ve been here, I’ve completely revamped things into a more suitable 21st century kind of way.

We do sales and we have no CRM.
We have no sort of pipeline or anything to help us keep track of orders or anything like that. Every order that was processed, sits pretty in my head or in our accounting application. Which is nuts.

I’ve since utilized Microsoft lists to create some sort of CRM pipeline to give the team a visual so they know what’s going on with each order.

All the while, the other admin that was here and supported our other warehouse/office got let go leaving me to support the whole company. The warehouse/office I’m at along with the other warehouse/office in CA long distance. I’ve stayed late several times to assists this office and its staff as they are two hours behind.

Every new person that has been brought in, I’ve trained them and got them to where they need to be. This includes new salesmen, a new admin for the other office that left after a month and a half because it was too hard for her and technical sales person.
Now a new salesman is coming in and sure enough, I’m gunna have to train them too.

Our accountant is Asian and doesn’t fully understand English or speak it (not to criticize at all. I’m half Asian and I understand as both my grandmas struggle as well. It honestly taught me the patience needed to work with this lady, so I’m grateful.), and I’m having to do a good portion of her job. She’s meant to take payments from customers and there has been several times where customers want to pay and I’ve transferred them to her and she gets confused and just hangs up on them.
She’s also meant to be doing all of the collecting on late payments for us, but any sort of push back from a customer and she “doesn’t understand” or “they don’t understand me” or “I don’t understand what they need to pay”, whatever. It turns into me being the one to email or call these people because if I don’t, then they can’t place anymore orders as our system legit stops their account and it’s not possible.

Our warehouse/shipping guy has been slacking lately. I have no clue what’s going on with him because he wasn’t always the kind of person that just did nothing.
But for the last 6 months, I’ve had to tell him things over and over and over again and even after doing all of that, he still forgets and messes stuff up or does the exact opposite of what he needs to do and it’s just absolutely ridiculous. I have no clue how someone can just mess things up so often and not learn from the mistakes done. He’s honestly at the point where he doesn’t even take accountability anymore and just makes up excuses. I’ve now taken on half of his whole job just to make sure stuff is getting done on time and we don’t have 30-50 orders sitting and not being shipped anymore.

Every little thing our CEO asks me to do or needs done, I stop and do it.

I’m the one that keeps things organized and going for this company. I have no clue what they would do if I up and quit today and left them to fend for themselves. They would legit be lost in the sauce.

All of this while still doing my original job, supporting the sales team by the way.
It honestly feels like I’m supporting the whole company and managing the whole company.
In all honesty, my boss has mentioned making me the operations manager for the whole company. However, he’s dangled that carrot in front of me for a whole year now and I’m just sick of hearing it. 

We’ve completely shut down our CA office and have moved everything to my current location and he claims new staff need to be hired and blah blah blah.
I honestly am just so over the excuses at this point that it’s either he follows through with what he’s said or I’m out.

I have done so much extra work outside of my original contract/job title that this should be considered robbery of my time and skill set. I took this job because I was at a job where I did everything and it was a lot.
I had minimal time to do anything outside of work and with me and my husband getting older, we want to start a family.
I figured this job was ideal for that because I could be home at a decent time for the child and not have to work weekends, etc.
I took a pay cut to have this.

But now I’m still dealing with having to do all of that on top of not getting paid what I was being paid to do it originally.
It really makes me regret leaving my last job because at least then, I would have had funds for my family or future children.
Right now I can’t even afford a daycare or daily babysitter because I’m definitely going to need one if I have to work all of these hours. And yes, my husband makes money. However, he travels 25% of the time and can’t always be home with the child.

I’ve talked to my boss about me wanting to plan to get pregnant in the next 6 months - a year and he legit looks me in the eyes and says “not allowed”. And yeah, it could be seen as joking, however, I literally feel like I can’t.
I take two days off and come back to a crap show that takes me a week and a half to sort through. How would I be able to take the 6-8 weeks off needed to have a baby?

I don’t know.
I don’t know if everything I’m feeling is just emotional anxiousness (I do have diagnosed anxiety. However, I don’t take any sort of medication for it because I watched my mom struggle from pills to pill and still struggle my whole life and I chose to learn how to manage it myself so I don’t have to depend on medication. I’ve come a long way in just the last 8 years in this regard.) or something real.

Any advice is welcome.
Even if it’s just to tell me that I’m being crazy and to relax/chill.",mrs_c0ach,2,0.75,0,1731642867,2024-11-15 03:54:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grno7l/if_it_feels_like_im_being_taken_advantage_of_at/,11,2024
1grnemq,Received a new job offer that I'm not too excited about. Do I hold on and wait for something I really like? Speak to existing employer? Ask for more from this job?,"I work as a Data Analyst for an e-commerce company. Been there about 4 years, one internal promotion with another team. I recently received my Master's in CS and have a Bachelor's in Management. I'm very strong in SQL and Data Viz tools. I also have experience with R, Python, and Javascript / D3. I wouldn't say I'm a pro, but I've done independent projects such as creating an NLP dashboard with Python within a week having never done it before....TLDR, I can learn pretty quickly. These days it's a lot of ad-hoc work with other teams cross functionally

Right now, my job pays $78k. Feels low. I've begun struggling a bit financially as my partner makes much less than I do and life is more expensive. I've really want to pivot from online e-commerce. I know there aren't really ""safe"" places to work in the US right now, but it's ridden with constant layoffs, instability with leadership, and things are so mismanaged. As for my main boss, as much as I love him personally, he's stifling. He's not a delegator. Our whole team has been a bit stagnant in terms of growth because we've never been properly onboarded. We get little face time each week and he's kind of just gone. Between that and the constant exec changes and RTO mandates (I was grandfathered remote due to my performance), I'm stressed and disenfranchised.

I started applying around in September and did well. It's now slowed down significantly. I assume nobody's hiring at this point in the year year. I got one offer a few weeks ago for about 25% more in salary, but the company was on a bit of a downward spiral. Benefits were a lot worse, the team didn't seem like one I wanted to work for, it didn't make sense. It was a money play and I do have some weird sense of loyalty to my existing company. I turned it down. Which worked out in my favor because there was this big lawsuit coming out about them some time later and news of layoffs / restructuring. It was in a similar industry, but not e-commerce.

This week, I got an offer from another company. $96k. Benefits are....standard. The only change I really dislike is I go from unlimited PTO to 18 days, with sick days included in that. Kind of a turn off. Right now I have unlimited and my boss is great about it (i.e., two weeks ago my pet died and I needed 3 days, got it no questions asked). They are a direct competitor for who I work for now. They have had a difficult time financially compared to where they were ten years ago. But it's still a reputable name. I liked who I've spoken to, but have had more questions the more I look into it. For example, this job I got an offer for has lived under 3 different departments in recent years - so it shifts around. There's been 3+ CEO changes as well. They did offer remote work, which is the most important thing to me, but did say to truly grow you'd need to relocate. So it really feels like a placeholder. I know I said I don't want to remain in e-commerce, but I did apply to a few ""safety companies"" just to see what pay would be like and if everything else was similar to my current company, I'd jump. If this job were $105-$110k, I think I'd suck it up and take it for sure. 

I haven't made a decision, but I lean no. I'm stressed because I am underpaid now. It's hard to ever get a hold of my boss especially around ""holiday"" season. I have big life changes next year including an insane student loan bill, wanting to get married, wanting to finally move to an apartment that isn't 700sqft. I need change. Everyone at my company really likes me and I do think suddenly giving my notice would put them in a really bad spot. It'd shock them. So I have value, but don't think there's much opportunity to get a raise and if there is...I just don't know how to go about that conversation. Sometimes I think I'm dumb for turning down more money outright, but I just feel like I'm entering the same exact kind of company with even more turbulence. 

I don't really know where the question in all of this lies. I wish my current company would boost me to a salary I deserve and don't know where to go with that convo. And I feel dumb turning down another opportunity, but I cannot get excited about it. To know benefits are worse, growth is stagnant... I mean, that PTO feels rough. I think more money may alleviate that, but not sure what I can negotiate - they mentioned how competitive this role is and want a decision before the weekend. I guess I'm just looking for advice as things slow down in the job market, I begin to lose some hope and am confused if I'm doing this all correctly. I've never been in a position before with any kind of leverage and had the freedom to say no so this is all a bit new. I just feel like for how much everyone where I work calls me a ""rockstar"" that I'm severely underpaid, yet the people offering me jobs aren't really at the top of my list.",Hefty-Kale-9588,1,1.0,0,1731641959,2024-11-15 03:39:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grnemq/received_a_new_job_offer_that_im_not_too_excited/,11,2024

For her, I’m looking for recommendations on certifications, courses, or entry-level roles that might be suitable and ways she could showcase transferable skills if possible.

1grmnhf,Corporate Frustration ,"I’m curious what advice you may have for this situation: 

Current roles in a very small marketing team for a large retail chain include the following:

Social Media Management: content creation, multi-platform engagement (dm’s, monitoring, posting, insight analysis) and social strategies. All solo - longest responsibility covering 2-3 brand profiles. 

Graphic Design: self taught with some college education, but with 10 years experience and considered an equal to creative director. Providing content for social media, in-store materials, external crm/mms content, campaigns, exteriors, private label package designs, website content, all while overseeing multiple needs for events and concepts. 

Content marketing (specialist): given title as the combined roles above. 

Other minor but impactful positions: brand development, marketing strategies and campaign development, communications (internal and external), manage event marketing and creative development, and overall involvement in any marketing tactics and industry insights. 

The situation is simply having an unorganized corporate structure with a large workload of poor project management, internal communication, and marketing control. Currently struggling with providing very clear feedback and strategic ideas as they are being taken credit for by a new CMO position coming from an entire different industry or ignored due to personal ambition to do their own plan/impress higher management(with no feedback on provided strategy/concept) 

While managing multiple roles during a 40hr work week. Tenure has overall been 10+, shy of 60k year. 

Is that fair to say this is underpaid? How do I approach an unfit CMO, with any upper management ignoring red flag decisions and have had a track record of also dismissing feedback and concerns on some of the marketing decisions. 

Common feedback from colleagues as well.

* I'm the only one allowed, besides my boss, to manage the POS and safe. Few days in he said he ""should"" learn how to use them and manage the register, ""just in case"".
* Barely two weeks in, he's asking for the store keys and that saying he's ""ready"" to open and close the store.
* Overall he comes as too cocky, saying he can do anything and making decisions on his own without properly following procedure or what he's been told to do.

Here's the thing - I'm completely burnt out. The endless sprints, constant on-call rotations, and fixing other people's legacy code has killed my passion for programming. The money is great, but I dread opening my laptop every morning. I used to love coding and building things, but corporate development has sucked the joy out of it.

My true passion is teaching. I've been mentoring junior devs and occasionally volunteering teaching coding to high school students on weekends. It's the only part of my week I genuinely look forward to. I've thought about becoming a teacher or instructor at a coding bootcamp, but the massive pay cut is terrifying. I have a mortgage and student loans that need my current salary level.

I've also considered technical writing or developer advocacy roles, but I'm not sure if that's just running away from my problems. Starting my own business teaching coding is another dream, but the uncertainty is scary.

Has anyone made a similar transition? How did you handle the financial aspect? Am I crazy for wanting to leave a ""cushy"" tech job? Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated.""

Thanks in advanced",sachika_Prism,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1731631953,2024-11-15 00:52:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1grk7pt/late_20s_software_engineer_burning_out_need_a/,11,2024
1grjs4z,I got rehired and I feel weird,"I (35f) got rehired at a company that I have a little over a decade with. I have a repoire with my manager. I applied to several locations before he called me in for a position that I had not previously done with the company. I was hired on for a different department but he told me that I'm going to train for 2 weeks and then he'll open the position. He assures me I will get it. 

Now, I feel weird. The person training me (28m) has been doing the job for a few weeks before I arrived. I have not discussed with him what my manager and I discussed. He really believes he holds this position now. He openly discusses his pay and I know that I make more than him already. It all just makes me feel so awkward. 

My manager told me that he wants me to have the job because I have been a team lead with the company before. I feel I was very successful at it. This position is something completely different. I like the work and the hours. 

I don't know how to proceed with the person training me. He is great and I believe we could make a great team. I'm worried he will feel slighted. I'm also only slightly worried I won't get the position.

She is interviewing with a place that is an hour away for three days a week work. She knows the boss there and gets along well with her. The only issue is the commute but it could be much better for her sanity.

It was the only offer I received straight out of college and in the moment I thought it would be smarter to gain experience for a year, gain experience and eventually move back to my homework. It has been one year and a half and I plan on quitting in January. I’m not a confrontational person at all so I’m unsure how to approach or even start to say that I have decided to relocate. I love the company, they were great, I have learned a lot in my time here. I know I don’t owe corporate America anything but I’m just so nervous.

Also, I’m quitting because I want to be closer to my family. My bf and I are very serious and have been talking about marriage. Lastly, I come from a diverse city and this city is 4 hours away from my hometown. I’m just exhausted of driving back almost every weekend, basically living in two cities throughout one week. I have no one here, no family, support system or friends, it’s time for me to move on but as the date I have set to quit approaches the more nervous and anxious I become.

I’m assuming this is a conversation about my compensation, since I did not give them a hard number before and said that I was willing to work within the range posted on the job description. 

I’m guessing they want to see how much I ask for before giving me the offer. Is there a possibility that they will not pick me if I ask for comp on the end of the range? I know they have a few other candidates who made it to the final round.

My coach and family thinks I came in my own way and that reporting to the VP is a downgrade and that it would just look like some guy is trying to save me. I’m a woman. 
This doesn’t mean a direct promotion for the VP but I feel they will say that he’s had to rescue me and push for his promotion. 
I was desperate, tired and burned out. I couldn’t handle not having any backup. I was totally independent but exhausted. I could have argued for a promotion and having a seat on the table with the VP but I am not very confident.

Recently I left the company mostly because we had some disagreements with my co-founder (CEO), and we thought it was best for me to left the company.

  
I have always visualized that whenever I left the company, I was going to be super motivated to start something new, but that has not been the case, I just feel empty, and don't feel personally motivated to start something again.

  
I have some money saved so I could take some time to recharge energies and get started again. However, I'm scared that, that drive might never come again.. So I'm probably thinking it could be best to get a job somewhere so I can have more runway, also scared that by getting a job I might kill all hopes of starting a new company in the future.

For a bit of context. I'm in my early 30s, used to code when we were starting, but haven't coded in a while, probably closer to a Product Manager now.

My question: should I mention compensation even though I feel I’m comped quite fairly already? Raises happen in March each year and while I think it’s likely I will get another 5% at least, is there a risk that if I don’t say anything they think I’m happy and I don’t get as much?

First thing on my resume is an internship with a political company that ran campaigns. I started as a intern doing phone banking, but did so well I got promoted to team lead and led my team in developing a paper on the rail strikes. Then I couldn’t find a job anywhere and needed something so I became an office administrator. Started picking up other things at that job and started doing staffing recruiter stuff so I have that on my resume as well. My most recent job was a contract at a company doing voter registrations. I started as quality control and moved to Data Integrity Analyst where I was “fact checking” that all of our door knockers in Michigan (150 ppl) were doing what they should be. 

All in all, I really just want to make the world a better place. I want to work for a nonprofit, but am unsure of what I should even be applying for because I don’t have any great experience. I’d really be happy doing anything that will make a positive impact.

1gratww,Need Advice,"Recently the company I work at did an anonymous Q&A. We were given the opportunity to ask questions about anything going on within the company. We were recently bought out by a bigger corporation. Anyway, a lot of changes happening within the company and people are curious about what happens next. One of the people that works there, was told today she couldn’t go on this training opportunity because the managers think that she was the person asking questions about pay, switching departments, remote work etc. they advised her that the president of the company pulled her package after she had already been accepted because he ‘didn’t want her embarrassing the company.’ Mind you the Q&A was anonymous and she had only asked one question and none of them were within that topic. Is that even ok? What can she do? The bigger company that bought us out, chose her specifically to attend this wonderful opportunity and it’s being taken away from her for what I feel like is no reason. I also feel as though one of the managers singled her out of 80 other people online during the Q&A to say it was her because she has jealous issues. She has held up other people from getting promotions as well. This manager also picks and chooses who she wants to give raises to… her bestie got a promotion and a significant raise while another employee who has been there almost 2yrs is still struggling on minimum wage and can barely afford to feed their family.. it’s weird.

1gra7aj,"California Based, what is the quickest way for me to get into a radiology technician career?","I’m 28 and sitting on 73 units that I received at a state university 5 years ago. Back then, I was hoping to get into a veterinary profession because of a few months of inspiring volunteer hours that I did at a small animal hospital near my college. I dropped out of said university 5 years ago because of some financial and mental difficulties and am now ready to return. I quickly discovered that veterinary medicine does not pay the best and have found that most everyone I’ve talked to within the field are either burnt out or leaving animal medicine for human altogether. Because of this, I am now enrolled in my local community college with the hopes of eventually getting into their rad tech major. I have no experience in a human hospital but enjoyed my time at an animal hospital so much that this feels like the right path. I’ve spoken to a few college counselors and am honestly pretty stressed about the information I’ve received. Some counselors have told me that my units are at risk for expiration and others have told me that I am fine but to be prepared to wait at least 3 years to get into the community college rad tech major. Because I am sitting on potential expiring units and some pre-existing student loans from my unfinished university degree, I need to figure the quickest way to get everything done. I’ve looked into trades, private and community colleges but I’m honestly still so lost. While I am willing to take out more loans to go the trade route, I’ve heard that they do not educate nearly as well as their community counterparts parts and this scares me.

I have also started taking on assistant managerial roles in my most recent engagement, where I have been helping to assign work and give guidance to some of the new joiners.

My issue is that I just dont feel happy with my job. I am very much so just living for the weekend, and dread having to go back to work on Mondays. Due to my new role, I am often left to my own devices to prioritise and complete work, but my motivation has been completed depleted over the past couple months.

I graduated with a 1:1 in Economics in the summer of 2023, and I know my main strengths are my analytical and organisational skills. However I am also someone that really values having good relationships with my colleagues, and I dont think I'm quite suited to the corporate environment I am currently in.

1gr9b4r,How do I know if I'm ready to make the leap (shift careers)?,"Hello People,

I'm 24M. I have always wanted to get into IT, but I majored in Business Administration (for reasons that are too long to elaborate now). I'm currently working as a Product Analyst cum Pre-Sales analyst at an IT company, after landing an opportunity to work as an intern one and a half years ago. I also got a CSPO certification a couple of months back. I will humbly say that I'm better than okay in what I do, which is mostly product configurations, evaluate RFPs, make proposals for potential SW projects, do presentations/product demonstrations and so on. And I make an okay amount doing this. But I've always wanted to do more technical things, technical problem solving, coding, etc. The most personal satisfaction I gained (contrary to the achievements I'm being recognized for) was two integrations that we did for two different clients. Evaluating the APIs and testing somehow made me more satisfied. To get into a much more technical role, I started pursuing a part-time MSc. in IT few months back. I have been doing okay in the courses (so far we had OOP with C#, Data Structures and Algorithms and currently SD Environments - Basically Linux and scripting and Big Data - SQL and noSQL dbs). I have also gotten into react and nodejs and working on a personal project (kind of big) these days, and I'm planning to finish this project at the end of this month or at the beginning of December at the latest. Apart from this I have a to-do app under my belt which I did with react and then a C# terminal application covering OOP fundamentals. I have been looking at jobs (BA, Product Owner) but not actively applying for anything, because I feel like I need a change of scenery. I know I want a SE job. It's a shame that I can't even find enough time to work on my project or work on anything exploratively related to SE right now because of work. I feel like my clock is ticking for absolutely no reason. I want to apply for SE jobs, but for some reason I feel like I should be more ready, that I should know a lot more things before I can become a good SE. I know an entry level role would be a pay-cut (maybe more than 50%) but I feel like in the long run it can definitely bring me financial returns as well. It's just that I can't really decide what to do now. Will ever know when the time is right, or is that time now?

I work in a small company as a web developer intern. I have been working here for six months, and I want to leave. At the beginning, they told me and some other guys that we would have performance reviews every 2-3 months and then a pay raise because, at the start, we were working for below minimum wage. They also told us that they would give us new laptops and guarantee us mentors, code reviews, and, as I said earlier, pay raises. But six months have passed, and we have had zero performance reviews, zero pay raises, not a single mentor was assigned to us, and also we can't work full time because there is not enough work to do (it is a very small company of seven people including me). I bought a laptop with my own money. Sometimes the manager can't keep up with all the things he needs to do, so sometimes he can ignore my messages for 2-6 hours during a working day. Also, we are getting paid by the hour instead of a fixed full-time wage, so all the hours where I wait for a response from the manager or am just waiting for a new task are not getting paid.

I am trying to find a new place, and if I find a better place with a better wage, how should I leave? I have an internship contract until the end of December. Should I say to the manager that I won't work until the end of the contract if I will find a better opportunity? The second option is, until the end of the contract, to try to work two jobs if I find a new job and they want me to start immediately.

1gr56x2,Contractor Dilemma: Accepting a Full-Time Role or Waiting for the Right Offer,"Hi, I've been looking for a full-time role for about six months. During this time, I’ve been working as a contractor at Wells Fargo. Recently, I received an offer for a full-time position with Truist Bank. I enjoy my current contractor role, and from what I know about the Truist role, I believe I’d enjoy that as well.

Currently, I’m making $46 per hour, which translates to about $95k annually, but the Truist offer is for $95k as well. My contract at Wells has about four months remaining, with a chance of converting to full-time at a salary range of $90k to $130k.

I’m struggling with the pay difference. Over the years, people have told me not to focus too much on salary and to think of roles like this as stepping stones toward my ultimate career and income goals. But I feel that, with my MBA, PMP, and over five years of experience in process improvement roles, I should be making $120k or more by now—though I haven’t received offers at that level.

I’m unsure if my expectations are unrealistic and if I should take the job since it’s what’s being offered, or if I should keep searching for a role that better matches my salary expectations, hoping that if nothing else works out, my contract might eventually convert to a full-time position.

p.s. I have spoken with the recruiter to increase the salary offer but they said $95k is the max. ",Joban_Alpha,1,1.0,0,1731592230,2024-11-14 13:50:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gr56x2/contractor_dilemma_accepting_a_fulltime_role_or/,11,2024

I pursued graduate studies in art history, aiming to become a professor. After two years as a Ph.D. student, I left the program with a master’s degree, feeling exhausted,  disillusioned, and hungry.

Surprisingly enough, I secured a full-time teaching position right out of grad school! It’s not a traditional professor role, but I get to teach what I love, and make enough money to be doing half-alright. However, I’m far from home and family and eager to get out of the hot, sticky hellhole known as Florida. Without a Ph.D., returning to an art history classroom seems unlikely, which is disappointing.

Right now, I’m earning a master’s degree in instructional design at my institution. I’ll complete a graduate certificate this month, with the full degree expected in eight months. With four years of professional teaching experience, two years as a graduate instructor of record, and a graduate certificate, do you think I really need the master’s to find meaningful work? So many jobs say they want someone with a master's in Instructional Design, but I only have a certificate and experience. I want to GTFO, but don't want to shoot myself in the foot. I’d be happy in a college office role, such as a curriculum specialist. Part of me is saying that without the MA, I would not necessarily lock myself out of the market, but I would lock myself out of better paying and more meaningful job opportunities. Thoughts? 

**TL:DR:** I have a bachelors in education, an MA in art history, four years of professional teaching experience, two years of graduate teaching experience (instructor of record), a graduate certificate in instructional design, and worry that without an MA in instructional design, I will not be competitive on the market.

Health insturance cost more with hybrid and doesn't start until jan 1st!! 

The other postion - pays more. I will receive a certification that I can use in future. Instuance starts day 1. I'll be making $120 more every pay period before taxes are out when you add up insturance and compare the two.  This postion is 5 days a week 8 am to 430.

1gr34bi,19M Seeking Direction After Internship in Sweden,"I’m a 19-year-old from Barbados, wrapping up a 3-month sales and marketing internship in Sweden. I have an Associate Degree in Computer Science, which I pursued mostly because of the potential salary and the “future-proof” hype around tech. I love the idea of creating things people use every day, but coding itself? I’ve never been passionate about it (or particularly good at it). Honestly, I think I chose it more for the money and status than any real interest.

Coming to Sweden was my way of breaking out of my comfort zone and potentially finding a job that wasn't in Barbados but also finding something (particularly in business) that I may be good at and pursue without committing to a full gap year. Going back to Barbados would feel like slipping back into old routines—and comfortable relationships—that could keep me stuck. This trip has let me explore, make a ton of friends, and allowed me to think and search for a career path that actually aligns with my goals and interests, but if this internship doesn’t lead to a clear next step, I’m left a bit directionless.

So what’s my real goal? It's not just about money; Like many others, I want the freedom to support my family, help my friends, and do something meaningful. When I ask people, “What would you be doing right now if you had infinite money?” the answer I would give when it eventually made its way back to me was, ""I'd be studying something I’m truly interested in, like cognitive science or sociology, while creating content—writing, short films, and projects with a positive impact"" (something along those lines). Ironically, it was the “financial freedom” dream that led me to Computer Science in the first place, though without the salary hype, I don’t think I would have chosen it. Sociology and cognitive science are recent interests, but I worry they might not offer the kind of financial security I want (I also think I would be doing it more out of curiosity than to get a job in it). **Plus**, the university back home doesn’t even offer the courses I’d need.

I’m trying to understand what I truly want in life, so I can stop being so indecisive. I know no one can hand me my purpose or advice that can fit perfectly align with every variable in my life, but any advice on practical steps, other countries, paths or opportunities to consider if Sweden doesn’t work out, or skills I should focus on to build the life I want would be appreciated.

I’ve looked into options like UK Degree Apprenticeships and scholarships abroad, but they’re more than my family can support (I’m open to options still of course). But overall I think the privilege of having so many options makes it so hard to settle on anything, the thought that there might be a path out there that could combine both financial freedom and my interests drives me crazy. Maybe I'm being too idealistic.

Feel free to give me a reality check if necessary.",Economy-Inside2527,2,1.0,0,1731585329,2024-11-14 11:55:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gr34bi/19m_seeking_direction_after_internship_in_sweden/,11,2024

1gr2e77,I feel like I’m stuck in a grey zone and I don’t know how to maneuver out of it ,"I (29 M : almost 30 in a few days) applied and accepted a full time job as an “Ad Sales Financial Analyst” for a very popular news company in NYC. This was a big jump for me since I worked in sales as an account coordinator (basically placing commercials in our database to run on our TV Networks) and had little experience as an analyst, let alone excel. I was very honest during my interview process about my skillset in excel and was told that it was fine and that they would do their best to teach me what I needed to know to get the job done. I’m about to hit my 1 year anniversary as an Analyst and I feel like i haven’t picked up much due to a lack of training, lack of resources to compare my work, and a lack of direction. 

So what is it that I do:
I am a financial analyst for a very popular news company. My job consists of pricing and planning for our news networks and support weekly, monthly and quarterly finance cycles that include budgeting, forecasting and analysis on close. Basically we create a budget plan one year in advanced and once we’re approved by our directors, we put that plan into motion. Once in motion, we look at how our networks are performing for the year which is broken into 4 quarters. From there we keep an eye on whether we are overdelivering or underdelivering and update our directors on our ratings, pacing of our numbers and if we need to book more commercials or adjust our price to meet our goals. 
My job has excel files already created as a base template and we start the week by updating our files to the given week and then pull the data we need to update our templates. A lot consists of copying and pasting the new numbers, linking old excel files to our current week files to compare how we’re doing vs last week, and adjusting numbers to keep our data flat to specific numbers. Once that is complete we send that data over to our director, break down the numbers to explain the performance and then they go from there and ask us to make adjustments. This is called weeklies and I have it down to a T

The issue:
Pacing and budgeting is where I get confused since we are never consistent on where we are linking our data. In our past models we are linked in such ways it’s hard to create a copy without the data being flat out wrong. This causes scrambling and mass confusion on my end since my numbers don’t align with current projections and we are forced to follow a trail of links to see what isn’t aligned and re-adjust. At first I felt like I might’ve overstepped in my career and might need to take a step back but as I further into this career I feel like it’s more based on direction and how we are inconsistently set up with our files, whether it’s the formulas we use, the areas we are linked to, or the random data that takes up space in our excel for no reason. 

I should also mention my work group consist of 3 people including myself. (We lost a member due to frustrations and a lack of communication and decided to go elsewhere) I currently work with a director who’s been at his role for about a year now. He seems to be learning as well so I can somewhat understand the lack of direction but it’s heavily affecting how we perform. And I work with a senior analyst who is an excel wizard and knows what she’s doing. The downside? She cannot teach to save her life. If you come with a question, you’ll leave even more confused. 

What I’m seeking for advice wise:
 I’m a very career driven person and always want to move up hence the jump from sales and finance. I want to jump ship from this company to another and stay as a financial analyst but when I apply or look at job boards I feel very in-experienced on what they’re asking for. While I know job searching is about taking chances and rolling the dice, I want to avoid another place that isn’t consistent with how they do things and are willing to train or bring you up to speed on how things are done. 

Has anyone that’s been in the same position been able to find something that fit that criteria or would I have to take a big step back and go back to sales where it’s not as data driven or excel driven. More than happy to connect with those in the NYC area or analyst position that’s had a similar career path. 

Thanks and apologies on any typos or ramblings. I’m currently readjusting from jet lag from my recent Tokyo trip haha.

1gr1rv5,22M fresh graduate in marketing - data analytics or marketing trainee?,"Graduated with a degree in Marketing and a minor in Business Development. I'm torn. I really don't know my career progression if I'm being honest - I wanted to become an entrepreneur but just don't have the skills developed yet (or money). 

On one hand, I'm progressing up the interview stages for my data analytics offer - the company is multinational and the benefits are great, though WLB is just okay. They need Excel skills which I'm above-average at least. It's a marketing company so it isn't too far-off but definitely need to learn new skills. 

On the other hand, I have an offer for a trainee program specially catered for marketing.  The skills involved are things I'd say I'm naturally good at, but with more work experience. Catch is that it's mostly soft-skills, making it way more competitive. Since it's a training program, I'll be living off allowances while I stay at a relative's home. 

I can sense that I'd be happier in the second option, but the first option will lead to better pay and better progression down the line. Wdyt I should do and moving forward?

1gqzrt3,Is this normal?,"Hello all!

I joined a small consultancy firm a year ago, this company provides with fair working hours and fair salary. When I joined I was the first worker of the office in my town and I've been their only worker for 5 to 6 months. For some reason, I've been recently promoted and promoted again to manager and, believe it or not, here is where everything is getting bad for me.

I've always been really insecure, but I always try to do my best. There are people much better than me to have my role, but for some reason they got me, even when I told them not to do it because of this.

I'm not good at anything, I have a business degree and masters degree in AI (recently graduated), but I've always passed with 5/10... I've been honest about this with my boss. And I don't have confidence enough to organise people.

Recently (for the last month) I've been constantly told off by my boss for silly stuff and due to this, I'm even having issues with my sleep.

I would resign, but for me having a manager role is the maximum I can aspire to in my small town and having plans of building a family makes this decission much more difficult.

Any advice?

1gqzazl,Months of work to career level up but my soul is evaporating. Help 🥺,"I've been a recruiter for 7 years and come to truly hate the job. I'm an introvert and it's become hell. Since 2023, I've been working on a second degree and now a PMP certification with the goal of moving into project management. I was laid off from my last (remote) company and had to move industries to get a job in this tight market and tbh I needed onsite for mental health. For almost two years, I'm spending all my money and free time trying to level up. Ok, that's the grind, but my new job kills my soul. I don't like the job and recently found out it was labeled a 'grind' job. The company brags, and thus  pays me to brag, about their internal promotion but hire their friends instead. Well, they do promote the super attractive young guy from a rich local family, but my manager told me that I shouldn't expect to grow in the company because someone needs to take this 'grind' job. But I still have to tell candidates we encourage career growth because they do ... for a small part of the company whom are usually related to or bffs with another employee. I asked my managers manager and another manager about internal growth with my degree considered. I got nothing. So I'm grinding at work, grinding so home, watching people do a job I want worse than I could do (company hires dozens of technical project managers), knowing my potential is ignored because I was the sucker to take the crappy job. They even rejected my request for PMP class tuition reimbursement because they had spend my money on a recruiting conference I didn't need to go to. My manager even said 'are you qualified to get a PMP cert' when I asked for reimbursement. 

I keep crying about this. It's 10:53 pm and I'm crying in the hotel at a the recruiting conference I don't need to be at with my PMP study class on a big screen. No, I'm not depressed but tbh will get there with this situation. It's those tight moments when I wish I were studying or meeting an advisor but instead I have a micro manager, coworkers who say 'I'd never want your job,' and project managers who can't keep up their workload and let me pick up the work. It's giving me this 'this is your entire life and it's wasted because you're not special' energy that isn't helpful. I feel invisible. I'm frustrated I have to get a new job after I finish this PMP.

I plan to start applying to jobs after I get the PMP, ideally by the new year. I won't have the degree but, in this area a PMP is rather valuable and with my talent experience, I'm a great person to manage talent heavy government contracting work that is common in this area. This could be a pipe dream too and I'm destined to hate whatever job I have for a lifetime.

1gqz775,which tech career to approach,"Hello, I am a little troubled of how I should pursue my future careers. I am currently a junior in college studying Computer Engineering. For my 3 years here, since Computer Engineering is a really broad field, I am unsure which one I should really focus on.

To give a little bit of background, I am an international student studying in the states. My plan is to find a job here until my sponsorship expires (3 years after graduation) then go back to my home country and continue with my family business (my ultimate goal). Another option is to get into graduate school (maybe an online technical degree while working) immediately then go back to my home country to help with my family business. So, whichever path I take, I will definitely end up working as a lead in my parents' company.

My family business is based on import and export, not really related to technology, but I hope my knowledge from university can somehow be used to help in my family business. Now, Computer Engineering can go into many fields such as software development, AI/ML, cybersecurity, hardware, data analysis, etc. I am unsure which field to approach that would be most beneficial to my further develop my family business.

Right now, what I see myself is studying into software development or AI because AI is growing rapidly, and I believe it will be a really big thing in the future, which might be a huge use for the family business. I am also interested in Cybersecurity since I was a child but don't really have an opportunity to explore and make sure that I really like it. Plus, cybersecurity courses at my university are very hard, and I probably don't have the spaces to take them. Another field that I believe might be of use is in the data field. However, Computer Engineering is quite far from that path compared to the other technical degrees, and I have limited resources to approach it. As for hardware, I do not really enjoy it and don't think it would be beneficial to my goal.

I really appreciate any input on this! Thank you!",Upper-Ice8848,1,1.0,0,1731567713,2024-11-14 07:01:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqz775/which_tech_career_to_approach/,11,2024

1gqyu7q,"job requiring 64 hour work week and now cutting our hourly pay, should I find something else? ","
My current job is a work from home job dealing with insurance claims/medical coding. They currently gave us mandatory overtime everyday so 12 hours all weekdays plus mandatory 4 hours on the weekend. This already has upset people as they said to expect this until the end of the year.

 We currently earn 15 an hour but they just let us know that in a month, we will all be taken to ABC pay. Meaning that if we exceed production target we get paid 20% more, 40% more, and so on. But that our base hourly pay will be cut to 13 dollars. So if we hit our normal target we will only make 13 an hour. The problem is, the target is ridiculous and impossible for anyone to reach or exceed. Even people who have worked there for way longer are concerned about this. So it’s basically like barely anyone at all is going to be getting the abc bonus. 

This on top of the 64 hour work weeks is really a lot for me to handle. And it just seems kind of unfair and like an easy way to be able to get rid of people once the ABC pay starts. They keep saying the overtime is something we should be excited about and it’s like yeah, OT every now and then is a good opportunity to make some extra money but forcing us to spend our whole days going forward only working is crazy. It’s not optional. and I can’t get anything else in my life or home done. They also keep saying they need the work done so it doesn’t come back on them from the client but I think from the start the company has been so unorganized, it doesn’t seem right that it falls back on us employees to do this much and also get a cut to our pay and have to constantly stress about exceeding a production target.

1gqy4cy,DON’T GIVE UP! - Life story and AMA,"This is lengthy. I’ll put a brief TLDR at the end but I hope it encourages someone who is currently where I was 5 years ago. 

I’m 36, and like many of you, found it nearly impossible to figure out what I wanted to do in my life. In fact, I still don’t know. 

I grew up with successful parents. My dad came from nothing but worked hard to climb the ranks in the financial services industry and was able to provide a fine life for our family and for me during college while I worked some odd jobs. Basically. I’ve always appreciated the finer things in life, but never knew how to provide them for myself. Buckle up. 

I went to school for business admin in middle Tennessee and was a straight C student from grade school through college. I am an extremely smart person, but books aren’t for me. I research everything, but can count on 1 hand how many books I’ve read. 

I graduated on the 5 year plan and started selling cars in the internet department for a GM dealership in middle Tennessee… not for the faint hearted and anyone that finds success in the car business, kudos to you. Side note, college is great for foundational knowledge and specific academic careers. See more below, you do not need a degree where I work. 

I quickly got picked up by a financial services company at my dad’s advice at 23 and made my first 50k in the first 7 months. The following full year, I made 114,000 including profit sharing. Frankly I thought I was rich. Bought a reasonably priced sports car, got engaged to a girl I grew up with, and started looking for houses. 

We found one, contracted on it, and our relationship crumbled shortly after. 

We canceled the home purchase and my first adulthood dream was crushed at 26. 

Fast forward a year, we rekindled our romance (bad idea) and she called me in the middle of the day and said she needed to talk. This is when I learned I was going
To be a father. 

2 weeks later. I was fired from my financial services company for “misconduct” (my new manager and I didn’t get along). Nearly 4 years in the position but my manger just didn’t think it was a good fit, so I was gone. Here’s the big issue, when you carry financial licenses, there’s a public form called the U4 that your company gets to list a reason for your separation. This can essentially blackball form the industry… and it did. All told, I applied to the industry for 18 months, and the majority of every interview was about that separation. 

So. I’m in a shit relationship with a pregnant woman, I just lost my job and I’m panicking trying to fix it. The car was sold nearly immediately. I was terrified and no one would hire me. For 18 months I blew through my savings and my 401k, and was crashing at my girls place with a storage unit for all my shit and started valeting cars. And let me tell you. When your parents neighbors and your friends/acquaintances pull up and call you by name and you’re dripping sweat at 29-30 running cars for $5, that will make you think about life on the drive home. 

I felt like such a loser. 

Anyways. We finally broke up, and she essentially wanted to eliminate me from my daughter’s life… this meant war. The next 18 months of my life was consumed with attorneys I couldn’t afford, and watching every step, because she wanted me GONE. 

My parents helped me get an apartment and basically funded my life for another year which gets me to about 2017. 

During that time, I racked up 42k in legal debt, 27k of that was personal loans and credit cards. My credit plummeted from 801 to 620 essentially overnight. I developed a nasty romance with alcohol, video games and bad relationships and this is when my life truly spiraled. Leaving the planet truly seemed like the best option in the moment to the point that in my clear mind I removed all weapons from my home. Bankruptcy was also something I heavily considered. Friends, I cried myself to sleep nearly every night. Broke. Alone. Not seeing my baby girl and knowing she was growing up everyday without her dad, and that even if she were with me, I really couldn’t do much but keep a clean diaper on her and a full belly, thanks to my parents support. The valet money hardly paid rent in my 1br apartment. 

My house was gone. Relationship extra gone, restraining order and all, my parents were paying for me to survive, I didn’t think I could get a job, I was under the microscope of the court system to determine if I was a fit father, frankly at that moment I wasnt. 

…But I had to keep going. I think that year I filled out around 700 applications. Getting a job was my job…. Until I found sales gig at a small auto finance company based in Florida. It was essentially purchasing junk car loans from buy here pay here car lots. Rough job. 3 months later, I was jobless again, they closed my territory due to lack of production. Florida has a massive BHPh market, Tennessee not so much. I made about $6,000 in 3 months which was still a nice bump in pay, mind you, I was still valeting nights. 

My dad introduced me to a neighbor that was the President of a credit card processing company (referred to as an ISO) and I did that for about 18-24 months until my direct manager fired me. Frankly I was glad to be gone. There was no leadership and no opportunity, the product was trash, and I’m pretty sure my manager was deep into the HR red zone. They started me at 36k and told me after a year I should make 80. I never got a single commission check, so I was literally just surviving in a miserable role with an extremely shitty boss, still not making ends meet, and basically being harassed everyday. 

But now, im really sweating just thinking I must be the biggest loser, and now being in my 30’s, what the hell am I going to do with a kid, a mountain of debt and no income. 

I started applying everywhere again towards the midway point of COVID and landed a job in the finance side of logistics. I was in my second week of training with this finance company when my current company called me to offer me a role with a rather large bump in salary and OTE. 

I went from a base of $40k with an upside of 75-80k to a base of 60k with an OTE of 155k yr 1. 

Easily said yes. 

I started that role in May of 2021 at 33. The company has been fantastic. They truly embody the “family” dynamic and they reward hard work, and trust me. Everyone works hard. 

Here’s what I learned, I had to go through these experiences to “figure it out”.

I spent more time on my resume than I typically did, and really studied for the interviews. I got intimately familiar with the company and the product, I reached out to current employees to get info. I also positioned each of my successes in previous roles to what I learned I needed to do well to succeed in this role. I miserably flunked a project during the interview process, and on my own accord, I redid the task and sent it to the hiring manager acknowledging where I went wrong, humbly asking for a second chance to present it, and taking his feedback into account throughout my second attempt. He noted this as the primary reason for hiring me. 

I also went out on a limb when asked about things I’ve done in my personal life that show my competitiveness, sometimes people look down on gamers, but I am damn good competitive gamer, and the hiring manager loved it. I was actually too 200 in the world at that time. Also, there is a large fintech/credit card processing component to my current role, so my brief stint with the harassing manager at the crappy ISO also helped. That shitty manager giving me a chance and letting me learn that business led me to a job where I make as much in a month as I used to make in a year. More below. 

May 2021 - Dec 2021: 60k 
2022: 205k
2023: 265k
YTD 2024: 398k

I have $100k in the bank, $360k in the market. I have paid my debts, my credit jumped up to 820, I purchased a beautiful new home with 20% down, I purchased my (realistic) dream car, and poured a hefty amount of money into fixing up my starter home with the luxuries I dreamed of; and most importantly I have equal custody of my daughter and am able to provide for her in ways I never dreamed of 5 years ago. 

Every year I have been with my current company I have hit President’s club. I have won the performance trip the last 2 years. 

In 4 short years, my life has changed. But I want to paint this picture one more time for those of you who are struggling. 

In high school and college - fired from 3 jobs 
Adult life - fired from 3 jobs and quit 1 
Depression. Anxiety. Feeling of never being able to make it. Shame. 

I have worked for large companies, small companies and everything in between. If you asked me “what do you want to do”, my answer is “I don’t know”. But the relationships I have made here, the money I have made, and the resume I have built prove that if you DONT GIVE UP, you can be doing something you’re proud of, that allows you to start building the life you want to have. 


TLDR: 
I was broke for a long time and considered everything bad to end the pain, but I kept believing in myself and fighting for myself and now have a high paying job and pulled myself out of debt and bought a house and did a financial 180 at 32 years old. 

Best of luck, and AMA!

1gqy0xj,Am I asking for too much of a raise here?,"Seattle area, smallish (about 500 people) company, personal care product industry. 6 years of experience + M.S.

  
Just hit 2 years, last December I got a raise of 2.5%. Started at 110k. I'm a process scientist, was previously working under a senior process development engineer. On the day to day generally work with corporate R&D and support on site production as well. My boss quit in January and I have pretty much been working my department solo with the exception of a few lab techs who I don't directly manage. I was actually a process engineer in a previous role so I was able to fill in to help while they were filling her old position. Stuff like equipment design and some project management aspects that I would not be taking on as a process scientist. In May the position still hadn't been filled and sales were not great so they told me they were temporarily closing the position. By September the company had recovered a bit and we started hiring again but they never put her job back up. I asked what was going on and they pretty much said filling her position isn't a priority right now.

  
I pretty much asked if I could be promoted to her position as I've been performing in the role for pretty much a year. Was told I don't have the amount of experience they're looking for (fair, my boss was at 15+ years with a PhD and they seemed to be following that when they were looking to fill the role).

  
I don't know exactly how much she was making but I am guessing it was around 160-170k. I'm planning on asking for a compensation increase to 125k (raise of about 11%), and will probably seriously consider leaving if they don't go to at least 120k. 

  
Are my expectations realistic? I thought it was perfectly reasonable considering all of the additional responsibilities I've taken on and the fact that they've pretty much stopped trying to replace my old boss for the time being. My parents told me I'm insane for asking for more than a 5% increase, so now I'm a little anxious about it.",Anxious-Name9037,1,1.0,1,1731562939,2024-11-14 05:42:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqy0xj/am_i_asking_for_too_much_of_a_raise_here/,11,2024

1gqxgug,Salary advice ,"Hi, This is salary related question. Using easier numbers.

So, I have joined a company via a consultancy.
My CTC is 100 with consultancy, but I noticed my consultancy's contract with my vendor is 175 for 6 months

Thought I understand the additional amount covers pf and medicals etc, Today i have a meeting with my company to extend my contract and they want me to confirm how i like to extend my contract either go full time on role or continue with consultancy. 

The consultancy guy is ooo and US counter part did not respond yet. 

So my question : what should i opt for?

1) Ask for 150 and on role with company
2) Tell company that I'll continue with contract and figure out the hike later with them
3) Ask if I can be independent contractor for same pay ( this won't have any cuttings like pf and medical increasing my in hand )

1gqxeku,What can I do?,"Hello all, I am posting this on a blank account just so I do not associate all of my details to my other account.
First off, I just graduated High School this spring, and I have mixed feelings regarding College. I have around 3k saved up about now, but I have not worked very long due to overall struggles during education. I graduated with around a 3.5 GPA and never took the SATs. I have good enough credentials to get into some colleges but obviously not all of them, I never originally planned to go. I live around an hour outside of Atlanta and have grown up in a pretty difficult household. My family is not very wealthy but they are stable. My parents are splitting up for many reasons I don't plan to get into. My sister has a couple of mental disorders that have made it difficult for her growing up as well, which have in turn made the overall environment more stressful and difficult for us all. I don’t blame her, but I don’t necessarily want to live in this environment anymore.
That launches my question. I would absolutely love to move to a different state entirely and get the chance to be my own person for a while. I understand I am in no financial position to do so, and I am trying to properly prepare for such a path. I would love to move to a city, which I understand is a very cliche move. I have relatives in Chicago and have a great interest in moving there. I do not really enjoy my current location as much. I have light experience with electrical work and food service, and can work as an electrician at any moment as well. I was originally going to study Film or Architectural drafting, but am leaning towards film at the moment.
Realistically, what would be the best path for me to be able to move away? How long of a timeframe am I looking at? How much money would I need and how would I realistically find a job that would support me in this decision? Has anyone here done this before and been able to share any advice? I am in no position to afford out of state schooling and will not be taking out student loans for this.",Ok_Variation3292,2,0.75,4,1731560679,2024-11-14 05:04:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqxeku/what_can_i_do/,11,2024

Everything I’m “passionate” about I don’t have the money or talent to pursue- although I might have the talent if I was able to dedicate any time to anything other than the three jobs I’m working to not even feel comfortable. I don’t know- I’m just burnt out, nothing I do is ever enough at any of my jobs. Someone is always talking bad about me even though I honestly just mind my business and get my work done- i have self reflected a lot and can’t figure out why people are so mean.

1gqwytr,"Those that once accepted an offer with significant cut, how and how long did it take you to get back to your previous salary level?","I recently accepted an offer after 1+ year's unemployment. The market in my industry has been terrible, with multiple layoffs starting from last year. Out of fear of losing the offer, I asked for a salary that's lower than what my experience deserves and what I would've asked for if I were employed. I realized I could've asked for more when the HR came back with an offer that matched my asking salary within a few days. It's not a low figure compared to the average salary, but significantly lower than what I was making on my previous job. Needless to say, I immensely regret this. There's no clear path of promotion within the team, as they are building a new team, so I guess the only way I can catch up to a level closer to my previous salary would be to keep looking.

Those that have experienced this, I'd love to hear about how and how long it took you to climb back up to a similar level of salary.",ChunkyMonkey5168,3,0.800000011920929,7,1731559144,2024-11-14 04:39:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqwytr/those_that_once_accepted_an_offer_with/,11,2024
1gqwto2,I’ve gotten myself into a pickle and I don’t know what to do next,"I (21 F) applied and accepted a remote part time job (25-40 hours a week) under the guise I would be leaving my current full-time job, but now I’m getting cold feet. I feel like I’m moving too fast and I don’t know if I’m making the right decision or not. For context, I currently work at a private non-profit Catholic high school. I hate my job, even though the pay and benefits are amazing ($70K a year). However, the actual job I do is very easy, although under the direction of the new president he is trying to expand my responsibilities and involve me in more major things I wasn’t before, so idk what the future looks like there. I hate the people I work with, I think the students we serve are undeserving and with it being a religious organization there’s the added requirements of having to do things like attend Mass and just all the fake bs that comes with working in a religious organization where everyone thinks they are holier than thou. I joined a 4-person team at the end of May. My entire team has left due to the poor direction and leadership of our president. My boss left after the president and his wife starting talking about her behind her back, there’s no WFH for any reason (even though I spend all day staring at a screen with no human interaction) and the president is generally just an egotistical narcissist on a power trip. It’s a long commute for me (30-45 minutes each way, 30 miles round trip) and in an unsafe part of the city. On top of all this, I hate and despise the city I live in. I am completely miserable. I have spent many nights crying to my boyfriend as I sit in traffic for hours on end. I haven’t cleaned my apartment thoroughly since I started this job because I’m so exhausted at the end of the day I come home and flop, and I escape to where my partner lives every weekend because I can’t take spending even one extra minute in this hell hole I live in. My emotional, mental, and physical health are at an all time low.

The job I accepted that is part time and fully remote is based where my partner lives, on a small island in a small country town. I love it there so much. It’s a beautiful place, so calm and peaceful.  My partner and I have been discussing all these things for a while and we agreed if I got this job I would move there because I wanted out so bad. But now I look at the pay and I’m getting cold feet. I don’t know if I’m just making a rash decision. I’m all alone in this city, and I have a whole support system of his family over there who were so excited to find out I got this job and have supported me so much. It’s a massive pay cut I’d be taking, although my expenses would also go down by about $6,000 since I’d be leaving a big city and working from home. The new job pays $25 an hour, and they are wanting someone who can fundraise it into a full-time role, which would alleviate all my worries completely. It’s a very similar job position to what I am doing now, although there are some added things like grant-writing that I’ve never done before. I keep going back and forth between being so excited to getting out of here, to being like “what the hell am I doing?”. I know I’d be happier over there, have a better work arrangement. PTO and sick leave benefits would be similar as well. I guess I’m just dumping all this here to get advice. I want to stay at my current job until beginning of January to take advantage of 2 1/2 weeks of paid winter break I get off at the end of December and just work this part-time job and my current job both at the same time for a month. My partner doesn’t think that’s a good idea if one job finds out about the other and he worries about me burning out. He has committed to telling me he’ll make sure I’m taken care of financially however he needs to make up some of what I would technically be losing coming over. So, with all this being said, I don’t know what to do. I think I’m scared of leaving the security this job provides, even if it doesn’t make me happy. The other job has a much better mission id love to support as well, but it may be a little challenging with new things I haven’t done before, but it would be good career growth and push my abilities. So, I’d love to weight others perspectives and see if I’m making too many decisions too fast, or if I should make the jump. If it matters I don’t want to be in a director or managerial level in my career, I just want to be an individual contributor. I have no desire to climb the corporate latter, just find me a simple job where I can be happy.

I’m a full-time student, and since I have a really “slow” period ahead, I thought it would be a great time to get a job. I took a chance and applied for a position that usually requires a degree. They let me interview, and it went really well! The pay is high, the job seems fun, and it would definitely add value to my career. But I’m still debating a few things:

1.	The job is 24 hours a week, which means working 8 hours a day for 3 days a week. I’m worried I might get too tired, though it’s a desk job, so I don’t think it’ll be physically exhausting.

2.	The job requires a full week of training, which means I’d miss 3 days of school. I have an important test on one of those days, but I already mentioned this to them. I told them I’d check with my teacher about rescheduling, and they asked me to keep them updated.

3.	The location. I’d need to drive 30 minutes (or 45 with heavy traffic) or take public transport, which takes an hour plus a 15-minute walk from the station. I wouldn’t usually mind, but the area feels a bit unsettling—especially early or late, as it’s mostly empty and only a few sketchy people are around.

i’m also just really nervous because this would be my first ‘big girl’ job. it doesnt feel like a your usualy part time job next to school..

Plot twist: I just found out I’m 8 weeks pregnant, meaning, at the time I start my new role I will be 4 months pregnant. 

I really want this opportunity and don’t want to risk it being taken away from me because I am pregnant. 

The question: Given I already have a relationship with my future boss, is the right thing to do let them know of the pregnancy as soon as it’s appropriate (early December before my start date), despite having no legal leverage in the event they choose to rescind the offer prior to my employment start (which, at that point I would have legal leverage should they choose to terminate me because I am pregnant). Or, should I wait until after my employment commences, even if this might hurt my future boss’ sense of trust and I will be 4 months pregnant at that time?

1gquupg,How to respectfully navigate working fewer hours?,"My husband works an hourly job with basically unlimited hours. He could easily work fourteen, fifteen, sixteen hour days and there'd still be more work to do that same day. There are plenty of people who love this, but he's at a point in his life where his time is worth more than the potential earnings. Now, he understands that a job needs to get done and sometimes overtime is needed, but there is often no *need* to work these long days other than the overtime. There is no contractual requirement to work these long hours but it is deeply embedded in the job culture.

He was working with a company where the work/life balance was great, but the work itself wasn't engaging him whatsoever, so he found a new job. He recently started with a new company and he is finding that there is that same pressure to work until you drop, basically.

The colleague he was working with told him that he (colleague) planned to work a fourteen hour day today, but ""he could leave whenever,"" putting him in a kind of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation. Damned if he leaves after eight hours because he feels like a crummy coworker (even though, again, there's no *requirement* or *need* work those hours other than the paycheque). His colleague will be fine without him there. He also feels damned if he works it because, well, it's a long-ass day and he's not really about that anymore.

So I guess our question is: Is there a way to respectfully navigate setting that boundary of working fewer hours? He's totally happy working his eight hour day and overtime if something comes up that needs to be addressed immediately, but he is not about spending 75% of his day working and commuting. 

He's really interested in what this company does and learning with them so he'd like to stay but also set some boundaries early on, but understands that moving on may also just be the only option for him.

The thing is, I was only making $63K a year at my last job, which is not nearly enough to live comfortably in NYC. So, before I was let go, I was already thinking about a career change, I just wasn't sure what to pivot to.

Would anyone have any advice on what I should do next?

TLDR: I have a background in social science in my undergraduate studies and worked in nonprofit after school until I was let go.

Her manager just took a new position and my wife is one of 2 people that are essentially guaranteed to be chosen as the new manager. My wife’s skills, work ethic, and passion are miles ahead of the typical customer service rep. Unbiased opinion, she’s much too good for her current position and would truly be an asset on any other team in the company. 

There is also a position in the billing department opening up and they’ve pretty much already told my wife that it’s hers if she wants it. The manager position would pay better, but would be much more stressful. The billing position would be very chill with a small raise, but she thrives on having others lean on her. This post is not saying “please help her make this decision”, more so if anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer any words of wisdom.

1gqqg9m,"Good ""boring"" or unknown career options that one can make a living off of?","I'm 25 with practically no work experience other than a collective few months at retail/restaurants/service. I'm not very smart or physically capable (I have chronic back pain, so no trades). I have no education past highschool and I don't think I could get a degree if I tried because of my difficulty understanding college level math courses. I'm pretty awkward and unsocialized and therefore have pretty bad ""soft skills"".

For a while I wanted to get into tech, start at helpdesk and eventually get some kind of sysadmin role, but that it seems like everybody decided to do that and now it's a near impossibility to get a job unless you have stellar experience or got lucky with nepotism/connections.

I'm not looking to make a lot of money. I'm never going to have kids and I will never be able to afford a home. I would be ecstatic with a $30k-$40k/yr full-time job for the rest of my days. Given my background and inability to function in a lot of ""normal"" roles, are there any niche or unknown positions for someone like me? I mean that's undesirable to others for a variety of reasons. Stuff that's isolating, night shift, requires temporary paid travel or relocation (at sea for example), or requires some obscure certification? 

I've heard some people talk well about overnight security guard. I tried doing night audit at a hotel but I only lasted a month because the pressure and responsibility after a very short training period was too much. I've also seen people mention things like water treatment or dams. Jobs that a lot of people don't even really know exist, or are too undesirable that most people (with families, relationships, etc) wouldn't want to travel or deal with whatever the requirements are.

I'm not completely opposed to some kind of post-secondary education, I just really hate the idea of taking a gamble and going through a hellish 4 years based on hopes and a whim that my degree will actually be useful. I'm much more open to some kind of certification or training, especially if it's in a niche that doesn't have as much competition as something like IT.",Supplier0669,2,0.75,6,1731539448,2024-11-13 23:10:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqqg9m/good_boring_or_unknown_career_options_that_one/,11,2024

I’ve been exploring job opportunities with salaries in the $110K–$150K range and am grateful to have received interview requests for roles I have applied to, even for positions that require a bachelor’s degree. However, I’m finding it challenging to compete with other applicants due to my lack of a bachelor’s. On the other hand, I have nine years of experience in financial business operations, strategic planning, and human resources.

I’m based in Iowa, and with my current salary, I live comfortably. I don’t need a higher income to support my cost of living, but concerned my lack of a bachelor’s degree will extremely limit my ability to pursue roles with salaries over six figures in the future. On another note, I wanting to remain optimistic, understanding that a bachelors degree will open more doors, but how many will they realistically open if I’ve already gotten this far without one & that if I keep working hard as I have the past month, applying and interviewing that , perhaps I will land something closer to 6 figures. 

So what are your thoughts? Would it be wise to continue gaining experience as I have been doing, or would going back to school for a bachelor’s degree to improve my chances of earning above six figures?

If I am successful I will have to go back to uni for 18 months and then I'll start on £50K and go up to £100K after two years, and after that, the sky is the limit really, as it's an international firm. This is an amazing opportunity but it will mean living a hardcore corporate life and I'll be stuck in London for a few more years - I'm not super fond of the city or its politics. 

I've also got  an offer to teach English in Shanghai for roughly 36K a year... 

I'd be able to get the salary up if I work on my mandarin or try and switch into the something more administrative - I can code and I'm quite an efficient worker. Or I could do my PGCE and lean into teaching. The only catch is the work for the first year at least, will be Weds-Sunday and I'll be working evening and weekend day-times.... This is not ideal but I feel like this could be a real adventure and if I work hard I could create my own opportunities.

I am not super attached to any particular career path. I just want a respectable, challenging job that's well paid and allows me to travel or live abroad. I also want a nice comfortable apartment and to live in a nice city - not London... 

Should I wait for the interview and turn down the teaching offer or take the offer and move to Shanghai and then have to fly back for the law interview... Or just avoid the interview altogether?

Help me play this well so I don't make a crap choice!

I have done a lot in the 20 years Ive worked, but I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to start when looking for a career change.

I've always struggled to decide on a career. I've been trying hard to decide the last year. I currently do data analytics for the last 2 years and I decided to move into data science, but I programmed on the side and I don't really like it. It's the same as the past, I didn't enjoy coding much.

I made a list of potential careers and weighted them based of these factors: ability to work from home, work-life balance, pay, my interest, ability for me to develop skills for, and location.

The most important factors for me were working remotely, work life balance and how easily I can develop skills. (for example, I'm more technical so I can learn coding, but less able to be a good car salesman for example). The best fit jobs were still programming jobs, or being a self-employed tutor since I used to tutor. 

On the side, I want a side hustle that can provide income, but my current work I need a direction.

I didn't like tutoring that much, but I was good at it and explaining concepts. I also would like the freedom and flexibility but it doesn't pay well overall and can be hard to find students/a lot of work.

I've been coding and programming and I don't enjoy it much, but I can do it and finish the job. I wont need to worry about pay, health insurance or job security, etc.

[TL;DR: 27M, 6 YOE in embedded engineering. Trying to gauge if I’m on the right track in the field and wondering about US options for the future. Honest feedback appreciated.]

I’m 27M, living in India and grinding in embedded for six years now. Started out in defense/space tech for ~4 years, and honestly, the work and culture were rough. I was making around 2000 USD/year (180,000 INR), and my last paycheck in that company was about 700 USD (60,000 INR) per month. Not exactly living the dream, but I learned a lot about MCU board bring-ups. Downside? My health and sanity took a lot of hits.

After that, I made the jump to a European ECU OEM for the work-life balance. Got a 40% raise, and I didn’t hesitate to join because I was so burnt out from my first company that anything looked better. Worked there about 20 months, then moved to a US-based microcontroller company. I was doing firmware in both places, but now I’m in the tool validation/automation team. Now I’m making 25,000 USD + around 15,000 USD in RSUs.

Thing is, I look around, and my friends are thriving in their fields. Just trying to figure out if I’m on the right track here. What’s the market rate for someone with 6 YOE in embedded? And how realistic is a move to the US in this field?

Family and friends back home haven’t been super supportive; they don’t really get the work I put in. I’m at that point where I feel like maybe it’s time to leave and start fresh in the US.

I’m not afraid to start over or put in the work. Just want some honest feedback on where I stand.

I did college but I dropped, tried some trades, and now I will finish graphic design in Photoshop, so I haven't got a good track record so it seems.

I interested in two things in particular, probably due to my interest in tech, which are science and engineering, note that apart from social science I like natural science.

I'll say what I'm interested, you will say what should I expect from these career's, and then I will decide which to take, I also appreciate what requirements do these works need.

I'm interested in :

-Civil and chemical engineering.
-Economics.
-Biology.
-Linguistics
-History.
-Chemistry.

If you need to know what I am good at I could tell you, but just as an aside I could tell you

I am truthfully more of a artistic guy
I like maths
I am very creative.
I learn fast

Cons

I am not good at paying much attention

1gql576,Would you take this new job or the counter-offer,"I absolutely love my job. I work at a state university, for reference.

The university is in a budget crisis, and my job was not permanent - my end date is April 2024 with the ""possibility of renewal."" Before we were in this crisis, I was assured it would be renewed with no issue. But since the budget issue, my boss and everyone else seemed much less sure.

So I got scared and started applying. I got an offer making significantly more, and the benefits at the new place are a bit better as well.

Everyone I interviewed with from the director to their staff seem really sweet and laid back. They all seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs. I did accept the offer. 

When I put in my notice yesterday, my boss scrambled to put together a counter. It came out a bit less than the new place - all told, the new place would put about $275 extra in my pocket each month, plus 2 extra vacation days. Everything else (retirement, other benefits, both remote) are nearly equal.

The counter offer also included making my position permanent. Permanent positions in this system are nearly immune to layoffs, fwiw. There's also the opportunity to convert my 401k style plan to their pension fund at year 5 (the pension vests after year 5; I'm in year 2, fully vested in the 401k style plan).

It also included a change in responsibilities that would include work I've been really wanting to get into - which was another reason the new job seemed attractive.

I am slightly behind on retirement and hoping to buy a house next year. The extra money could help with that too some degree, but I just can't tell if it's worth it emotionally.

So here are my choices: 

Reiterate my resignation and take the new job. $275 more net/month + 2 extra vacation days. Comes with the stress of leaving a place I've really loved and talking a risk with new people and environment.

Rescind my acceptance of the new job (makes me physically ill to think about since I've already started some of the onboarding). $275/month net less, 2 less vacation days. Staying with a team I absolutely adore.

1gql0y9,Concerned about looking for new job ,"Hello gang,

Recently left my job of 10+ years to join a new company in a similar field - got a huge pay increase and better hours. On paper it seemed great and to some degree it is, although my passion for the job isn’t there and I’m in over my head(I additionally travel under 2 hours daily and work very long hours). I was also supposed to go out of state to train for two weeks, that never happened and I feel completely set back as well since training never happened. 

I also replaced a manager who was recently fired. So I don’t feel any job security within this job and I’ve definitely made some mistakes along the way. I’m not concerned about being terminated at this very moment as it’s a very busy season, although I want to prepare just in case and look for a new job prospects. 

To get to the point of making this - I want to set my status on linked in to - open to jobs or whatever. Only caveat is that I was recruited to this job on LE from someone outside of the company and I’m nervous if I changed my status, that recruiter could see that and report that change to my job. 

Am I tripping about this? Should I just ignore LinkedIn and use a different means? Any advice?

Right now, idk if I should go for being a veterinarian or a twitch streamer. I have always wanted to be a veterinarian. It’s in my heart to dedicate my life to saving animals. On the other hand, twitch streaming would probably give me a lot more freedom, it wouldn’t come with the stress that vet school comes with — and it’s just something to do for fun, and it may lead to steady income, but it’s kinda hit or miss. Also, I would be studying abroad for vet school which has its pros and cons.

1gqjtgx,Leaving for a competitor,"Hi All, would appreciate some advice or insight on how to potentially handle an upcoming departure from my current company(A). I’m in the late round of interviews for a direct competitor(B) for a very similar job(we do not have noncompete agreements) that I have now. HR for company (B) told me they are already drafting up the paperwork for an offer, I just need to meet with one more individual(more so just to ask questions about a cross-functional group).

At my current company(A), I used to have a coworker that left for a new job at competitor(B). She provided her two week notice and was transparent about where she was going. Company (A) escorted her out immediately- which is what I’m assuming would happen in my situation. My old coworker was not paid out for the two weeks. Assuming I’m getting the offer and accepting it- I’m trying to figure out the best way to depart from my current role without just getting walked out. 

Here’s my initial thought-If competitor(B) wants me to start, for example, on Monday December 9th- I should ‘give my two weeks’ to company(A) on Friday December 6th knowing I will likely be terminated on that same day. 

Are there any strategies others have used in the past while navigating similar situations?

1gqjsbw,Job prospects for second career in business administration? (And online degree to get there??),"I (40f) have a masters degree in a liberal arts field, but I have not made great career path choices and am deeply dissatisfied with where I am. Long story short, I am considering going back to school for business administration. I have three young kids and need to continue working to make money, so I’m considering an online degree. My question is two-fold:

1. Does anybody have experience in getting a degree in business administration (or something similar) as a second, later in life career? I have some great experiences on my resume, including federal government policy, regional economic development, and small business consulting. A lot of this work could be classified as program or project management. But I took a big break when I was having my kids and worked as a real estate agent for several years, which I can’t imagine adds any value to my resume. I’m scared that my good career experience is too far in the past (2007-2018) to matter. 

2. How do employers view online degrees? Is it a complete waste of time because it won’t be taken seriously? Having gone through an underwhelming and expensive masters program at a very reputable university, I’m not concerned that an online program will be less-than, more concerned that it just won’t be taken seriously.

1gqjfpe,Should I leave my job in the UK and start again? ,"Hi there. I'm in my late 20s from the UK in a job that pays 18k after taxes. It's pretty stressful with a high workload and I'm given responsibilities for things I'm still learning. However, I'm not allowed to make any mistakes, which often arise due to my lack of experience, and when this happens I feel physically sick and like I'm going to get fired. Due to this, and other reasons, I'm unlikely to get promoted in the foreseeable future and sometimes I get anxiety due to deadlines and can't sleep, although this is rare. The main thing I could benefit from is learning from a mentor, however this hasn't been possible so far. I've been working here for a year and a few months, and I studied an unrelated degree that I don't want to go into the field of. 

My partner is from North Africa and studying engineering in France. They're graduating next year and trying to get a job in France afterwards. We spoke about them coming to the UK to close the gap, but I can't afford rent where my job is (I live with my parents) and that will be very difficult to figure out by myself, plus I don't meet the salary requirements for them to come here on a spouse visa.

My partner's idea is that I move to France to be with them, study a french course at a university (they offered to pay for this), and then I can proceed to study or get an apprenticeship in something that I like and I'm good at (which I have yet to figure out) and begin a real career. This way, I can come with a student visa, and we can marry after 1-2 years. However, we both don't have a lot of money and I feel bad for him paying for my living expenses until I (if I) get an apprenticeship.

My main problems with this plan is that it lacks the specific steps I need to take, it's just an idea. Other things are that my partner doesn't have French residency, I will unemployed and relying on them which is hard on us both. French is so difficult to learn (it might take me years and I need B2 to study), and I'll be leaving my job and creating a gap on my CV (which stresses me out).

I live with my family currently and they're getting divorced so I'll have to figure a way to move out and live with mum and brother. I'm not as independent as I feel I should be because they've sheltered me/ refused to let me do certain things, but I don't want to go into it. I can't drive, can't afford to learn or buy a car at the moment, so I feel pretty stuck. I can get a bike though if needed and use one when I go to France. 

I'm looking for direction, because I want to make a real plan and improve my life. I want to find a fulfilling career I'm good at and I want to live with my partner. 

There are risks with going to France but I feel like I'm not getting anywhere in the UK. 

Please let me know your thoughts. I feel so lost.

1gqij3b,Considering career swap to HR from higher education,"Hi friends,

This is sorta a strange post, and I hope it is relevant enough for this sub. I’m just very confused at this time in my life and wanted some advice.

Currently I work in the higher education realm as a financial aid counselor for state university, making 36k. In a year I’ll finish a masters degree in higher education administration, but for years now I’ve felt like I would be happier in Human Resources. I’m considered to be positive, talkative, and very outgoing in my work spaces, and I love working with people (hence why I work with students). 

I guess my question is, where do I start if I want to eventually break into HR? Will my masters degree help me at all? Will I be able to land something with my unrelated experience? Would you say HR is a good field to get into right now? Should I get an MBA while I have free tuition? Sorry about the long post. Any tips or comments would be greatly appreciated :)

1gqi513,What would you do if you were me? 18F,"I’ll keep this short and simple. (Jk)

Basically I’m stuck in a strange place in life at the moment. I feel like I can either stay home and just work to save up money or throw myself into college. 

I was thinking of staying home for at least a year (which is still the original plan anyways cause I  can’t go to college right away) and to work. I have the advantage of sweet parents that actually never want me to move out, which of course I’m going to have to leave eventually. My mom wants me to really save up for a car. And i have been saving up with my waitress job & currently have 5k on me right now. But the problem is, I feel really guilty for staying home. Even though im working which makes me feel better, and I can’t move out anyways because I’m not made of money, I’m still stuck with this guilt and it’s eating me alive. Also, my mom isn’t allowing me to pay any bills (which who does) but this makes me feel even more bad. She really wants me to save my money for a car. Of course it would benefit her as well which is why she really wants me to have one. First, which I didn’t mention before, I have to get my license which I’m afraid to do because I’m afraid of failing the test even though I know how to drive. I have a long way to go. 

A month ago I thought I had it all figured out. I was gonna just stay home and work and then go to college maybe in the fall of 2025. Now I’m overthinking it. After a fight with my mom it made me realize how guilty I feel for staying home and how easy it is for her to manipulate me and make me feel bad for living under her roof. Even though when I go to college I’ll still be relying on my parents, I feel like not living with them and being in a dorm would make me feel less guilty. I don’t want to just to go college for personal reasons such as that. I made up my mind a month ago but now I’m rethinking stuff. I also wanna apply to my gf’s school which I’ve visited her before and her school seems super nice. They sorta have what I’d wanna do. Which is another problem because I have no idea what I wanna do with my life. I wouldn’t just be going to her college for her, even tho she’d be the main thing motivating me to.

Now I’m stuck. Because also, if I do buy a car, there’s no way I should even think of college. How would I maintain paying that off even if I worked a job. Then my grades would possibly flop. But if I go to college, it’s no car (which isn’t a huge deal) but if I end up not being happy because I only went to get out and get the experience, then what’s the point? There are so many personal reasons to why I do and don’t wanna go to school. I orginally didn’t wanna go to college right away because I felt like I didn’t get to enjoy my last two school years home. (Btw I moved to this town my junior year of hs). I wanted to see myself become a better version of myself here which I know may not exist if I leave for school. I know college has many opportunities but I don’t know what career I’m looking for yet. I was also in a failed long distance relationship and even tho the college I may apply for (my gf’s school) is 40 mins away, I still don’t like the idea of me and her being far because of my last relationship. But of course I dont wanna just go to college just to be with her because im scared a distance will tear us apart. 

Im also trying to find peace in my life here. I don’t mind my job and I love being home. My brain is kinda screwed because I was very very stressed and melancholy my senior year of high school and I’ve been smoking a lot lately. I feel like I should just stay home and fix myself. But what if I cant? I’m so afraid of leaving this all behind because what if I regret not getting my shit together while being home and I bring all this negativity with me to college. 

So what do yall think? If I stay here and buy a car I prob can’t go to college right away. Which means distance from my relationship, sometimes feeling guilty for staying home, but it also means I’ll have time to heal myself, maybe read more, work out, get my license, and save up. 

If I go to college, it means I’ll be happy to be with my partner a lot, who is my best friend  (speaking as if I even get accepted into her school), time away from my family maybe without guilt tho, I can explore my interests and meet new people… 

I know there’s a lot of psychological reasons to why Im overthinking this and to why I’m stuck in the middle. I just need someone to talk to.

1gqgi4w,How do I get a lay off?,"I worked as a groundskeeper maintaining softball fields during the summer months and I loved it. Lots to do, lots of overtime and hours, plus the pay was decent for what it was.

But now that the softball season is over. They started a new work contract for the ""off season"". Which is just storing everything away for the winter which was completed the first week and I was praised for it. Now there is nothing to do and I waste 10 hours a day wandering around looking for stuff. It would be like that for 5 days then I will have one day where I clean of one of the managers garages at home or something personal that makes me feel uncomfortable doing. (They are made aware of that)

What I don't get is that they lay everyone else off after the season is over. But they kept me on for reasons unknown to me. They ended the softball contract and started a new one with a wage decrease (without my consent, I already started a case with the labor board). So it doesn't even feel worth it working here nymore. Especially when your pay cheque doesn't even cover the minimum of everything. 

My goal was to go back to college and get some necessary courses I need in order to start an actual career in the trades. But without a layoff I cannot get the funding I need. And 95% of my income goes towards necessities. So I cannot save.

How can I convince management to givr me a lay off? I think they would find a way to fire me before they would do that unless I find a better way of asking.

I might just be being paranoid but it's like they don't want me to better myself. It feels like they are keeping me hired on purpose just to mess with my life haha ",EmployeeCommercial83,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1731514423,2024-11-13 16:13:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqgi4w/how_do_i_get_a_lay_off/,11,2024

1gqdot9,"2 months into a new role, most senior marketing role in the company & feeling mega imposter syndrome and stress. Cried today in front of my boss from the overwhelm!","I just started a new role 2 months ago and I feel so so in out of my depth! I’ve never been this senior before in my life and feel completely not ready for this kind of role. My onboarding was terrible, I have had no proper training or handover and have just been thrown straight into the deep end. 

The more I get to know the role, the more I begin to realise the person before me did EVERYTHING and set no boundaries, and was an absolute yes person. Things that I shouldn’t be doing are being expected of me by the wider team and I’m feeling like I have a fire hose to the face with the amount of things on my plate! Also the company has grown tremendously recently but they haven’t kept up with hiring for that growth, so just more and more keeps being added onto my plate. 

I’ve never felt this stressed in my life and have been coming home crying almost everyday. Today I finally reached breaking point and cried in my bosses office. I’m feeling so embarrassed!! But at least she knows how I really feel now. She was kind in her response but ultimately I need more people and more help to be able to make this work. Right now I’m really struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel! 

I’m not usually one to give up and can be pretty hard on myself, but I’m starting to think this isn’t healthy for me and is going to cause me a mental breakdown from the stress! 
I’m worried if I start looking for other jobs, how do I explain why this role hasn’t worked out? I don’t want to seem like I can’t handle it or am job hoppy? At what point do I call it and say enough is enough? I’m wanting to give it a go for at least 6 months but I’m really struggling and it’s taking its toll on me - making me loose my confidence and absolutely consuming me.

1gqcs8l,MarCom: Boss wants me to write two-liners with ChatGPT - how can I make him there’s more to it? Getting frustrated as a studied linguist.,"Hi there,
A year ago, I‘ve started working as Marketing Specialist at a company that sells a niche product in the consumer goods industry. We are a relatively small company, the smallest one I’ve been in to date, and I cover everything from PR & communication, writing blog posts, newsletters and SEO texts to media planning and event organization. I found this position to be very appealing initially, providing me with the possibility to do what I’m already experienced in - writing - while learning new things. I’ve studied languages and translation but changed direction during Covid.
Our CEO and his closest advisors (that sit in another country, one is responsible for marketing and digitalisation, while the other is head of digitalisation) are big fans of AI, notably ChatGPT. We are very much behind in digitalisation- we do not even have a chat program for instance, still communicating via email or stationary phone only - but what the three of them have in common is their admiration for ChatGPT. The fact that they sometimes use it to them is a sign that we are indeed a very modern company and employing new methods which as such is a good thing. Now, the sole use of AI they can think of atm is text creation. 

I already use AI to assist me in writing texts but the technology is not yet at a point that you can copy a text and use it without editing it, especially if it’s going to be printed or is a longer text. They are not aware of my creative process and I can only assume they do not think I use AI. So, our CEO regularly asks me to write two-liners „with the help of ChatGPT“. Texts that have been written by me with the help of AI get rewritten with ChatGPT entirely up to the point the key messages are not even in it anymore. While my every word gets corrected and rewritten, fully AI-generated texts are not even read fully before publication. This is frustrating to me, as I am a professional but I do not feel valued. What can I do to make them aware of how best to employ AI when writing text? How can I politely make them aware of the creative process and that of course AI is involved in my creative process but that it’s advisable to not trust it 100%? How can I make them trust in my expertise?",mas-del-food,2,1.0,0,1731504248,2024-11-13 13:24:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqcs8l/marcom_boss_wants_me_to_write_twoliners_with/,11,2024

1gqbitg,"Career break success story! (Depression, employment gap)","TL;DR: Depression lead to an abrupt exit from a promising career. I worked on myself over the course of multiple years and am now back in the game. Keep your head up, good things will come.

Hi, everyone. 

Throwaway account for obvious reasons but I feel compelled to tell my story in the hopes of inspiring / helping others who may be able to relate.

Let's rewind to the mid 2010s. I was a Senior in University and landed a fantastic internship in the financial services space in a major global metropolis (large US market). I felt like a million dollars, I loved riding the elevator up 40+ floors into my beautiful office space, wearing a suit on a daily basis, and working with an inspiring team. I thought I had it made and that a successful life was laid out in front of me.

I graduated university and was offered a fulltime role with the Company. Again, I thought I had it made.

In the office, I looked good and produced good work. I was promoted like clockwork and before I knew it I was making a comfortable 6 figure salary and was in my early 20s. 

Although I had a good job, it was the only thing I had going for me. I had a brutal routine, I abused drugs, and I was truly living in my own filth. My apartment was a mess and depression set in. I would go days on end without bathing, I would lay in bed and log on to my work at 9:00 on the nose every morning (which was late for this industry) and my mental health was deteriorating in real time. 

Things finally hit a breaking point and I submitted my 2 week notice abruptly. This took my team entirely off guard and I think it really put them in a tough spot. I felt bad about this but I felt like there was no other option. 

Once I put in my 2 weeks a heavy feeling of regret set in almost instantly. I had to move back in with my parents which was embarrassing and I thought my life was over. My depression continued and I didn't work for over an entire year. 

After this 15 months of no job I was now in my late 20s. I finally had the strength to put myself out there and I applied for a job at a local gym that was down the street from my parents house. **My coworkers were high school kids and I was making minimum wage. I worked this job for 2 years.**

So here I was, late 20s working minimum wage when I previously had such a strong career path. In terms of poker, I was dealt two aces and I folded the hand preflop. I was confident that I was cooked.

My resume was obviously a mess. I had half a handful of years of professional experience, a massive employment gap, and then a minimum wage job. I thought I had single handedly fucked own life up and it was all my fault.

**Then something clicked. I lost 50+ pounds and ended my relationship with drugs. I then said to myself ""screw it, let's give this a go"" and began applying for roles back in the financial services space.** My job search was 4-5 months of absolutely nothing. Rejection after rejection, no interviews or even phone screens. But I stayed focused on the goal of getting my career back on track. Even though I was confident in my skillset, the idea of moving out of my parents house still seemed like a pipe dream.

But, one morning I saw a job posting at a company where I had some connections. I applied for the job and let my connects know that I did so. 

  
I was eventually offered the role (!!!!!!). I cried. A lot. Happy tears.

I have now been in this role for about 6 months and I am completely reborn. I hardly drink anymore, and couldn't tell you the last time I smoked weed. I am a new man.

I am now back in my own place, back in the above noted large metropolis, and I am now a complete person. 

**My advice to people who are burnt out and perhaps have quit their careers due to metal health is to work on establishing a balanced life. By that I mean don't allow work to consume too much of your emotional bandwidth. Allow work to just be this little thing in your life that you take care of, and focus on activities and ambitions outside of the office. Be that what it may, for me it was working out and finding a girlfriend. My drive to establish a strong romantic relationship had me enroll in workshops, run clubs, book clubs, rock climbing gym, and etc. I took care of my job but packed my calendar with activities. This way, as you're in the office you're excited for everything else you have going on in your life. Without outside factors like this, I'd just go home, smoke dope, and eat pizza.**

So there is my story. From a promising career, a godzilla employment gap, depression, drug abuse, and now I'm back in the saddle and I feel amazing about my personal development.

  
Hope this story can help someone. Feel free to leave a comment.",New-Horror-7594,2,1.0,0,1731500103,2024-11-13 12:15:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gqbitg/career_break_success_story_depression_employment/,11,2024

1gqapya,How to quit a job I just started but also like.,"So I just started a job where they took a big gamble on me and agreed to train me with no prior experience in the field.

1gqaorj,Struggling to stay motivated to do overtime on 2-3 month notice,"Hi everyone! So I'm a recent grad coming to the end of an 18-month grad scheme. I got placed on an IT project where I have some pretty critical data-related tasks to do. The scheme in many ways hasn't been what was advertised but I still learned loads there. Unfortunately the organisation has a recruitment freeze right now so post-scheme prospects are low, but I worked my ass off to make the most of the scheme, upskill in the evenings and weekends and got a higher-level position at a really interesting job at another company in the same sector - it's much more my thing and I can't wait.

The problem I have is that no matter how hard I try, I cannot make myself like what I'm doing currently. It's a grad scheme in a sector I've always wanted to work in but while the other grads are involved with the heart of the sector itself and have rotational placements, I got given one long placement which is basically very repetitive back-end data work (and not analytical either - mostly excel lookups and entry). I'm also having to do quite a few evenings, saturdays and sundays.

Also, because the project is intense, I was also encouraged by the project to delay the grad scheme qualification (i.e. the one the org more generally - not my placement - sponsor us for) until next year, but now I've found a new job that starts before the 'delayed' time that's a bit more up in the air. I think I can still do it in the evenings after my new job starts.

I got offered the job at the new company in mid-late october. I was told by my line manager that I'd be able to move to the new job quickly, but then it became 'after project go live on november 25th', then 'december 6th' then 'best we can do is december 20th'. Technically my notice period is three months, so even the constant pushing back of the date is them being generous, as December 20th would have been about two months.

As it stands I'm starting at the new company on Jan 2nd (which was way later than they originally said they'd need) and my contract with my current company ends December 31st. By utilising lots of saved annual leave and christmas breaks, it means I have about a month left as of today. But ultimately, I'm in an intense, high-stakes job I really don't like, doing repetitive and stressful spreadsheet work day in and day out, and I'm leaving in less than a month. It's SO hard to find it in me to meet their expectations.

Do you guys have any insight? I'm neurodivergent and really bad at the 'business acumen' side and find it hard to read people's intentions, but also hate the idea of reading bad intentions when they're not there, so I need to be careful about being taken advantage of. Essentially, I'm lost and really want to do the right thing.

1gqabri,"Automotive engineering or automotive design degree?
","Hi,  
  
In a huge dilemma at the moment deciding on which degree to take, I currently have offers for both at Coventry for 2025. Everyone is telling me to go for the engineering due to the job prospects and how useful that degree is in comparison to the design one, however I am leaning more towards design as I have always been more creatively inclined (my Art A level was my highest grade).  
  
I definitely want to go into automotive design at some point (that is the goal), so my plan would be to do engineering as undergraduate and then go on to automotive design for masters perhaps, as it leaves me with plenty of other options if that fails. But then I am thinking should I just jump straight into automotive design now? When I think of engineering, I don't like to think of how suspension arms work and batteries. I would much rather focus on the design process, body panels, aerodynamics, and working on a portfolio.  
  
Academically I am okay at maths and sciences, definitely not a prodigy but I did decent at GCSE, I initially took Maths as one of my A levels but dropped out due to difficulty and swapped it with business. I also did Computer Science. I definitely think this knocks my confidence with the Automotive Engineering, although I would be doing a foundation year.  
  
Has anyone on here done any of the above degrees or been in my dilemma? How are you finding it and what did you decide to do? Should I go into something else completely? What would you do in my position?

1gqa7ll, Stuck in a Field I Never Chose: How Do I Learn to Love It?...,"I ended up in a place I had no idea about—I'm sure I'm not the first, and I certainly won't be the last to find myself here. I had my reasons for choosing this path, but here I am, two years into an engineering program in horticulture and plant protection, and I’m feeling stuck and tired.

I’m in my third year now, and I’ve realized I need to make a change. I want to do something, anything, to try and love this field I’ve found myself in. But it’s hard. I barely know the basics, let alone the more advanced stuff like the specialized equipment or techniques everyone else seems familiar with.

I used to excel in my studies, and I miss that feeling of passion and drive. I want to be productive, maybe even excellent in this field, but I’m lost and don’t know where to start.

1gq9ruf,Need a career advice it’s been a tough journey guys ,"
I left engineering and joined tourism to follow my love for travel, even though that meant facing a challenging path. During college, I spent more time on trips and with friends than in classes. After graduating, I found it hard to secure stable work in tourism, so I joined Easy My Trip in a BPO role. I left after a month due to frustration and then joined an online travel company, working unpaid but gaining experience by arranging and guiding trips. Yet, I still wasn’t satisfied with how tourism was being managed in India.

With the desire to learn more, I applied for an education loan to study for a Master’s in the UK, hoping it would help me create real change. However, the course was more theoretical than practical, and I couldn’t complete it. I traveled extensively in the UK and Europe, but I returned to India without enough savings to clear my loan.

Back home, I decided to start my own sustainable travel company, determined to bring fresh ideas to the tourism industry in India. Though financial challenges and self-doubt sometimes weigh on me, I feel proud for following my heart. My startup is my chance to make a real difference in tourism, but it also carries high stakes, as I still have my loan to repay, and my father is currently facing financial loss.

Any motivation or advice would mean a lot—I need reassurance that I’m on the right path.",Tramp22,1,1.0,0,1731493070,2024-11-13 10:17:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gq9ruf/need_a_career_advice_its_been_a_tough_journey_guys/,11,2024

1gq9480,I’ve spent my life working towards my dream career and I have failed ,"I (24M) have been working towards my career since I was 10/11 years old. Teachers, friends and even some family, said I’d never even get into university but I’ve achieved a masters degree, so surely I can achieve my dream career? Since graduating I’ve been applying for jobs for around a year now with no success and I have continued to keep learning and developing my knowledge. I tend to fail all job assessments and tests (especially AI ones) and mostly don’t hear back from applications. For the few interviews I get, I either get to the last stage or end up doing a test that I inevitably fail or I get to the final stages of the interview process and get rejected for no experience (obviously I’m a graduate) or they find someone better. 

Chasing my dreams is now killing me, I have no life or money, my mental health is in the bin. I’ve sacrificed my sport and fitness for this dream. My last two relationships have destroyed any confidence I ever had, alongside the constant job rejection.

I’ve been lucky that my parents support and believe in me. But I think I need to face reality and give up. My dream is to be a games programmer but the games industry has been having constant layoffs for longer than I’ve been job searching. So I have been searching for software engineering jobs too.

I'm looking for some advice here, maybe some of you have been in a similar situation. I'm 30M and I'm overall pretty happy with where I'm at working in a niche field. I do a great job and get plenty of praise from colleagues and managers. Honestly, zero complaints. This isn't a post where I'm incredibly unhappy in a job or anything like that, but I'm simply wondering what people would suggest to get to the next step.

Where I'm struggling is that I feel completely uneducated compared to my colleagues. Most of the people I work with have PhD's, or at minimum Master's degrees, while I have an A.S. I would like to eventually entertain the idea of working at headquarters overseas, but I'm unsure if that's even realistic with an A.S. The problem is education is quite expensive, and I'm not sure that I'll do better financially with a B.S. even with changing companies and staying in the US. Quitting my career to attend school full time is entirely off the table, and it seems nearly impossible to achieve any sort of engineering undergrad without being able to attend classes in person.

What would you do in my shoes? Should I perhaps forget about an engineering degree and do something remotely like business? My skillset and work history are all hands on trades and tech. Moving to Europe on a work visa seems nearly impossible without an advanced degree.

1gq5lt4,I got fired today ,"My boss fired me today. For context I have been working for a startup for a little over a year. 

I had 0 experience coming in to the job and made sure that she knew. She hired me on the spot anyway. 

On my first few days, she would teach me a lot of things. I ended up writing it down or typed it out. I once asked her to record but she didn’t want me to record anything. 

Obviously, i made a lot of mistakes as she would teach me xyz then later on take it back saying it’s too complicated. Then teach me something different. 

A lot of the times, my brain was just fried from understanding everything she was telling me. 

For the jobs as well, she’s quite disorganised. 
She would send me a job over email, teams, WhatsApp, phone call or even text.

So I end up getting confused half the time because it’s everywhere. She gets mad when I miss her messages. 

I told her it would be helpful to have a channel to put in all jobs to be done and jobs completed. So she agreed and started the channel on teams. 

There were a couple of times that I finished a job for her to review and I’ve put it on the channel. She missed the review and told me it was my fault for not reminding her.

When I started out, she used to scream at all the mistakes I made even if it’s small, obviously ended up getting discouraged and paranoid. Which in turn kinda fucked my work because I would constantly be paranoid. 

She would also tell me to own my work and so that’s what I did. There’s a job that was assigned to me and when she came to the office she screamed at me for doing that job since she said it wasn’t “urgent”. 

I believe it’s urgent in a way because if I don’t lodge it on time the client gets a late fee. Also the job takes 10-15 mins max so I genuinely don’t understand why she is screaming when she wants me to own it and I did. 

Anyway, I end up missing emails here and there (honestly it is my fault) but also I’ve been so overwhelmed.

1gq51x9,Should I switch departments or stay in my current role? ,"Hello. 

I received a job offer from another department within my company. I’ve been in my current position for two and a half years, and I'm starting to feel tired of it.

When I get to do work I enjoy, it’s rewarding, but there’s often a lot of unnecessary drama with coworkers. It also feels like a dead-end role, without much room for growth.

The new department offers more overtime and a possible pay increase of one dollar per hour. While access to overtime is appealing, the work seems more strenuous than the raise would justify. I had also considered going back to school (although that’s not set in stone), so I’m unsure if more mandatory overtime would be worth it.

I tend to feel a lot of apprehension around major decisions, which is why I could use some advice. My current role provides some enjoyment, but the ongoing drama makes me wish I could work somewhere else. I’m not particularly passionate about the new position; to me, it’s just another job.

The main appeal of switching departments is simply that it’s not my current role, which has become vague and frustrating. However, I’m concerned that if I take this new position without a real interest in it, I might struggle to adapt in the long run and end up feeling worse.

I feel conflicted about joining a new department just to escape my current one, especially since I’m not genuinely interested in the work there. It’s not that I couldn’t do the work—I just don’t feel any real connection to it. 0 passion 

In my current role, there are parts I enjoy and would love to focus on, but the position is so vague that I’m constantly pulled into other projects. I’ve spoken with my manager about it, but he can’t provide the static role I’m looking for—maybe in a year or so, he said, but no guarantees.

1gq4a4z,"Job in my specialty vs. higher paying, more flexible job that has nothing to do with my skillset","I just finished many hard years of training to become specialized in a certain field. Since then, I took a break and I've been enjoying being unemployed for a few months just making side cash. Problem is, the side cash has become very lucrative, fun, and has tons of freedom. I can build my own schedule and work or not work whenever I want. 

Well, I just got an offer/contract to sign for a position that is pretty much the perfect job for my original intended specialty. It pays less (about half per hour compared to the other job) and I'll be held to someone else's schedule full time. Also I currently bring my cat everywhere with me and I'm worried they won't let me keep her in my office with me. 

The one upside of the specialty job is that I could potentially work from home in the future if I ever needed it and still make reasonably good money. And if I didn't keep up my skills in this area, likely in the future employers would take a pause before hiring me from being ""rusty"". So if I wanted to keep that door open, I'd have to keep doing that to some capacity to stay relevant in the field. 

I need help, this is my first time out of school/training and I've never made such a big decision before. Thanks for your help. 

  
TLDR: 

Got an offer for a full time job in my highly specialized field. But my unrelated side hustle has been way more lucrative per hour and affords me a lot of freedom. Do I take the full time job to stay relevant in the field?

1gq2ss3,What to choose?,"I am currently employed, making 72k annually. It’s a remote position, flexible hours, but I am a W-2 contractor and benefits are crappy. No PTO but it’s easy to request days off. Health insurance is terrible for what I’m paying for it.

I recently applied for a job and I was offered 82k (final offer). It’s in-person (no possibility of hybrid/remote) with a 20 minute commute, strict 8-5, but benefits are more than decent (health insurance is great, PTO is offered). There is also a possibility of upward movement.

I want to accept this offer because the extra 10k will help with my finances (30k in debt), but I worry about my mental health. I’ve noticed that I do well in remote jobs and tend to spiral into a deep depression when I work an in-person role… 

I worry that if I do accept it, I’ll be letting go of a decent comfy remote job and currently-okay mental health.

1gq297f,Should I move?,"I'm really struggling with this option because I like my current company and the people are super nice, but I'm severely underpaid.

At my current role, I make okay money. Admittedly we are the absolute largest in the market, so we work on a lot of cool projects with smart people. I work in analytics and there is only one other person beside myself who is remotely technical (but he is in a different division, he occasionally mentors me)

A much smaller competitor is trying to poach me and they are offering me an eye-watering 260% increase on my current salary. Let me very clear 
1) I am very underpaid
2) they are paying a premium for my experience

The role I will go in is leading the Analytics division. My current company is HEAVILY dependent on me. I was on a medical leave and they postponed a lot of client meetings waiting for me to get back. I went on a negotiation spree with them and they told me how great of a company they are, and whatnot, and the salary increase while they didn't explicitly state it (I should get an email today) it would be more like 30% increase max. Which I would argue is actually slightly still below market price for my output within the division.


I am slightly doubting myself if I can lead it there or not. The amount of money I'll save after every month from my new role is equal to nearly 6 months at my current role (without increase).
This new company does have a history of hiring and firing if things don't work out fully. So during covid they fired like crazy, but my current company, it's near impossible to lose your job no matter how much of a slacker you are (something my coworker is taking absolute full advantage of)

While the money is absolutely amazing, I'm slightly doubting myself.

I could really use some advice as I’m feeling torn about a big career decision. I’m in Ontario, Canada, and right now, I’m working in the HVAC trade. My company is offering to train me further in HVAC, but this comes with a commitment to stay. Here’s the thing – I’m not particularly passionate about HVAC and don’t see myself enjoying it long-term. It’s stable and has good job security, but my heart just isn’t in it.

On the other side, I’ve studied software development (especially full-stack and front-end), and I have about 2 years of experience in front-end development. I genuinely love coding and building things, and software is where I really want to be. The challenge is, I don’t currently have a job in the field and worry about how long it could take to get one.

I’m stressed about this decision because I only have about a month to decide. Should I commit to HVAC and stay with the company, or leave and fully focus on finding a software job? Any advice, especially from those who’ve been in a similar situation or who work in either field, would be super helpful.

1gq0v5b,Navigating Power Struggles at Work ,"I am looking for some advice, 

I recently started my career as an engineer. I am the low man on the totem pole so to speak. My supervisor is largely absent, and he leaves his training duties up to a senior employee, who treats me as her direct report. The senior employee is over qualified for her position, and has the credentials to be department manager. I was warned by another employee when I started, that no one lasts in my position due to the controlling nature of the department. I also pretty quickly felt the department was not a good fit for me. 

Recently, the senior employee was passed up for a promotion, and holds resentment to our supervisor, and it is apparent in their conversations and work flow that they do not trust or like each other. She took me under her wing and told me she would take care of me and teach me everything she knew. She recommended me for a position within the agency, that would be in a city closer to my home, so I applied. I did not tell my supervisor I applied, as I did not want to cause further strife between them. 
 
I had to call out of work to attend the interview, but the senior employee views that as me being dishonest. While I agree that it was dishonest, I was worried I would be treated differently by my supervisor for taking the senior employees recommendation. 

How should I approach my supervisor about this? I do need to tell him, as they will likely call him about it, but I am not sure how to approach the conversation. The senior employee will likely tell him I applied before I get the chance to tell him. 

Have I just ruined my relationship at my current job, and ruined a chance at a better opportunity as well? ",EstablishmentOld1976,1,1.0,0,1731459922,2024-11-13 01:05:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gq0v5b/navigating_power_struggles_at_work/,11,2024

1gpy1dh,Realized after a week my new job is not for me. What do I do?,"

I quit my customer service job about a week ago to start a job for Morgan Stanley in another customer service role. The role requires you to be licensed by FINRA and the first four months are spent training and learning so you can obtain the licenses needed. Employment is contingent on passing the exams to receive the licenses. Upon getting into the role and material, I realized I’m not interested in the material and the training is too fast paced and rigorous for me. Per my post history, I’m concerned if I can even pass the first exam we are due to take in a month because the material is so rigorous. Because of this, I reached out to my old job to see if they would hire me back. I was only at the job for about 3 months and the role does have high turnover. But when I took the job, I had been looking for months and that’s all I could find at the time. I’m also applying for other roles as well since I really need employment and money to get back on track financially. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. If I don’t pass the first exam at my current job, it’s highly likely I’ll be fired or have my pay reduced while I continue to try to study for the exam again all within a month’s time. I really think the job is a mismatch for my skills and experience since I largely have a marketing background, but they liked that I had some financial services experience because I used to work for a financial services brand. It’s just been tough finding a marketing job, so that’s why I started to focus on customer service roles so I could get by.

I'm currently an associate for a department that is very administrative heavy and they often implement new polices/procedures that don't make my job any easier.

There would also be a lot of competition for the next senior associate position so my chances would be quite low considering there would be a few other candidates (at least 2-3 highly skilled people) who would be interested in being a senior. 

Another job as an Executive Coordinator is open at the moment at my company. It sounds a little more like me in terms of coordinating travel, events and activities. Only problem is, it's the exact same salary as I make now so in a way I'd be starting at the ""bottom"" again in terms of building up any seniority. However, like I said seniority in my role now doesn't really mean much unless they create another Senior Associate position. 

  
A new policy has also been rolled out where if I start a new position, I'd have to stay in it for at least 2 years before I can pursue other internal job opportunities. That's the main part I'm worried about. Right now -things are not bad. I enjoy the people I work with. The work itself is fine. My manager is good - not great but it could be worse. My other concern is come September 2025, I feel that there will be more jobs since they are asking all employees to come into the office more.  So do I wait until then to try and pursue something that is a higher salary?

  
As great as the company is, I'd also be open to leaving if something somewhere else came up. It's just that again - the company I work for is great so it would be difficult leaving unless it was as significant salary increase.

1gpu7sx,How to make a career switch from Acting?,"Career switch from ACTING💃

Hello!
I don’t know if this is really going to help…
But yeah…I’m into acting…and I kinda wanna switch my career….
First of all…the work hours/timings are crazy…daily makeup…hair styling…hair sprays…and all the chemicals…late night shoots…stressful scenes…
Have to stay away from home like days together!
And all the unwanted attention you get from people…
Like almost “objectifying” you…

I’ve done like 10 movies…but honestly really tired of this profession!
Don’t feel the zeal and passion like I used to earlier!

So considering other professions…
Don’t wanna have to study much…but any professional course…
I have like 1 Million followers on Instagram…
And have been doing influencer ad campaigns…so something in the similar domain…
Like -
• Digital Marketing
• Luxury Brand Management 
• Starting a business (something like clothes, or other stuff that sells on Insta)
• A cousin of mine is doing a United Nations based course which she claims will get her a good salary
• Something which involves more of personal soft skills…interacting…engaging with people!
• Be like a mediator or something for real estate brands
• Become a designer/stylist or a makeup artist!
• Interior designer
• Kids Crèche… salon franchise or something

Want something stable and reliable even if it just pays decently…

I get paid better with the acting gigs…but it’s just too stressful…and I feel like I can’t have my own personal life.

Am I cooked is the theme of this thread. I've been with the same company (public company) for 18 years. We recently had our first layoff round, where most tenured employees were let go (including my boss). I survived the layoff, however, I believe it is because they thought I could do my bosses job. I manage several critical/key functions at the company, and those responsibilities are now being transitioned off to other teams this quarter and my MBOs are around helping them with the transition. Do you think they kept me because they couldn't let these key roles go by the wayside, or would they have laid me off during the layoff round if they wanted to get rid of me? All of my 1:1's with my boss are mostly about personal stuff, and not about the work I'm doing or how they can help me stay on track with the initiatives I'm driving. It doesn't feel like I'm being managed at all. They also haven't updated my colleagues title since we started this new role. Am I cooked? Are they going to get rid of me when these key responsibilities are fully transitioned?",Responsible-Crow4303,1,1.0,0,1731436524,2024-11-12 18:35:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gprtb0/18_year_employee_recent_layoff_survived_but_am_i/,11,2024

So far it hasn't. Last week we had an in-person meeting for testing on a new system being implemented next year, my boss said it was okay I didn't attend in person (due to class which meant I'd be in and out and it would just look bad), as long as I was on the calls they had set up. I was on those calls when I wasn't in class.

However, upper management was ""concerned"" because I wasn't on the meetings, and complained to my boss, who called me to get clarification. He tends to be forgetful and wasn't sure what we'd agreed upon about my lack of not attending in person (no worries, I have an IM to backup my claim if it comes to that), and he was supposed to go back to upper management with this and let me know. He never did (again, forgetful). 

Fast forward to yesterday afternoon where I got sent a tracker spreadsheet where I need to track everything I do for the next two weeks. I immediately replied and asked if I needed to start looking for a job, my boss said no, that the spreadsheet is ""going to help in identifying resources who have time to learn new things with our work space"".

I find that \*really\* hard to believe, but I guess I can't force them to tell me the truth, can I? Job searching is going to be hard finding something I can do full-time to pay the bills while going back to school, but it doesn't sit right with me because I can't seem to get any clarity without going over his head, and I feel like upper management is already sour with me.

1gppqsi,I don’t know what I want to do and I’m 30,"Long story short. I am the type of person that wants to try everything. I have a undergrad in civil engineering, masters in education, and currently taking classes for a computer science masters. I worked many jobs in different fields such as construction management, EMT, public school teacher, military officer, and engineer.

I have been unhappy with my company because of various reasons and have been applying to other places for work.

I recently just got promoted to the next engineer level and on a new team that’s titled “software engineer”. Titles in this company can be misleading a lot of the time. The team that I am on now mostly deals with IT. We do have software engineers that writes codes, but it’s more like software test engineers and they sometimes write the tools to test codes from other departments. 

I do want to have the option of working as a software engineer open in the future, but not sure if staying at the current job just for the title would help much considering the climate.

My favorite job had always been being a teacher. However, the pay was just way too low and it was hard to cover bills at times. I also very much enjoy being a military reservist officer. I am in charge of 30+ people and $10+ mil worth of equipment. I think that I like the “people” aspect of a job rather than the actual doing.

1gpo5gi,I just graduated and I don’t like my job at all,"Pls help. I am freshly graduated (may 2024) and was one of the only people I know who got a job offer right out of college at a decent agency with pretty fine pay. Within 3 months I got a raise and they shifted my position from what I was originally hired onto do to a more specialized analytics role. This is obviously great experience, but I don’t like what I do. I hate sitting under fluorescent lights for 8 hours and staring at a screen. My coworkers are awesome and talking to them is the only fine part of my day. Additionally, I feel like I’m being micromanaged by my bosses. I am smart and really driven and they recognized that but unfortunately they just keep piling work onto me. I feel like I am absorbing all the random work that doesn’t fit in anyone’s job description just because I have proven that I’m a good worker. I want out, I don’t want to work 40 hours in an office. But I’m scared that if I leave without even a year of experience, I’ll never be able to provide for myself. But in reality, I don’t like this job so the experience doesn’t even matter that much. Please someone give me guidance. Is it just all like this and I’m being a baby? On top of all this, I would feel extremely guilty to have my parents pay thousands for college for me to work for 5 months and decide I don’t like it.

1gpnuhj,which pathway should I choose after my undergraduate ,"Hello, I am currently a third year undergraduate sociology student on a 2:1. My degree doesn't really have much job prospect as it seems and I'm currently very confused on what to do after University. I was initially thinking of doing a conversion course postgraduate on either nursing or a PCGE. I genuinely do like working with people so this is really decision I made on whim. However, I'm also interested in social research and statics but from what I've seen, its hard to find a good paying job in those sector. 

If you are either of those fields - social research, nursing or teaching or was in a similar position as me. Please give me advice on the pros and cons and career progression on those sector. 



 I am planning on taking a gap year to gain some experience in a sector I choose before applying.

1gpnu63,Recruiter wanting to change - non tech role ,"I am in the US, female and mid-career. I worked for a FAANG company as a Senior Techncial Recruiter sourcing Senior and Director level Software engineers. But was laid off and I know the market is terrible for recruiters and for Tech in general. I know engineers who can’t get a job. I don’t even like recruiting. It’s the first to always get laid off when times are even remotely tough. I want job stability. I thought about transitioning into some kind of HR role but I heard from others they are getting laid off or automated now too and that could there’s still competition in that field. But isn’t that true of all fields? Anyway. I have management background and managed for 7 years before I pivoted to Recruiting.  I don’t want straight Sales, nor anything that requires a new degree. Just something I can pivot into with my recruiting and management background. I’ll do a certification though. I thought about Customer Success Managers or Implementation manager or Onboarding Manager but I don’t know how the market is for that.   Also considered People Operations Manager. I would just do Recruiting manager and call it a day but there are hardly any roles for that right now and the competition is fierce. Maybe Payroll Manager bc I did payroll when I was a General Manager. I don’t know any ideas or pivots you as a recruiter or recruiters you know have made are welcomed!! Ideas. I like brainstorming 

I’m ok with not making the same amount I did. I don’t necessarily want to start entry level but I don’t mind taking a paycut.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at a crossroads with my career and I don’t want to leave IT I do not know what I would do with my life.  I love the tech.. I don’t love the positions. I know help desk for some is an important stepping stone. I know there are other fields of IT and yes you always have to deal with end users. I am a ray of sunshine when I interact with people and I can diffuse situations but I can’t bring myself to continue doing help desk/phone support. I am not sure if it’s just me or the positions. I burn out so quickly and each position that I do, the burn out is quicker. I try to do different things to try and make it easier like wake up early and go to the gym and try to have a social life but it doesn’t work. I still end up feeling quite anxious and at times, I may even shed a tear before I log in (So embarrassing dude 🙄 ) . I don’t feel such anxiety when I do other things in my life. I can even say when I was DoorDashing in New York, I was happier overall with barely any anxiety! Phone support, I just feel trapped for 8 hours a day. No matter how many times I may get up and do a break, I always have this trapped feeling.

I know I don’t have the skills for anything else so I am just feeling lost. I am trying to upskill so I can do something with the cloud and that’s cool so far but in the mean time, i do need to work and get some experience. It’s just that I NEED to work. 

Oh man guys, what do I do? What can I do? I feel so lost 😞 😵‍💫 😔 🤦🏾

I wanted to see if anyone here has dealt with **Validate System UK** or **AAHM Group Ltd**? I recently applied for a care worker position with AAHM Group Ltd, and everything seemed fine at first — I had an interview and even signed a conditional contract.

Then I was asked to pay for credential validation through Validate System Limited. After making the payment, the process took much longer than promised, and their communication was frustratingly vague. What’s worse, when I followed up with my previous employer and academic institution, they confirmed they had not been contacted for verification, despite Validate System claiming they had.

Eventually, I received a validation certificate, but the QR code doesn’t work, and AAHM Group Ltd later informed me that due to ""timing and manpower constraints,"" they had to move forward with other applicants. It feels like I got scammed.

I've found some concerning online reviews and reports on both companies, raising the question of whether this is an organized fraud scheme. I feel ashamed that I fell for this, but I wanted to share my story to prevent anyone else from going through the same thing.

P.S. A few of my friends who applied at the same time also had the exact same experience, which makes me even more suspicious.

1gph3xv,Which major to choose to land a role as a data analyst ,"I’m a 26-year-old currently working toward my associate’s degree and planning to transfer to a four-year university soon. I’m hoping to become a data analyst after graduation, but I’m trying to decide between two majors, and I need some advice.

One option is a Data Science major, which is heavily focused on math, statistics, and programming. The other is Information Systems and Business Analytics, which has a mix of business-focused data analysis, SQL, and programming, with less emphasis on math.

Math isn’t my strong suit – I’m okay at it, but it’s not something I’d say I excel at. I’m pretty good with coding and computer science, and I actually enjoy it. I’m also a big fan of working in Excel, so I like the idea of using it as a data analyst.

My main goal is to land a data analyst job after graduation. I want a degree that will give me the best chance of finding a job in the field without overloading on a bunch of advanced math if possible but if that’s not possible than that’s ok. 

Would a data science degree give me a significant advantage in the job market, or could I still be competitive with a business analytics degree? Any advice or experiences would be hugely appreciated.

I wish I lived on a farm and grew everything with no money or no cars and I was just living in a community where we live off the land. Modern society makes me feel like it’s taking my life from me and it is not how I want to be spending my days.

But sadly I am in modern society and I’m saving to have my own place- which will take an eternity. 

My previous job I was a sound engineer and that was an abundance of running around.  ",Ok-Difficulty6697,0,0.25,1,1731399788,2024-11-12 08:23:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gpg431/lazy_modern_day_life/,11,2024
1gpf9yz,Disabled woman wants help with unique well paid jobs ,"Hi everyone! I am a 43 yr old woman who has been on disability for the past 8 yrs and I am struggling with not earning a living. Currently my income is about 36K / yr, and I have been so conscious of the extra stress on my partner to be the main bread winner, while I am unable to stand, sit up at a desk long term or walk without incapacitating pain. 

So my question is this... I want to find a career that is sustainable, and easy going, maybe even self employed, work from home type stuff. If I'm not able to bring in at least double my current take, I'm afraid that what my body will suffer for it. Isn't worth any less than that. I should also throw out there that I'm deaf, so all jobs where phone calls are required Mcgregor will make it more difficult to work with. I live in the parties in Canada and unfortunately jobs where ROV training is virtually useless, so there's a bit of challenging stuff going on. 

I thank anyone who read this and I'm hopeful some ideas get thrown into the hat here. Much appreciated.

1gpdunk,Seeking Advice: Should I Focus on Skill Improvement for 3-4 Months Before Applying for Jobs?,"Hi, I recently completed a six-month internship as a software developer and finished my B.Tech. During my internship, I worked hard on my project for two months, often staying up until 2 AM after coming back from the office. The work culture in the company became so toxic that I wanted to quit halfway through. They never reviewed my code, and if the client found any issues, I was blamed, which was really frustrating. Despite the challenges, I managed to complete my internship and received a job offer with a 3 LPA salary. However, the company has a 6-month probation period, and if I want to leave, I need to serve a 2-month notice period.

After much thought, I decided not to continue with the offer because the experience left me mentally exhausted and demotivated. It's been a month now since I rejected the offer, and I've been looking for a new job. I'm also considering doing another internship, but I’m thinking it might be better to spend the next 3-4 months focusing on improving my skills and then applying to better companies to increase my chances of getting hired.

1gpd38t,Think I’m possibly getting sacked; need advice,"In my check folder I received a letter dated for today that outlined five complaints against me that have been brought to the attention of management. I am not sure if this is something that has been an ongoing case of complaints they’ve been compiling to sack me, or a recent thing leading to an investigation. I have been asked to respond to each allegation and turn this in by Friday. 

In the letter it has been noted that I have been talked to about these things before. It is true of some things, but not all. Should I mention the things I feel I have not been talked to about? There are some things I feel are not true, but some undoubtably are. When I made the mistakes that were listed (and these are fairly recent,) I realized instantly that I had messed up. Would elaborating on realizing I made a poor judgment call the moment I had made  such errors and explaining how I have not made these mistakes going forward and what my prevention plan is to avoid these things from happening in the future be wise practice? 

I will be sat down and talked to with the director (no date provided) and I’m absolutely nervous. I’ve been fired from multiple jobs and have had ongoing issues with performance or difficulty getting along with/offending coworkers in the past and I realize this is on me. If I get fired I don’t know what to do from here as I am so tired of running into this issue and having difficulty keeping a job.

1gpcsil,How to decide on my career? ,"I have graduated in B. Tech and I have landed an IT job in an MNC. The salary is decent and I am yet to join the company. However, I don't envision myself working in the company in the long term. When I was thinking about what to do in the future, there were few options I could think of. 
*1. I could work really hard and land a job in a product-based company. The job would definitely pay well, but all the layoffs and recession is making me wonder how stable my job would be. Also my parents really want me to do a government job. 
*2. When my parents insisted that I prepare for a government job, I looked up on what options I have. I don't want to do a job where I am just doing routine work everyday, and let's be honest, we all know how government jobs in India are. I came across ATC, and I was really attracted to the nature of the work. However, doing a government job would mean that there is a societal pressure and you can't leave the job at your own will without society shaming you. 
*3. I always dreamt of being a writer/author since childhood. Even though this dream never felt feasible, now that I am participating in contests and also receiving compliments for my writing. It feels feasible. However, regardless of what I am doing, I want to write books even if I wouldn't be able to monetize it because leaving everything for writing wouldn't be such a wise decision (what do you think?).

After that,  I checked their career page and saw I had applied to 3 different internships: Human Resources Intern, Corporate Admin Intern, and the Neurodivergent Internship Program (which includes roles like HR Operations Analyst, among others).



I didn’t think much of it until I got an email inviting me for a face-to-face interview for the HR Operations Analyst intern role. The job description they sent included a note at the bottom saying, “Company ABC is an equal employment opportunity employer. Qualified applicants are considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or other characteristics protected by law.”



Now I’m not sure if this interview is for the Neurodivergent Internship or the regular HR intern position. Does it even matter if I’m not neurodivergent since it is an equal opportunity employer?

I immediately got hired by another company as a customer service rep and was liked by everyone but I just kind of sucked at managing the phones and organizing files, everything. I tried my best but eventually I was unable to perform on a key project and I was let go - I resigned after a conversation with a manager. 

I went back to school and became an EMT. I worked my ass off, I did everything right but, I was just too slow reacting and clumsy to do obvious parts of the job. I also realized that I crumble under pressure.

I tried Painting and was so bad they all laughed and told me not to feel bad - obviously no call back. I tried pressure washing - fucked up someone’s paint. I tried Car Sales - couldn’t close a sale. 

I tried a bunch of food and bar type jobs and am literally too clumsy and easily overwhelmed that I once again just stopped getting shifts.

1gp7izb,How do i write this into a resume? ,"Hi, first off i have been looking for a new remote position for just over a year and a half and have had some health problems arise and I lost my previous job about 13 months ago. I want to find a job that utilizes the things that I love to do but I have no idea how to find these jobs nor what they could be called. So here is me, I apologize for the length. I have so many interests and transferable skills/experience that it's hard to summerize it all.

I've worked various rolls over 14 working years and have over 20 years of transferable skills for experience. I love to work with databases and would love to work with animals or in healthcare. I excel in roles that work with the public but am no longer looking to work with the public as it has become too toxic and detrimental to my mental and physical health. I've been the primary appointment setter for my family since I was a teenager and work with budgets often in my personal life. Spreadsheets and being a ""detective"" are 2 of my favorite things to do and get paid for would be a plus. I have a smattering of tech experience basically i only call technicians when they are necessary and the process goes past the ""turn it on and then off again"" or the first like 5 steps on a techs list of questions to ask. I have adhd which I use to my advantage when researching it doing ""detective"" work. I say it like this as that was how finding the cause of an issue was posed to me at my last employer and it stuck. I have a personal background with medical records/coding and billing procedures and finding the right codes for various situations, but lack the certifications needed to work in this field I also am exceptionally passionate about. 

My main interests outside work are video games, Sailor Moon, art, camping, music, and horses. 

I have always had a hard time figuring out what I ""wanted to be when I grew up"" that I really just worked and went with the flow for most of my early working years that while I have many years of total experience I've always started in an entry level position and just as I was ready to be promoted I'd be passed over or life would step in and I either left the role or got let go. So please help me so i can put together a better paper version of me and hopefully get a job that not only I enjoy but I can make what I feel I'm worth.

1gp7ib4,37yo underachiever,"I was a great student in school, undergrad, postgrad and then I got hit by depression and took a break for a few years. Post that break I have been desperately trying to get back on track but now I’m 37, married, with a child, settled in USA but am way behind all my career goals. All my peers are in very high positions and here I am interviewing rigorously for entry to mid level positions. My original aim was to get a PhD but I haven’t been successful in that so far so I ended up working in a lab in a topic of my choice. Now when I’m trying to make a transition to the pharma/biotech I’m struggling to land a job. Of course I feel like an underachiever.

1gp7g2c,How candid should I be about my experience at a place I'm leaving?,"I've had to leave a toxic workplace before and it was easy to give open and honest feedback in as much detail as requested because I knew everybody who left before me gave the same feedback so I felt safe. 

This time, I don't really know the people who left before me, and the people who are in the same boat are also new hires and much more junior than me. I don't know of any feedback already given or how it was received. I've already given my notice and will be leaving soon. My question is: how candid should I be with 

1. HR (they've already asked me what's wrong because I'm leaving in such a short period of time). I felt comfortable with this person and wanted to help them do their job so I did share a bit about the difficulties I've had and that I'm open to having more conversations if they want to (I know there's a retention issue here).

2. Candidates they're considering.
Multiple people have reached out to me to try to get their foot in the door. At this point, I've been transparent about the fact that I'm leaving and obviously they want to know why. My gut wants to help out these juniors and be transparent so that they can make an informed decision if they get the opportunity.

I'd like advice on how to share helpful information tactfully. I don't want to throw people under the bus or condemn anyone unfairly, but I want people who might consider joining this team to be warned.

I also don't want to shoot myself in the foot in some way I haven't forseen.

Relevant context:
There's nothing illegal or worthy of an official HR complaint happening (that I know of), just difficult personalities, some poor management/organization, and very inconsiderate behaviours.

1gp71lc,I feel like my younger coworkers are entitled.,"Okay so here’s the thing. I’m 27 years old and currently working at this office job and my work friends are ages 19-23 years old. They’re the best group of friends I ever had, considering I’ve been in this company for 2.5 years.

But in terms of work, I feel like they’re entitled. I don’t know if it’s an age thing but, they always whine whenever things don’t go their way. For example, they keep on doing “no call no show” multiple times yet complains about deductions on their salary, when we all know we’re paid hourly. 
Like you caused those deductions yourselves??? Okay I’m not the perfect employee and I myself sometimes do “no call no show” as well, yet I don’t whine to the world when I see deductions from my payroll. And when our supervisor calls out their attendance issues, our supervisor is now the bad guy on their story when she’s just doing her job.

They’ve been on the company for less than a year, they slack on their performances yet they act like the company owes them the world. For me, you can complain all you want as long as you’re an efficient employee and is providing good numbers. I don’t know where the entitlement is coming from and I’m just tired I have to hear about it every single day.

But nevertheless, outside of work, we’re all very good friends.",jem_jem_,0,0.33000001311302185,8,1731368945,2024-11-11 23:49:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gp71lc/i_feel_like_my_younger_coworkers_are_entitled/,11,2024

I recently found a new job the pay is $5 dollars more per hour than what I get now at my current job. But the real reason I am leaving is because my work place is so toxic and no one respects me there. I spend most days crying after work or depressed because I have to go in. I’m not sure if I can do this for 2 more weeks. I’m thinking in 2 days the next time I work I just quit on the spot after my shift because mentally I am done at this place. Where I am starting work they saw me more then where I currently am, they know I can do more then what my current job expects and see me for what I am. I start my new job in 4 days. So wondering if I should just quit or put in 2 weeks…… the place I work at now is a single owned store and family ran not sure if that makes a difference. I don’t plan on putting them down as a reference because even if I put in 2 weeks they wouldn’t say good things about me. I also have 2 checks to pick up from them after I quit so I would get them no matter what right? That’s what I’m more worried about….

1gp6uby,What to do with a Bachelor's in Computer Science if not code?,"After I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science I tried looking for entry level software development jobs and applied to a ton but ultimately only got a few interviews and none resulted in a job. After being jobless for a year after college I got an IT Helpdesk job and told myself I would work that in the meantime while I improved my skills and bulked up my portfolio. For the first year I was really doing that but after a devastating rejection I gave up on applying and just worked my IT jobs hoping to get a promotion or upskilled (1.5 years somewhere, 1.5 years somewhere else) but inflation/cost of living caught up with my stagnating wage so I had to move back in with my parents. Now I'm working a call center job that's more geared towards customer service but I still do troubleshooting and tech support for users (for a software ""FastTomes"" if you know you know) so I could pass it off as tech support on a resume if it came to it. However, there's not really a future at this job.

I'm so far divorced from my graduation date that I don't think any company would (or should) take a chance on me short of some savant work or contribution to a project. That's fine, I was never a good programmer. I would be satisfied working in the world of IT support but I don't really know what skills to hone or work towards.

1gp5as4,Help with pivoting into a different career with a psychology degree,"Hi, I'm currently going through a midlife crisis on what to do next with my life.

I am currently 26 years old, and graduated with a bachelors in general Psychology back in 2020. For the past 3 years I have been an ABA behavior therapist making 30/hr at an autism clinic. The problem I have is this is a dead end job in terms of progression and salary, unless I go to grad school and become a BCBA which I have no interest in becoming as I am currently burnout with ABA.

The pay is average but there is no longer room for progress anymore and hours are inconsistent if clients cancel their sessions, and is not enough if I want to afford a house and family someday. 

I don't really have passions in life. What gets me excited is finding ways to be more efficient and effective in the things that I do, do in life. Whether it’s playing basketball or video games, I like the part where I'm familiar with basketball and video games but then finding ways on how I can be better. I like to self-reflect and watch videos of other people playing and determine what makes them good at the game that I'm not doing and then implement it into my own play.

In my free time I would flip clothes for extra income. I liked the process of buying poly mailers (instead of using cardboard boxes) or using a thermal printer for the labels (instead of a ink printer and cutting it out and using tape)  to cut down the cost and be more efficient with my time and money. Essentially I like the part after the initial fast learning curve, where learning slows down and I have to find ways to learn to do better in something, ultimately to make the task easier. 

My previous experiences are relating to being a teacher assistant, tutor, advisor and counselor for a college-prep program for high school students, which though I somewhat enjoyed, it’s not something I financially enjoyed.  

I had no research internships while pursuing my degree and did not learn how to use R studio while in school. I was an average student with average grades. Because of my age, I know I will do better in my classes and be more proactive if I were to go back to school. 

I want to break into a different field but am unsure where to start with a psychology degree. I am open to going for a 2nd bachelor's degree or getting a masters in something else to help reset my career. 

I have looked into non-psych related fields such as ME/EE engineering, computer science, statistics, cybersecurity, nursing, finance and accounting

And somewhat psych related fields such as Industrial Organizational Psychology and UX Researcher/designer but have read people are struggling to find work in these areas 

Preferably my ideal job would be a stable field where I am able to make 100k after a few years of experience (3-5 years), and potential opportunities to work remotely down the line of my career (though not required). If possible also a field that has a cap of around 130-150k. 

Computer science would make sense but I’m aware that an entry level position extremely competitive atm

As of right now either ME or EE engineering makes the most sense to me but wanted to hear from other people's opinion, even though I would be 30-31 by the time I finish my degree. Are there other options I can go into that would be a better use of my time instead of pursuing a 4 year bachelors over again.

I want to know what are my options for any non-psych masters program that would take someone with a psych background and if not what bachelor degree would you guys recommend that are available that would provide a stable income.

I’m an Indian from Kerala, currently working and living in Bangalore. I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science from APJ Abdul Kalam Kerala Technological University in the 2020 batch. By late 2021, I got hired by a multinational company that focuses on servers, storage, and networking solutions.

I work as an L1 Technical Solutions Consultant (Storage Engineer) in a break-fix role for North American clients, primarily focused on SAN storage, NAS, tape libraries, switches, etc. My day-to-day involves customer communication, log analysis, creating action plans, and collaborating with L2 support. I’ve been here for three years now, and I’m consistently performing well – even write the executive summaries for my team.

Despite my performance, my compensation feels low. My salary is 6 lakh per annum plus a night shift allowance. I got married this year to my long-time girlfriend, and all my savings went towards the wedding and setting up our rented place. Right now, I don’t own anything except my bike, and I’ve got around 50k in my bank account and around 1.6 lakh in my EPF. I’m finding it really hard to save or feel financially secure.

Given my role and experience, am I underpaid? If so, what’s the typical salary range I should expect? I'm starting to feel stuck in this niche role, and I'd really appreciate any advice on my next steps or insights from anyone with similar experience.

1gp37wu,Do I decline taking more interview steps after a weird job interview?,"Hi all!

I interviewed at a company today that was a little bizarre and I'm not sure if I should just turn it down. The work itself is not bad (though its a little bit of a departure from what I normally do). On the one hand, perhaps a weird job that is a little flexible in terms of what I do is GOOD for someone like me (kind of in a career existential crisis where I'm not sure what I'm interested in anymore), it is definitely going down a different track that I'm not sure I want to do.

Aside from that, I weirdly couldn't get an answer from them in terms of compensation. They implied that the money is good (the owner of this company seems wildly eccentric though).

1gp2ftg,How do I negotiate for a higher starting pay?,"I (24F) have a logistics call tomorrow for a job I interviewed with last week (QC position at a spice company). The recruiter gave a strong indication that the company will most likely be offering me the job. The job listed their pay as $22-24 an hour. I previously made $27/hr at my old job (which I quit about 3 months ago now and am currently unemployed). I let this company know that I am looking for at least $25/hr. I really like this company, but I know they are a smaller company and are family owned. I don't know how to negotiate if they offer less than $25/hr. I feel with my current lifestyle (aka student loans and car payments) and where the job is located, I can't accept less than $25/hr. How do I negotiate? I am so worried about sounding greedy or having the offer rescinded (although I'm pretty sure that rarely happens). I also just feel like if I do negotiate then it puts me off on a bad foot with them (even though I know this is a normal process). The person who I am going to be talking to about this is also the Director of QA (she was the one who interviewed me), so it would be my boss's boss... in my head it seems easier to negotiate with an HR person who I will never have to see again rather than somebody who is directly above me...",LanguageCautious8023,0,0.5,1,1731357334,2024-11-11 20:35:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gp2ftg/how_do_i_negotiate_for_a_higher_starting_pay/,11,2024

1gp1rjh,Salary vs Growth Potential,"
I’m currently weighing two job offers, and I could use some advice. Here’s the situation:

Option 1: $90K salary with a project that aligns well with my long-term career goals. This role would give me significant opportunities to learn and grow, which is valuable since I’m in a mid-level position and want to develop my skills further

Option 2: $115K salary, but the project doesn’t seem as impactful and could even be considered “filler” experience. I’m worried it might not add much to my portfolio or skill set

A bit more context:
- All other conditions (benefits, work environment, etc.) are similar
- I’m planning to buy a house soon, so income is a factor
- I typically switch jobs every 3 years, so I’m not looking for a forever job

1gp1gra,Getting scared about changing career at mid 30s?,"As the title suggests, mid 30s male, been thinking about switching career and I’m getting worried if I’m making a mistake. 

TLDR: Construction drafter career of about 10 years. Planning to start Lab Technique course and start a new career.

Let me layout my situation first. 
Almost 6 months into a new country. Couldn’t find a job at first and tried Hospitality course hoping to find a job easily. But, in my head, that’s just a plan C that can come handy. 

Been working in construction as a drafter/3D modelling . I don’t mind my job, I like assembling  things. But, the software are usually changing and different companies can be using a different software. So I have to just not learn but get properly good at them. Feel like I’m running after something and never catching it. Been in this industry close to 10 years good. 

The drawing procedures and work flows can be different too. So I tend to have to learn new things either in the same company or getting another job. Plus, technical skills are also changing depending on whether I work for an architectural firm or sub contractor or just for the main builder. It feels like never ending. 

Plus, I don’t like going to construction sites. Either big or small. I don’t know what I need to do or what I have to do. I feel like a clueless kid sometimes. 

Now I’m very close to applying for a Laboratory Technique certificate course for a year. They just opened the applications today. I’ve been thinking about it for a while. The course has work placement option into the industry businesses. And some of the teachers still work in the industry. So they say the students can network for the opportunities. 

But, I’m scared if I’m making a big mistake. There’s a saying in my country. “Like a monkey who missed the branch and fell!” But maybe I can fall back into the drafting job. I’m not worried about my savings cos I can still work part time. The classes are 3.5 days a week. 

Please share if you have some experiences or insight into this new course or some knowledge, and about career switching. 

Thanks in advance. ",Brownboysea,1,1.0,0,1731355039,2024-11-11 19:57:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gp1gra/getting_scared_about_changing_career_at_mid_30s/,11,2024
1gp1chw,Advice: New Grad (22F) feeling discouraged by tech - Should I start fresh somewhere else?,"Hello! I’m seeking some career advice. 

I’m a 2024 Grad seeking full time roles in Product and UX Design. It’s pretty clear that this industry is over saturated. I worked towards this career for my 4 years of undergrad, and I’ve been searching for about 2.5 months now and it only fills me with immense anxiety and hopelessness. 

I love UX Design. I discovered it my freshman year and absolutely loved it. I’m a very people-centered creative person so this felt like the perfect career for me and I enjoy the entire design process. I know I haven’t been searching for long, but the job search ruins my spirits. Even if I switch into, let’s say, Product Management, I just feel like Tech will never feel stable (though someone please prove me wrong). Especially in comparison to healthcare. 

I keep thinking:
What if i never get a job? What if I experience layoffs my entire career? 

Should I keep searching for a little bit and then pursue another career? Will I have to accept failure?

I went to a very prestigious undergrad which makes me feel very unsuccessful in comparison to my peers. Even most of my close friends are pre-med, so they never have to worry about this job search as they are all planning their next 10 years very easily. My friends who are not pre-med already have post grad jobs or are working on getting further education. My corporate peers on LinkedIn work in prestigious companies and I just feel horrible. My peers who studied UX Design right next to me in college have full time roles. 

I know, I know. Comparison is the thief of joy, but whenever it feels like everyone around me and everyone who I went to school with is succeeding, I feel horrible about myself. 

I’m only a few months post grad, but I know these feelings will get worse as time goes on. 

I started looking into stable jobs that don’t require lots of further education like MRI Tech or Rad Tech. (Send other careers you can think of pls). 

I could see myself enjoying these, though it obviously wasn’t my first choice. I’m very smart and very motivated, so school wouldn’t be a problem, I think. I’m a people person and I strive for work-life balance. 

Oh, that’s another thing. I’m confident that my boyfriend and I will last until marriage and beyond. I don’t think it’s naive, we are very mature and strong. He’s going to med school next year, so a lot of our relationship will depend on where school and his career leads him. 

So when I think about going into MRI Tech or something, I know we will have an even MORE compatible relationship because we are both in healthcare. 

I said before, I’m a very creative person, so even though I created this life plan in my head where my job will have to be creative, I know that if I work in healthcare, I’ll be creative outside of my job (hobbies,etc). I had this vision for my life where I’ll work in a cool tech company and be able to live in awesome cities and travel and live this epic life, but now I’m not so sure. 

I can probably life in awesome cities and travel and live an epic life with a non-tech job right? And have my creative fulfilling hobbies on the side. 

I just don’t know what to do. I knew your 20s were full of questioning, but wow. I feel like I’m in the middle of writing out my life, but I have no idea what to do. 

I know we are little ants on a floating rock, but I still gotta figure out my damn life! 


So, if you’ve read this far, give me ANY advice you have. Give me advice on life, design, healthcare, relationships, etc. Tell me your life story or literally anything you want to tell me.

I am prepared for them to counter and not meet me where I need to be. Upon signing I would need to tell my current employer immediately and would be let go day of since it’s a competitor.

I want to email company 1 and negotiate my pay but how and when do I do this? I told them I would like time to review but don’t want to sit on my hands all week and not get back to them since I need to counter offer and see if they can agree.

STARTING CA WITH No Accounting Knowledge but full of Determination to transform my Life,"Fuck i have written hell lot of thing i dont think alot of people would actually read this i am sorry... Buts ITS BEEN 4 years i am working my ass off in traditional business and every day i hate myself attending it cuz i know have much more potential i want to explore. If i won't take this shot i will regret in my 30 i am alrdy late but i guess it's managable


Some brief about my background and myself: 
I have never secured above 70% percentage in my entire academic life but also never failed in my any exam scoring above 60% evrytime at a same time i never ever tooked coaching or studied sincerely. i use to study only before a month of exam i was kind of backbencher but not dumb i was smart but lazy . I was  jzt enjoying my life with no goals to be honest cuz my dad had a Good established Business which was kind of backup for me. I am Gujrati and its like our Family and society never has a mindset of doing Naukrii. They always embrace of being self employed. 

EVERYTHING WAS GOING NORMAL AND GOOD untill
COVID Happend in 2020 
And due to some Badluck and bad decision my Dad business suffered alot. One by one all our assets started Reducing and Dad got trapped in a Huge debt at a same time i was in my final Year of college doing BMS IN MARKETING..  I had 3 option in my 2 n year to  choose between Hr marketing and finance 
Because i I was bad at maths  and book keeping.. I eliminated finance at very first cuz it was not my cup of tea i used ro run from maths and accounting. I learned accounting thru youtube 20 days before my exam i didn't even knew how to draw the format and how many coloums i have to draw but still i managed to get 50""  marks in BK. But i was shit scared to be honest for failing the boards jzt because of Bk but i passed. Marketing was something i liked it so i opted it. 

So in between this covid. I never use to like my dads business to be honest it is boring but i was ok with it because at the end of the day it brings good money thts it. So during this covid as soon i get to know my dads position and people and relatives  and cousins gossiping about our family tht how My dad have now come to Road and a Huge debt out of nowhere.  Tht day gave a new perspective to mee and made me more responsible And i actually started worrying about my Life  cuz the only backup i eas relying on was no more there. 

My Dad told me to get some work and earn i was 20 year old at that time.. I didn't deny the fact because our condition was getting really bad and i wanted to contribute to my family. 
My dad has good connections and hige networks because he have camed to mumbai at age of 9 to earn. He asked me to work in one of my Uncle s shop which is in Mumbai. A SUPERMARKET SHOP. I WAS shattered tbh because i was Graduate and he wanted me to learn and work in Supermarket.. Like i was thinking i am fukin graduate and my dad is telling me to go learn how to sell sugar bread milk and daily houshold item like I was not rdy for it.. Infact i told my dad i have got interview and its a good pay (more then supermarket where he wanted me to join) but he refused me to get a corporate job because he don't like Naukris. He wanted me to learn supermekt so in future we could start one or maybe i can start one and get my self settled. I was speechless cuz my College friends were joining companies like infosys  wipro and etc etc. With a avg pay and 9 to 5 job. Where as i was selling Raashan and doing deliveries of Bread and bisleri to Peoples home.. I use to cry alot cuz i was better then my College friends yet i was working as a delivery boy or kirana wala. Anyway i gained my positivity and by looking my family condition i stayed in Mumbai for 8 months far from my family i use to visit home once a month.. I was hating my dad for making my life worse. Anyhow i aced the learning and soon i was doing better in my shop and i started enjoying after few months because my uncle was making More then 2  lakhs a day i am not counting the monthly customer here. But then my father called me back again to start our business again as marker started opening.. Again a new Change in my life carrer shifting from supermekt to Xerox printing and Stationery Shop. 
Like my dads  actual business in which he created fortune before Covid. But now things are not like it used to be before Covid.. THE EVOLUTION OF ONline market and giants have Eaten up Traditional business like kirana and stationery or u named it.. Every customer comes to shop and opens the fukin amazon and show us dkeho bhaiyaa Online me to itneme milta h. The margins have reduced.. After covid due to Wfh, offices are not buying stationery as it used to buy.. Due to cloud data and storages People have cutt storing Physical Files and Papers.. Also coachings use to xerox like crazy which have come to zero  now as student gets Pdf And Online coaching and pendrive classes. From last past 2 years i am working with my Dad with our old stationery and xerox shop.. But now i dont see the scope in it as it use to be there before Covid.. Covid has Hit us very Hard.. We are still on debt  and  the bond between my father and me have worsen fron last 4 years also  there is no joy in home left everyone seems so depressing like they have left on living i somehow had pulled my business up and settled my shop im this 2 years making almost 15k average sale per day but all days are not same  there are days when i only  5 to 7k too.  inshort 4lp month from retail and 3"" to 4 lakh from company supplies of bulk  which my dad handles. Inshort 8 LAKH   PER  month.. But tbh i dont like what i do.. Doing xerox all day and making photocopies and sitting for 14""  hours in shop. Doing a work which anyone could do even a boy come from village can do this fukin job.. I hate what i do but i had to because of family responsibilities but as of now as things are better then before my dad is supporting and asking me if u wanted to do something else.. Because me n my dad have very different way of working style we fight alot tho. But my current shop is totally dependent on me like people knows me More compare to my dad i have build a good goodwill but i fear if i left this to pursue my New chapter.. My dad won't be able to look after this because he don't know half of the work... Tho he tells me i will hire a guy inexchsnge of u.. TERE JAANE SE KUCH BAND NAHI HOJYGA which shatteredme again because i have build customers and my shop through out my heart. And i dont want it to get effected if i leave the business and prepare for CA.

1gozr3e,Reporting a co worker advice ,"A co worker (whom I used to get on with) was trying to spread a rumour about me within the workplace in order to get me in trouble.

She was making out that I had come down from one to department to where this person was working on my own accord and was following this individual around the building which this person stated that they felt scared and was effecting their anxiety.

What actually happened was that I was instructed by my supervisor to go to that particular building in the work van to drop off some pallets. I had to go to this department three times in that day to make the drops and pick up more pallets.

In no way did I approach the person in question nor even acknowledged them. I kept away from them and just focused on the job at hand. That's it.

A week later I got told by a fellow colleague what this person had done. Apparently they were texting other colleagues in the workplace this obvious lie trying to turn people against me.

Now, as I've stated earlier, me and this person used to get on, very well in fact. But, for some strange reason, this person started to give me the cold shoulder then stopped talking to me full stop. I noticed this and instead of engaging I stopped talking to them as I'm not the type who wants to beg people to talk to me. I don't know what it was that I did but I've been told it's because I didn't give them attention.

Fact is, people at my work place have worked with this individual before in previous jobs. I have heard that this person tells lies and is actually quite the narcissist. A pathological liar and covert narsissist to be precise. Other work colleagues had noticed the lies this individual has said and a lot of them have turned against this person by ignoring them.

It was only the help of two work colleagues who had to stop this person spreading the lie or lies about me so there wouldn't be any trouble.

Problem is, this person has never been held to account and it did have an effect on me. I didn't rise to it though. I kept cool and calm and acted in a professional manner by getting on with my job.

However, I feel that this individual does need to be reported in case they do it again to me as I feel they have a vendetta against me which I think is more than obvious. This person has also been rude to another work colleague of mine but they didn't report this individual. Not only that but I do know that this individual was also seen kissing one of the managers in the back rooms in the department where they currently work.

Now, I have 4 strong witnesses that will testify my innocence and not only that we have cctv in the buildings. I just want to know if it is worth reporting this particular individual.

1gozgqz,Seeking Career Advice - PMP/CAPM Conundrum,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm seeking suggestions for my career path and would love your input. Here's my background:

- 4 years of experience:
    - 2.5 years as Technical Editor (code testing, white box testing)
    - 1.5 years as Associate Project Manager

I'm eager to grow and considering certifications to boost my career. I'm interested in the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification, but my experience falls short of the 4,500 hours required.

Should I:

1. Wait and accumulate more experience to meet PMP requirements?
2. Pursue the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) certification as an intermediary step?

Pros/Cons of CAPM vs. waiting for PMP:

- CAPM: sooner certification, potential career benefits, but may not be as valuable as PMP
- Waiting for PMP: more prestigious certification, but delayed benefits and uncertainty

Questions:

- Has anyone taken the CAPM route and seen significant career benefits?
- Are there alternative certifications worth considering (e.g., Agile, Scrum Master)?
- Any advice on how to strategically accumulate experience for PMP eligibility?

Your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I'm open to exploring non-certification related career advice as well.

I have my BS in Health Studies. So broad lol. But I was able to work with eye doctors (technician title), I’ve been a scribe at a hospital and other doctors offices. 

The thing is, I’ve played soccer all my life so being in sports or exercise related things seem to be the best. I’ve played professional and this year I decided to hang up the boots. Now I feel like my life is starting all over again. I’ve been considering deeply either school PE teacher, massage therapist, personal trainer, (already a soccer coach but thought about expanding that too), S&C coach and lastly I have thought about getting a masters in anything related to exercise science or physiology or athletic training or teaching if I decide that. 

The thing I’m not too sure of… is getting a masters easier for all these possibilities listed or should I try one route at a time and build off that? I know being certified is super important. Will the masters balance these things out and I can do a little of each? I’m keen to becoming my own boss but also willing to work with any school, team, group etc whatever it is to build and grow.

I am wondering how I can translate my skills mentioned above for a career change back into writing. I was also wondering if it's worth looking for a remote job (as I am moving back to my moms and its a suburban a bit far from the city with the jobs) or if I should just try in-person jobs?

I guess I am just asking for some guidance in what to do. I know I should just apply to the writing jobs, but I want to make sure my resume is relevant as well.

1goynrb,In Need of Career Advice: Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"
I'm currently at a crossroads in my professional life and really could use some perspective. I've been with my current company for over 6 years. Prior to this, I left a job under tough circumstances (company got in serious legal trouble, moral bankruptcy, etc.), so it almost feels like déjà vu now.

When I joined my current company, it felt like a breath of fresh air. Morale was good, teamwork was strong, and we even had the flexibility to work remotely. Things started to take a turn when our department head announced his retirement and ""Bill"" was put in charge. Following this change, a domino effect of retirements within upper management ensued, which wasn't the best sign.

A once trusted member of the upper management shared hints of looming chaos under the new leadership before dramatically moving up his retirement. Just five months in with Bill at the helm and I'm witnessing the chaos firsthand. Competent and assertive colleagues have been fired, leaving a void filled by ""yes men."" Additionally, the remote work flexibility we once enjoyed has been revoked. To top it off, Bill has said demeaning personal comments about the employees personal lives and threatens to move the entire department to another country. For the most part, I have managed to limit my interactions with him. 

Now, I'm torn. Financially, the job is rewarding, and the benefits are solid. However, the shift in culture and management style under Bill is palpable and reminiscent of my previous job's toxic environment. I'm grappling with whether this is a temporary storm to weather or if these red flags are my cue to seek greener pastures.

I value stability but also recognize the importance of a positive work environment. I dont know about the current state of the job market and anyone knows that the process is exhausting. Has anyone faced a similar dilemma? How did you decide whether to stay and hope for the best or to leave in search of better opportunities? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and suggestions.

1goyawf,28M Regretting My Move to Tech Sales—How Can I Rebuild My Career in Data Analytics?,"Back in 2021, I landed a data analytics role through a grad scheme at a Big 4 firm. It was a great start, learning SQL, Power BI, Python, and gaining consulting skills. But over time, the repetitive tasks and limited pay progression made me consider other options, so I switched to tech sales, hoping for better earnings.

Unfortunately, sales wasn’t the right fit. My first company lacked proper training and direction, leading to layoffs. My second role also struggled with product-market fit and management issues, and I eventually decided to leave.

Now, I’m looking to rebuild my career in analytics. Has anyone here navigated a similar career switch or returned to analytics? Any tips on re-entering the field or insights on interviews would be amazing.

**Additionally....**

A friend of mine, who’s a founder, suggested that I consider *“enhancing”* my CV by adding experience I don’t have in this field, to improve my chances of landing an analytics role. The only challenge would be preparing well enough to handle any specific questions during the interview.

Has anyone else faced similar advice or have thoughts on the risks and benefits of this approach?

1goy472,Do I take the job or not?,"I am a manager at a large well known entertainment company doing advertising. I work remote in the suburbs of NYC (65-70 min train into Manhattan) as most of my coworkers live in LA and some in DC. I am not overly passionate about the brand or the work, however it is a great company to have on my resume and as a new homeowner the remote aspect is very helpful. I am getting married soon and we plan to have kids in the future, so working from home provides great flexibility now and in the future as well. My fiancée works from home 3 days a week and works in office (30 min drive) 2 days a week.

I have been interviewing for a lateral move at an extremely well known sports company and feel good about an offer. I am very passionate about sports and my knack for advertising sparked years ago in a sports marketing class in high school. It would be a dream job, however there are cons that come with it. My salary would increase by about $15K but I would have to commute into NYC 4 times a week. The door to door commute one way would be 1.5 hours. After commuting costs, my pay increase is really ~$8K. I enjoy working from home because I have time to do things I enjoy like working out, cooking, caring for the lawn and fixing things around the house. However, I am extremely outgoing and value in person time at work. 

I am very conflicted with this decision. I feel that I am not only deciding for the short term future, but also the (somewhat) long term future for myself and my family.

1govu0d,Is a bird in the hand *really* better than two in the bush?,"Good morning! I am currently moving from job A to job B and am finding myself with wet feet in the final few weeks. My main reason for leaving was that I was passed over for a promotion without even being considered for it and I felt as though there was no opportunity for growth. Other people with my job title have been here for twenty years and I was terrified of ending up like that. Job B promised that they would provide opportunities for me to learn new skills outside of the role and they detailed a pathway of career growth if I excel. The head doctor seems really committed to mentorship and helping her employees meet their career goals, but it is a grant funded position so if that doesn't come through in four years then I'll be without anything lined up. 

I think job A sensed that I was looking elsewhere and made a lot of hay about changes they'd take to make my role less stressful and more aligned with my goals, but it still fundamentally is not the work I want to be doing. I kept moving forward though because also that's just talk. After I put in my four weeks notice though the surgeon had a small heart to heart where he was like ""oh it's such a shame, we were planning on doing X Y and Z to give you more responsibilities and experience"" and now I'm wondering if I'm throwing away something good. Maybe I'm just feeling FOMO. 

I like the team and mission of job A, but I like the actual role and future prospects of job B more, but I'm conflicted now. Job B is a better commute, but they pay is the same.

1goupye,Cold calling GCs,"Cold calling GCs?

Hello! I posted this over in construction but also wanted to get some feedback here for anyone willing to lend a hand. I’m trying to break into the construction industry after being in hospitality and sales for a decade. I’m trying to get an entry level position. After send out over 100 CVs, I got a meeting with a guy who has a company doing window and door installs.

I went out to the job site to shadow and though in the short term I would be able to get skills and income, that it’s probably not the best move. It would be more of a tangential step imo. Without any sort of structure, advancement within the industry seems like a hard sell there.

I’m looking to work into a foreman position and work up to either superintendent, project manager or an estimator role in the future. I do have a bachelors in business but since I have no experience, my plan is to get my OSHA 10 and start as a general laborer or admin and work my way up. However, I’ve sent out over 100 CVs for entry level and haven’t heard anything back. My guess is my resume gets filtered out because there’s no experience that translates to construction. 

I’ve read a lot of stories about how people walk on to job sites looking for work but that looks/ sounds like a recipe for disaster. However, I was wondering if cold calling various GCs in my area and explaining my situation might give me a better chance to start at the ground level. 

Anyway, any feedback or insight would be greatly appreciated. ",Findoutwherehomeis,1,1.0,0,1731338701,2024-11-11 15:25:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1goupye/cold_calling_gcs/,11,2024
1gouj5w,Reporting a co worker ,"A co worker (whom I used to get on with) was trying to spread a rumour about me within the workplace in order to get me in trouble. 

She was making out that I had come down from one to department to where this person was working on my own accord and was following this individual around the building which this person stated that they felt scared and was effecting their anxiety. 

What actually happened was that I was instructed by my supervisor to go to that particular building in the work van to drop off some pallets. I had to go to this department three times in that day to make the drops and pick up more pallets. 

In no way did I approach the person in question nor even acknowledged them. I kept away from them and just focused on the job at hand. That's it. 

A week later I got told by a fellow colleague what this person had done. Apparently they were texting other colleagues in the workplace this obvious lie trying to turn people against me. 

Now, as I've stated earlier, me and this person used to get on, very well in fact. But, for some strange reason, this person started to give me the cold shoulder then stopped talking to me full stop. I noticed this and instead of engaging I stopped talking to them as I'm not the type who wants to beg people to talk to me. I don't know what it was that I did but I've been told it's because I didn't give them attention. 

Fact is, people at my work place have worked with this individual before in previous jobs. I have heard that this person tells lies and is actually quite the narcissist. A pathological liar and covert narsissist to be precise. Other work colleagues had noticed the lies this individual has said and a lot of them have turned against this person by ignoring them. 

It was only the help of two work colleagues who had to stop this person spreading the lie or lies about me so there wouldn't be any trouble. 

Problem is, this person has never been held to account and it did have an effect on me. I didn't rise to it though. I kept cool and calm and acted in a professional manner by getting on with my job. 

However, I feel that this individual does need to be reported in case they do it again to me as I feel they have a vendetta against me which I think is more than obvious. This person has also been rude to another work colleague of mine but they didn't report this individual. Not only that but I do know that this individual was also seen kissing one of the managers in the back rooms in the department where they currently work. 

Now, I have 4 strong witnesses that will testify my innocence and not only that we have cctv in the buildings. I just want to know if it is worth reporting this particular individual. Any advice would be grateful. ",SandwichRoutine1380,2,1.0,0,1731338230,2024-11-11 15:17:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gouj5w/reporting_a_co_worker/,11,2024

1goua9l,I took a job out of desperation and now I'm on the chopping block. What should I do?,"I've been in a rut.

I'm a 35F who has had 6 job changes in my career of 13 years. I also am an American living in Japan. Last year, I went to a job that actively pursued me all to get let go after two months.

I took this current job after a 6 months just to desperately take anything. However, while they said this job was marketing, and I confirmed before I came to my current company that it wasn't a sales job, I have been writing their sales pitches.

I have never done sales or sales pitches before AND they want me to do this within their framework. It's also a startup company. Every day is a living hell. I didn't want to be the sole person responsible for their business expansion (they've had about 2 years of only having one major client now and pressure is on every day to get new clients). There is a team overseas, but they expect me to be able to work on my own, but I could have really used a mentor here...

I was put on a PIP which the term of it ended but I haven't heard back my results. I think they will fire me in December, though. They don't like my work.

I have had a long career of job hopping, but I did stay at jobs with companies who had larger teams and were more established. These past two jobs have been startup-ish companies, a ton of responsiblity was put at my feet...and I've choked.

I have looked so hard to find something else a bit more in my lane, but have failed to find something else in the year of searching now. I got to the final round with 4 interviews this past month all to either get ghosted or passed over for another candidate. It's hard to find anyone who wants to talk to me because of my job hopping resume and finding any jobs that are not Senior positions which are related to my background...

I am so discouraged. I feel so hopeless. 

I feel like I definitely can't find anything now that it's the end of the year.

Who's even going to be hiring now in December?

If/When I get fired in December, what's my story now to tell employers for having a 6 month gap and being fired twice?

1gou0ny,28yo RN questioning schooling paths ,"Hi everyone, 

If there is a more appropriate subreddit then let me know and I will post this there, otherwise here I go. I have been a registered nurse for six years, in that time I have worked exclusively in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). I love my job, I love being able to care for kids that are critically ill along with their families, and I love collaborating with the doctors on appropriate next steps in patient care and other nurses in direct patient care. In the time that I have worked I have not become burnt out (unless it was from non-work-related stressors) but I have found myself wanting *more*. I just got off a shift with a critically ill kid, and these are the days that I think I could have a role with higher responsibility than my current one. Clinical conversations between nurses and doctors, I find my RN colleagues looking at me with the look of ""Why are you a nurse, you don't talk or think like us."" At the same time as I build rapport with different docs that come through and I speak with them more they become more open to my suggestions as I approach pathophys differently from them, but I understand the way that they see our patients in a way that other nurses don't. (This isn't to sound contemptuous, I *love* the ladies and gentlemen that I call colleagues, they provide some of the best patient care despite whatever circumstances they have going on at home. They are some of the strongest people, and they give me hope for humanity.) The doctors will have extensive clinical conversations with me that I don't witness them having with other RNs. The thought of next steps always come to me in these times. The days that have been the most satisfying have been the days that I can thoroughly communicate family stated goals for patients - whether it be advancement of care, withdrawal of care, limitations of care, etc etc - that the doctors hear me and adjust patient care in accordance with the family's stated goals; this leaves me feeling like I actually had a role in achieving patient goals, but ultimately *I* wasn't the one who made the decision (of course it's the family at the end of the day) it was the doctors who made that call. This leads me to having two contemplations that play on rotation in my head. 



One of those is advance my degree and become a certified nurse anesthetist (CRNA); I would directly play a role in achieving patient goals (usually to make it out of surgery comfortably, to have line placements and nerve blocks placed with minimal complications, etc) with a fair bit more autonomy, while still directly reporting to the anesthesiologist. This would provide a satisfactory work life balance, regularly acquiring the outcomes that bring me current job role satisfaction after rigorous schooling and a fair amount of debt. There is reliable job placement with CRNAs reliably working in either outpatient surgical settings or in hospital in the operating room. 

  
On the other hand, I consider the possibility of being a non-traditional applicant to medical school. Pursing medical school would allow me to be a physician who hears the language that family speaks and directly addressing patient care through that, and with my experience I would understand the way to communicate with nurses and hear the concerns that are being brought up by them. Work life balance as a physician would be more tenuous through residency, and even throughout fellowship. Job placements would also be reliant on satisfactory ""matching"" for residency programs, if I were to be a physician I would strongly prefer to work as an intensivist, surgeon, or anesthesiology, which are competitive placements to get, particularly coming in as a non-traditional student. Those are not all considerations that ignore the debt I would ultimately be saddled with by the end of the program.

  
Either way, I would be entering into a leadership role with a responsibility that is nothing to scoff at, while being able to do the things that bring me work satisfaction. I considered the possibility of nurse practitioner, but the way that I have seen the clinical practice affected by different schoolings has led me away from that decision, all of which I won't go into a sidebar about. 

  
About me: 28yo male, my cumulative GPA for all courses was 3.58 at a little state college, I have an AA, ASN, and a BSN. I am currently working towards a nursing certification to verify by a certifying body that I do indeed know what I am doing. My pre-med crossover courses were minimal, I would have to take chems, physics, and perhaps some maths (I've taken up to Calc I) to be able to appropriately test for the MCAT. I would have to take the GRE to apply for CRNA schooling, and maybe a couple undergrad chem courses just to boost my application strength. I am an active sort, searching for an eventual work life balance after known growing pains that allows me to directly affect patient outcomes through personal-collaborative decision making. So, what do you suggest is a better course of action? I don't know that either is objectively *wrong* but I just can't help but wonder if I haven't asked myself the *right* questions to determine which course I should take in life. 

  
P.S. I did just finish a night shift and I'm going back in tonight, so I may not get to replies as quickly as would be ideal, but I will get back to them! Thank you in advance!

I've found another remote job, which is ideal for me, that's part-time (up to 20 hours a week), and I'd really like to make sure I get it. Will they mind if I have this other job, since I can always refuse to work my existing job if work conflicts? 

Additionally, you apply via email and I'm nervous how to introduce myself. I'd love any advice on how to apply, what to mention, etc. since my existing job is unconventional and had me apply by filling out a form rather than applying with an email and CV.

1gor842,HR Career ,"I feel like I’m a bit of a dilemma. I did my MSc in HR 7 years ago whilst working as a HR Officer, worked my way to HR BP was with a company for 6 years. Then needed a change and am with my current role 4 months as a HR Manager in a different sector. 

I’m not enjoying my job, I felt like that for the last year in my previous role and thought perhaps the company / role had run its course and also wanted to move up. I’ve moved up since but am not enjoying it at all, nothing role related it’s a nice company with nice people (a bit much recruitment due to the company growing). I just feel I have to drag myself in every day and cannot wait until I can finish up. 

I don’t really know what to do. Do I look for another HR role or explore something different? What kind of skills are transferable if I do look for something else?

1goobpk,career advice,"Hi everyone!

I’m looking for some guidance on a potential career switch and would love to hear insights from people who might have been through something similar or have experience in the field.

# Background:

* I have a bachelor’s degree in biology and a strong foundation in scientific research and analytical skills.
* Recently, I’ve developed an interest in software engineering and am considering pursuing a master’s degree in the field.
* I don’t have a formal background in programming, though I’ve started learning some basics on my own.

# My Questions:

1. **Is a master’s in software engineering worth it for someone with my background?** Is it realistic to expect to find job opportunities as a software engineer or in a related tech field afterward?
2. **Would I be at a disadvantage in a master’s program compared to students with a computer science background?** Would I need to do additional prep work, like learning certain programming languages or completing specific coursework?
3. **Are there alternative paths to break into software engineering without a master’s degree?** For example, would a coding bootcamp, self-study, or a certificate program provide enough skills and credibility to land a job?
4. **Are there specific master’s programs that cater to career switchers, especially those who come from scientific backgrounds?**
5. **Long-term outlook:** For those who’ve made this switch, do you find it rewarding in terms of job satisfaction, growth opportunities, and salary?

Thank you in advance for any advice or insights! I’m really curious to know if others have taken a similar path and whether it’s worth the time and financial investment to get a master’s degree in software engineering.",justtube,1,1.0,0,1731317005,2024-11-11 09:23:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1goobpk/career_advice/,11,2024

Currently, my situation is lost, and I am not able to get a clear vision of how I should continue my life and how I should go on a track. For everyone to understand, I will quickly explain my life till now. My school went well; I was an average student. After school, I decided to continue junior engineering, which is known in India as Polytechnic Diploma diploma. For that, I left my hometown and went to a place that was a bit far from my hometown. But I didn't get the college I wanted because of my low grades. My parents never interfered in my decisions; they had always let me do what I wanted (I sometimes think that is the fault I lack). After six months of college, the pandemic started, and I was back in my home. All classes were going online; I neither attended classes nor studied the whole pandemic. I lost interest in what I was trying to be. At that time, with one of my friends, I started filmaking and started earning a small amount of money, and I was happy with it. As time passed, the pandemic was over and colleges were opened, but I didn't attend classes, which led me to have lower attendance, and I was not able to sit for the examination. After that, I lied to my parents that I just got backlogged in 1 subject, so I will not sit in exams. I will take online courses and try to get a job. I somehow convinced them. They agreed to it. I took online classes a few days were good, but then I again got some money through different part-time work and lost my interest in learning coding. After that, I got into a call center because relatives were starting to ask what I was doing or planning for. I started searching for any work and got a call center job. I didn't let anyone know that I worked in a call center; I told them it's some kind of office work. Now, I have left that work and have started again my coding journey. In March 2024, I started to develop my physique as I was obese. I lost 22 kg in 4 months. I started learning web development in July. Till now I have completed my HTML and CSS, all from free YouTube tutorials, playlists, etc. Started javascript just a few days ago. I used to have some break in between, like 4-5 days for some relaxation or some outing with family or friends. Now I have only an aim to just get a good job in the web development field or as any coder to make my parents proud. Now the thing is, why have I told you all this? This is because I wanted to tell you how my life is going and if I am on the right path or if you have any suggestions you want to give me. Please reply with some comments; I will be very happy.

1gon6c4,My employer asked me to use Timely to track my time on tasks,"Hey everyone,
I am a free lance, hourly based remote working employee that does anything from video editing, setting up web pages for her site, backoffice stuff and more.
Basically a handyman for a woman that does retreats and digital content.

When we started working 3 weeks ago we agreed to start on an hourly basis up to 80 hrs a month. I write my start and end time of working in a google sheet and send it to her every month


Yesterday we had a call and she asked me to download Toggl (time tracking app) and to time log each task. She explained that she would like to know how long does it take me to work on the various tasks as for example if it would take me 6 hrs to set up a landing page maybe she can hire a freelancer for that specific task that would take 3 hrs.

Sounds reasonable to me but I told her that I don't feel comfortable with time tracking apps, and I suggested to write down in my sheet what are the things that I worked on in my 5 hrs a day time.

Now I am not sure on how specific I should be with logging my tasks. I feel like its a slippery slope to be micro-managed, I spend a lot of my day thinking about tasks and coming up with creative content ideas that I want to create for her which is also done outside of ""working hours"".

1gomsb0,Is getting your degree in software development still worth it ?,"
Hi I am a 24F and i recently switched from careers. I was a graphic designer and switched to software development. I made this switch because the job market in graphic design is dying and it wasn’t the job for me. I switch to software development because I always liked computers and always took a interest in them. Also I thought the job market was good for development in the Netherlands.

I started to learn coding by myself 4 months ago and I really love it. Its annoying at times when I don’t understand the code but learning it is really fun and interesting to do. Especially learning how a computer works and reacts to things. So I really want a career in tech and mostly software development.

But recently I heard the job market in software development is not doing so good it’s not as bad as the market for graphic design but I still wanne be careful. Also what’s the reason that this happened ? I think it’s a AI but I am not sure.

I go to college in a couple of months to get my associates degree in software development. I graduate if everything goes good in 2 years.

Is it still worth it to go to college for it or should I look for something else in tech. That will guaranteed a job ?",SuccessTotal7116,1,0.6600000262260437,8,1731310088,2024-11-11 07:28:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gomsb0/is_getting_your_degree_in_software_development/,11,2024
1gom054,Should I choose a career in marketing or data analytics? ,"Hey I’m (26F) currently torn between which career field to go into. I’m currently attending my local community college studying to get my associate’s degree. After I get my degree, I plan to transfer to a 4 year university and either major in Marketing or Data Analytics. I’m torn about which field to go into.

On the one hand, I really like how creative marketing is. I think I would really love to come up with campaign ideas for brands and I think understanding what makes people engage with brand sounds really interesting. However I am incredibly shy and introverted and marketing seems like a very social field. I worry that marketing might require more interpersonal interaction and extroversion than I’m comfortable with.

On the other hand, I have a very analytical mind and I love the idea of working with data to make strategic decisions. I also feel like being a data analyst is a job more fit for being an introvert than a marketer so I might like it more since there’s less social interaction I’m guessing. I also heard data analytics pays more which is a plus. However I heard the job can get a bit boring or monotonous which I’m worried about. 

I’d love to hear from anyone in either field about their experiences—especially if you’re more on the introverted side.

1gokh8d,Losing my mind over this decision,"I graduated in architecture four years ago then quit it a year after to pursue a career in graphic design and illustration.

I was very happy with my decision and excited to be free from the shackles of employment and corporate life. I got clients as a freelancer and kept it up for two years.

1gokdy4,How to find career and passion?,"Dear Reader,

I am stuck. I am nearly 30 and not where I dreamed I would be. Growing up, I have always been outgoing and kind with a will to learn. While I have always been a natural leader, my skills have not been pursued. 

My mom always told me I was born to do great things. She always made the joke that I was born during an active lightning strike on a stormy evening. My personality matches, as I am a fiery, spunky woman who just wants to give love and show others their worth. I lost my mom this year. I always wanted to prove she was right. 

My greatest asset, I believe, is communicating/networking face to face. I've been told many times that I can ""talk to a doorknob"". I would love to use my skills and pursue a career in such environment. 

When I was a child, I would sell lemonade any time I needed money to do something. I grew up poor, but my mom would have given it to me anyways (depending). Being the stubborn, ambitious, curious girl, I wanted to see how much I could make. I wanted to be able to pay for all of my friends to go to the public pool in our small town. My mom was always impressed as to how much I would make. So I turned it into a game for myself. Each time I made more than the last by incorporating new ideas. 

I know I need to network, whether it is through a luxury bar, event, fundraiser, etc. 

I'm unsure how far this thread will reach, but is there anyone out there willing to connect with me? I would love to learn how you have achieved success. 

I want to be known, seen, and heard. I have provided that to all people in my life hoping one day the good karma will make its way to me.

So here's the situation. I \[33F\] got married very shortly after graduating college and spent most of my marriage being a stay-at-home mom to my stepdaughter. My ex-husband worked in fast food. When things settled enough that I was able to work outside the home, not many jobs were willing to hire me because of the gap in my resume from staying at home.

I am going to try and sum this up as good as I can. Feel free to ask me if you have any questions :)

I recently started a new job as a recruiter a month ago and I like it.

I was trained in by 2 people for 2 weeks, both people put their two weeks in so they are now gone. They were great and I learned a lot from them!

2 weeks ago, they had someone who has worked in the company for about 3 years now in a different position help out with recruiting, while they find a second person. 

I am super chill, and it takes a lot for me to be upset at work, but this girl is a control freak..

Basically she had worked this position before for a while and she thinks she knows best, since I’m new and they just hired someone else a week ago, this girl is giving **im always right, you’re wrong*** vibes.

Anyways, she keeps using my indeed to schedule interviews with candidates who have applied to my positions, and I struggle to say something… 

She literally doesn’t have any position to do so, she is supposed to train the new person in only, but oversteps boundaries and I don’t know what to do.

1gohzh2,Offered title too narrow ,"I have been a senior project manager for over 4 years, first for a large government agency and then with a startup consulting firm. I am in conversation with a big firm about a role where I would do all the same things I do now and more, including co-leading engagements with communities, doing alternatives analysis and financial planning. It started with informal conversations with the firm and they built a job description around me. 

They sent me the job description and I just saw that the title for that role is senior public affairs specialist. I don't think this reflects the broadness of the role and I'm afraid it might lead to me being pigeonholed. If I'm co-leading with someone with a PM title, it feels weird. And a community might feel handled if their lead is in public affairs.

I feel really stuck because I love everything else about the role. I am expecting a formal offer next week. How and when do I bring up the title being too narrow to get the best result? Should I approach it with asking whether they use working titles when interfacing with the community?

Hi, I need your advice!

I recently graduated with a BSBA in Marketing Management from PUP Manila, with Latin honors, and I'm also a Career Service Professional eligible (passed before graduation). Currently, I work as a part-time Administrative Assistant for a US-based company and as a project-based Marketing Assistant for a local cosmetics brand.

In my Marketing Assistant role, I was offered a full-time position, but the workload is very high. Right now, I manage affiliate marketing, and if I accept, I'd also handle public relations and lead two teams (PR & Affiliate). The pay is low, and management is SUCKS, so I’m not planning to accept the offer. However, I don’t want to leave without a replacement due to the income.

I’m interested in applying to IT companies, but the roles I’m eyeing are currently unavailable. My plan B is to use my credentials to work in the government, potentially at Landbank, but I’ve read some mixed reviews about it 

Recently, someone referred me to a BPO company for a ""Content Writer"" role, which is more focused on video annotation and AI training rather than traditional content writing. The offer is decent, but I’m concerned it might be a career suicide para sakin or baka pumanget ang background ko :(

Should I wait for openings next year, use my civil service credentials, or try this content writer position?",jeriezb,1,1.0,0,1731291136,2024-11-11 02:12:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gohfhv/send_help/,11,2024

1gogg7f,Need some guidance ,"Hey guys, So I had a situation happen to me last year while working at a larger hospital-based health network in the Northeast. I started working in a larger clinic as a staff PT beginning in 2018, then in 2021 a Clinic Director opened at a mid sized clinic, which I applied to and then was promoted to. Upon starting this position I learned the other applicant to this position was the staff PT I would now be managing, who had worked at this clinic for three years. During these first two years we had one of the highest rates of growth in the company, as well as the single highest productivity per FTE. 

Fast forward to Fall of last year, we had a new grad PT who struggled with the responsibilities of schedule management and in all honesty was extremely lazy. Through discussions with my manager we decided to proceed with putting her on a PIP. I had this discussion with her and then a week and a half later I received a call from HR. This new grad went to HR and said that I was treating her differently and blamed her poor performance because she was a woman, which was a flat out lie. Clearly trying to scapegoat her way out of the PIP. I was then contacted while traveling and on PTO, took the call and was immediately ambushed by HR and my manager. I was required to put in a statement that day, in which I briefly summarized what happened. Upon return to work the following Monday I was placed on corrective action, I was unable to cross out the false statements in this document. Following this I submitted another statement to HR, describing the struggles this PT was having and how I made every attempt to assist her prior to the discussion regarding a PIP. Two hours after this was submitted I received a call that they were immediately moving this employee to a different clinic. On top of this, the PTO I already had submitted due to a holiday would be rescinded as there was now no therapist coverage. 

Another piece of background, this struggling PT who had reported me to HR was working with the staff PT who I was hired over. About two weeks after she was moved to another clinic, these two PT's had a virtual ""mentoring"" meeting, in which I heard them discussing her going to HR. Later that week I received another call from my manager and HR, saying that this staff PT also went to HR, pulling out of context situations to make me come off as sexist. I was immediately placed on unpaid leave and then eventually terminated the following week. During this unpaid leave I asked multiple times to meet with HR to discuss the situation, these requests were never responded to. 

Following this I applied to another position at a different company and was then told that my previous employer had me listed as ""do not hire"". Oh and fun bonus here, the staff PT who went to HR was then given my director position. I landed on my feet and have another director job with a decent amount of freedom, just have a longer commute. A few months ago I sent a long letter to the head of HR for the entire hospital as well as the president of the PT side. HR then just gave me the runaround, however they did unknowingly confirm that my statement following being put on Corrective Action was never put in my file with HR.

So obviously this is a year out, I wanted to make sure I am locked into a good spot with my new company before I did anything substantial, but I am not sure where to go from here. Was going to send all of my statements that were given to HR to former managers of mine who I haven't spoken to since last year, so they have full transparency of the situation.

I could use some advice. I left a startup as a sales engineer(technical oriented) about a year ago after a raise request was rejected. Since then, I’ve been working at a new company and set a goal to move into a full-stack developer role(which could take in this company around half a year)

Now, my old company has unexpectedly offered me a full-stack position. It’s tempting, as it aligns with my career path, but I’m unsure how returning to a previous employer in a different role might look on my resume.
	1.	How would this change be viewed by future employers?
	2.	Anyone with experience returning to an old company—what were the pros and cons?
      3. Should I use this as a leverage to make the move in my current company?

Have you ever seen that viral post on the internet that goes like ""Ten years ago, I said 'One day' Yesterday, I said 'Day One'""? To me the dream is to say ""Day One"" at WHO or UNICEF. 

I do not want to pursue biochemistry or nutrition for my masters. It took me a lot of time to make this decision since I am brown and making this decision is kind of going against my parent's wishes. And so if I am going to go against their wishes, I want to show them that my decision has success in it. 

The reason why I don't want to pursue a career in biochemistry research does include my lack of interest in research culture and my really high interest in social advocacy. But one other reason is that my grades are not fantastic. Since I am not as interested in biochemistry stuff, it takes me 3x more effort to get things done in my courses, let alone enjoy it. My current CGPA is 2.75/4, and it may go up from here since I am really working hard. 

Can anyone advise me on what the roadmap of my career should look like? If not a roadmap, where should I make the right networks or get the right experiences to build my career in this field?

I've been working in this job for 2 months. I was excited for this opportunity as it's in a country that I've always wanted to live in. The problems I've been having since I got here have been a lot and I'm wondering if it would be better to cut my losses and just leave.

Here are the biggest issues:

\- No response from on-site accommodation manager before arriving (I was asking for rent prices + pictures). This is despite them telling my manager that they had answered my questions.

\- Dirty on-site accommodation that hadn't been touched since the last person lived there (this is despite the school having a cleaning company). Surfaces black with dirt, mattress covered with yellow and brown stains, broken bed, no bedding, cooking utensils so scratched that I don't feel safe cooking with them.

\- No blinds in bathroom. The windows aren't totally see-through but you can still see a fair amount. I've had to buy a cheap plastic cover and tape it to the wall.

\- No keys to exit/enter the site. I have an electronic card which I thought would be sufficient but I wasn't told that this card wouldn't work on weekends or vacations. I've nearly been trapped twice. I've asked for a key multiple times but have been ignored. Manager told me to ask if I can make a copy and request a refund but I feel like this shouldn't be my responsibility.

\- Misled about rent. Only found out last week that the rent is more expensive than I was originally told. The amount I'm paying for the quality of accommodation feels scandalous.

I'd love to be able to move somewhere else but this isn't possible with the area that the school is in.

1goewal,Need Advice on Handling a Difficult Coworker & Career Growth – Feeling Stuck and Unsupported,"Hi all,

I'm a 24F working at a large corporation that's recognized as a top employer. I genuinely love the company and the opportunities it offers – there are so many sectors to explore. Currently, I work as an EA to the SVP and business development team and also support our Executive President, legal team, and VP of General Counsel.

Here’s the issue: Recently, my boss (the SVP) mentioned that a coworker of mine doesn’t like me and doesn’t want to work with me. This coworker, who’s friends with the SVP, has been avoiding me since July, and I’m only finding out now that she has issues with me. Part of my job includes tasks like shipping presentation materials, organizing room blocks, and managing budget trackers, which she’s been purposefully bypassing.

I was stunned to hear this – I’ve never had any indication there was a problem! I believe in learning from my mistakes, and if I made one, I would’ve appreciated direct feedback instead of silence. According to my boss, her frustration stems from a mistake I made during a July presentation, but here’s the kicker: I was on PTO the week of July 4, visiting family, friends, and (big news!) getting engaged. Everyone on the team was aware of my PTO, so I’m unclear on how my absence could have led to this reaction.

I even tried reaching out to her two weeks ago via email, asking if she needed any help with organizing for the presentation, and she’s ignored me.

To make things more complicated, I've been applying for internal roles to transition into project management or a coordinator position – I’ve applied to 12 internal positions. Each time I apply, she’s notified, and I now feel that she’s blocking my growth by withholding support for my applications.

Honestly, I’m confused and frustrated. These women are about 15 years older than me, and the way they’re handling this feels so petty. It’s uncomfortable, and I’m not sure what my next move should be. Aside from applying to roles outside the company or considering HR, I feel stuck. Any advice on how to handle this professionally?

This month marks one year at this job and they just told me they would be increasing my pay to $21 an hour. I appreciate it for sure but I still think that this is too low for what I do and the lack benefits. I work as an Assistant/ coordinator for a team of 11. So I do a lot of work and am incredibly busy all the time. Since I have started the team has grown by 2 people so my workload has as well. I get no paid time off, no sick time, no benefits like insurance, 401/ retirement. Due to the type of company benefits like insurance are unable to be offered. I am thinking of countering with $25 an hour. I am okay not getting those benefits but I think because I get none of those things that my base pay needs to makeup for not having them. I realize that is a VERY large jump but I think when you take the benefits and no time off into account that it is justified. I would like $25 so I would like to start high with that but if they counted at $23 I think that would be reasonable as well.

1godtlp,Career change - Merchant Mariner or Pilot?,"As the title states, I'm looking into becoming either a pilot or a merchant mariner. I thought I'd write down my thoughts here in order to better organize them, but also hopefully hear from people who have worked in either field, or even both!

About me: I'm a 34 year old American teacher/gig worker, fed up with working in education and barely staying afloat. I'm drawn to both the maritime and aviation industries for their earning potentials and possibility of an earlier retirement, their unique working schedules, and my love of the seas and skies.

I've found two training programs of similar length and cost and now I am trying to weigh all the options of each. The main factors for me include return on investment, work-life balance, career stability and trajectory, and overall happiness.

**Option 1 - Maritime Academy:** 2.5-3 year grad school program majoring in shipping/logistics, along with a third mate's (3M) license from the coast guard. First year of classes can be taken online at own pace and then two years must be done on campus and at sea. Total cost \~ $90k USD. Expected salary after graduation: $100k+ usd, capping around $250k within several years. 

*Pros:* long blocks of time for traveling (ex: 3 months on, 3 months off) , projects, etc, can continue to work during first year while studying online, high demand for workers, *masters degree can be used elsewhere.* 

*Cons:* Long time away from home and future family, long hours at potentially tedious/boring job, risk of military involvement if war is declared, risk of Jones act being repealed in future (job security), no marijuana, military-esque cabins and lifestyle.

**Option 2** \- **Flight School:** \~1.5 years of training to get all certifications to become a certified flight instructor (CFI) or equivalent. Total cost\~$80k USD. Then working as a CFI for 2+ years to get your 1500 flight hours while earning roughly $25/hr. First job at regional airline might pay $90-$120k USD/year, capping around $2-300k a few to several years later.

*Pros:* shorter time periods away from home (better for relationships, family, etc), flexibility, great benefits and travel perks, job is arguably cooler, generally good job stability.

*Cons:* frequent traveling to and from work, long hours at potentially tedious/boring job, earlier retirement age, likely need to live near major airport. 



\*I would be taking loans out for nearly all of the costs of either program, so repayment time frame is something else I'd like to consider. 

I am currently single and have no kids, but would like to have a family at some point in the future. I would like to save as much as possible during my 40s and retire from either field by 50-55.

1godpj3,Negotiating salary after 90 days,"I was told during my initial interview with this company that the starting salary was 60k. My professional contact who referred me to the job and vouched for my abilities told me I had the potential to make between 70k-85k in this position as I was originally told it was commission based on top of
salary. 

Upon getting to the third interview, I was told they would hire me for the regular probationary period of 90 days at 55k. I was told at 90 days I would be bumped up to the starting salary of 60k. I accepted this because I really wanted the job, as it was kind of a ""foot in the door"" situation into the career field I want. I had enough relevant experience to know I will excel. 

It's been around 45 days and I am basically proficient at the job, minus a few areas like insurance verification where it is an ever changing thing. I am an extremely fast learner and quick to train, and have a lot of passion for this field. I had about a week of training and then was working by myself after that. 

 I have learned that the ""commission"" is a very rare occurrence so I will not be making as much as I had hoped on top of the salary. On top of that I have been assisting to train a coworker that started 2 weeks after me since we are alone much of the time together. This coworker is bilingual and has a degree so I was not surprised to learn she started off at a higher wage, however I feel as though I grasped the job and systems much faster than she is. I have performed duties outside of my job description happily and have been flexible with scheduling changes than what I initially agreed to. 

How shall I negotiate a higher salary? 5k increase after 90 days is good but I'm not satisfied since 60k was what they initially told me was the starting salary anyway. The downside to my professional experience is I do not have any degrees. Only 10-12 years of considerably relevant professional experience, 2-3 years of personal experience (I work in addiction recovery), a passion for the company, and I am relatively young (29) so there's plenty of room for personal and professional development. I see my value and I want them to also.

1god451,2 masters in same field useless?,"Hello everyone,

So I’m currently finishing my bachelors in business economics. I only need to pass 1 class to get my degree. This bachelors degree normally takes 3 years but I did it in 5 years, because I was mentally struggling and also covid happened. The next step is getting my masters (where I’m from you need it because the bachelor alone is useless and theoretical). The logical route is to do the masters in business economics, which would take me 1 or 1,5 years to finish. There’s another master program that got my attention and it’s business engineering. This one is 2 years and is considered a bit more difficult than business economics. There are 3 specialities where you can choose from in business engineering and I found sustainability engineering interesting. 
The thing is I’m already feeling behind in comparison to my peers because I did 2 extra years. If I would do business engineering I need to do a short prepatory program before starting business engineering.
I need some opinions about the following: So if I would do business engineering now + prepatory it will take me 2 years and a half. But what if I do the master in business economics so that I’ll have a master already and then add business engineering which will take me 3 years in total. It may sounds dumb because it’s in the same field, faculty and uni and I’ll need to write 2 thesises. I do get some exemptions for business engineering if I did business economics btw. I would love to get some advice and perspective on this.",Expert-Pie-8390,1,1.0,0,1731278498,2024-11-10 22:41:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1god451/2_masters_in_same_field_useless/,11,2024
1gocw6o,When to call a high paying job quits for a better life.,"It is a bit long and read on if you wish but want to put some context around it as I see questions on here without much background.

I am 57 years of age in Australia, recently split the proceeds for the separation, 2 twin lads 18yo and some small financial contributions like health care, incidentals etc. Anyway, I am not enjoying my job, in fact I dread going Sunday through Friday. I am good in my roles, customers are loyal, good reputation etc but after since working FT since I was 15yo and never having more than 4 weeks off in a row I am feeling burnt out.

My plan is this and is based on bonuses etc, put my notice in March next year (after I get my bonus) and finish in June just before EOFY. This way I can take a break of what I want as long as I want, I expect 3 months would suffice, a bit of travel, rediscover myself and contribute to society, in short whatever I want. I could then be happy to return in a minimum wage job as a casual/temp as I am fit and healthy and could ever do warehousing work (which incidentally were the happiest working days of my life.) but would pay commitments which I shall mention next. I just dont want to work fulltime.

My financial situation - I own my own apartment, and I am happy with it, in fact with my upbringing it is the only material thing I am proud of. I also own another apartment worth around 350k all paid off. My goal by March next year is to have around 130k saved. I have worked my commitment outgoings, this does not include food, entertainment etc at around 2k a month after getting rent from other apartment and financial commitments to it (rate/levies). I have 300k+ in Super (I am risk adverse with Super so is sitting in cash but safe) so I can in theory push the 130k until 60yo and then have around 700k retirement funds. 

I have lived a pretty hard (self-abusive life) with no regrets, my time will come when I need more than I am comfortable with assistance so not expecting a prolonged life nor actually want one unless fully mobile and lucid.

So, my question here, do you think I am doing the right thing. I would feel more comfortable getting independent advice and not from people I know who would never dream of giving up a high paying job. Point to me is I am at the arse end of my working life and rather than spend 3 years being stressed before accessing super, I should create a flexible life where I am in control as in living to work/or not rather than the other way around.

The dread and commitment to the role shall leave me with ability to remove the A type personality in my current role, relax a bit and look forward to something which when the time comes shall pass but be happier in life in general.

Appreciate you getting to here and your thoughts regardless will help me in my decision. I am a self-made person and this is why it is hard to make this decision

1goc64w,"Title change fell through, what next?","In 2023, I was asked to take on additional responsibilities that effectively took me from a manager of one team to director of multiple teams. It was supposed to be for 3-6 months, but turned out to be significantly longer due to M&A activity. This was initially acceptable because my pay had already been adjusted and my target title (director) didn't exist. In 2024, I did ask for a title change to an existing title, but dropped it because it would have impacted getting director when the M&A activity resolved. In exchange, they would attempt to get me promoted to a junior executive role and, at worst, I would get director. Crucially, they would put in a title change to the existing title on my behalf if the situation changed.

I recently found out that the situation changed. It is not confirmed, but there is a vanishingly slim chance I will get director. My current executive is getting promoted and I will have a new executive. A junior executive will absorb the teams I have been leading. They have tried selling me on an obscure (let's be honest, made up) role outside my existing career ladder as good for my career. Regardless of their puffery, I would have 0 direct reports and they will likely want me to continue to do the most stressful parts of my existing role. I feel like it is career regression.

Negatives aside, I am in a privileged position. The organization is grooming me for executive leadership. Since the announcement, multiple senior executives have reiterated my importance to the future of the organization. However, I am now in the position that I wanted to protect myself from because my current title means I cannot easily jump to a director role outside the organization.

I have many questions:

1. Has anybody navigated this type of situation before? Was the ultimate outcome worth the perceived or actual job regression?
2. I have been doing work as an interim or acting director with the expectation that it would turn into a director role. Can I title myself as ""Director, interim"" or ""Director, acting"" on my resume?
3. I want to remind my current executive of their promise for the title change. I anticipate they will tell me they couldn't have anticipated this type of change.

1gobzqy,Consulting vs. Regular Job: Higher Immediate Income or Long-Term Wealth Potential?,"Hey all, I’m looking for some advice on a career decision. I’m 40 years old, a manager in a major consulting firm, making $143k, and I just got a solid and confirmed offer from a bank for $175k plus a 15% annual bonus (so basically 200k).

**Here’s the unique and f'd up situation though:**

* I have a conviction for a violent misdemeanor, which makes consulting’s frequent background checks an added stress. Cause a lot of clients will raise a red flag on me. (I didn't actually commit the crime, I got caught up. I pled. Nearly ruined my life). This has not stopped me in any way though. I've constantly gotten promoted.
* Financially, I’m $100k in debt, and I don’t have much saved for retirement, like 50k total. I started late. I'm was a high school drop out, and I was broke as hell until 32 years old (no excuse for the debt though).
* My ultimate goal is to hit millionaire status on paper by 60, and consulting has the very clear potential to get me there—but the higher immediate salary in industry could help with my immediate debt and savings goals right now.

**If you were in my position, would you stick with consulting for the long-term wealth potential?**

* Mind you, consulting makes you DREAM of the craziest salaries, most of my closest colleagues are all making over 200k (all). But of course it comes with a ton of stress, politics and it takes over your life.
* In the banking/regular job, things are relatively easy, chill even. The salary is decent. But the upward trajectory is uncertain and I'd probably never make 300k - 400k going that route, and I'm going to need a TON of money to catch up.

 

Would you stay in consulting with the  higher risk or take the industry role for the higher immediate income and stability?",TomorrowConstant2245,1,1.0,1,1731275549,2024-11-10 21:52:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gobzqy/consulting_vs_regular_job_higher_immediate_income/,11,2024

I recently realized that trying to “fudge” my way into a role just isn’t who I am or who I want to be. I genuinely want to build a career I can feel proud of, but the constant rejections are wearing me down.

I have an MBA and a BS in Business Administration, with a major in marketing. Despite these qualifications and adding projects to my resume, I can’t seem to get any traction. I’ve applied for so many internships, recent grad roles, and even retail jobs that don’t require experience, but I keep facing rejection after rejection. It’s making me question everything. At this point, I’m wondering if I should go back to school for a different major or if there’s a better approach I haven’t considered. Relocating is also out of the question financially right now, so I’m working with what I have.

Here are a few specific questions I’d love insights on:

Has anyone successfully broken into a field without traditional work experience through freelance or contract work? If so, what kind of work, and how did you get started?
How can I better highlight my transferable skills on my resume or LinkedIn? My resume mostly shows my degrees, a few projects, and tailored entries for each job listing, but nothing seems to get noticed.
Would short-term volunteer work or internships be worth it? If you’ve gone this route, did it actually help you land a paid role afterward?
Is building a portfolio helpful in marketing? I’m considering creating some mock marketing strategies or case studies to showcase my abilities. Would that add credibility, or would it be seen as too “entry-level”?
Are there certifications or specialized courses that made a difference for you? I’ve thought about taking something like Google Analytics, but I’m not sure if that would add enough value.
How do you stay positive amid constant rejection? This process is hard, and any tips for resilience would be amazing.

1go7sub,Job is destroying my mental health,"Been here since June, and initially it went ok. An office manager and admin, cool I’d done all that stuff before. 

But quickly I realized they didn’t plan on training me, and then the boss pulled a “your mistakes can be the reason we lose our contract.”  I don’t know how any of the other admins do their jobs honestly. They are wildly inefficient at everything they do. I have tried to implement actual procedures and I am met with resistance from every side. The ceo is kind of a coward, he’ll do whatever the CFO says, and the cfo does not understand how the company runs on a daily basis. 

My ceo said he’s hands off, but he’s only hands off because everyone else is micromanaging the shit out of everyone else. 

I am probably paid the least out of anyone here and yet I am responsible for all documentation review and submissions that go to our government contractor, as well as part of our billing process, and client services. 

A client doesn’t show up and it’s on me. A therapist refused to turn in a document and it’s on me. I make a change that someone didn’t like and it’s on me. I send out biweekly document reminder emails and a therapist got very upset and has since decided that they hate my guts and straight up refuse to involve me in proceses (that I NEED to be involved in) and will constantly email the ceo about how I am lacking. 

Part of me feels like I’m being too sensitive, but I’ve worked like five jobs now (26f) and have never been treated this badly. I’ve never been so ill prepared for what I have to do. 

I am looking for other work and applying, managing to get interviews and all that good stuff. But I can’t quit, I need to keep making money while I look for work. 

Does anyone have any advice for how to muddle through this time? I just need to keep pushing through till I find a new and I don’t know how to make it bearable.

1go7i0i,Feeling Lost and Confused About My Career Path as a New Immigrant in Canada,"
Hey everyone, I’m in a tough spot right now and would love to get some advice and perspectives from others who might have faced similar situations. Here’s a bit of background:

I’m currently 34 and will be turning 35 in April. Last year, in 2023, I moved to Canada from Germany with my wife. We’ve been married for less than two years, and she came here to study at Fanshawe College. As a new couple, we thought it would be best to take this journey together.

In Germany, I worked as a cybersecurity analyst, which I loved. But since moving to Canada, finding an IT job hasn’t been easy. To support my family and keep things going, I transitioned into healthcare and now work as a Personal Support Worker (PSW).

I have mixed feelings about the job. On one hand, I really enjoy the freedom it offers. I can choose my hours, spend time with our one-year-old son, and even work on personal projects. I value freedom highly, and this job gives me a lot of that. I also have dreams of being an entrepreneur—I’d love to create a web app or a SaaS application someday. I’m passionate about AI and spend my free time building skills and projects related to it. But, financially, I’m still limited, which holds me back from fully committing to my entrepreneurial ideas.

Recently, a friend referred my CV to an IT firm, and they’ve invited me for an interview. The job seems like something I can do, but I’m hesitant. I’m not sure if it’s what I truly want or if it’s a career I’d want to stick with long-term.

I’m also considering a future in the Canadian military. Nursing or auto mechanics are other options I’m exploring for next year, but I feel lost and uncertain about which path is the right one for me. As an immigrant, I’m still learning how things work here, and I don’t want to make a decision today that I’ll regret in the future.

So here I am, asking for advice. Has anyone been in a similar situation, where they’re balancing different career possibilities, family obligations, and a desire for freedom? I’m scared of making a wrong decision and want to prepare for a stable future.

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!",olaminana,1,1.0,4,1731263956,2024-11-10 18:39:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1go7i0i/feeling_lost_and_confused_about_my_career_path_as/,11,2024

1go6l7f,How Can I Best Use a Free Month to Prepare for a Career Shift?,"I have a whole month away from work, and I want to make the most of it to prepare myself for my next career step. I’m contemplating a gradual shift into the renewables or energy sector, and my long-term aspiration is to live and work in Denmark (currently based in Germany). 

I’m eager to hear your suggestions, whether it’s for learning opportunities or other productive ways to use this time. 
 A bit about my background: 
• Studied landscape and regional planning 
• 6 years of experience in broadband planning, including leading a team of planners 
• 3 years of project management experience (planning-focused, with budgeting and monitoring) 
• PMP certified 
• Skills include GIS, BPMN process modeling, semi-advanced Power BI reporting, and FTTX 
• I find process automation, Power Platform, and Alteryx fascinating but don’t have coding skills (yet). 

1. What specific courses, skills, or certifications could help pivot towards renewables/energetics, especially leveraging my existing planning and project management experience? 
2. Would investing time in process automation tools like Power Platform or Alteryx be beneficial for this transition? 
3. Are there any impactful activities you’d recommend during this free month to align with my career goals?

1go5iog,How do I tell my struggling boss I don't want to work at the business anymore?,"Hi, any advice would be fantastic as right now I am really struggling to think clearly about my thoughts about recent events and the state the business is in that I work for.

I work for a limited company in the UK that sells on eBay and Amazon. I am the only employee left after two terrible colleagues (thieves) were dismissed. It has only been me for a whole year now and I'm struggling mentally, not only this but I'm starting to really dislike the job and my boss.

The job is simple, and has basically next to no progression, I have been here 2 years and the job has reduced in sales significantly and the boss is barely scraping by to meet bills and paying me. Although he has never missed a payday he makes me well aware that he is struggling to pay me minimum wage, but he words it in a way that I should feel guilty? 

Regardless of all this, he recently had some health complications and because of the nature of the job I worked ridiculous hours to meet all of his requirements so the job can barely stay afloat, he is now unable to do most of the job and this will continue into early 2025, leaving me with minimal days off to relax, because the days I'm off he's asking me to do the Shopify website which he wants to do to escape eBay and Amazon. If I don't do it on my days off, the next day I come into work he will ask if I ""had any time to do any of the shopify?"" Yet he will do nothing himself.

After this recent diagnosis, I went to my hometown to see my sister for her engagement celebrations, after returning he asked ""what do you reckon about you future brother in law?"" I corrected him and said ""sister in law, my sister is a lesbian"" this unleashed a disgusting side of him and said how the ""woke are ruining our children"" and that ""you cannot argue against human nature"". This took me by surprise as I am bisexual myself and it upset me greatly, I said nothing and left work early that day, he has yet to apologise.

Since this incident he has had an operation, he reminds me all of December he won't be able to drive or work but in the same breath says ""me and my partner are considering a holiday in December"" I am yet to have a holiday all 2024 due to lack of colleagues, all of August he was away to Greece.

I know my situation is terrible, and I know I should have left sooner, the area I reside in is not particularly amazing for jobs. I am actively seeking but I really need help navigating how to tackle this inital conversation. How do I tell my boss without it blowing up in my face I'm seeking a career elsewhere. I feel if I say something he may just give up on the business and make me redundant... or possibly he just makes the workload harder so it's difficult to fit job interviews?

I am a hard worker and love to work, I just don't feel like I'm being treated fairly, I do not wish to report him but I want to leave and forget everything about this job. But I want to do everything amicably so my departure is much easier. 

Thank you for any advice or support it means so much as I've never experienced anything like this before.

TLDR: My boss has been overworking me for over a year as the only employee and was extremely homophobic towards me and my sister. How do I inform my boss I'm looking elsewhere amicably without it blowing up in my face?",Dazzling-Explorer-11,8,0.9100000262260437,18,1731258858,2024-11-10 17:14:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1go5iog/how_do_i_tell_my_struggling_boss_i_dont_want_to/,11,2024
1go5d53,Need out of blue collar life. ,"Hey everyone! 

I’m a 25 year old guy. I am an industrial electrician apprentice. I currently make about $55,000/yr before deductions, $33,000/yr after deductions. In 10 months I’ll graduate to being a real electrician and I’ll be making $65,000yr before deductions. 

I have grown exhausted from this line of work. I will finish the remaining year of my apprenticeship but I am looking to set myself up for some sort of transition. 

My supervisor is a tremendous tyrant and I have been dealing with harassment/belittling all because I told the truth in an incident report. This particular situation is my point of breaking, but I am just tired of the industrial blue collar atmosphere. 

I enjoy working with my hands and learning about technical systems. But, I really shine in the administrative side of work. I have always been a really good writer and speaker. I also have a solid background in customer service. 

I would love a job where I can wear khakis and sneakers, come into work and sit at my desk for the majority of the day. Remote work would also be really cool. 

I am thinking that something IT/Computer/Network might be really up my alley. Given that I have some experience with electrical systems and motor-control programming. It seems as though it would be a really good balance of technical knowledge and administration/desk work. 

I don’t mind going back to school for my degree but I would prefer to do it online so I can continue my day job until I have my degree. 

Anybody have any input for me? 

1. What career/jobs might fit me? 
2. What computer/IT job might be best? 
3. What degree should I pursue if any? 
4. What is the job market like for IT jobs?

1go59wg,Should I apologize to my coworkers?,"Hey all,
I’m 22m and this is my first real job out of college (don’t want to go into specifics for sake of anonymity but insurance). I’ve been working here for a few weeks now, and I’ve mostly been doing fine, but today I got told something that has me feeling a bit embarrassed. One of my coworkers (the only other male who works there, around my age) pulled me aside and let me know that my white pants are apparently a bit see-through in certain lighting. He said the women in the office had noticed and asked him to tell me. Apparently they thought it was a new fashion choice they don’t know about. 

I honestly had no idea—these pants looked totally fine when I bought them. I have three identical pants and I’ve been wearing them. They’re not like fully transparent, but apparently they’re just thin enough that in the wrong light, they’re a bit revealing (meaning that apparently the designs on my underwear are fully visible). I’m definitely not wearing them again, but now I’m wondering if I should apologize to the team, especially since most of my coworkers are older women, and I really don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.

I’m a little embarrassed. I’ve been working here for weeks and people have been seeing this the whole time. I tested it in the bathroom later and my underwear was fully visible (not the day to be wearing a flamingo print btw).  But I don’t want to make a bigger deal out of it than necessary. Do you think I should apologize to anyone?  I don’t want them to think it was some fashion statement.

1go52q7,Advice for marketing ourselves and earning $ after leaving US,"Hi, my wife (25f) and I (27m) have decided to plan on leaving the US in 2-5 years. We're exploring several options in Europe (Ireland, Portugal, Denmark) and Latin America (Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico).

Education: 
---I have degrees in Environmental Science and Nonprofit Leadership.
---Wife is nearing completion of an associate in arts. 

Skills:
---Me: digital marketing (social media and search), photography, graphic design, web design, research, strategic thinking and planning, business administration, financial management, project management, writing, customer service, driving, computer operation (not coding), English (fluent), Spanish (basic/intermediate).
---Wife: drawing, painting, graphic design, organization, interior decorating, customer service, English (fluent), Spanish (fluent).

Other info:
---I am very much a logical thinker and a planner. My partner is a creative thinker and is also much more spontaneously-minded.
---I am quite entrepreneurial, and would prefer to start a small business wherever we go. I already have a good idea what this will be, but I don't want to rule out other options. 
---We are both willing to obtain low-cost skills/certs (including trades) before we leave that would be in high-demand and med/high income wherever we land.
---We are striving for a healthy work-life balance while earning enough to be comfortable but not necessarily rich. 

Questions we have:
---What would you look into career-wise in places such as the ones listed above? 
---How can we best prepare ourselves to be in positions that are in-demand while having a good income? 
---Which skills are worth learning or expanding upon? 
---Which skills or careers are not worth it due to low pay or potential to be lost from automation?
---Can you think of any businesses ideas which could effectively combine our skillsets?
---Any other advice for us? 

Thanks.

1go49r5,When/How to ask for a raise when given new responsibilities ,"I've worked as a Fulfillment Coordinator for an online retailer for close to 10 years. Recently, our company was bought by another corporation and tons of changes are underway. I've slowly begun to take on more tasks and responsibilities with the old leaders phasing out their roles with the company by early next year.

At what point should I initiate a conversation about a raise or title change? I'm the only one fulfilling and managing logistics for our company, so I do have some leverage. Is this something I should discuss with both the old leaders and new ones during this transition period? Or, is this something I should hold off on until the transition is complete?

I have been working for 12 years for my company. 
5 years ago I moved to the sector I’m in. 
Two years ago I talked to my supervisor and told her I wanted to move to another sector because I thought it was more fit to my skills. 

She begged me to stay and told me that if I did she would help me get a promotion and give me a role with more responsibilities. 
I told her I knew it wasn’t her call but it was the director who decides. 
She talked to the director and he promised her he would promote me if I stayed in this sector. 
He also told her to make me keep doing special shifts that I was already doing, which in my company imply more responsibility and should be assigned to someone who has a more senior role like the one I’m aspiring to, but I don’t have. 

I trust my supervisor, but since this is an important matter for me, I asked for a meeting with the director and clearly asked him: will you promote me? He said yes. I asked when. He said, “well I can’t tell you right now, as soon as I have the possibility of making some promotions, in the future, but at the moment we don’t have the budget. Anyway it’s gonna be soon, but remember that there are other colleagues that also have to be promoted. In the meanwhile keep doing this special shifts, it will pay off”.
I kept working on these special shifts, honestly with very good results and never complaining. 

After some months he did 2 promotions for the role I wanted, but it was people who were waiting for a longer time, so I wasn’t really that upset. 

I kept having more responsibilities and working extra time linked to the new role, like I already had it. Even though I didn’t. 
I kept doing so because there were also 5 other people in my company doing exactly the same. 

After a while I talked to my director again. He told me I would get the promotion but he didn’t know if it would be in 2024 because the company doesn’t have free positions at the moment and we have to wait for the general manager to make a budget assessment. But he guaranteed that he wanted to promote me because I am an asset, very skilled, and a great worker. 

The months went by and I kept working in this special role like I had it. Also other colleagues in other sectors did. I think they were ALL proposed a promotion. 

In September I went back to the director and told him: I’m doing my job, i’m doing it well, you promised me a promotion, I need a timeframe: when? He started going like: well, you know, there are also other colleagues, and he mentioned 3 of them. 
I said “of course, those are great colleagues and I don’t wanna say nothing against them but please note that I have been working here for a longer period”
He said that if he gets to do 4 promotions he will promote us all and everyone will be happy. 
I said: “ok I know. But what will you do if you only have the budget for TWO promotions? Will I be one of them?”
He wasn’t clear, he said he will have to check, and took time. 

Now, this was almost two months ago. 

I am a bit lost as for what I should do. 
I kept working as I had this new role. He proposed me to my supervisor for some very advanced tasks, which I thought was very positive. But still, I am competing with these other people.
In the meanwhile the company is completely blocked without a budget plan so I know he can’t do promotions right now. 

What would you do in my place? Should I talk to him again and ask him for a guarantee? 
Should I stop doing this special shift until I get promoted? Honestly this would definitely put me in a bad position towards my colleagues who keep doing it without having the role. 

I am a bit lost here…

TLDR:
My boss offered me a promotion so that I would keep doing special shifts which should be assigned to a more senior role. I’m quite sure he also promised the same thing to at least 3 other people. He will surely be unable to promote us all. 
At least not in the near future. 
What should I do? ",RiknightIt,2,0.6000000238418579,26,1731225872,2024-11-10 08:04:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnvtzj/my_boss_offered_me_a_promotion_almost_2_years_ago/,11,2024

1gnvabw,Fashion buyer looking to change careers. Any ideas?,"
I (32 f) studied Fashion at University and have worked in Fashion Buying for 10 years. But now I feel increasingly disconnected from the fashion industry, given how bad it is for the environment, and less passionate about my work overall.

I would love to change into a career that has a more positive impact, but I am unsure what I could be qualified to do. I have considered roles in architecture, engineering, animals and helping underprivileged youth, but I feel like I won't be able to get a job in these areas without completely retraining. I enjoy being creative but also very analytical. At school (UK systems) I got A grades across the board, then A Levels in Fashion, Geography, Business and English, and my Degree is BA Fashion. I was considering trying to open my own vintage store but have been told that owning a business is a 24/7 job which kind of puts me off since I value the work/life balance that I currently have.

2. Computer science and Math for PhD in Computer science then take my Actuary exams- Reason-Job security, better understanding of technology and finance, Better chance of starting my own business.

3. Nurse and then Masters in Nursing- Reasons- Job security, Very good pay, good preparation to become a doctor.

1gnrh3o,-6 month certificates for a non-degreed individual with a background in payroll and service industry? ,"
My husband has been affected by the strikes in the film industry and he has been out of “real” work for almost two years. He worked for a few years as a payroll accountant on episodic television and as a waiter for 15 years before that. Unfortunately the software they use for film payroll is specific to the industry, so it seems as though his skills don’t transfer. He doesn’t have a degree of any kind. 

He is a quick learner of software and is an extremely intelligent people person. When he worked from home, he got lonely - I think he enjoys teamwork. He’s great at math, but isn’t so into noodly problems, so I’m not sure if coding would be his jam. I think he would enjoy an office job that wasn’t overly technical or fast paced, but that did require some expertise and talking to people. 

Is there some kind of certification he could get in or under six months that could help him find a new career? He’s open to anything except jobs that are too physical (so trades are prob out). Thanks in advance! 

TLDR: searching for certificates for non-degreed husband with background in payroll and service industry. Open to any non-trades.

1gnr7lk,Help! Should I Quit My Job?,"Hey all, I’ve been in a new position and I’m thinking seriously about quitting. Here is the low down. I am a part-time student who has been struggling hard to find a job that will work with my schedule. Most jobs want me to be constantly available for rotating shifts even if they’re part time. So, wanting some money for school, I accepted a position that was offered to me as a “casual” - my employer, knowing I am a student, offered me this saying I’d be able to pick up shifts other employees were missing and I would have flexibility this way. I was informed there were night shifts, but told they were few and far between, and I assumed since I am a casual I would be able to simply not work those shifts. 

However, a week in and I am being put in the roster for 2-3 shifts a week, 1-2 night shifts. I am not seeing much flexibility. And I am being scheduled on Christmas. The biggest deal is the alternating night and day shifts. I can see this seriously messing with my sleep and mental health, and especially my academic success. That is important to me. 

So, would you quit? The organization is health and I am afraid of being blacklisted from working in a similar area in the future, as I want to be a healthcare worker (part of why I took the role)(and not one that would ever have to do night shifts).

1gnqwix,"Boss Got My Interview Canceled with Another Section and a HORRID ""Coaching Session"" Followed - Gate Keeping my Career Growth at an Engineering Consulting Job","**WAYY TLDR:** This was a terrible experience and I got gate-kept from an interview in a section that this same guy, just 1 week earlier was happy to help me get. The day of it all this BS happens. I think its because my boss basically said ""I am crap at what I do and can't handle the move"" so VP guy who got me in to energy interview in the first place hears my boss say this and then freaks out, somehow gets the interview cancled, and then pulls me into a ""coaching meeting"" where he COMPLETELY takes the side of ONLY MY BOSS and completly ignores any of my side of the story and my logic. Then says ""you need to do xyz or get fired"". Great coaching. Seems very very very \*not professional at all\* and I can't help but think my name got slandered to the point that the guys in Energy cancled their interview all based off of what a guy told a guy that told a guy... Fooginell man  
  
**NON TLDR (enjoy the drama):**  
  
Hello, I am an Electrical / Computer Engineer from the best electrical engineerig program / university in a 500 miles radius (Mid-Midwest). I work in a small team doing low voltage design. I am about a year out of school. I have worked here at the consulting firm for 6 going on 7 months now. My team consist of ""boss"", ""J"" and ""D"". J and D are the same role as I am except I dont have years of experience like they do. 

At my 30, 90, and 180 day stays, I expressed that I am not too sure low voltage (LV) is for me. These XYZ day stays are conducted by the ""VP electrical"" that is above ""boss"". Lets call him ""VP"" or ""VP electrical"" from now on. OK, so at the last 180 day stay thing, I spoke that I am interested in changing sections after giving LV a real shot. LV work is brain-dead and out of my small team of boss, J, and D, I am the only electrical engineer for real. Boss was electrician, J was a camera man, and D was an architectural engineer recently turned LV engineer. 

So, after I mention this, VP is happy and is like ""lets get you into section X!"" Why didn't you just say so?! Lets make it happen!"" He says... Cool, I get turned to the VP of Energy (I want to do controls, SCADA, process piping (aka actually complex engineering, not building buildings).  If I made this move, I would no longer be under either boss and or VP electrical. I have been having real problems with the team as they are all remote so I never see them. They are also perpetually unavailable on teams. I mean if you look at their schedules, they are in meetings 80% of the day, no exaggerations. So after I have a video-call with VP Energy, I thank him for showing me what they do, tell him that I am excited for this, and am ready to make the move. Therefore, we setup an interview. 

At this point or before, I believe I should have let my boss know, but I was not planning on letting him know anything until I am sure that I would like to make the move and is also offered a spot! Seems logical. So suddenly, the day of the interview with Energy, one guy declines it after we have been communicating and had this scheduled. Very strange, OK, the other team lead that I was mainly talking to will still be there.... DECLINED. OK, now this is super strange. I ask these guys ""hey, why did you decline the interview?"". You know what I get hit with? I get hit with this: ""I was told to stop the process"". I am confused but think its just nothing and things are going swimmingly. Oh NO...

This is when it gets juicy: later that day, out of absolutely no where with zero communication for this meeting occurring, with only 30 mins of heads-up, I see a ""coaching meeting"" has been set. It gave me a strange / bad vibe. I check to see who this is with and I see: Boss, VP electrical, and an HR lady. Oh SHIT, here we go. WTF happened?! So I mentally prepare myself for what I feel is about to be carnage. I get on an I see both my boss, AND VP electrical are supremely mad. Uncontained anger, just barely keeping it under wraps. What the heck is going on? I ask ""hello, I see I was put in this meeting, what is going on?"". Well VP elec chimes in and says ""well OP (me)... we have a problem (basically, I don't remember what was said at first). Then they open a document called ""coaching memo"". This is where the shit hits the fan. 

This ""coaching memo"" thing is just a letter of PURE ANGER. As they read it, they bring up the most petty things, little issues that have been plaguing me the entire time at this job. I can tell who wrote this, it's obviously my boss, not VP elec. I do not EVER work with VP on ANYTHING. After this seriously hurtful, non-positive, angry, finger pointing, terrribly written, ""coaching memo"" was read to me as I sat silently just taking the full weight of the bullshit, I first ask who wrote this while knowing full well who wrote this. Then it dawns on me, the reason my interview got canceled is because VP-elec must have mentioned it to Boss. I had not told Boss about this yet as I was not ready and also this was a thing that VP-elec setup for me in the first place. What gives? 

Well, after asking who wrote this, Boss instantly steps in and said ""Well me and VP wrote this >:( "". Ummm, sure. HR lady says ""you have any questions?"". Oh HELL YES I HAVE QUESTIONS?! Do you think I am just going to take this sitting down? Just let you bully and falsely accuse me. The thing that made me the most angry was that not only did boss hold this in when I had asked SEVERAL TIMES about my performance only to be told that I am doing ""VERY WELL"" but that I am ahead of the game and it will still take me a year to get fully up to speed. Then, this same guy has all this crap to say to me and the VP is also on my ass? What gives? What exactly happened this morning I think to myself. 

Well, I was basically told that ""you cant go to energy because you are not focused on your current role. You say that you don't like LV and that you want to move to Energy. Therefore, you can not go to Energy because you are unfocused. Also, you turn things in unfinished, ask too many questions, and are not a good learner""

This just made me so angry. The first statement about ""bc I am not loving LV, I cant go to energy"" is a logical flop. I clearly ask them this ""so are you saying this?: If there is a guitar player who expresses interest in playing drums, does this make him any lesser of a drummer?"". Their answer, YES. OMG NO IT DOES NOT make you less of a guitar player? Who *are* these people? I regret saying anything to VP electrical. He is a jerk. Dude talks all the time about being christian but when it comes to it, this is how you act? Not only this but both of them did not listen to a THING I said in reply. Every word went in one of VP's ears and out the other

But the biggest thing that annoys me? THAT MY INTERVIEW WAS CANCELED! Dude completely overstepped his boundaries. If I was not already within the company, I would have interviewed earlier this day. IDK what you said to those guys but if it was ANYTHING along the lines of ""OP sucks at his job"" then we have a HUGE problem now and I am about to pull up some serious evidence of the massive blunder that these guys just pulled on me. I think what happened was Boss caught wind of me trying to move to energy, somehow talked to VP elec and essentially talked seriously poorly about me to the point that VP-Elec decided that not only does he need to cancel my move to energy but to also make this BS ""coaching session"". LORD I AM... IDK what I am rn.... :""( So many things wrong with this. 

I ask them to elaborate about the ""Issues"". they say I ""keep making mistakes"", so give me an example instead of making this seem like its the end of the world. What are the mistakes? You know what it was? I forgot 1 out of 50 card readers on the redlines. You know *why* I made this mistake? Because D (co worker) gave me edits (redlines) to make, you look at it and do whats marked. Again, zero brain cells required. There were a few card readers that said ""coordinate with Kate"". Who is kate? So I ask D ""hey, idk who kate is"" Can you please coordinate with her. No reply. BTW, I get ALL MY WORK THROUGH either D, Boss, or the 3rd guy, J. Therefore, D is the one that does the communication. Dude just ignores my calls and chats (says is ""too busy""). Then, once he (prob) got flamed for forgetting a card reader, he bitches to me about ""how you need to be more diligent and double check things and blaw blaw blaw"". I tell him that this is all on you man. I can pull up chats were I told you I need help and you don't reply. Where I call you and you don't answer, or how even if you read it, you dont respond. IDK why you don't like me, but we need to work on this. So don't come to me, mad, when there is a mistake like this. Also, you are a suck a$$ teacher. Also, I heard the story of why this guy always has a terrible gotee and it goes like this: My girlfriend in HS liked me clean shaven so when we broke up I swore I would always have a gotee... Brother is now married with kids in his 30s and still does this. Stop it.  
  
This is the same guy who CONSTANTLY Socratically questions me. They are the ones who sit in the meetings with the owners and have been working on the projects mostly. So when I ask ""hey, is this a type 1, 2, or 3, firealarm (just an example)"" I want an answer, not to be told to look at this and that code book. I get socratically questioned, so I look in the book (even tho on the other hand they say don't look in the books at codes, it burns up fee and you should be drafting). I find my answer, but ask *again*, is this right before I waste days working on it only to find that it was wrong and I need to redo everything because I didn't ask questions! They are so completely angry at this point that ""I got it wrong again"" they say that they know the answer and the answer I got is wrong (both D and Boss at this point). Well, these JERKS are actually wrong. I just opened a go-by project for the building as we are just building the LV devices on: the camera, data, and fire alarm for 1 floor out of 12 on a building, and LO AND BEHOLD, THEY ARE WRONG! I WAS RIGHT! The other floors were build exactly like I said. No credit given to me. Again, IDK if they even read what I sent them. I would just call but dude is just a jerk.   
  
Dude (D) even started a thing where the joke is, if something goes wrong, we need to ""Slap OP"". Brother, I get it, I guess you don't like me. It was funny ONE time, not the 12th time. Later dude tried it in a BIG meeting and I, for the first time, confront him about his antics asking ""why he likes this joke so much as its long past being funny"". Everyone is just dead silent as I don't think they expected me to respond. I think dude took it as another blow to his ego or something when I am just chillin man. What IS IT WITH THESE GUYS?! Maybe, this stuff makes them feel powerful or something? I think several things about me challenge him, from my young age to being the only electrical engineer in the group, *and* I am a pepper in a sea of salt? I'm sorry I somehow challenge you, but IDC man"". Stop it. I am always respectful. Old school: yessir, no sir. Always have been. 

Yea, so the meeting with the coaching, I apporach every single point they make and time after time, my logic is completely disregarded. This battle is lost, but afterwards, I talk to the friends of my father that got me in here in the first place and they are even higher up than these jerks and hes like this is NOT how this is going to go. We are going to fight this as the little blocking of my interview might even be illegal. Wow, so yea, we are going to war. Also, I have several jobs lined up in the controls world, but thought I'd try my hand here within the company before leaving. Guys wanted me to just quit on the spot *SO BADLY,* I could just tell. I took my sweet time getting to work the next day only to find my computer blown up with missed calls at 8:03. I call Boss later that day and he appoligizes and I accept his appoligies and also tell him that I understand where his anger is coming from and also tell him that I know I could have told him about my move to energy, but thought it best to wait until the position actually is offered before talking to you. I made peace with him and never got mad at him. Like in Game of Thrones, ""You make peace with your enemies, not your friends. Thats why they call it *making peace*"". God I love that quote. 

Now, the lingering issue is with VP-elec's attitude and how he singlely sidded with Boss and heard NOTHING of what I said. He also is the one who got my interview with Energy cancled and made this ""coaching"" meeting in the first place. Also, I was basically told ""you will be a better learner, stop asking remedial questions, never leave early (that was another point, I CONSTANTLY catch shit for leaving at 4 even though in my offer-letter, and my one stipulation for workign there was that I need to leave at 4. I have an entire second professional studio musican thing going on and am making money doing that. I have student debts to pay and 40 hours is NOT going to cut it. I am young and have energy so I am going to BURN it!

Not to mention that Boss took a critique of me from J (the only guy on my team thats not a jerk and is actually nice to be around) that I put some speakers at a 15\* angle as the floor plans in that area were at a 15\* angle. I DIDNT EVEN DO THAT! The intern did! I thought it was fine as the symbol was a circle so no matter how roated it is, it does not matter. None of what we do is actually 1:1 design and its just ""put the speaker in the damn ceiling tile"". We dont even show the wiring. The most intense calucation I have seen anyone on my plans or on my team do is for wattage... 10 speakers tapped at 3 watts each? 3x10 = 30. Therefore we need a 30 watt amp. Then, J and Boss have the AUDACITY to act like not only is it difficult but ""are you sure you understand""?! YES I UNDERSTAND! Gosh. Have yall ever even done REAL curcit analysis? Try a 7th degree polynomical transfer function and come back to me and ask ""do I understand again. I dare ya"".   
  
Lord that was a lot to write. Sorry. I might just make this a PG version and use it as documentation for my deformation of character single-handedly by my boss playing the telephone game with an asshole named D. J is chill. If I can get into energy, I will. That is the only section where the people don't look like their souls have been sucked thanks to this company. Oh, and I was told ""I don't fit the comany's standard"". Again, sorry I am no slave but a thinker, a question asker instead of a nodder, one who has a uniqe style and is a non-conformist. Even if I tried to conform, the skin I am in will never allow me to. Therefore, I am unabashidly myself! :D

If anyone read this far, what would you do? What do you think of this. This was a terrible experience and getting gate-kept from an interview seems very very very not professional and I can't help but think my name got slandered to the point that the guys in Energy cancled their interview all based off of what a guy told a guy that told a guy... Fooginell man.

1gnpg8b,Need Advice? (Long Post) ,"
Hello Reddit people, I’m looking to hear some advice on what I should do. So I’ll try and make it short. And this might be a no-brainer, but I don’t know.
 
Currently, I work at CVS making $20 and have been here for 3.5 years. It was my first job. They’ve said they want to get me promoted for quite some time, but I feel as if they keep pushing it off or further from me. But my current manager seems to be telling me I will get promoted this year. First, she said November, but that didn’t happen. Another factor is my drive is about 30 minutes  with no traffic and ~25 miles. I also just really don’t feel happy here anymore, but I’ve had a lot going on, so it could be that. 

Now I was looking on Indeed and saw there was a position I was thinking about applying for. It’s as  a delivery driver for Amazon DSD. They pay more, $21.50, so a $1.50 more than what I make currently. And my drive would be about 15 minutes and <10 miles. They say it’s a 4-day work week, which is a plus, but I’m willing to work OT if they want me to. I’ve always thought doing something like this would be fun. I know it’s hectic and can be nonstop, which is fine. Financially, it might sound better, but I’m not sure if it’s worth it. 


Last part, I’m also trying to pay off some debt and just feel it’s hard with me not making enough currently, unless they were to promote me at CVS, which gives me like an 8% raise, which slightly puts me over what the delivery driver positions offer, +5 OT hours, which I’m not sure is worth it with my drive still because I see that is one of my main expenses, because I need to fill up about every 5 days, and it costs about $50 every time. 

I would just like to hear your advice on what I should do. Should I stay where I’m at and try to continue to grow or should I do something different? Thank you if you read this all.

1gnpe8z,How to become a manager for a large retail store,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask. 

To start, I do not have a college degree. 

Long story short - I worked for a small retail business as a general manager for over ten years, specializing in sporting goods. My goal was to one day take over ownership of it and run it 'till the day I died. Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way. COVID, changing consumer habits, and greedy landlords meant we shut down, and I had to go find real work. 

Through networking, I manged to become a manager for a third party logistics company. Unfortunately, I was laid off after about a year and a half and they shut down shortly after. 

Currently, I am the store manager for another small retail business. It's fine, but I want more. First, of course I want more money, but also, I want more action. This is a bit of a specialty business, and as such we don't get a lot of customers on a day to day basis, the customers we get are usually return customers, and there isn't much to do during the day. We do well, but I'm bored. 

Call me crazy, but I miss some of the more challenging aspects of retail. I miss the holiday rushes. I miss the crazy customers. I miss doing things. 

I would love to become a manager for a larger retail store. I know retail is dying, and I'll probably get laid off again in the future, but I'm willing to take that risk. 

What made me post is, I saw a position as a department manager for REI, and I do miss outdoors and sporting goods. That was a large part of my life for a long time. I never got a call for an interview. 

I've sent out resumes for different store manager and assistant manager positions, but I know my resume isn't strong. How do I make it stronger, what are they looking for? How do you network for these larger corporations to get your foot in the door? I don't want to start fully entry level. Maybe if I'm laid off again I'll go that route. I feel I can work my way up. But I'd like to start as an assistant/department manager at least. I don't expect them to hire my as a store manager directly, though I'm sure I can do the job.

Objectively I volunteer to teach English while on my fellowship in the heart of MS 13 and 18.

1gnomed,How do I lock in a stellar opportunity,"Don’t get me wrong here. I’ve gotten tons of jobs in the past so I’m not necessarily looking for “wear blue”, “do an Eldridge knot”, “smile”, or “don’t beg”. But I do feel like the company I just interviewed with would be a phenomenal place to work and while it seems like they’re keeping the candidate pool low, their interview process is pretty busy. 

I’m an Android engineer and this job is in the music industry (broadly speaking). I’ve been given a take-home assignment and with the approach I’ve taken so far, I’ve only worked with a handful of devs who could pull off what I’m aiming for in any comparable time frame. If I don’t blow this stage out of the water, it will be because I did too much and I don’t think this is likely. 

The next interview stage is a 45-60 minute system design interview with one of their engineers. I’m supposed to collaborate with this person, ask questions, and so on. This seems odd because my takehome is a system design problem. Beyond what I’m currently doing, I don’t know what to expect at this stage. 

A couple more rounds after that one seem to be ascending in terms of the interviewers leadership level and descending in terms of technical aptitude. I.e. progressively “cultural”. I’ve been on the interviewer side of basically each of these stages and know that a decision between two candidates can come down to something incredibly minor, an overall vibe, and/or who was most memorable (for better or worse). 

I’m here for any advice as I’ve generally interviewed at lower levels and found myself advancing to this level naturally. While I’ve been in a lead position for several years now, my previous interviews for this level have fallen flat at the end — possibly losing the VP/CEOs interest for some reason. Any suggestions on how I could be missing this one? I’m always very honest, possibly to my own detriment… does this level of interviewer just want to measure who makes them feel the fuzziest?",No_Discipline_512,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1731199770,2024-11-10 00:49:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnomed/how_do_i_lock_in_a_stellar_opportunity/,11,2024
1gnock4,Need to leave my new job but should I include on my resume?,"I made a huge mistake leaving a good job of 10 years for an opportunity for growth. The company I left is in serious financial trouble and we were told there will be no promotions in the foreseeable future. On top of this they weee not backfilling jobs when folks started leaving so I took this as a big red flag. 3 months ago a recruiter contacted me and I was sold on everything they had to offer. 

Within a week after putting in my notice the red flags started showing up with the new job. My hiring manager, whom I really liked, stepped down weeks prior to my job offer and the company did not disclose until it was too late for me to go back to my old company. Over the next two months I’ve faced nothing but toxicity and the worst work life balance I’ve ever encountered in my 20 year career. After weeks of working 7 days from the time I wake up until I go to bed I have decided to start my job search.

Since I am in good standing and rehirable at my former employer my thought was to leave this new job off my resume and applications. I suppose I could go the route of saying I was laid off or something along those lines but what are the odds this new job will somehow come up? Even though I never job hopped before I feel like in this tough and competitive job market listing a job of 3 months will place me at the bottom of the pile.

1gnnop4,About to open an international office,"
I work for a technology consulting firm, and when I was hired 10 years ago, I was employee number three or four. Nowadays, I’m regarded as one of the senior leaders of the company, I have a strong billing rate, and I manage several projects each with multiple staff. I am not one of the original founders of the company and I have no equity. 

I need some advice about compensation for the next phase of my career at this company. I have accumulated a few projects in Canada, and I proposed that I go to Vancouver and open branch office up there. My boss likes the idea so I’m beginning to make plans. It’s obviously a great opportunity which I feel very lucky to have, but I also want a significant compensation adjustment that recognizes all the travel and disruption this will bring to me and my wife (I’ll be dividing time between the US and Canada for at least a year, at which point we may decide to relocate there.)

I currently make around $250K a year, and I can earn an annual bonus if I meet a minimum billing threshold. 

I’m trying to figure out what I should ask for and what’s fair. I think it’s reasonable to receive both a salary bump and a portion of equity, but I’m not positive what the specific ask should be. I feel like a decade of profitable performance and assuming a major responsibility is worth an equity stake… Maybe 5%? And should I propose the salary bump? or something based on the revenue from the new office?

I haven’t really operated at this “level” before so some guidance would be great.

1gnncdn,"PLEASE, Avoid jobs that hire on the spot; there’s usually a reason they’re in urgent need of employees.","I noticed the usual red flags but hoped this place would be different. My hiring experience  was extremely rushed, and it didn’t take long to realize I was in for a rough time. Looking back, the quick hiring should have been a warning sign, they were severely understaffed and dealing with constant turnover. The work environment was tense, with management frequently belittling employees and posting aggressive messages on the bulletin board. Important details like pay, dress code, and training schedule weren’t clarified when I started. When I tried to address scheduling conflicts with my school, the general manager abruptly ended my employment via text rather than having a conversation. Given that the general manager prides herself on her hospitality experience, I expected a more respectful and professional approach from both her and the company. All of this is to say: don’t waste your time, there’s a reason they’re so desperate.

1gnmne7,Should I accept an offer from a company with bad reviews on job sites ,"I have just got a job offer which offers around 10K higher than my current job. This company is much bigger than my current one and is thriving. I didn’t apply by myself but was referred by an employment agency that approached me on LinkedIn. They offer somewhat the same position so I easily passed through the interviews. The interviews were easier than I expected. After the reference check, they sent me an offer. The offer is somehow sus as they didn’t state clearly the duties and work hours. It is a long letter with all the conditions that favour them. Though they sent a revised one after I asked. Besides, I went on all the job sites and found out that they have very low ratings. Most of the recent reviews complain about the management with toxic environment. Also, they hire and fire pretty often though that position is not related to mine. I even sent messages to a few past employees to ask about the culture there. I only got one reply from a person who left recently after a short time. They didn’t specify the reason but stated that they have bad experience overall with the management and wouldn’t recommend. 

I’m really scratching my head right now as I know there are some red flags. However, with the current job market, it is tough to secure an offer with higher pay whereas I am fed up with my current one and on the lookout for a while.

For context I am a woman in my 30s, I work in a residential home and I’ve just re-enrolled to finish my masters in social work after taking a short break. I am support staff which is basically the bottom of the hierarchy in our mental health program. I get paid well, have a flexible schedule and the benefits are great. I started last year and have been really enjoying it for the most part. I have learned a lot here and really like my coworkers. I have a lot of experience working with different modalities and in different clinical settings as well. I’ve been trying to work with different populations to be a more well rounded provider when I eventually start practicing.

Working in mental health is stressful but it’s more stressful when you are trying to manage clients and coworkers. One of my older male coworkers has been historically difficult to work with. He was transferred due to issues in a previous setting. He has had mediations with other people working with us. He’s a self proclaimed alpha male and problem solver so the misogyny is heavy with this one. Additionally he's the type of coworker that thinks he knows everything, undermines what people say, is moody, generally confrontational and has demonstrated a severe lack of self awareness. Think someone who says they never make mistakes but historically has. He says some pretty unhinged things and spends most of his shifts on his phone. Many times when I ask him something pertaining to work he looks at you like “why are you bothering me”. He contradicts things we say to clients always asking why? Or tells clients “you don’t have to do that if you don’t want to” which is ultimately true but it can hinder their progress especially when is specific to their behavior plan goals I’ve also had the misfortune of overhearing him on his phone and it’s pretty gross.

I’ve personally had issues with him off and on throughout the last year but I haven’t said anything because a. I don’t like confrontation, b. He’s a man child that I don’t want to waste my time on and c. I'm not petty. Now being so passive has come to bite me in the ass. Recently he got into an argument with my immediate supervisor and during her recent supervision she told her supervisor that he was bullying people, has a general bad attitude, is creating a hostile work environment and that he’s been particularly awful to me. So of course during my supervision I confirmed everything that was shared. When the issues were brought to him (again I am not the first or only one that’s had problems with him) he decided instead of talking to us about everything to report me to HR. I don’t know the full extent of what he has said but from what I gather he’s complained that I’m unprofessional and I don’t follow the modality we use and because of that I need to be reprimanded. 

My boss told me I have a meeting with HR next week for mediation. How should I approach this meeting? I am very nervous and when I’m attacked I shut down. Part of me feels like flying off the handle because what he’s saying is absurd but the other part knows I need to be collected and calculated. 

If you made it this far thank you so much for reading this.",Alili1223,66,0.7900000214576721,73,1731192549,2024-11-09 22:49:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnm6cy/my_older_male_coworker_reported_me_to_hr/,11,2024
1gnm535,"Potentially have to pivot, job search advice?","Hi all, the company I currently work for recently just had a not so positive earnings call and it's suspected that there may be layoffs in the coming months. I would hope that my role wouldn't be affected, but everything is so fleeting nowadays that I wouldn't be shocked if it did happen. I want to at least get ahead of it so it wouldn't be as much of a hit if I was laid off, so I've been looking at what opportunities may be out there. Based on all of my most relevant current and previous experience, I wouldn't say my ""career"" thus far has been necessarily consistent since I don't have a degree and all of my roles have been pretty different. Mostly worried bc considering where I live (Greater Richmond, VA area), my current role pays extremely well (>$29) and I fear I wouldn't be able to find anywhere that pays the same or more. 

I've worked as a Bank Teller previously, but most of my other jobs since have been more based in administrative work (Administrative Assistant, Accounts Receivable, & currently Title & Registration Specialist). I'm skilled at and have experience in administrative support, regulatory compliance, researching, and also just really good at learning quickly. Does anyone know of different types of roles i could search for & look to pivot into that would potentially pay the same or more?",Superb_Driver998,1,1.0,0,1731192443,2024-11-09 22:47:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnm535/potentially_have_to_pivot_job_search_advice/,11,2024
1gnm1i5,HR vs Risk Management,"Hey everyone! I’m currently at community college and planning to transfer to a university to complete my bachelor's in business admin, but I’m torn between two degree paths: HR and Risk Management & Insurance.

If I chose to go into risk management, I think being an underwriter would be cool. However, the university I'm interested in only offers classes at a certain time. I need 24 credits to complete the risk concentration, but some of the required courses haven't been offered since like Fall 2021/2022. I'm also not the best at math, and it's sort of scaring me away a bit because I would hate to fail a class.

On the other hand, HR classes are more consistently available, and I could probably finish the program faster, making the transfer timeline smoother. But I’m aware that HR doesn't pay super well, and I'm also quite introverted/shy. I think I can adapt to having to talk to people over time though.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have advice on what to do? Should I switch to HR to streamline my transfer, or stick with Risk Management even if it means a potentially longer and more uncertain path?",Illustrious-Shake775,1,1.0,1,1731192162,2024-11-09 22:42:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnm1i5/hr_vs_risk_management/,11,2024
1gnk1tr,Mechanical Engineer. What are some next steps I could take for career growth?,"Hey redditors, 
So I have a masters in Mech Engineering, have work FT for 3 years as a new product dev engineer in an oil and Gas related company. 

I live in a MCOL area and pay just over $100k. 
I have been in the same team and the same project for the last 3 years (my entire career). Definitely not something too great for my resume. 

But I hope that consistency here will convince my company to sponsor my green card application. This is the reason I have been sticking it out. 
I am planning to give it a few more months before asking for a team change. 

Could I be doing something more to improve my career progression. My current role is relatively chill, other roles will definitely keep me more busy, with probably about the same pay. 

I don’t mind getting into a passive side income in the meantime either. 

Just feeling a little lost over here on how to approach my career!

1gnjyc8,Manager shit talks me to other people regardless if I’m present or not,"Hey all, just curious what you think of the following situation..

I ve been with the same corporation for the past 5 years, since 2 years ago I moved to a new role with new manager.

My performance has been great in the beginning, very supportive manager, all good. She constantly supported me and even appointed me to organize different events. So far all good. At one point a few months ago due to some family issues that I never brought to anyone at my job, my performance dropped somewhat…I admit that in terms of organization my mailbox has been really chaotic with missing important emails and overall not doing my tasks in a timely manner. This got to my manager which warned me that I should get back on track a few times. I started to slowly improve again but while working hybrid, due these family issues, I appeared to be away at random times which apparently really pissed her off. At one point she started to micro manage me in terms of randomly calling me and telling me to share my screen so she can see my mailbox and even mentioned she would ask HR if she can get full access to my maibox so she can always track it (of course that never happened lol, Im sure she didnt even try as she knows thats a huge privacy break).

Fast forward…I got back on track and started performing again - however, this is where I need your advice because Im not sure if Im crazy or not:

Even though this whole story was months ago, whenever we re in a group at work she talks about me while Im also there. She says how unorganized I was, how she has to micromanage me, how she had to “teach” me to be organized and do my job. She doesnt even say one good word about me or any of my accomplishments even though Im currently performing above the majority of my team. She talks about me even when Im not present, colleagues coming to me telling me she said “I cant focus on the job, I start too many things at once etc” and overall bad things that make me look like someone on their first day at the job

Usually colleagues come to me asking for advice on different job related topics because they know I have the knowledge…the other day someone asked me something, I gladly helped them and I just made a random joke like “I think I would probably do pretty ok as a team lead” for which my mngr immediately answered “yeeeeeah, thats a really bad idea” which I laughed at but inside I was totally disgusted.

My question is .. why even though Im a really good perfomer again, my manager only mentions the bad period about me to everyone? Why is she trying to spread that bad image of m to the rest of the colleagues? It just makes me not give a shit anymore and be unmotivated. She never mentions anything positive about me and overall tries to make me look like I have no idea about this job and I have to be babysit even though several colleagues told me in private that thats not true, that I should not believe that and that they feel great working with me. 

Last detail to complete the picture - my manager is also the kind of person to talk a LOT about her life and barely letting anyone else talk.  She also tries to have a counter argument to anyone that would possibly be right in front of her.

1gnj0j7,Should I ask my boss why he is angry?,"My boss fluctuates between friendly, kind and helpful, and then will be angry with me. Right now he is acting combative in conversations and seems to intentionally be taking any little thing I say in the wrong way. He also reminds me that he is boss. He did this in front of my coworkers in a meeting yesterday. I have a coworker who is kind to me and felt awkward, and another one who was smiling and happy about it as she seems to dislike me (acts kind around others, acts passive aggressive when alone, acts jealous when he is nice to me).

I can't think of anything I did other than..

- not being quite as friendly back and avoiding him a little this week because last week I feel like I relied on him too much and wanted to show I can deal with my job - he was also extremely busy and I didn't want to bother him
- left work earlier than normal as I usually stay late (way after others) and he said he came to find me and I wasn't there (he has rarely come to find me after work and he usually leaves before me so this was unexpected)
- I challenged his thinking a few times as the situation he is helping me with, but I am supposed to lead this and have a say in it. (But I've done this in the past and he acted like it was a good thing.)

For example if I say my opinion he says that he is in charge and I should ask him. Then when I ask him his opinion he says ""well what do you think? I want to know your thinking."" And then whatever I say he rebuts it mostly through asking questions and I feel very stupid.

His usual way of behaving is kind and friendly. Especially when alone, he smiles while talking to me, glances down at my mouth and holds eye contact. When in this state he always understands what I mean, takes it positively and compliments my work.

But he goes through phases (about a week or two) of being critical and quite rude. The angry part is only to me however, he acts much more stable though also sometimes friendly with others. Most coworkers adore him and say he's never acted angry with them. He went to great lengths to hire me permanently after having had temporary contracts here. I am female and we are both early forties.

Sometimes I have a feeling there are feelings involved. I've caught him watching me, sometimes when I walk by he watches me from behind. I usually feel that he really cares for me and has stood up for me before. Once he recommended a musical artist to me whose top song is called ""secret love."" I really value him as a person and we have an unspoken understanding of each other.

His anger causes me stress and I wanted to know if there's a professional way I can address it? Or is it better to let it go and hope he gets over it?",Elen5teech,2,1.0,0,1731183728,2024-11-09 20:22:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnj0j7/should_i_ask_my_boss_why_he_is_angry/,11,2024
1gniy8w,"The Importance of Respectful Communication in the Workplace: Why Telling Employees They're Replaceable Is Detrimental
","In today's competitive business environment, fostering a positive workplace culture is more crucial than ever. Companies that thrive understand the value of their employees and recognize that respect and appreciation are key components of a productive and motivated workforce. Unfortunately, some managers make the mistake of telling their employees that they are easily replaceable, not realizing the long-term negative impact this can have on both the individual and the organization as a whole.

First and foremost, it's important to acknowledge the role that employees play in the success of a company. Each team member brings unique skills, experiences, and perspectives that contribute to the overall performance and innovation of the business. When a manager tells an employee that they are easily replaceable, it undermines their value and can lead to a decrease in morale and engagement. This, in turn, can result in lower productivity, higher turnover rates, and a less cohesive team.

This approach fails to recognize the true cost of replacing an employee. Recruiting, hiring, and training new staff is not only time-consuming but also expensive. The loss of institutional knowledge and the disruption to team dynamics can significantly impact a company's efficiency and effectiveness. Therefore, it is in the best interest of management to focus on retention strategies that build loyalty and commitment rather than creating a disposable workforce mentality.

From a broader perspective, the message that employees are easily replaceable can damage a company's reputation. Word-of-mouth travels fast, and a company known for treating its employees poorly will struggle to attract top talent. In today's job market, skilled professionals have the luxury of choice, and they are more likely to choose employers who value and respect their contributions.

It's also worth noting that companies themselves can be replaceable. Just as employees can find new job opportunities, clients and customers can turn to competitors if they perceive that a company lacks stability or treats its workforce unfairly. A business that fails to appreciate its employees' value risks losing its competitive edge and, ultimately, its market position.

To avoid these pitfalls, management should adopt a more supportive and appreciative approach. This includes providing constructive feedback, recognizing achievements, and fostering an inclusive and collaborative work environment. When employees feel valued and respected, they are more likely to be engaged, loyal, and motivated to contribute to the company's success.

Telling employees that they are easily replaceable is not only disrespectful but also detrimental to the overall health of the organization. By recognizing the importance of each team member and fostering a culture of respect and appreciation, companies can build a more committed and productive workforce. This approach not only enhances employee satisfaction but also strengthens the company's reputation and market position, ensuring long-term success and stability. Remember, in the end, a company's greatest asset is its people. Treat them well, and they will help the business thrive.

I like the people, the atmosphere, the subject matter, etc. However, after 3 years, I’m bored. I’ve taken initiative and literally begged for more responsibilities. I get some here and there and am told from my higher ups that I could do so much more it I was “certified” and even move up a level but “there isn’t room right now.” At my level certification isn’t necessary; some of us are certified and some of us aren’t. Really the only difference is a couple bucks an hour. I’ve looked into the certification process and I’m willing to do it and spend the money to achieve it. But I want to make sure that the investment is going to be worth it. I want the assurance that if I go through the process of certification I am going to get more responsibilities and move up to the next level. I don’t want to spend $30,000 to just be doing the same thing I am now for virtually no more money.

To make this more confusing, I was reached out to by someone in an adjacent field (where certification isn’t necessary at any level) about a job opening. The interview went great and they are currently working with HR to put together an offer. This new job is great and has some many perks that my current job doesn’t have but I still think I would rather stay at my current job if I were given the responsibility I crave.

I don’t have any more PTO and they won’t let me take any more days off even though they let other people. They personally are trying to push me out because of a few HR issues that I had to bring up that weren’t kept confidential. 

Problem is that the job is so draining I don’t even have the energy to update my resume let alone look for jobs. I live in Los Angeles for context. Every single person I know who is unemployed has been looking for jobs for months and hasn’t been able to find anything, so it’s a scary prospect. But I just don’t even know if I’m going to make it through the end of the year mentally, even seeing my therapist. 

Every day my opinion changes on quitting based on miserable events that happen at work. I work in a warehouse basically doing inventory and online orders and they are forcing me to be a security guard for most of the day now and added that to my job duties after firing security to cut costs. I mentioned to them that I’m being harassed by scary men (the store is in a bad area and I’m a small woman) and asked if I could compromise and be security during the day instead of night, but they said no. They then told me they are on a hiring freeze and gleefully told me that they’re going to add a lot more work to my plate for holiday season. I can’t go to HR, trust me on that.

1gnh65w,"Need Advice: Stuck in a Toxic Job with a Huge Sign-On Bonus Debt, But I Just Got My Dream Job Offer","Hey Reddit, I really need some advice on a tough situation I’m in. I currently work as an engineering tech in underground mining and am dealing with a very toxic and unsafe work environment. It’s mentally and emotionally draining. My boss gaslights me and constantly hints that I’ll stay stagnant in this role, and I’ve been subjected to some really hurtful treatment. People at work call me fat and refer to me as a boy, even though I’m a girl. It’s spiraling into severe stress, affecting my mental health and my relationship at home. I even find myself lashing out because I’m so unhappy.

To make matters worse, I accepted a sign-on bonus between $7,500 to $15,000, which I’d have to pay back if I leave within the first year. I’ve only been there for about three months. The idea of owing this money is overwhelming, but I recently received a job offer for a position I’ve always dreamed of. This new role comes with relocation support, amazing benefits, a strong development plan, a company pension, and a yearly bonus of thirty-five percent. It’s everything I want, and the work environment seems healthy and supportive. Plus, I’d get to move to a place I’ve always dreamed of living.

The catch is that I’d have to leave my current job before paying back the sign-on bonus. I’m unsure if I can negotiate a payment plan or if quitting now is the right thing to do. I’ve accepted the new job offer and start December ninth, but I’m stressing over the financial impact and what to do next.

1gng41c,Lower pay with stability or higher pay with risk,"Seeking some advice please. I don’t consider myself a risk taker so making life-changing decisions can be challenging at times. 


The gist is I have two potential opportunities to decide from and I’m not sure what to do. Details below.

Position A
Been in this job for a few years, took on a ton of roles outside my scope and excelled at them. A month ago I asked my manager to consider a raise to my comp above the usual annual bump. And I also mentioned that I want to be considered for promotion for the next cycle set for next Spring. They acknowledge my ask but said nothing can be decided at the time because everything runs on a cycle at the current company.

Pros
•stability
•office culture: I’ve built strong relationships here
•hybrid model: 1-2 days in office
•I manage a team
•I have a say in the hiring process for certain positions
•Health Benefits, 401k matching, etc

Cons
•High stress and lots of “fire-drills” 
•Demanding based on client
•Pay feels low for what I do
•No guarantee in promotion yet 
•No guarantee on whether they will match my ask for comp 
•Currently feels like I’m asked to do more for another year without my comp and title being fairly adjusted 


Position B
Recruiter is trying to poach me. Comp is attractive and is above what I’m asking from my current company.

Pros
•comp offered is 50% more than my current role 
•health benefits and more but not entirely sure on 401k matching yet
•potentially less stress in terms of type of work

Cons
•fully onsite 5x a day
•more start up feel because it’s a company experiencing hyper-growth
•more heavy lifting in terms of administrative work like planning events 
•no team to manage locally because team is much smaller and they don’t need it 
•if I accept this role I would abandon my current team and I think that makes me feel guilty - I just started to manage them a few months ago after our previous manager left 
•it’s a new company so who knows what will happen in a few years

The truth is if I had kids I would stay at my current job because it’s comfortable and stable. But I’m thinking that if I want to take a risk I am at a place in my life where I don’t have kids so risk is also not necessarily the worse thing. 

Can’t deny hybrid model is a luxury but also can’t deny double the comp is attractive. Stay where I am and do the right thing to support my team or selfishly leave and make more money. Not sure what to do…",Actual-Blacksmith-76,1,1.0,0,1731175840,2024-11-09 18:10:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gng41c/lower_pay_with_stability_or_higher_pay_with_risk/,11,2024
1gnfzkr,How do I ask my boss for the hours I was told I could work?,"So, started a new job on Tuesday this week. Nothing glamourous, just making poke bowls at a place that friend helped me get a job, but it pays better than my last job and the environment is better. At the time of my interview and when I was first hired, I was told that I'd be able to work full-time each week so long as 1) I had the availability for it, and 2) was willing to work multiple locations. No issues with either of those, the only times I can't work are Saturdays and Sunday afternoons. Still leaves 5.5 days open for a 40 work week. 

  
However, I've just been informed by the same owner that hired me that no, I won't be getting 40 hours a week as promised as they've elected to hire more people and they need to be able to schedule them for training as well. Mind you, we could use more people at the main location on top of what we've already got, and where I can work mornings as a college grad, the new hires are high schoolers that can only work evenings. Shouldn't be any issues there, I'm fine doing morning-afternoon shifts. 

  
Any way I can ask/insist upon the 40 hours? It's not even for medical benefits or anything, it's just a requirement for my current housing situation that I be able to prove that I'm working full-time each week.",Mean_Calendar4289,1,1.0,7,1731175508,2024-11-09 18:05:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gnfzkr/how_do_i_ask_my_boss_for_the_hours_i_was_told_i/,11,2024
1gnf8dc,Would you switch from a work-from-home job to a similar-salary hybrid role (3 days in office) solely because you feel stuck and undervalued as a professional?,"I'm facing a tough decision. Over time, my current job has become a place where my boss has gradually overshadowed me. I was informally demoted and am now left out of many meetings and projects. Although my boss seems satisfied with my work, and I sense no immediate risk of being let go, I’m struggling with the workplace politics that I haven’t adapted to—things like asserting my presence in meetings and navigating office dynamics. I’m a foreign worker in the U.S. 

While the work-from-home setup allows me to take care of my house and kids, and the salary is good, my mental health has taken a hit. I feel undervalued and isolated, with zero social interaction due to working remotely and living in a quiet suburb.

1gndzt3,"Despite tons of support, didn't get promoted. Perspective check?","I'll try to give as much context as I can without doxxing myself. 

  
In my mid-30s, at the company for over 3 years, 8 YOE in my current field. Megacap tech company (not one of THOSE), SG&A function (think: accounting, legal, finance, etc.). Currently in a director-level role on a small team supporting work that is vital to the execution of our long term strategic vision (and I mean that - CEO mentions our work during earnings calls, investor days, etc). 

  
This cycle, I was put up for promotion and both my boss and my group head were pretty optimistic. They have my back, are incredibly supportive, and definitely wanted me to get a promotion as they feel I am outperforming both my title and years of experience. I also had the support of senior management for the groups I work with. All in all, I had support and very positive reviews from five or six senior vice presidents and vice presidents (which are either 1 or 2 steps from C-level).

  
The C-level in charge of my department said no. My big boss fought for it, said he truly believes I'm one of the few ""young"" people in the department that he could see having a senior leadership role in the future and I should be both rewarded and incentivized to stay, still told no. 

The reasoning was that we're in a tight capex environment and there were a lot of people put up for promotion with more years in role than me. To me, that translates to ""you aren't deserving, but the other people are"", but maybe I am taking that too personally. The issue is the C-level is an incredible micromanager. They started around the time I did and, for a group our size, seems to get involved in things that should be below their pay grade. I have heard they have asked managers to change review ratings (upward or downward) for certain people, purely based on whether the C-level likes them or not. Same with promotions - doesn't matter what anyone says, the decision is purely made by them, and feedback/input doesn't seem to matter.

The band-aid I was given was a bigger bonus.

This is my first corporate job, and therefore the first promotion cycle I've ever been part of. Prior to this, advancement was purely YOE - each year you got paid more and took on more responsibility, basically automatically. So, I don't really know what to think.

To me, if your boss is advocating for your, if \*their\* boss is advocating for you, and senior management is saying ""yup, this guy is good"", I find it a little baffling \*not\* to be promoted, I don't know what else I could have done or what other good factors I needed. 

And, more importantly, I now really doubt my future here - I am now stagnating in my role and career when my peers have moved upward. The problem is that my current title is a fairly ""normal"" one and can range from someone with 2 YOE to 10 YOE, so it won't do me any favors if I want to leave. 



But here's the rub: my team is fantastic, my direct and group management is amazing, my job isn't too stressful, WLB is good and my comp is really good. I am trying not to overreact - do I stay put for one year and see what happens next cycle? Or do I take the message that I will not advance, at least not quickly, and look elsewhere for a growth opportunity?",Testudo-Aubreii,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1731170169,2024-11-09 16:36:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gndzt3/despite_tons_of_support_didnt_get_promoted/,11,2024
1gndob8,HR to Sales: which of these paths is best?,"I've (28M) been in Human Resources for 6 years in Toronto (Canada), currently a Senior HR Manager at a reputable international company. For the past year, I've been considering a career change, leaning towards sales. I've always been an outgoing and social person, so much so that when people ask what I do for work, they're always surprised to hear I'm not in sales, saying I'd be really good at it. 

I'd consider one of my greatest strengths to be the ability to ask extremely high quality questions, which has proven useful both in professional HR, and in my personal life when showing genuine interest in new people.

My question: is it better for me to transition from HR to consulting first before going into sales? Or direct from HR into sales (which I imagine is harder)? Anyone here gone through a similar career change and how that went, or just advice on how to approach it?

I’m not sure what I can do with a bachelor of science though. I could do kinesiology, I don’t know if I’ll enjoy that but I could hypothetically work 4 day weeks and still be making a good living wage.

Do I choose a degree I will make money with or a degree I enjoy? I grew up without much money so it feels important to me to be able to live a middle class life.

Although I had received feedback on areas like critical thinking for IT auditing, I wasn’t placed on a formal Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) but was working to improve proactively. Being the only associate on a team with five managers made the role challenging, as I lacked peers for support. Leading meetings with managers and senior staff was uncomfortable for me, which I know affected my manager’s view of my independence and creativity. Now, with three months of severance pay and health insurance, I’m considering whether to continue in auditing or explore alternative career paths. Any advice?

1gna4jl,"Lost hope with my career, Don't know what to do now.","I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science in 2017 and initially aimed to start my own business. I spent about a year working on a startup idea I found online, but self-doubt held me back. By 2018, worried about finding a job, I took on an internship as a Python web developer, but I struggled and decided to leave after three months. I then dedicated almost a year to learning web development through various online courses.

In March 2020, I landed my first job at a small company with a 25k salary. It was a basic setup—just three of us working there, mainly learning from YouTube tutorials. After about six months, they started asking us to do forex trading on OlympTrade, where I faced constant losses and frustration. After 1.6 years, I decided to focus on coding again and joined a reputed institute’s full-stack web development course, completing it in 2022. Thanks to that course, I secured a job as a Frontend Software Engineer with a 65k salary.

However, my new role required me to learn Ember.js, which was challenging, especially since my training had focused on React.js. With a lot of help from my seniors, I managed to get by, but it was a struggle. After a year, the company let me go due to cost-cutting in March 2023.

After a five-month gap, I joined another startup without an interview, but my manager was unhappy with my speed and constantly questioned my fit for the role. Feeling defeated, I left coding behind in October 2023 and started exploring non-coding jobs. For three months, I tried stock trading but faced more losses. I also completed a DevOps course by May 2024, but I couldn’t crack any interviews. They required DevOps experience not willing to hire a person who is new to the role as fresher, gave interview for software tester role as well couldn't crack even the first round interview.

Now, I'm in a tough spot—unable to secure a job, and my previous 8.75 LPA salary makes it difficult to pivot to non-coding roles, as companies either won’t downgrade my salary or they suggest me that I look for similar-paying roles.

However, the main challenge I'm facing is my location. In my country, most FAANG companies operate as **go-to-market hubs** for the APAC region, focusing almost exclusively on sales, CSM, and solutions architecture roles (e.g. ChatGPT and Figma were only hiring Sales and CSM roles). While there are some PM opportunities, they're mainly in fintech and e-commerce – sectors I'm not particularly passionate about. Looking ahead, I don't see major tech companies moving their development operations here anytime soon.

The past year has been quite challenging. I've thrown myself into hackathons, networked extensively with PMs, and submitted 300+ applicationss, but I'm starting to feel stuck without any progress. I know there are plenty of opportunities to grow in my current GTM path, but my heart is set on product management.

I'm at a crossroads and would love some advice. 

* Should I stay in my CSM role and work toward a more strategic position where I can influence product decisions in the future?
* I'm also considering an MBA in the US to pivot into PM roles there.

[On remote] Me and my manager have been planning to send an e-mail to the director asking her for the all-set-to-go for a project idea. I drafted an e-mail and shared It privately with my manager. He said that the body of text of the e-mail draft was fine and that I could [theorically?] send it, but that I had to take into account that he wouldn't be able to fully read the most recent changes I applied to the document I meant to attach until the following week. I thought this meant I could send the email with the attachment immediately and that he relied on me on the goodness of the changes I applied to the document, so I waited and aboundant 20 Mins and sent it.

After some time I sent the email, my manager rushes into the exchange explaining to the director certain clarifications about the document that I wasn't aware of: they didn't involve the changes I applied but certain features that needed to be changed and that I was never made aware of. The director replied cheerly and gave the all-set-to-go.

My manager has explained to me, in private, that the clarifications he has provided need to be included in all the emails I have to send to other people regarding this project and its attachment. I've drafted them too including what he said, sent the draft to him like the last time but didn't get a reply. I waited two more weeks: nothing.

I started as an officer and now an AVP with 6 team members reporting to me. It's been 8 plus years in my current position.

While I do enjoy the company of the people I work with, the work itself does not interest me anymore or slowly loosing interest I would say. 

I have my hands on a few areas in my current postion -  business continuity, risk management, ad hoc data reporting and of course the static data functions (maintaining static data in core banking systems). 

I have narrowed down two options to explore further 1. get self employed by furthering my photography hobby into a business - this is not without it's risks of course, as its not steady income and takes time to build a client portfolio. Of course with hard work, it pays off  2. take up Risk management as a career path which i have realized i want to learn more about and to transition ill have to start from scratch.

I have been on long term sick and he started emailing me with positivity, I emailed him back and back and forth a couple of times. Now it's been 2 weeks he hasn't replied to my last couple of emails. (1 being sent to my actual supervisor with a update) Also no response...
Confused because he started the emailing then stopped....
I was open with him but I don't think I said anything inappropriate or overstepping...
Did he not reply because he doesn't want to get feelings? 
Has anyone had this experience 
Probably sounds weird but I fell hard for him and he knows this Iv made it obvious that I like him and he has made it obvious he likes me but we stay professional.
Am I being stupid? 
Was he just busy? 
But why start the emails then stop?
Update....
I'm seeing him Monday at work.
How do I act?
Do I ingored him? 
Will he even realize he didn't reply?
Do I act like nothing happened?
Do I wait for him to chase me (how I dunno).
Do I bring it up with him? 
I'm confused and need advice?
Anyone fell for someone below them ?

1gn4v41,Missed 2 meetings in the first two weeks & got fired ,"I missed two internal catch up calls and was 5mins late to another one due to a medical emergency. Didn’t send a message beforehand bc it was an emergency. This was the first two weeks of work. 

It was still during the onboarding process and another excuse they gave was that I needed to better integrate Google shared services as the role is remote. I did, but as any new employee, I needed to learn where all the documents were so I asked frequent questions. 

Whenever I made “mistakes” by asking questions that I didn’t know, I felt shamed for not knowing even though I just started. Any and all mishaps were spotlighting in company group chat. This made me not want to ask more questions than even though I’m only at the onboarding and new hire process. 

I like the company and the role, but one particular person who is my oversaw my onboarding, is super toxic and hyper critical. Thoughts?

Usually it takes one month of training to learn everyone as I have experienced in all my previous roles and mistakes are bound to happen as I’m learning and new to the processes.

1gn49mv,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi I’m a 35 y/o male based in a mid sized Australian city. Work in marketing.

I’m currently employed part time (4 days per week) in a small agency. I make $80k + super. I also have a profit share that fluctuates but currently averages less than $10k per year.

I love the role and the team and count the director as a friend. They are accommodating to me and see me as a key to their business. Although the business is small they are genuinely enthusiastic about the future of the business with me in it, and have built a strategy going forward around my experience and skill set.

I have recently bought a house and had a child, so feel a need to grow my earnings.

I have had an offer at a bigger interstate agency, full time, WFH with interstate travel required every few months. $130-$150k plus super. This is good money for my profession, but less time with family etc. This role would provide more obvious opportunity for career growth, which I’m excited about. 

Being privvy to profit share at my current role, I don’t think asking them to match it’s feasible. 

On one hand, the new role is a financial no-brainer, and will provide a better financial base for my family. On the other I feel a sense of loyalty to the team at the existing role. I’m seriously dreading having to have the conversation with them.

1gn3xpx,[Canada] Seems like junior jobs are running dry in Software Engineering. Can I transition into Product management with a few courses ?,"**Background**: I have been looking for jobs with 2 YOE only, and the market seems to be only for Seniors 8+YOE or Interm. 5+ YOE now. I have been applying and upskilling since May with no end in sight. I also have been getting less interviews and callbacks since last year summer when I was looking for a job. [My previous post here for some background detail](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/1g6pqlq/i_only_have_2_yoe_in_mixed_fields_and_finding_a/). 

In the first 4 months, I relied on Linkedin and Indeed Jobs but only got 1 phone screen (no, I don't fully depend on Easy Apply since thousands do it and competition is massive). Then I decided to cut the middle man out. I went to glassdoor, filtered companies by location, job title and rating and went directly to their website and their career pages to apply. It was here that I noticed some jobs before that would otherwise never have popped up on my Linkedin jobs because of my filters. At first, things like ""Software sales"" and ""Business Analyst"" were things that I have heard of before but then ""Product Manager"" started showing up and a lot of companies - big or startup - seem to have it a lot more than engineering positions - and I noticed that they don't particularly say anything about having Seniority, unlike Software positions.

**My Question**: Can I, with 2 YOE, pivot easily into Product management ? 

I asked ChatGPT, and basically the barrier to entry seems to be low because it doesn't recommend anything more than just a few courses on edx or coursera with certifications and maybe, not definitely, an MBA.",wompr,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1731133528,2024-11-09 06:25:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gn3xpx/canada_seems_like_junior_jobs_are_running_dry_in/,11,2024

long story short for most ppl in the U.S apparently the tech sector is destroyed and would never recover from severe outsourcing at least anytime soon and I'm not planning and keep on waiting until I get the axe so I wanna move fast.

To give you some context I'm 29 and work as a QA engineer and the issue is with the current unstability is just outrageous and nobody can deal with it , salaries are low and even if you get another job after a layoff you'll get laid off again within 5 months so what's the point.

I tried applying to trades apprenticeships but oh bit they won't take you without any experience and the last conclusion was the the state where I live is literally dead and there's no hope with trades here.

I was thinking something medical but 8 years of med school and a pile of debt is not worth it so idk at this point a friend suggested radiology like he said it would only take like 2 years and you can make 100k with a stable job.

So what are you guys who worked in tech pivoting into ?

1gn331j,My manager is against applying for new position..,"A new manager stepped in about 3 yrs ago and has created a bit of noise (wanting to revamp teams and departments) Well, one of her newer projects has been officially been picked up and made permanent. 

This week she sent a meeting to everyone in my current position just to give a brief description and to give us the opportunity to meet and interview if we were interested in joining her team before anyone else in the company or externally would be able to. Our managers had no notice of the meeting and have since been furious (basically claiming shes poaching).

All the managers and their supervisors have agreed to “take a stance” and show no interest due to her approach and also that they truly don’t agree with the department she’s forming as it’s basically the job “we’re” (me) is doing now. They also have a theory she’s trying to eliminate our (my) role. If she can “steal” us, our managers lose their budget to replace us and would create a larger workload for them. 

The upside, it’s exactly what I’m doing now but more self focused and will expose me to more departments within our company. Also includes a significant raise and up my “rank” with the company.  

The downside, going against my current managers and colleagues, losing my title and freedom with my schedule. I’d also be subject to performance metrics and quality as I’d be taking on a more front facing role.

I’m very happy (and I will admit, comfortable) in my role, but can’t help to think of the opportunity ($$) I could be missing out on for a few sacrifices.

1gn2j49,The hiring manager cold-called me and gave me a pre-interview. Is this normal?,"I am looking for my first career after college. I have only really worked in a restaurant, so I don't have any experience with how hiring goes and what to expect. I have applied for several jobs but have never made it to the interview. 

I received a call around 3 a week after submitting my application. When the hiring manager called, he was like, ""I just wanted to call and ask you a few questions."" So I said okay and sat down to answer the questions. He told me about himself, and the job, gave me a lotttt of information, and included some things that were not listed in the job description (which was fine because I was interested in the things he was adding, and he told me there would be a lot of training which is also fine). 

My response to all this information he gave me was ""Okay."" because honestly, I didn't know what to say and wasn't prepared for that. He said, ""You're saying okay, and I just gave you a lot of information..."" so then I responded a little more about what he said and referenced my experience and goals, but I really was not prepared to do what felt like a vague interview. He also asked me about specific things that I had listed on my resume which is what made it feel like an interview. 

We also talked about my schedule and when I would be available for an in-person interview, and he asked me to send more material so that he could look it over. But he kept saying, ""When we do the interview,"" which made me think I am definitely getting an interview?

I've never experienced anything like this before and I am nervous about what this could mean. Is it common for a hiring manager to cold-call for a pre-interview?

1gn2bwu,Is it wrong to put a 4 months job experience in my resume?,"So in my latest job experience I worked as a Interior Draftsman at one of the BPO here in the Philippines, technically I was outsourced to do job of others in other countries.  and  so my client is an Australian based construction firm.

I started working with my client in Austrailia, during the  last week of March, this year, and all seems fine within the first 3 months working here, doing my job without any problem.  
  
Until the 4th month came, July to be precise, and I started noticing some red flag with the company that I'm working with, since they lack the knowledge when it comes to innovations in modern design trend and even their marketing strategy is none existant , I'm not even surprised since the higher ups, especially the managers are too old that they don't even know how to operate a computer.

So this resulted with the company struggling to find new clients since they can have new projects with.   
And so they hired a new Senior Interior designer, to take the lead.

Now that our Drafting department has a new member, now we consist of 2 senior designers , one is my old team leader and the new hire one, and 2 draftsman, which includes me.  
  
All is good now, or so I thought would be.

As days gone by my life working here became hell, whenever we have new projects 2 of our senior designers  always start arguing with one another, pretty much like a gen z vs boomer thing. so at first I tried to be neutral as much as possible, but being caught up between them had made me confused on which one to follow, which in turn made our productivity low and there are constant delay with our projects.

Seeing this kind of progress my guts tells me things are about to ge worse from now on.

And to make it short my old team leader finally decided to quit,  and was replaced with the new hired one, now she began a powerplay with us remaining draftsman, doing some micromanaging and giving us impossible task with unrealistic deadlines that whenever we can't meet her expectation, she would immediately report us to the managers.

At first I tolerated this until I finally snapped and confronted her and asked her "" to be realistic with her approach and having a little bit of consideration wouldn't hurt, it's not like I can read her mind all the time"".  
  
And this probably hurt her ego so much and finally decided to ask the managers to disengaged my contract with the company, which just happened few days after this incident. Finally good riddance this is the most toxic company I've ever worked with.

And so after that,  now that I'm jobless and still currently looking fo a new job, whenever I have an interview they always pointed out what's the reason why only lasted 4 months with my latest job experience, sometimes I just tell the employer the thruth, but sometimes I lied with the other employers and reason out that my previous client can no longer afford to the do outsourcing with me  just to get that position I'm applying.

Now I suspect that this 4 months job experience which I included in my resume is the reason why I haven't secured any job offer up to this day.",Hanigama_sama,1,1.0,0,1731127426,2024-11-09 04:43:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gn2bwu/is_it_wrong_to_put_a_4_months_job_experience_in/,11,2024
1gn2bbd,Am I Cooked After My BCG Round 2 Interview?,"Hey everyone, I (M21) just had my second-round interview with BCG for the Data and Research Services team, and I'm wondering if I'm cooked or not.

Here’s what went down: I did well on the market sizing question—the interviewer even said ""well done,"" which felt great. However, things took a turn when he started grilling me on finance fundamentals. I wasn’t prepared to discuss corporate finance in depth (ironic, given that I'm a finance major). I couldn’t recall the formula for enterprise value or valuation multiples like EV/EBITDA. I also struggled with navigating the different sections of the cash flow statement.

I vaguely remembered that enterprise value involved market cap, but that’s as far as I got. This threw me off because I had only really covered these finance basics in my first year, and given my double major, I hadn't revisited them in detail since. I expected more questions around structuring or market sizing (similar to round 1), which are typically BCG priorities, so this caught me off guard. The behavioural side of things went well imo. 

I’d appreciate any insights from people who’ve gone through similar experiences with BCG or other consulting firms.

There's, just, no positions publicly open at my level and in my field - it's like people stay in these positions until they retire. I'm good at my job, but I don't really meet new people in my work that have much sway so I've never really made professional connections organically. 

Is there a special way you do it when you're at the Sr. level? I feel like so much of the networking advice I see doesn't apply. Is there a helpful resource for people at more sr. levels in how to navigate this? It just feels like I have none of the leverage I thought I'd have.

1gmy452,Horrible feedback from manager - advice on how to proceed?,"I recently got feedback from my manager saying that I 
1. Constantly need my hand held
2. Lack critical thinking 
3. Am a poor communicator 

For reference I’m a junior level employee at my job and given that my role is project based, I’m constantly being placed on projects where I’m forced to work with new people, learn new tools, and work on new things. Long story short, it’s never the same work that can be applied over and over again. 

So, getting this feedback from my manager really hurt me because I wasn’t expecting it and thought that I would be cut some slack given the nature of my job. 

I asked for examples of how I’m doing poorly and my manager gave me examples that I didn’t think were fair. 
1. My manager thinks I need my hand held because I’m constantly asking questions on the work that I need to get done. In my defense, the instructions are really vague and a lot of the work that I’m tasked with is very new to me so I resort to asking questions to ensure I’m on the right track. 

2. My manager thinks I lack critical thinking skills. I think my manager ties this in with always needing my hand held and again, I don’t think it’s fair. 

3. My manager thinks I have poor communication skills. I believe I am very communicative at work and always make an effort to schedule meetings and sessions with folks when needed. My manager gave me one small example of me being a poor communicator when I did not communicate the status of a task to another coworker by EOD. It was a minimal thing that didn’t mean anything but was still used against me by my manager. 

4. My manager thinks it takes me too long to complete tasks. In my defense, I am a quick worker when need be but will not race to finish something if a due date/time is not communicated to me, if I have other priorities, or if the due date/time provided is open/lenient. 

Anyway, my manager’s comments completely destroyed my self confidence and positive attitude towards my job and honestly, I dread logging on every morning.

Any suggestions on what I can do to overcome this situation? I feel so bad about myself. ",SalaryFlat4293,2,1.0,8,1731113732,2024-11-09 00:55:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gmy452/horrible_feedback_from_manager_advice_on_how_to/,11,2024
1gmy36g,The idea of quitting is stressing me out-help?,"I've been working at the same small business for a year and 8 months now. In the beginning, it was good and I didn't have any complaints. It's a pretty small team, so there's only 2-3 employees on average (+ the boss). I just feel like there's a high turnover with the company? I've worked with 4 different people since I've been here and all 4 left at different times, to the point where I was the only employee working for a good month. My friends and family say my boss is taking advantage of me, and at first I didn't see it but I think I do now? Is it normal to feel anxious about asking for time off? This year alone I can count on one hand the times I haven't been to work, and that was for my birthday or if I was sick. I'm also a college student and even though my boss knows my class schedule, sometimes she'll assign me a workday at the same time as my classes and I have to remind her I can't work those days.

  
I got sick two weeks ago and had to call out as my illness and cough got worse. I felt horrible and my asthma can get really bad if I overexert myself. I texted my boss ahead of time (5 hours before my starting time, 8 in the morning) and told her I didn't think I could make it in. She texted back asking if the cough was ""wet or dry"", and to look at the health policy to see if I could come in anyway. I didn't know that was a thing to be honest (she typed out the store's health policy and made us sign it maybe a week ago, and when I looked again I never saw any mention of a cough? It was mainly food-borne illnesses). I went back to sleep immediately after I texted her though (so I didn't see her message in time, which I think might have been a mistake), so when I woke up later and responded about the cough she told me she was going to write me up. Weeks have passed and this never happened, so now I think she may have said that to scare me?

It just kind of hurt. Idk, I understand there's only 2 employees rn but I didn't think it would have been a smart move to go to work that sick. There's other instances that have happened; I'm just not happy working here anymore, and I don't get paid enough. I want to quit but I would feel guilty because we're extremely busy, and we're in the process of moving to another location. How can I feel less upset about the idea?

1gmy0tw,"My new temp colleague never stops talking, and is inappropriate with no boundaries. How should I discuss this with my bosses?","This woman started two weeks ago. She never stops talking about personal/trival stuff. My boss and I noticed the first day. I have no idea if her boss has a problem with it, but she's clearly still here. This is a serious office supporting a very important person and I'm amazed the recruiter sent us this woman. 

She complimented something on my desk this week, saying ""I'm flirting with you...not flirting but like you know, when guys are trying to pick up girls.""

I just blankly stared at her the whole time.

On Wednesday she saw me walking to the bus to go to work when she was walking her dog. Have no idea if this is a coincidence, but she'd previously said she saw me on the bus and that we must live close to one another. Later that day she asked me if I wanted to take an uber to work with her and split the cost when she's running late. I just smiled and said I don't use uber (technically, I don't!), but thanks!

I overheard her telling someone else she was having problems getting to work on time because she walks her dog and people keep stopping her to talk about her dog in the morning, so she takes an uber to get in on time. Granted, both of us don't live more than a mile from work, she's always at her desk before me each morning, and I get there at 8:55AM. Which means she thinks the solution to her terrible time management is having me help her save her money instead of...getting up 10 minutes earlier.

And then today, she was late to an important Zoom meeting. Last week I'd helped show her how to troubleshoot pairing her bluetooth headphones. But several minutes after the meeting started, the meeting was blaring loudly on her computer. I waited for a few minutes to figure out her headphones, and then got up to go to the conference room so I didn't have to hear the talking from both my headphones and her computer.

She stops to ask me to help her with her headphones again. I tell her I can't because of the meeting but to google the instruction manual for the model, that's how I figured it out. I can tell she's going to make a fuss over this, so I emailed her the link to the manual so she can figure it out. 

She replies to me that she's so sorry she's disruptive and she hopes I can engage in ""open communication"" with her. I was going to type up a reply, but ended up saying it to her in person after the meeting instead because her boss wanted to talk to us both about the meeting.

She repeated the ""open communication"". 

I said to her: ""You joined the meeting a few minutes late so I couldn't help you. That's why I sent you the instruction manual."" \[Also, I left for the conference room so she could continue listening from the computer: she was the only person out there and it was the perfect solution to this problem.\]

Her, teenage snotty tone: ""Well I was \*late\* because Carrie asked me to do something before her!""

I start walking away because clearly she just wants to escalate conflict. 

Me: ""Okay, but you could have asked tech. It's probably not a good idea to depend on me for tech problems.""

Her, same teenager snotty tone: ""And \*that\* would have taken longer than having you help me.""

I'm still walking away and getting really frustrated, so I just don't say anything. I hear say ""yeah \*bye\*"" sarcastically lol.

  
I have a chat with my boss, who chats with her boss, and we're both having separate meetings on Monday with them.

  
I intend to tell them what I just said above, with the closer that she lacks responsibility and judgment, and is trying to make her problems my problems, or to solve her personal problems without her having to do the work herself. And that her desire to be friends with me and have ""open communication"", especially after her reaction to me being open with her today, is really just wanting to get her way, wanting to be dependent on me in an unhealthy way, and I believe it will get worse the longer it goes on. 

If you think this is not the correct approach or think it can be better, I'd love your feedback!

I have a history of depression and anxiety in particular to do with with work. I used to work in a high paced sales environment where the results would generally dictate my mood and mental health. Then about 3 years ago I got a job at a not for profit organisation that pays about 95k a year pre tax it is very easy, dosnt challenge me at all and zero stress.

As the Yeats have passed I thought my anxiety issues have subsided and was approached to apply for a similar role but for a private organisation that's alot more sales focused I got the job its 95k pre tax but with realistic commissions of an extra 20-50k
There's more expecting and some evening work if clients want to meet then.

I have been having massive panic attacks about leaving my stress free comfort zone.

I need the extra money because everything is so expensive now and even with a dual Income me and my wife are just keeping our heads above water.

1gmwngy,I am “Donna” and it’s freaking me out,"First of all, sorry to those who haven't seen Suits, but the reference just fits. Also sorry for any mistakes, English is my 2nd language.

I (F30) have a boss (M50) with whom I practically developed an (un)professional relationship, like the one Donna & Harvey had. There are multiple scenes where they finish each other's sentences...where she says to Harvey: ""I am the person you call at 6 in the morning..."" To my boss, I am. We have been working in basically the same set-up as H&D, just the two of us on a team, for the last 4 years. Multiple references have been made by mutual colleagues that we ""act like an old married couple"". I laughed, shrugged it off. We are very much alike, with similar personalities, values, work ethic and sense of humour, so I attributed it just to a sort of good mental connection. Then a couple weeks ago, he made an offhand comment about how he sees me now not only as a colleague, but as a friend. And it's downhill from there...

After a recent business trip, where he made multiple references to how alike I am to his wife, I revisited our most recent interactions and oh boy, am I creeped out. Over the last year of so, he's made jokes about us being married, references to ""if I were his wife, he would..."" or ""if we were married, we would..."" (but nothing sexual, ever). But then, he's also said he sees me as his daughter. There were jokes made about us kissing or a random example made by him, he was explaining something and making a metaphor: ""it's as if I said (my name) and (his name) are in love..."". He constantly badmouths his wife to me, even though I refuse to engage and even though I expressed that I disapprove of him telling me that and find it highly inappropriate as I do meet her at a few events.

He's a flirt to some other women, too, but not to this extent. For context, we are in Europe, but feel free to use US standards and berate me, because I deserve it. I am tired of constantly having to be the ONLY ONE in this relationship to enforce professional boundaries when he repeatedly slides into friend/flirt territory.

- Current salary: ~$80K
- Guaranteed pay increase to ~100k in one year and ~120k in two years.
- Less than 40 hour work week
- 1 day telework per week 
- Low stress job that I excel at, but am not passionate about 

Job B
- Will match my current salary with possibility of same pay increases as Job A each year, but not guaranteed. I’ve been told pay increases are difficult to obtain. 
- Slightly longer work weeks 
- 2 days telework per week
- Long term, I want to be in this field of work. 

I’m not sure what to do because although job B is my passion, it feels stupid to give up the guarantee of a $40k pay increase in 2 years. However, I’m not passionate about Job A and don’t see myself staying in this field of work long term.

1gmuxx6,How do I survive a Factory Acceptance Test for a very chaotic software project?,"Note: I'm not very practical with Reddit, I had no idea where to post this so sorry in advance if this is not the right place but I hope it is...

Little background on my situation: I've been a software test engineer for about a year now, no previous experience whatsoever or proper training, they just threw me in the job and basically all I know about processes I've learnt all by myself. It was good the first three months of employment until my boss decided to toss me in this project which is driving me absolutely insane because saying it's a mess is too reductive. Let's start from the beginning:

1. Requirements: there are like 1000 requirements, and I had to test them all one by one. They are probably the biggest problem because they are very poorly written if not completely nonsense, the requirement department had to change THREE PEOPLE within 10 months which the last one left 3 months ago out of desperation (I wonder why?), and if that was not enough, the customer kept changing them until last minute, adding random stuff because why not. Neither me and devs managed to properly track everything so you can imagine the state of that part.
2. Due to bad requirements, many things are yet not done/not implemented because devs don't even know what to do, and I don't even know how to even test those things.
3. The customer wanted ALL tests to be ready and fully functional 2 months ago, all of that while requirements were still changing and stuff was not even remotely close to be implemented or even properly testable. Yep, you heard that right.
4. Of course, my tests are a mess too (half of them are failed or not even compliant because they are missing proper procedures) and I don't have the time and resources anymore to fix them. I was forced by my boss to lie BADLY to the customer for the TRR saying that just a few minor test have failed and I am afraid they will notice, if they did not already...
5. The official FAT is at the end of the month.

I've passed the worst last two months of my life, I'm just sick and tired, I can't sleep, my anxiety is back at max level, and the fact that I'm completely alone in the team doing testing is even worse. Oh right, I also might have undiagnosed autism because ""my parents don't believe me"". I tried to tell my boss I can't keep up this way, I understand he understood the situation is chaotic but telling me ""Just relax"" is not really helping.

So yeah, I'm cooked. My boss says ""it's normal"" to feel a bit down during FAT but I don't think that having panic attacks every day while going to work, forget about everything I do, or even being afraid when having a call is considered that much ""normal"". How can I survive this hellhole, possibly without quitting despite I'm very tempted to?",TrainMaster844,1,1.0,0,1731104811,2024-11-08 22:26:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gmuxx6/how_do_i_survive_a_factory_acceptance_test_for_a/,11,2024

1gmu6pi,Should I take this seasonal job and quit my permanent job (student),"So I’ve been working as a busser for around 2 years now at this restaurant and I’ve been applying everywhere to find a new job. 

I landed on this seasonal job at Lids and quite frankly I’m happy because it’s something in retail which I want to venture into. 

My concern is this: I can leave my job of 2 years for a job that I could work at for like 2 months and also build myself a reputation and have a likely chance to get hired more places 

Or I reject this job and continue searching till I find a job that isn’t seasonal. I am a high school student so it’s not a super super huge concern but still I want to know any suggestions.

1gmu544,I am stupid ,"Long story short I left my job 7 months ago, still unemployed and now have made it for the final stages of a job interview where they are asking for my referees/ references. Problem is, I told my last workplace I already had a job lined up (marketing firm) when I left because I didn’t wanna seem like a loser leaving without a job. I left because I hated it and there wasn’t much room for growth. I’ve reached out to one of the old managers on Linkedln explaining to her “oh I realised quickly marketing wasn’t for me so I left and now could I please ask you to reference me for this job in sales”. If she asks why don’t I get the marketing firm to reference me, I’ll say “oh the workplace culture was bad and it looks bad if I left a workplace only working there for 6 months”. What should I do? I have someone from my old teams number I could also reach out to and explain them the same situation (who I was close with). I only need one referee from my old workplace. I’m willing to stoop low and drop my pride here. Please help as I want to provide the recruiter with the referee asap.

For the 85k job, it is currently uncertain where I’d go, but they offer a great relocation package to get you there. Due to the 70k job being so close, it is hard to decline it.

1gmsr26,Bakery or remote customer service?,"Hello all,

I have been offered a PT bakery clerk position at a local Publix and I have been offered a FT remote customer service job. They both pay about the same and in the PT job I was told to expect FT hours. I'm not too worried abt benefits bc I am married and my husband has insurance. 

So background: former teacher, just exhausted by life and unemployed currently. Ultimately I am seeking a job with less intense responsibility ? and something with work life balance. 

I like baking pastries and cakes and would love to learn to be a cake decorator. At Publix, over time, I could train for that. Also, I held a few office jobs post teaching and cannot stand being tied to a computer all day. Plus, the remote job is customer service and I become easily exhausted in those roles. In the bakery there's def some CS involved but I don't think as intense. 

Howeverrr, I am a bit agoraphobic. I hate leaving my home, I have severe anxiety about driving, and just being in crowds. I know I used to be a teacher but my mental health is just not what it used to be. I'm not as resilient as I used to be, hence, looking for a new career. I also have needy, bad dogs (I know dumb excuse) but it would be easier on us for me to continue staying home. I also do the bulk of housework and cooking, so being home more will offer me time to do that on breaks. I also would hope to at some point advance into training or quality assurance with a remote role. 

Idk I got two paths ahead of me and I am stuck. Any suggestions? Maybe your opinion on which I should choose or what you would do in my position?",chubbyfoxxyy,1,1.0,0,1731099066,2024-11-08 20:51:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gmsr26/bakery_or_remote_customer_service/,11,2024

1gms91z,Old boss wants to hire me as a manager ,"Hey everyone, 

I graduated in may looking to pursue roles in marketing/communication fields specifically in gaming, tech, and agency work, and have been applying for quite a while. My old boss from my HS job reached out to about a manager position overseeing day to day operations and employee oversight for his dairy store (Basically it’s a drive in grocery store) that is known for its ice cream. 

My internship for my current role ends on the 15th and I have a colleague of mine setting me up with warm intros with some well known companies that align with my current work experience and what I want to pursue in the future. I currently live at home which I’m very grateful for, however my parents are somewhat pressuring me to take the manager position for my old boss, even though it may not be experience that is relevant for my resume.  

Wanted to see if anyone has any guidance on how I should proceed. Should I take a manager position for my old boss that I consider a good friend; and potentially leave right when I get a job offer (he has stated he is looking for someone long term)? I never had any intention of coming back as I don’t feel this is very relevant work experience, however it was a very laid back and fun job. OR should I wait to see if these warm intros lead to anything bigger and continue to apply for roles in the meantime? 

Any help / advice would be great

I currently make 120k and think I currently have the hours to take on this role.

I am thinking about offering to take on the role for potentially half the pay in addition to my current. The department is having trouble hiring someone and would need to hire a seconded employee (which would cost a lot more) to fill the gap. This would also save the company a lot of money in salary, benefits, and the hiring/on boarding procedure.

1gmrb3l,33M dropped out of medical school,"Posting for my brother as he doesn’t have Reddit.

My Brother(33m) about 2 years ago dropped out of a Caribbean medical school(yes we fell for the trap) due to mental health reasons and extreme test anxiety(although he’s a really good student he would get extreme anxiety and panic attacks as exams would come up). He ended up dropping out after not passing USMLE step 1 for the second time because he couldn’t take the mental strain anymore. 

Now it’s been 2 years and he’s doing much better mentally but he hasn’t worked or pursued any other fields or higher education. He has a bachelors in Biomedical engineering, but it’s been almost 10 years since he’s gotten his bachelors so he’s unsure if he should rejoin that field or not, or if he’d even be able to get a job in it considering his graduation date. He has been applying but as of right now he hasn’t even heard back for an interview yet. 


In the past he also pursued wedding photography and has been also considering restarting that, but it’s also been more than 7 years since he last shot a wedding so he feels he’ll be extremely behind the current competition in our area and he’s not sure how lucrative the market is for wedding photography. 

So I guess he would really appreciate some advice on what he should pursue. He had a a few options but he’s unsure if they’re even good ones.
1. He could keep looking for biomedical engineering jobs and hopefully eventually land a job and start his career there
2. He could go back to medical school, retake the USMLE and hopefully start clinical rotations after that. (It would be about 2 more years of school + min 3 years of residency.
3. He could go back to school and get a masters in either Physician assistant, Anesthesiology assistant, or any other related field(open to suggestions)
4. Pursue wedding photography again and restart his business
5. Any other field or career (open to suggestions) 

A few things to consider are:
1. He’s in a much better place mentally but he’s apprehensive about going back to medical school because of the pressure
2. He has about 200k of student debt because of medical school so he’s unsure if it’s a good idea to pursue higher education to add on the debt
3. There is some familial pressure to go back to school instead of pursuing a career or business but I’ve told him to ignore it and do what he thinks is best (but it’s still on his mind)
All advice and suggestions are appreciated and welcome. Thank you in advance

1gmqf38,Got sick at the team happy hour,"I’m a little more than a year into my job after college. I do great work and it’s not gone unnoticed, partly my skills and partly my home life kind of sucks now so I don’t mind working late.

They flew me and one of my team leads in to another (distant) office for a few days project. The team was great, we all got to know each other pretty well and I think we did a good job. We finished up the last day and hit up a beer garden. 

I had about 4 drinks. I usually do more than that on a night out but it did get me pretty buzzed. I got some food at a food truck. It’s a pretty fun outing for everyone.

Maybe a few hours in, I start feeling sick. I cannot stop throwing up. At a certain point, I just can’t hide it any more. I should’ve just been honest I didn’t feel well but I was pretty embarrassed. At a certain point everyone knew and I end up yakking a little bit into the souvenir cup my drink came in.

I get back to the hotel, get really close to oversharing about my home life but I cut myself off, and spent the rest of the night blowing chunks. My manager suggested it could be the food.

I wasn’t able to sleep, moved my flight to later (sitting at the airport now). I had to tell my manager who came with me. Got messages from a bunch of people on my team who are (fairly) concerned, including the big boss

I’m just telling everyone I got food poisoning. Maybe the story is a bit more complex than that but it’s the simplest and skips over the part where I’m an idiot. I was tired, didn’t drink a lot of water, had a food ive never had before from a food truck, and alcohol was involved.

I’m upset I might miss out on these connections from all the great work I did and I sacrificed my professional integrity. It’s a horrible last impression and eventually I will need to talk to all these people again online. Maybe my manager will cover for me with the food poisoning story for people in my own office (and honestly, I think there’s a high chance it was truly food poisoning—I was sick ALL NIGHT)

Not sure what to really do or say or think from here. I probably need to talk to these people early next week to summarize and report what we did.

1gmq3r8,"Been asked to travel for an interview, expenses paid, but there might have been a miscommunication regarding my location. Is this salvageable?","I recently left a role in Northern Ireland as an immigrant and, lacking any sort of income, decided to temporarily move back home with family until I found something else. The problem is that I was recently contacted by a hiring manager based on a reference and I told them that I am ""based"" in NI even though I'm not currently in the country. I still have right to work and I said that I'm willing to relocate but they've invited me to a face-to-face, expenses paid. I'm worried that they think that I am currently in NI. The issue is that flights from my current location are significantly more expensive and I currently have no address in the UK so even if I paid my own way for a few days, I'd still have to book a hotel, transport etc. which I just can't afford. Frankly, I can't even afford the flight on its own, let alone a return. I'm also worried that if I broach the subject, they will take my initial statement regarding where I am based as a lie. What do I do? What's worse is that reading the original email they asked where I ""lived"", not where I'm based.

I'm kinda freaking out! I didn't mean to lie or anything, I've just been soo conditioned by recruiters getting cold feet over immigrant workers and sponsorship which was stupid in this case because my foot was already in the door anyway!

I'm curious if they would have already inferred that while I have lived in NI to one extent or another for quite a while, it would be unreasonable for me to be staying there presently given I am out of work and not from the country. I'm not even sure if they know any of that. Maybe I'm over thinking it. Maybe I shouldn't have said I was based there. Was that a bad thing to say? Did I lie? I'm not sure what I even meant!

1gmoniy,is this job offer a scam- unpaid trial period & expected to use personal laptop and personal cell,"
Hi,

I’ve worked in SaaS sales for two years but was recently let go from my previous company because they had funding issues & let go of the entire sales and marketing teams. I was making 110k OTE there.

I’ve been having a hard time looking for a job and really am ready to take just about anything. Yesterday I had a second interview for a full cycle Account Exec position at a small ad agency. They are offering 150k OTE (80k base, 70k commission) which would be great. They want me to do a one week trial period, during which I have to close two deals or I don’t get the job. If I don’t close any deals during this, I don’t get paid. 

I’m used to much longer sales cycles so I was confused how realistic that is- the CEO assured me it’s realistic but then went on to say he never cold calls anyone, they don’t have anyone in sales, and they don’t have any data to back that up as a realistic goal.  For the one week trial period I won’t have a company phone number or email. I’m not sure if I will get a company phone number afterwards. I also will not get a company laptop, or company email until one month in. 

I’m not particularly comfortable cold calling from my personal number, nor am I comfortable sending the follow up texts they want as part of their sales process from my personal number. I have never heard of this being expected from any company. 

They also want to pay me over paypal. I’m Canadian & they’re an American company so I’m not sure if that is part of the reason but it raised a red flag for me. 

In summary, the main reasons I’m cautious:
- only two interviews for a well paid position
- expectations to cold call from my personal number
- need to close two deals within a week without knowing the product well (extremely short sales cycle)
- limited company tech stack & resources

And the main reasons I’m interested:
- potentially pays well
- I need a job

Are there too many red flags/ is it legal to make company calls from a personal number/ is this some sort of scam?

I would love any advice or thoughts. ",lovelylemon12,2,0.75,6,1731088525,2024-11-08 17:55:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gmoniy/is_this_job_offer_a_scam_unpaid_trial_period/,11,2024

1gmnvv3,My manager tried to get rid of me claiming subordination because I caught him falsifying records,"I have been off work almost 2 months now, and put in a grievance, for bullying and harassment against my manager. He was my manager for about 8 months, and had some issues early on due to the fact he is unable to listen to anything I say, it is just dismissed. There is a pattern and catalogue of events, that follow the theme of him not listening to me, for whatever reason, and disregarding my opinion and concerns.

Anyway, I accidentally came across some documents that were signed by someone that was not the person who was meant to sign them, but it was signed as the person, the day before an audit. I emailed what I found to my manager and to a director, not pointing the finger, just showing and explaining what I found. I suspected it was my manager, but also knew, as he had done previously that he would, disregard what I said, hence why I copied in a director. Now, my manager replied to the email, just to me, saying it was signed off incorrectly and had deleted the falsified document and instructed me to sign the new document he made and get the correct person to sign it. I didn't do it, as I felt it was rather cheeky of him to tell me to fix his fuck up, never mind potentially illegal, basically helping him cover up him falsifying documents.

That was in June and it was a downward spiral from there really. He gave me an extremely negative performance review the day I got back from being off for my bday. Basically because he had forgotten I was off and someone had asked him where I was and he forgot and it was ""fucking embarrassing"". Which I definitely believe is the motive for this review. His tone was less than friendly and aggressive at times. It was like he was gunning for me honestly. He had also turned down an offer from HR to sit in on the meeting as he apparently didn't want it to feel heavy handed. The review consisted of 6 things I did wrong which were all either trivial and not performance related, massively exaggerated or with 2 of them, totally factually incorrect, blaming me for 2 mistakes someone else made, one of which I actually identified and helped them correct, which I should have been praised for. 2 of them were literally his fuck up, one being the fact he forgot I was off, and the last one, I admit is a performance concern, but when I asked for support and advice from him he shrugged and said he didn't know. He asked me what my thoughts were ""besides that I'm a dick"", which I wasn't even thinking as I was just in shock really.

I asked for my review in writing the next day, as it did not follow company policy nevermind general good practise. And I responded in writing, had it independently checked that it was okay and fair, and sent him it, which he found rude.

Another major incident he had withheld vital information from me, and so when I got some figures wrong on a report as a result, he came into my office demanding to know the source of my data, embarrassing me infront of my office colleagues, despite knowing what my source is and knowing why the data was wrong. Because of him. He set me up.

The final straw was a report I produced that he distributed to managers, which came back to me via a manager because the quality was bad and some information couldn't be read. I sent them my original version. But my manager had sent them a printed off and scanned in version for some unknown  reason. I asked him about it saying it had come back to me and I wondered why it had been printed and scanned in and told him I was happy to distribute the original copy in future if he had a technical problem or something. I also had this checked to make sure it was fair and not rude. I just wanted to make sure the best quality report was being sent out so it could be read, but also so it doesn't make me look bad. He replied asking who sent me it. I said I had sent them the original so it wasn't relevant to the question I asked (but in a more friendly way). He replied saying it matters to him. So I told him who it was. And he basically got in a huff about it and told me it's not an issue. I said it was an issue to me as the quality had been reduced for no reason. It was just the unnecsity of it, I take pride in my work, I just wanted to ensure it didn't happen again. It wasn't meant to be a big deal. 

He came down the corridor to my office and asked me to come out to speak to him, I said he can speak to me here, as there's nothing the folk in my office can't hear, and I really didn't trust him after the performance review. He mumbled something and left. I knew he was going to report me to HR right away. He came in later to speak to a colleague and I asked what he wanted to speak to me about, and he said it doesn't matter.

As predicted, the following week HR manager came in and asked me to come and speak with her, so I did. Went into this meeting room where she was accompanied by a senior manager. She was real fucking nasty, making things up about me taking stuff out of context, and threatening me with subordination, one for not initially telling my manager who sent me that report he sent out, and two, for not going out to speak to him. Neither of those were a refusal or subordination. He just wanted me gone because he doesn't like me. It's that simple. I walked out of the meeting saying it was ridiculous, because it was, and went off with work related stress. 

That was nearly 2 months ago. I have an appeal hearing next week, and am only getting statutory sick pay now. The fact I'm missing out financially now is pissing me right the fuck off. All I did was try to do my best work. I've missed out a lot of damming details here too. But 2 weeks after I had been off, my job was advertised.

Sorry for the long post, if u got to the end and responded It is much appreciated. 

I'm just at a loss as to what to do. I just want to do my fucking job without some ass hat manager who can't take any feedback or listen to other opinions without being offended ffs. The irony is he says I'm not part of the team and don't want to be. But he seems to think there is an I in team.

The idea of being forced out of my job by an individual, really really boils my piss. If u want to get rid of me for capability, that's fine, if I deserved it, but follow the fucking company policy and laws, and back it up with data and performance metrics. You can't argue with that. But don't just give me shit until I want to leave and threatening me with subordination. That just makes it very very personal.

1gmng61,told I'm accusatory at work,"Hello, I am looking for some advise on what I should do in this situation. I work in quality assurance for an agency that runs group homes and one of my responsibilities is to review receipts, ledgers, and count the cash on hand. While reviewing some receipts I have noticed that some staff are using their personal reward accounts. Sometimes to get the company a discount, like at at department store. Other times at a food chain where the rewards just go to that person's card. I brought this up to my supervisor and I was told there's no problem and I said ok.

At another meeting my supervisor told me that if there is a receipt for something over $100, I have to ask the manager to see that item. So let's say the client purchased boots for $150. I have to ask the manager to show me the boots.

Then I noticed on some receipts, like at a department store, there is ""Department store cash"". I brought this up to the manager that there is no accounting for the ""Department store cash"". The manager did not know where the ""Department store cash"" went. When I brought this up to my supervisor things changed. I was told ""do you know how accusatory that sounds? ""Department store cash"" isn't money, it's a coupon."" I don't know how to respond.

On one hand it's my job to account for the receipts and money. I feel like I'm being told 2 different things: 1 my supervisor wants me to see the product. But then 2 when I question where something went I'm accusing the manager of theft.

I'm a very straight-forward person. So I'm thinking when I questioned the department store cash I didn't do it in a delicate way. Not sure how I should respond that I'm accusatory when it's my job to question everything.",SeaAd5228,1,0.6000000238418579,3,1731085552,2024-11-08 17:05:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gmng61/told_im_accusatory_at_work/,11,2024

Basically I service and repair (Mostly HVACs) VFDs and stuff, and i have to travel a lot plus the pay is intern level, which is not making the ends meet ( have to still ask for money from parents, they're chill, but i feel bad) 

I DON'T want to continue doing this job. I feel like if i sink too deep into this field, i wont be able to escape and will have to keep travelling and will never be able to settle. I want to get out of the Industrial automation field itself. But what do i do after that????

Option A is masters abroad and basically gamble at a chance of getting a job there, but again it'll be Industrial automation related only, since that's where my work experience will be counted. Orrrrrr

Option B, i take the IT Pill and go the route of network engineering by passing some certs like CCNA and CompTIA

Either way, i want to go abroad and settle there, but i feel like if i wait for too long then i wont be able to enjoy my 20s and then ill be too old to do anything anymore. What do i do??

1gmldzl,Conflicted with this job. ,"This is my first post because honestly I have no idea what to do and would love some outside help. Plus I’ve heard redditors are wise lol

So, I (27f) just graduated college. I already have a bachelor's degree from a school that focused mainly on interior design and other design areas, so I'm pretty creative. My new degree is in cad, which I fell in love with through my old drafting classes. 

I've worked a lot of different design jobs but tend to leave when things get tough. During school, I found a job I genuinely love because I get to do creative graphic design. It's a startup, though, and when I asked for a raise, they said no. Which in a few weeks I will have been here for a year. I’m doing graphic design work that’s worth $26+ an hour for only $14. To make it worse, new people who’ve been here a few months make $16.

I'm in a tough spot because I really love what I'm doing, but the pay just doesn't cut it, especially with the financial pressure my partner and I are facing. My boss seems to believe in me and has even mentioned a future role leading my own department. It sounds like a great opportunity, but part of me wonders if they are just stringing me along. Especially, because they say we want to get you to that point where you’re making $26. If I could just get a $4 raise I would feel better but they won’t for another 6-12 months.

A little bit of background: he’s divorced 3-4x and lives alone. Might be very depressed, just an observation. Always complaining about not getting work done, he chit chats with staff for days. In office 12hrs+ and has a morbid sense of humor. 
Of course, everything was dandy at the beginning started recognizing the role. As time went on and he started giving me new tasks such as admin data entry and running operations. I was picking it all up just fine! 
Side Note: I love to get my paperwork done and out of the way as soon as possible to focus on daily operations necessary to the property. 
I showed my ability to learn things immediately and complete tasks efficiently. He used to make comments to me such as, “I might as well give you my keys” and “Soon corporate will be kicking me out”. During month 5 he talked up “I’m pushing for my prior AGM pay for next month’s transition” and “I’ve been talking to the RDO about your promotion”.
Once month 6 came and went, he went silent not a thing mentioned about my “promotion”.
The sales director placed her notice as she had found another opportunity around the same time and I thought that was why he was no longer mentioning it. I talked to him directly about it and asked if I was being placed on the back burner, he stated “you’re not where I need you to be”.
(I find his answer vague and quite frankly, Bullshit with no support) “But keep talking about it, that shows your interest is there!”
Poker faced, I was confused and not wanting the reality that my time had been wasted.
I’m coming on month 8 and from month 5 up to this point: No new admin tasks have been assigned. No access to admin required programs. Corrects me in front of staff. Does not delegate and remains behind on his work.
Here’s where I’ve drawn the line. I’m still an hourly employee…yet weekends he leaves for me to get called in and “take care of the property”, name dropping me his “AGM” to staff, vendors, and clients.
He also fought and put his “job on the line” for an AGM that he has known through this industry to become his new Sales Director who has no experience to start as soon as possible. And another front line employee is to take her spot at the sister property without any managerial background. At this point I feel like I’ve been slapped in the face for 8 months and am utterly appalled I would be placed in this position with promises not being kept.

Or I'm being insane that I think it's even close and I need an outside perspective. In either case, I know I am extremely lucky to have these options:

  
Job Offer A: SVP Growth, comp $300K. Broad remit/scope, growing company, but a tough industry that I have some experience in (basically, media). This job would involve commuting 2.5hrs/day for 2.5 days a week. Can shift hours to make commute work. Management and Board are all great people and I've gotten along with everyone easily throughout the whole process. From a career growth perspective, being in a high level ""growth"" role sets me up well for almost anything in the future, and if this company succeeds in its goals it would be a huge resume boost.

  
Job Offer B: VP Performance Marketing, comp $340K + $350K equity (standard 4 year vest). Fully remote. This is so, so, so far beyond what the market is paying for this type of role. It doesn't even cover all marketing channels (at first...). It's a recently acquired PE-backed company with a new management team, and I have 2nd degree connections to all of them from prior work experience at the same company they were at. So we're both comfortable with how each other thinks, but I'd still say the ""vibe"" was better with Company A. Boring industry, but stable, growing, and profitable.

1gmjut4,Switching department for skills vs Promotion,"Hi,

Writing here on behalf of my wife.

She currently has a basic clerck role in a company, and has proven there she was good and efficient. Another department is trying to recruit her and offers a 12% pay bump for a similar position in a more competitive environment where she will learn very different skills from what she is doing now.

Now, her current promotion is proposing to stay for a similar pay raise but a promised promotion to a senior role on the next cycle (they could roll back, of course).

Money is not important in this case, but one proposition leads to a sure way to gain skills and a sure pay bump. The other leads to a similar pay bump, but with a promotion to a senior role.

1gmjs8s,What should I do? Please advise ,"I am at a crossroads with my career choices. I’m currently a Sophomore in college majoring in Marketing. I am also very passionate about cars and want to start a business in the automotive industry eventually. I was never 100% sure what my plan was going to be going into college but I initially felt an inclination towards the business school after I took some Marketing classes in high school and found an interest in it. But in the recent months I have come to have second thoughts. I am not sure if I want to stay in business because I am quite introverted and not outgoing at all. I realized that in business, it is more about the relationships you form with people. It is essentially all about networking and working with people, which isn’t my strength. I have been considering switching my major. I personally feel like automotive engineering might be what I want to do due to my interests. But the downside to being an automotive engineer seems that it is not a very promising career these days as everything is going is going electric (unfortunately). But my dad has been advising me for months to consider becoming a dentist. Now, I personally do not have much of an interest in anything related to medicine or dentistry. Time spent in school will also be more with dentistry, but the one thing about it is, it is not super hard to get a six figure salary and it is quite stable (from what I heard) unlike automotive engineering.

1gmjc57,Certificate Program 1-2 years that can get you a wfh job,"Hello

My partner who was previously working in the service industry is struggling with some back problems and is looking to transition to a job where they can work from home sitting down. 

They do not need to make a ton of money. Honestly a part time wfh gig would be fine/ideal so they can also focus on healing. 

I have good benefits and make a good salary to supplement. We just need him to make $20k a year part or full time (ideally something that is in the $20-25 an hour). 

Are there any easy to enter/high demand fields with wfh opportunities? We can have him do a program online or at a local community college fairly easily. I just want to make sure we look at the right opportunities.

1gmir89,deeply concerned what course to take as an artist & a soon-to-be-seniorhs-student,"How do i even get this thing started?

I'm in my 10th grade , which means I'm going to be in senior high school the next school year. I have talked about my career path/ what course i am gonna get with my parents but they have recommended me too many things and idk what to do now.

I love drawing both traditional and digital art. I do portraits, paintings and other things. My parents know that well, and so i told them any course is fine as long as it relates to arts(architecture/ fine arts). BUT my dad says that its hard to get a job with art course related. .................. i mean yeah. i get that. so he recommended me to take **computer science** instead. he says that i can still put my art skills to that cuz i can make a game. so basically a **game developer**. **^(he also mentioned that, since i already have the skills in art, its better to learn other things.)** but tbh i am so not good with math AT ALL. idk how true it is but some people say its very hard some people say its okay. like i know i can still learn it but it lowkey feels too forced *CAUSE ITS NOT MY PASSION. AND IM SCARED IF I'D REGRET TAKING IT.*

NOTE: he also said that compsci got one of the biggest demand (basically good money.)

And the thing he said about ""learning other stuff is better"" does make sense to me tho so i did kinda consider on taking comp sci.

now, yesterday, he called and said its also good to take a teaching job: basically a **TEACHER.** i was like, no i dont wanna be a teacher. i mean, i guess it would be fine... as long as i am gonna be an art teacher(?) i would consider that too. but ill need to be in art major or wtver u call it, in order to be an art teacher. *i would defiinitely want to share my knowledge about art. BUT TEACHING IS NOT MY PASSION. AGAIN. BUT I CAN SEE MYSELF TEACHING PPL THO.*

NOTE: my mom planned me to go study abroad in Taiwan for senior hs. (and yes im scared leaving my friends and family and other ppl close to me)

I am so confused on what to take honestly.. if only money wasnt a probably i would take fine arts and wont have to worry about the salary of the job whatsoever.

1gmidd6,No follow up after put on a PIP?,"Hello all, I hope this question is okay for this subreddit. I need advice.
I was hired at this job 05/01/2024 and was not given access to my paystubs even when I asked. I had negotiated $18.50 for my position instead of $18.00 About a month ago I finally was able to access my paystubs and that's when I saw this entire time I have been getting paid $18.00. so I went to HR. This is a family business, there's only one person in HR and that is the owner. I emailed her my paystubs and let her know I was shorted. (Yes I was professional.) She did not answer even after I sent 2 more emails.

A week later to the day I'm sat down with my manager and the owner and was put on a PIP for ""not meeting expectations"". And said this PIP would be revaluated in 2 weeks. Not 30-90 days like a normal PIP. Okay, retaliation I see you. My PIP said they would reevaluate me ""the week of November 4th"". 

A week after my PIP the owner paid me what was owed but didn't say sorry, apologies, or anything. Only said ""your wage has been changed."" Which to me proved she screwed up my wages because what employer would give an employee a raise while on a PIP??

My shift is now over and no meeting was set up and nothing was even mentioned about my PIP.

What am I to make of this?? Did they realize the timing here was fishy? I'm so confused. Also yes I am actively and aggressively looking for another job.

1gmibfc,Screwed up a final interview. Should I followup and address or leave it be?,"I did well at every previous stage of the interview process. Then today had to meet the big boss for a sign-off/final interview. The assistant who arranged it sent me a video call instead of a location. I emailed her twice to confirm but she didn't respond, and it turns out it's was there in person - but I didn't find out until I started.

So the interview started on the wrong foot. Video calls are generally slightly harder to make a good impression. But for whatever reason, all my answers to questions were rambling and vague. The interviewer seemed a bit cold, and perhaps a bit quick to jump to negative conclusions from small things in my answered. They were mostly fair and competent, but I don't think they were impressed with me.

At the end I asked what concerns would they have about my profile. It's a good question to ask as you can address it. Usually they say I have X concern but I think it will be ok. This boss said though they have a concern about Z, and left it hanging in the air.

I don't think there's zero chance I get the job, but a much lower chance than I had going into it.

So my question is, should I follow up to the hiring manager with something like:  
*Thanks for the process, I enjoyed meeting everyone and I am confident this is a role I could excel in. After the disruption me and XX were able to speak, though I think I could have given better responses to some of their questions.*

*If there is a concern Z, I can give a couple of examples....* 

Or is it better for me to stay strong and not talk myself down?

- if I am so close to retirement, should I wait for the move at my current employer, tell them I am planning to retire, or try to get out of the RTO, which the new owners probably will not buy?

- new company is in a terrible area, no exaggerating urban location. Should that be enough to say no? And shouldn't references be given only if a pay package has been discussed?

1gmgw8w,TDCX Project Blue Cancellation - Fucked up Process,"I know this isn’t the right subreddit, but I'm trying my luck posting here since I can't post to the relevant subreddit due to the karma requirements.

Hello everyone here who’s with me on the TDCX Project Blue? I was supposed to start next week, the 14th of November, but that was tentative. Then on November 5th, I received an email from recruitment or HR saying that all the classes until next year have been canceled because the project was reassigned to a different region. They asked me to fill out a Google Form to see if I was willing to reprofile to another project. In the reprofiling form, it stated that I needed to undergo another assessment and final interview, and my salary package was reduced to 21,100 basic pay + 2,900 allowance. The original offer and the contract I signed were:

* Base Pay: ₱26,100.00
* De Minimis (Non-Taxable Allowances): ₱2,900.00
* Completion Bonus: ₱5,000.00 (Metrics will be clarified during the offer discussion)
* Night Shift Differential Pay: 15%

After I received the email, I replied to them and they called me right away regarding my concern. Long story short, the recruiter/HR just reprofiled me to Project Zeus. Then on November 6th, I did another assessment and went through a final interview. I asked the person who conducted my final interview when I would know the results, and they said I’d hear back by November 7th. But until now, I still haven't received any results from them.

It's really messed up because I immediately resigned from my current company because they said I needed a clearance from them to prove that I have no remaining ties. They also had a deadline for all the requirements, so I fully complied to move my application forward. So bottom line, I finished all my pre-employment requirements, including the medical—which cost me extra because their partnered clinic retook my test due to a suspicious opacity on my chest X-ray, which has never happened before. All my previous X-ray results from other partnered clinics were normal with no suspicious findings, but I failed only at their partnered company. Then I signed the job offer, contract, got an account with TDCX that included my supposed job title, got an EID, and even did the onboarding. So everything was good, I could say I was their employee or, let's say, a new hire. I was just waiting for next week to start until all that happened.

So now, I’ve resigned from the company. I have no work, TDCX isn't replying to my emails, and there's no update on my reprofiling to another project. I've emailed them several times but haven't heard back. What I thought was a great opportunity turned into the worst experience for me.

It's really unfair what they did to me and my colleagues, especially since finding work isn't easy. Do you think when they reprofile you to another project, you really have to go through a new assessment and final interview? It feels like all the process I went through was just wasted.

When I received the email about the Project Blue cancellation, I also started applying to other places. I don't want to rely on their messed-up system. I'm just really frustrated with everything that happened and how they handled this situation. Maybe you have openings in your company, please refer me guys. Help me out since my rent and other bills are due soon.

1gmfb5c,I am crying after this call,"I am literally crying typing this out. Had a call with my boss, and he was very supportive and objective in his feedback, and I realize it is my fault, but I never knew it would come to this. 

Context: Handling a merger from a bigger company with a smaller retail entity. 3 people from the bigger company are working on this and have shifted states for the same- VP, Finance rep and me handling HR. 

The VP and Finance rep have trail blazed the merger process, changes structures, interact with heads etc. I am a fresher (worked with the bigger company for 8 months) before being tasked with this. All of my initiatives were met with disdain and a fair amount of resentment (from the smaller company, not from the VP, and I just realized there are multiple review meetings where I am not invited or asked to participate, either because I'm  a fresher, which is okay, or idk why else) 

Cut to the chase, the HR head of the smaller company wrote a mail asking me to report to the office in lieu of their working hours ( I do not report to him, but work collaboratively on all HR processes). The background was that he did not close any open positions (50+) which meant he had a bag argument with the VP, and the VP had questioned why despite my presence and support things are not moving well ( I was never aware that such a huge number of positions were open at all) . I do not know if the VP had mentioned about my absence in the office as well (but I was working from home as there are no meeting rooms in the small office + no women who work there + it is in an relatively un safe area, and the office location will be changed in 2-3 months time). This I heard from the HR head on call, when I asked him why he had written that mail. 

I then said that such communication is not right, and that my reporting is to the VP, and not him, and asked him to not interfere. (On call) 

I wrote an mail as well (cuz fucker had clicked reply all, with the VP, ops head, recruiter, payroll etc) that I work collaboratively with him, and my reporting is with my boss and VP, not him. Wrote that such mails are not entertained. The tonality was rude, I accept.

I've been reflecting on choosing a career path that not only aligns with my passion but is also future-proof, especially with the rapid advancements in AI. With a background in graphic design and (3D) motion design, I’m curious to hear your thoughts on how AI might impact these fields and what path you would consider in my position.

Both paths interest me deeply—art direction offers a broader scope, while motion design is more specialized. My dream has always been to work in motion design and specialize in it, yet I’m drawn to the conceptual nature of art direction, which feels potentially more resilient to AI disruption. If AI weren’t a factor, I’d choose motion design without hesitation, but with the uncertainty around AI, I feel I need to be practical.

Tinanong ko sa nagconduct sakin ng final interview kung kelan ko malalaman yung results and sabi niya eh Nov 7 malalaman ko din yung results. Pero hanggang ngayon wala pa din akong results na natatanggap mula sa kanila.

Sobrang fucked up lang kasi nag immediate resign ako sa current company ko sa kadahilanang kailangan ko daw muna ng clearance from my current company na nagpapatunay na wala na kong connection from them. May deadline din kasi sila sa lahat ng mga requirements kaya ako naman todo comply sa kanila para magprogress din yung application ko. So bottomline, natapos ko lahat ng pre-employment requirements ko, medical - kung saan gumastos pa din ako kasi pinagretake ako ng partnered clinic nila sa kadahilanang may suspiscious opacity on chest xray daw ako which is first time lang mangyari sakin. Lahat kasi ng xray results ko sa mga previous partnered clinic ng mga napasukan kong company eh normal, at walang nakikitang kahit anong suspiscious findings - dun sa partnered company lang nila ako sumablay. Then nakapag sign na din ako ng job offer, contract, may account na din ako sa TDCX na nakapaloob dun yung supposedly job title ko, may EID na din, nakapag on boarding na din. So all goods na lahat, masasabi kong employee na nila ako or let's say new hire ako. Bale waiting na lang talaga ko for next week para sa start date hanggang sa ganun nga yung nangyari.

So ito ko ngayon, resigned na sa company. Wala ng work, di nagrereply sa email yung TDCX, walang result about sa reprofiling ko sa ibang project. Nakailang email na ko sa kanila pero wala silang paramdam. Yung tipong inaakala kong magandang opportunity pero naging worst experience para sakin.

Sobrang unfair lang talaga ng ginawa sakin or samin ng mga kasabayan ko lalo't di naman madaling makahanap ng work. Tingin niyo ba, pag reprofile sa ibang project kailangan talaga mag undergo ng panibagong assessment at final interview? Para kasing ang nangyayari is balewala lang lahat ng process na pinagdaanan ko.

Nung nareceive ko yung email about sa Project Blue cancellation, nagsimula na rin akong mag-apply apply sa iba. Ayokong umasa sa bulok na sistema nila. Sobrang frustrated lang talaga ko sa mga nangyari at kung pano nila ihandle yung ganitong sitwayon. Baka may opening kayo dyan sa company niyo, refer niyo naman ako guys. Help niyo naman ako lalo't malapit na bayaran ng rent at other bills.

1gmcup2,Is it normal for me to feel lost at my new job?,"I am an ex-founder of a customer success platform with an overall experience of 5+ years. I recently joined this startup as a head of customer success with three sub departments to overtake from the founder- customer success, implementation and support.

So right now we already have an implementation team and a person in support. Just for some context I love setting up processes and sorting things out and exploring SaaS tools.

Right now we on't have anyone in customer success so basically after implementation customers just exist and no one looks at them or nurture them.

So my founder asked me to start there and slowly take over other departments as well. Now there is a girl in implementation team, smart but threatened by my joining. I have a feeling that she was expecting to become a head of implementation and me joining makes her feel that she won't be able to. No one mentioned this but I feel so

I have been taking all the information but it is end of first week and I feel so lost. I want to start with taking over customer success and streamline some part of implementation and support as well. I am afraid to present my idea to the founder, I feel if I do he will say this is what you did in 1 week? And I feel I am underperforming as I have created a plan after the 1st week. I don't know why but I feel it should have been done by 4th day.

Am I expecting too much from myself or what are the kind of expectations founders have when someone joins new?

because right now it is a complete mess, of course it is a startup in pre-seed A stage

I initially went into this because I enjoyed computers and thought it was a stable career but that is not the case. I feel caved in because I don’t know what else I could do.

The first one was a bureaucracy issue, I got caught in the cross hairs between the regional director who hired me and the national director. The second job, I was the newest hire in a small boutique law firm that ended up not doing so well business wise, so I was let go because they couldn’t afford the newest hire. 

This last job, the reason I was given was “it’s just not a good fit”. When I followed up in an email asking for feedback, I got a response saying we (paralegal who trained me and principal attorney) “having to repeat instructions you have been trained on”. That’s true, but only because the attorney is so specific about small things I always wanted to ensure I was doing the task in the way they wanted. I was only there for 3 weeks, I feel like they didn’t even give me enough time to get settled into the role. I was only doing half the tasks because the previous office admin was still there until the Monday of the week I was let go. 

I’m at a loss of what to do. I had one really good job that I excelled at, but it was exhausting and temporary. I wish I could go back to that job. But I feel like that first job that I got caught in the middle of burned any chances for me to be in that field. 

I’m so frustrated and sad and mad at myself. I don’t know what to do or what to turn to. 

Note on resume: I haven’t added this recent job, it’s not even worth having to talk about in interviews. The first job that let me go was from 01/2023-06/2023, I didn’t add it to my resume either because I feel like it would be a deterrent.

1gm6wgg,Some advise on whether I should job hop or not,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping for some advice on switching fields. Currently, I work for a Japanese restaurant supplier, mainly dealing with equipment and appliances, and I’ve been here for two years since graduating. The environment is supportive—my bosses and managers are great people who taught me everything from scratch. Plus, the company provides affordable housing ($400 a month) and a free car, making it easy for me to save.

However, I don’t love the actual job. My role is supposed to be sales-focused, but due to staffing shortages, I often find myself handling deliveries and doing a lot of physical labor, like setting up large appliances in restaurants (work that other companies often have dedicated teams for). The company initially planned for me to focus on e-commerce and online revenue management, but most of our business comes from restaurant openings, so I haven’t had much chance to work on that.

Recently, I’ve been pursuing other roles and am close to an offer from a Japanese anime company as a digital marketing/licensing specialist. This aligns more closely with my love for anime, video games, and Japanese pop culture. The add on it, I will be working hybrid, only 2 days per week in the office. The catch is that the pay would be about the same (around $50k in LA), with no housing or car benefits. This would mean budgeting very tightly and essentially living paycheck to paycheck, though I don’t spend much on going out or entertainment beyond video gaming.

When I mentioned the potential offer to my current boss, they responded with a 20% raise (from $50k to $60k) to stay, though this would come with more responsibilities. This would be a 40% increase in my savings. Then again, I am saving a way more than how much someone from the country I grew up in (Japan) at my age would save, and I do plan to go back for retirement one day or another.

I’m torn. I’m 28 and really want to move into an industry I’m passionate about, but I’ve also gotten used to the financial stability of my current job. My friends and family think I should take the anime company offer because it’s closer to what I want to do, and I’m leaning that way too. But I’d love to hear what others think, especially considering my age and my plans to get married in the next few years.

1gm688u,Is it wise to stay in a job that feels mismatahed after just 2 days ? ,"After only two days, I already feel this job may not be the right fit for me. Here’s why:

On my first day, I attended an information session on job duties and product knowledge, but afterward, training felt disorganized. I was left to observe others and try to keep up with an overwhelming amount of information—about 20 to 30 web applications. Although I did my best to follow along and even completed some tasks with help, it was exhausting. After lunch, I took an extra 15 minutes to regroup with some tea, which annoyed my supervisor.

On my second day, I was given a headset with no instructions and left alone while my supervisor stepped out. When I briefly left to use the restroom, she returned frustrated that I wasn’t there to answer a potential call. This seemed unfair, given the lack of guidance.

My typing speed has also been a point of criticism. Although I type quickly and correct minor mistakes, my supervisor seems impatient with me adapting to the setup.

I’m considering leaving as I already have two other job offers, although they pay slightly less. Should I stay or go?

1gm5xxq,Opportunity for Promotion — Stay or Go?,"Hi all — could use some advice on my current situation at work. 

I currently work as a PM at a large healthcare organization, which I’ve been with a little over 1.5 years now. For the most part, I’ve enjoyed the scope of my work and projects, but the hours are long and the pay is not great for the hours I work and level of responsibility. I often work evenings and on the weekends just to not fall too far behind, and I also make bottom range salary for this position (my state requires jobs to post a salary range) due to “lack of years of experience”. I currently have about 4 YOE and a Master’s degree for additional context. 

While I’ve scaled back on the hours of work I’ve put in, the level of responsibility has grown and for the last 6 months or so, my manager has indicated a promotion next performance evaluation cycle in Q1 2025. My requests for an off-cycle promotion or salary re-evaluation were dismissed due to “a tough budget season” and “tenure” (other PMs in the organization have more YOE than me, per my manager’s explanation). Other than that, my performance evaluations come back with stellar reviews, with maximum rubric scores and the only indication of opportunities for growth being giving me more opportunities to lead and manage junior employees to get me ready for the next promotion cycle. 

Afew days ago, my boss revealed she would be leaving her current role but that this would be a great opportunity for me to “step up” and move up in the organization. While I’ve been gunning for a promotion the last year or so, I mostly felt confident under her leadership and direction. Now that she is leaving our department, not only is it unclear who my direct manager will be (my boss is a senior leader in the organization and there is only 1 more leader above her before c-suite), it’s heavily implied that the department will go through a re-org. There is currently no timeline for this, nor is there clarity on what my next role will be once she leaves — the only indication I’ve received from her is that it will be a “director type role” and that I’ll be leading a very technical portfolio that I don’t feel prepared to take the lead on without my boss’s expertise and /some guidance. She has also indicated that I shouldn’t update my resume and seems to assume I’m going to accept the new role as she’s already telling everyone that I’ll be leading this work solo come January 2025.

Can anyone offer thoughts or insights into the following:

- How can I get a better understanding of the intended promotion title and job responsibilities given that I’ve been asking since early 2024 at each of my quarterly check-ins and my manager never offers clarity beyond what I’ve mentioned above?

- Should I convey my concerns about the technical complexity of the portfolio and how I don’t feel fit to lead this work solo at this point in time? She states she will “set me up for success” prior to her new role starting but with so many competing priorities I worry this will not happen

- Any tips for negotiating salary given my current situation? For additional context, there is no one besides me and my boss working on this portfolio of work in our department so she indicated there may be a period of “self-direction” until her backfill is hired

As I’m pretty close to the next promotion cycle (early 2025), I’m inclined to see what the organization can offer for my growth, but I’m also very generally concerned about the lack of handoff, structure, and support that will be coming soon.

1gm5e83,What should I do with my future career trajectory?,"
Should I change my field or stay put and change the company?

I’m currently working remotely as a sales operations associate making 75K per year and I’m remote. I get 4 weeks holidays and an RRSP match. I’ve been pretty unhappy with the job due to promises by senior leaders that were not kept since I started. If I want to grow in this job it’ll likely take 2 years to get to 90k and hit senior associate level. I originally joined this team to gain more technical knowledge but it seems like that’s not the case and I’m not exactly learning anything new. The job has pretty high expectations and you are more or less the dumping ground for all the stuff nobody wants to do, or they don’t feel like doing themselves.

One of my colleagues suggested I join them as a high networth client relationship manager making 90K salary + variable component with on target earnings at 110K per year. This job is also remote and has a match. This is at the company as the above job. Before my current job it was client facing so speaking with people is no big deal. If I take this job my only concern is how automation will impact it in the future and if I’m making the right move.

Alternatively I’ve thought about staying put in my field and leaving the company I work for and find something else. Likely I’d be making 90K per year or more for a senior associate job or I could make even more by working at a US based company (that part is more variable).

Should I stay put in my existing field/job and just push through aiming for a promotion, jump to a different position, or move to a new company. My ultimate dream would be to find a job in the USA, but I know that’s extremely difficult and I don’t have citizenship there. But I also don’t want to close any doors.

Only thing about moving to a new company is I’ll lose my 4.5% match, $3000 budget for whatever I want, remote job and 20 vacation days per year. The company itself takes care of their employees but this team I moved to hasn’t been great.

1gm4qdx,Remote Work for someone with a background in Sales and Tech Support,"Due to personal factors, I'm limited to working from home for now. I'm not college educated and have a short tenure/gap filled resume due to my chronic health issues which I've finally gotten under control. Have 2 years of sales experience in tech and solar. 

Long story short, I've had 3 interviews and 0 offers from over 300 job applications for salary + OTE jobs. It's time to start looking for other avenues of work, because there'sjust no way i can compete with college educated peeps with decent resumes in this market. I tend to excel in interviews, but can't get over that initial AI resume analysis hump.

 I'm currently in a commission/draw company selling/scamming people with ""prescription assistance"" (them paying us a monthly fee for 15 minutes of paperwork every couple of months) and making anywhere from 2k to 2.5k a month. Plus it's in office and I'm given the micromanagement and strictness of a W2 employee with none of the benefits; as I said, working in office is extremely difficult for me as well.

Im desperate for some kind of change, even if I have to do something outside of sales. I have a background (3 years) in tech support, but taking inbound calls 8 hours a day is the reason I moved to sales. I hate the feeling of the phone immediately ringing right after I finish up a call. But it might be necessary.

Basically my only two requirements for a new job are 1) remote and 2) making at least 50k a year. If you have a commission sales industry in mind, it has to be a short sales cycle because I have no money saved due to this shitty job I have now (which is why I dont go back to solar even though I did well at it).

1gm4bec,When to approach HR or Big Boss,"I don’t even know where to begin. 

A few days ago, I (F) went to my boss (M) and mentioned to them the ongoing attitude/disrespect from a lateral manager(M) towards me directly… and only me. I also mentioned the lack of willingness to co-work on a project… leaving me drowning in an unrealistic workload.  

An example of this persons disrespect - In a department head meeting he asked a question and I tried to answer it and he threw up his hand to let someone else answer his question…

After that meeting that’s when I voiced my concerns and they said they would handle it… 

Today this lateral manger double downed on being disrespectful - he acknowledged everyone in the room but me and I feel as if it is intentional. I don’t need acknowledgement but I feel targeted… I can only speculate that my boss told this employee I have a problem with them… 

They’re also a newer employee and when they first started the lateral manager had an issue with how I handled something pertaining to them - they went off on me in a department head meeting…and no one intervened… no one thought anything of it other than me.

Is it time to go to HR or the Big Boss? What do I say? Could this be a sexist issue? Do I even bother ? Etc.

1gm2vpm,I got a raise but this month they took it back. Do I ask them?,"Hi everyone. In my job recently I got a slight raise. I didn't ask for it, my boss kind of asked me if I had seen a raise in my money, I said yes and he told me it's like a well done, keep going like this. The thing js, I've had two months with the more money. This month my paycheck was back to my old lower paycheck. I'm not sure if it's a mistake, or if they took back the raise, or if they meant the raise was twmporary like a bonus. Should I wait for another month and then ask them, or ask them? I'm kind of embarrassed to ask. Also there was a bad misunderstanding with my coworkers where we discussed about our paychecks and when they asked if I had seen more money this month I said yes (knowing about the raise) but didn't want to tell them about the raise so I told them it must have been a mistake. The thing is, they kept pressuring me to call the accountant to ask, claiming they had questions to ask her too, so we could all ask. I told them I didn't want to ask. The next day they told me I had remaining vacation days because they asked the accountant, and they thought I was too shy to ask. I was kind of furious, so I'm wondering if someone told the accountant I saw more money and the accountant now calculated less money? I know the part about the coworkers sucks but they caught me off guard, I didn't intend to say anything but I'm not quick thinking. They may jave mentioned about the money, maybe not, because I don't think they want to show we talk about money. Before the raise we used to talk about money, in terms of asking when we got paid, or if we all saw a bonus we would ask eachother what this money would be. So this si why they asked me in the first place. How do I proceed? I'm embarrassed to ask what happened to the raise, because I feel like since it was a gift from the upper ones, I don't feel like it's my money. Any advice would be helpful, thanks.",Enough_Ad_4354,5,0.6499999761581421,31,1731018016,2024-11-07 22:20:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gm2vpm/i_got_a_raise_but_this_month_they_took_it_back_do/,11,2024
1gm21hm,27 Unemployed for a Year,"Hi, I’m 27 and in January of this year I was laid off from my job. This was totally unexpected, but kind of a blessing in disguise, because I took the opportunity to go backpacking for 4 months, which is something I’ve always wanted to do. I started applying for jobs seriously at the end of June, but this job market has proven to be more challenging than I have faced in the path, and I’m open to suggestions about other paths that I should take for my career.

I was working in UX Research Operations for a big tech company before I got laid off, and I really enjoyed the job. I’ve been applying for ResOps roles, and have had a couple of interviews, but have not gotten an offer yet. Before that, I was working as the Lead Clinical Research Coordinator for a $500K study at a lead research university. I also had a hand in Grant writing in that role, and secured an additional $20 mil in funding for the department. I have a lot of experience managing and executing research studies from beginning to end. My main previous job duties have been as follows:

- Participant recruitment: including sourcing, scheduling, collecting consent forms, NDAs, and processing compensation
- Dashboard Management: built dashboards in Excel/Sheets to track participant recruitment for longitudinal studies
- Budget Allocation and Timeline: worked directly with PIs and UX Researchers to set project timeline and scope, all within study budgets
- Data Visualizations: used Excel and Tableau to create data visualizations to monitor real-time progress (gantt charts), support grant proposals, and communicate findings to cross-disciplinary stakeholders.
- Survey Creation: worked with PIs and UXRs as subject-matter expert to set eligibility requirements, drafted screeners, programmed screeners in Qualtrics and RedCap, facilitated data collection according to legal and privacy standards 
- Miscellaneous Skills: standardizing documentation for training materials and SOPs, onboarding and training new team members, File Management, Stakeholder Management, lead integration of new tools into workflows, conducted phone screens and interviews, elementary SQL skills

I would maybe like to one day maybe become a UX Researcher, but I know right now I don’t have a portfolio to get my foot in the door, but I also like working within ResOps; I love being able to standardize and automate processes on the team while managing large projects. I don’t really see myself getting back into being a clinical research coordinator, but I’m open to something in the healthcare tech industry. Some people have recommended to me to become a PM, but I don’t really enjoy being the sole manager for a team of people. Do you have any suggestions of careers I’m not thinking of that based on my skillset that I would be a good fit for. Obviously, I would like something that I would be qualified to apply for today, so I can get back to working, but I’m also open to suggestions that would require additional schooling or certifications to build my career down the line. All suggestions welcome!

There have probably been around 4-5 rounds of layoffs in the two years I’ve worked here. I’ve always felt pretty safe since I was a newer hire and a lower level employee.

This time is different. After this morning’s meeting, I received invites to two new meetings. The first is a company-wide meeting to go over some new ‘restructuring’ changes that are being made. The other is a one-on-one with my boss, an hour before the company-wide meeting.

- I have a bachelors in psychology (useless degree, I know and I regret it)

- I’m great at talking to people in deescalation (but I hate having to do it)

 - detail oriented

- efficient and diligent 

- I’m competent and can pick up new skills very quickly.





Things I am not good at :

- Handling high stress environments and situations. I taught middle school history briefly, and while I liked coming up with ideas and actually teaching curriculum, I could not handle the stress of classroom management.

- Managing other people. Currently doing call center work and was in a sup training program for a few months, having to be responsible for a team of people is NOT for me. Again, I could not deal with the stress of being responsible for the actions of others and stepped down from that position.

- I’m currently on the phones at a call center. I’m good at talking to people and deescalating angry customers but I hate doing it. It’s  like all the empathy and patience I have gets drained out of me by the end of the day.

1glz707,Over looked - Any advice please 🙏🏼,"Hi there, 

Apologies in advance for length if post.

I started a new job a couple of months ago. My line manager immediately left and someone (the same level as me) was put into the role on a temporary basis. This has made things quite difficult for me, the person has been more focused on impressing in the temp role so I haven’t really had much support.

Part of my job, and the reason I applied, was to be given additional line manager responsibilities. It’s experience that I really wanted to gain m. This involved hiring an assistant and a couple of months into the role 2 assistant positions were advertised for myself and my counterpart.

I’ve been overlooked since the beginning of the process. My name wasn’t put as hiring manager. I tried to actively be involved in the sifting process, setting up meetings, communicating via email etc. I then found out that my line manager and counterpart had sifted the applicants and informed the resource team who would be progressing without telling me. Further to this, I was then informed by my line manager that as he wanted to get experience he would be doing the interviews with my counterpart. (I ended up being involved in two interviews as my line manager was busy)- albeit external candidates that realistically were never going to be successful.

Successful candidates were selected - both of which I wasn’t involved in the interviews. I was then told that as I didn’t interview I couldnt inform the candidates of their successful application, and instead need to inform the unsuccessful candidates. All of this was done with school boy type sniggering and jokes at my expense.

I feel a bit of an idiot and overlooked. I don’t want to cause any hassle, especially so early in my postion, but I’m worried if I don’t say anything now it will continue.

I also want to build a rapport with my assistant, and actually be given the opportunity to speak with them. I’m worried that when they start the postion I’ll be overlooked and undermined.

Through the process my counterpart and manger have completely made up stories to exclude me from the process, I’ve worked for the company for 4 years so I know that it’s complete and utter nonsense:

Could anyone offer me some advice on what to do next please? It would be really appreciated.

I recently applied for two positions within the same company. It's basically the same position: both are part of an AmeriCorp program and carry essentially the same duties.

Some context:

Located in Europe.

I can get an apprenticeship offer at a Big 4, where I already know the people and have already made a 6 month internship that ended a couple of months ago. I liked my coworkers and my superiors, and based on feedback I was good at the job and was liked by the people around me. 

As of now, I just started an internship at a Big Tech (not FAANG) in a back office role where the job is very similar to what I was doing/would do at the Big 4. 

The question:

Without considering benefits like smart working etc, what would be the better option? Which grants the best professional and salary growth opportunities? What gives you more experience? In case I decided to change, which would grant better options/exit opps?

1glxof4,AWS Machine Learning Associate EXAM Certification - I passed!!! The best practice Exams ever!!!...,"# This AWS Machine Learning Exam Prep Is Next-Level!

Hey Reddit! If you’re like me and knee-deep in AWS Machine Learning prep, you probably know about Stephane Maarek and the usual go-to resources. But I just stumbled on a new AWS ML course that completely blows the others out of the water!

If you're tired of feeling like you've seen the same content recycled again and again, this is the Exam prep to check out. It’s intense, engaging, and truly in-depth. You’ll walk into that exam center feeling like a boss.

...And it seems almost unbelievable that it has far fewer students than the more commercial courses. I believe the instructor is a true expert in AWS certifications.

I wasn’t finding anything in my field and settled for a customer service phone roll with a 2/1030 shift. I have only been at this job for 2 weeks and there’s 6 weeks of training. 

So fast forward to yesterday and I got a call from a recruiter for a fraud investigator role back in September. Had a good interview and was told there was a hiring freeze. They called me back today and off red me thee job. This job would be the same pay Mon - Friday no nights or weekend not a lot of phone time. 

So what do I do with my current job. My new start date is Dec 2. Do I just keep my current job until my new start date or just door dash until then. I feel bad about staying with the training just to turn around to quit.

1glw7jn,Is it normal to do my ex coworkers work until they find a replacement?,"My coworker left 2.5 months after I started. I’ve never been in this role or this company before. They gave me all her clients as well as mine. I pressed them as to what they were going to do to help me and they basically assigned a senior person to look after me, which is fine for now but I will probably bring it up again because it’s very overwhelming. I get all of my ex-coworkers calls and emails forwarded to me. I asked if someone else could look over this too, and my boss redirected the conversation. I asked for a timeline and they said 90-120 days to hire someone new. With the holidays coming up, this is not a time when I wanted a stressful job, then again when is? I’m also more worried because my ex-coworker (big gossiper so taking it with a grain of salt) said when she was hired someone did the same thing to her and they never hired someone until a year later, me. Maybe it would be manageable for one person but again, I’m new to the role so don’t exactly know what I’m doing 24/7!

1glvrq6,Motion Design or Art Direction?,"Hello community,

I've been reflecting on choosing a career path that not only aligns with my passion but is also future-proof, especially with the rapid advancements in AI. With a background in graphic design and (3D) motion design, I’m curious to hear your thoughts on how AI might impact these fields and what path you would consider in my position.

I realize this is a motion design-focused group, so there may be some bias, but I’m hoping to gain diverse perspectives. I’m sure others may be facing similar questions about where our industry is headed.

Both paths interest me deeply—art direction offers a broader scope, while motion design is more specialized. My dream has always been to work in motion design and specialize in it, yet I’m drawn to the conceptual nature of art direction, which feels potentially more resilient to AI disruption. If AI weren’t a factor, I’d choose motion design without hesitation, but with the uncertainty around AI, I feel I need to be practical.

I’d greatly appreciate any insights you can share on this!",Southern_Animal5547,1,1.0,0,1731000140,2024-11-07 17:22:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1glvrq6/motion_design_or_art_direction/,11,2024
1glvqty,Not sure how to react ,"I am a developer in a company. Colleague A was fired and me and colleague B received the handover from one of colleague A’s project. We started to work on this project 3 days ago without any documentation (he left without sharing the backend documentation). Yesterday there was a huge issue on the data and without documentation was really hard to understand the issue. I spent the entire day reverse engineering the backend to find the cause of the issue and I’ve found it - while colleague B was working on something else not related to the project. I shared with colleague B the conclusion and we both fixed the problem. However, colleague B today sent an email to the customer and my boss on cc explaining the issue and that “we” discovered it etc. since this is a team work I don’t mind at all colleague B uses “we” of course, we both worked on the solution. The problem here is that my boss answered to the email (with the customer on cc) literally saying word by word “you are super good *colleague B’s name*! Thank you for your investigation”. I feel a bit sad because 1- my boss did not even acknowledge me and 2- customer also gets that perspective, while I feel that is a bit unfair. I am not sure what should I do, or even if I should do something and just move on. 
Other relevant info: 
-Colleague B did not answer yet to my boss’s email, so I am not quite sure if colleague B will take credit or be honest
-tomorrow I have a 1on 1 with my boss, maybe I could bring this up?

1gluxx1,Quickest way to shift careers and up my salary in my 40’s?,"So, I’m in my mid-40’s. Been working in the entertainment industry in a specialized business capacity for about 20 years now. 

My wife, same age, has been working in government relations our entire 17 year relationship and has been the primary breadwinner during that time - earning close to twice my salary.  

However, she’s hitting a wall in her career as the demographics at her organization, where she’s been for almost twenty years, has changed (leaning younger and more male) and it seems she’s not only stalling when it comes to promotions but may be at risk of getting phased out and losing her job entirely. She doesn’t have a college degree, is feeling some limitations related to her age and gender, and suffice it to say, she’s feeling very anxious and dejected.

So, despite already having my dream career, it doesn’t pay much and there’s almost no room for growth. I’m really feeling like I need to step it up and start earning significantly more money, quickly - but I’m at a loss as to how to do that, especially at my age. What’s the best way to shift careers in middle age for the purpose of earning a significant salary boost?  I’m willing to put in the hard work here, so I’m not looking for “easy” rather “quick”.

1gltvla,Fired due to someone else's negligence ,"Just needed to vent about something that’s been weighing on me. I worked at a therapy office for the past four months. It wasn’t perfect, the training was pretty unhelpful and performance feedback was non-existent, but I liked my coworkers, and I genuinely enjoyed helping patients. The office environment was mostly great, usually a quiet and chill day until the afternoon when it got busy. 

The office started slowing down hard over the last couple of months. We went from seeing 17-25 patients a week per therapist to 6-13. It was obvious we weren’t bringing in new clients, but I didn’t think it’d lead to me being fired, especially not this fast. But today, after my last patient, they called me into my own office and told me they “could no longer sustain me.” They said the office was too slow, which I get, but they also hit me with some vague complaints even though I never got proper feedback on those supposed issues. I know I had 2-3 complaints within my first month when i was still pretty fresh to all of this but I guess they hold that against you. It makes sense that I would be fired first as the most recent hire but why not at least cut my hours down or offer me a part time position. And if my performance was an issue then why not work with me on it and at least give me some time. 

What really pisses me off is that the office makes pretty good money, enough so that the owner has multiple offices. How about investing in some decent marketing to bring in patients instead of laying me off. It’s not like I was out there managing the client pipeline—I was just doing my job. If your business is struggling, maybe take a look at the people in charge of bringing in revenue.

The worst part is how cold it all felt. They didn’t even have the decency to let me know earlier or offer more support. Just “we can’t sustain you, hand over your keys and head out.” I felt so blindsided by the whole experience. I didn't really care for the job all too much but getting fired from my first post grad job not even a year after graduation really does feel weird. 

Now I’m sitting here, jobless, sitting in my car after handing out 25 resumes to different offices, applying to 36 jobs online, and calling different places to see if they're hiring. I know I need to move on and find something better, but it stings. Thanks for reading—needed to get that off my chest, any advice is appreciated, its my first time going through something like this and it just feels so weird.

1glsu59,Is it considered wrong to accept commission?,"Is it considered wrong to accept commission?

Hi everyone, so I have something that is bothering me and if it ahould actually bother me or if I am just ovethinking.

So I work in the marketing industry. We have different clients and at times, for projects, we would need to hire suppliers.

We have this one supplier whom I have been recommending to my clients as they have always produced quality work and my clients are always pleased with their outputs and in terms of pricing, they always price below other suppliers. I have been giving this client a lot of projects already for this year. 

Now, we have another project coming up. I have informed this supplier if they are willing to work on us on this new project. I have been informed that since I keep recommending this supplier, my colleague decided to ask this supplier to give me a commission as my colleague has been receiving commisions from this supplier recently.

When I got the quotation from this supplier, I noticed it is higher than their usual fee but still priced low (assuming commissions were factored in). So my question is, is it wrong of me to take it and how should I reject the commission if ever without destroying the established rapport I have with this supplier and my colleague?

1glssa1,"I have a bachelor's degree in Engineering, but it's hard to do the work","Hello people, hope you can help me with my situation. In 2021 I completed my degree in Computer Engineering and quickly found a job as an Embedded Software Engineer in the Automotive industry in Michigan. Unfortunately, at the time I was having a lot of issues with substance abuse as well as undiagnosed ADHD that made it hard to do the work, I quit after 6 months at the end of 2021. After that I applied to grad school, was accepted into a reputable Master's program, and attempted that for a couple years, but again had a lot of issues with ADHD and didn't finish the program. I have been clean from drugs/alcohol since 2022, around the time I started grad school. 

  
So now I haven't had an engineering job in a few years and have been medicated for ADHD with some success since late 2023. I'm not planning on returning to grad school anytime soon because I think I need a little more of a structured environment to learn to deal with the symptoms of ADHD. My resume doesn't look great because I only had one engineering job that I stayed at for 6 months, and a huge gap in my resume since that ended. I am having a hard time getting interviews for engineering jobs. Partially because of my resume, but also the market is challenging right now, especially for software jobs. 

I'm trying to decide my next move. I would be okay with working in the Automotive industry (I live in Michigan and don't plan on relocating), but I'm trying to figure out which job I should go for that would be best for my symptoms of ADHD. I find that sitting at a desk for hours at a time is hard for me and makes it likely that I become bored. I'm thinking of trying to go into a type of engineering that is more hands-on work (away from a desk/computer), maybe in manufacturing because I'm seeing on reddit that people in that area tend to not sit at a desk as often.  I'm also to open to accepting a lower-paying role without the Engineer title for the sake of breaking into the field, or if it means more physically active work, maybe some kind of technician or manufacturing specialist position. 

Problem is, I'm not qualified to work in manufacturing currently as most of knowledge is in software/coding. I'm thinking of taking a few classes in Manufacturing at the local community college, which I don't have a problem paying for because I'm a military veteran and have VA funding. I have enough funding left to do the Associates program in robotics/manufacturing/mechatronics and could complete it in 3 or 4 semesters. 

  
Do you think it would make sense to pursue the Associates? Or should I just try to get some kind of technician job and work my way from there? My concerns are largely around what the best environment is for my ADHD and what employers will think of my resume.

I’ve been contemplating what might have gone wrong. Did I have a problem with my communication? But she did reply, telling me to pause due to personal reasons. I also checked, and some of the other resources were zero, so maybe she needed time to sort that out. It just feels a bit sad, like separation anxiety. It’s been about a week of feeling unwell and unmotivated to apply for new work. I didn’t realize freelancing could feel like this.

1glrxnl,Keep looking or Contract? ,"Need some advice. For context, I am a senior level individual contributor in marketing. My goal is to manage a team eventually. 

I am currently in-house over 3 yrs at a company that's shrinking and
increasingly toxic. There is no room for advancement (it’s not performance related, all of those are good). I hate my narcissistic boss. My job duties keep growing without a promotion and are all over the place. Boss doesn’t care whether I want to do the new type of duties either. The customers are angry from wild changes being made. I’m pretty miserable but can easily duck out for interviews. 

Before this I freelanced (contracts and direct) for a long time out of necessity. It made it hard to find a job in house after.

I have an offer for a 6 month contract. No benefits. Pay is about the same when you factor the lack of benefits. Job duties aren't my target job, and less responsibility. I also need benefits so would have to keep looking. Company is better known.

Will a contract hurt how my resume looks? Is it too risky? Am I settling too soon? Or should I take the leap? 

What should I do? Stay put and keep looking or take the contract and keep looking?",CatLadyAM,1,1.0,2,1730990369,2024-11-07 14:39:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1glrxnl/keep_looking_or_contract/,11,2024

Though in front of everyone he's still nice to me and acknowledges me sometimes. But most of our 1-to-1 conversations don't happen as he cancels them or he'd try to avoid eye contact with me in the office. 

In these two months, there has been 3 office parties (2 of them weren't even official) out of which i attended only 1.

He is a co-founder of a multi-billion dollar company and does a lot of guest speaking across multiple countries.

I have his number, WhatsApp.  
First time I called him it was to lock the meeting down. He first didn't answer but called back within 5 minutes. That was begin October. He told me just mail me begin November with the specific details of topic etc.

I've been wanting to announce the event since 1 November, so sent him an e-mail, called him Monday (instant voicemail and I left a message), then sent a reminder e-mail yesterday to follow up and ask if he could confirm.

The event is happening in 2 weeks.

Not sure what do to next? Already feel bad for harassing him tbh haha. I wouldn't be mad if he cancelled, he is a very successful and busy man. It's just if he confirms or denies, I'd be able to start looking for someone else.   
Also, because he is such a high-level speaker it's nice to name him, as people would be more likely to attend or be fellow guest speakers if he is on the panel.

  
Should I consider him cancelled? I see him liking posts on LinkedIn where he also didn't answer my message.

I just don't know the next move. Don't wanna bother him too much, but I just need to know for my own schedule and communication a yes or a no haha. Appreciate your advice! 😊

1glq72b,Career Advice?? ,"In need of professional and/or genuine advice based on experience...
I'm a 24yo BW with a degree in PoliSci from UofAlabama. I did not get much internship experience using my degree or skills in undergrad due to becoming a young mom and not prioritizing networking and sticking to the 'plan.' Long story short, I moved to Texas in 2023 with my child's father and I settled for a job in Customer Service making $42k, where I worked my way up and got promoted to a 'web team' where I handled/escalated tech requests, answered 70+ calls daily, and maintained seamless order processing.
Got tired of the stress from the job and my WFH team was dwindling. Landed a new role making $66k with an EV company as a customer support specialist. I am thankful for the pay increase but I do not like the job.. AT ALL. The startup culture is horrendous and policy just isn't followed at all. It's also a bit intimidating being the youngest person and only minority in this space. Microaggressions exist and although my direct management is great, I just don't feel like I belong....
Said all of that to say, I've been looking into graduate degrees and different career paths and I have favored risk compliance roles and analyst roles. Since working with entry-level tech issues and EV merchandise.. I want to explore something deeper within IT and Cybersecurity but moreso on the rules & regulating side of things (privacy law or senior risk management being the end goal) but I have no clue where to start. I do not want to start studying for certs or paying for training if I don't have a clear pathway on how to get there. Stuck between getting an MBA with a concentration in Cybersecurity or just narrowing down certs to be ready for.

I appreciate any and all advice given. I am gravely stressed about my 'next move.' Financial stability is a big motivator for me but I also need work life balance as I am too a young mom. Just trying to explore and see what's potentially out there for me now because I don't want to be older and wish I knew of these things.",seasonsvisual0012,2,1.0,0,1730985430,2024-11-07 13:17:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1glq72b/career_advice/,11,2024

I am fully willing to admit my failure to rise in the field of Tech and is mostly my fault but I will divide fault as 60-40 , 60 is me 40 is the world! I got laid off recently and struggling to rise!

I will not rant about the world or corporate hiring practices, my post will not change a thing, I am giving up hope for any type of job in this field. This field did not treat me well, I felt used and  I felt under-valued and underpaid, and finally got laid off! Now I am realizing my worth and reshaping myself.

I have over five year experience in Tech support, and good educational background.

Anyway I need to change my career, willing to start in a new field with low bareer to entry, even willing to accept lower pay.

1glprhv,Seeking Advice,"Hi Reddit! I’m reaching out here because I’m feeling pretty lost in my career and need some guidance on my next steps. I’m currently working for a startup software company in marketing, where I'm the only marketer, so I handle everything: graphic design, copywriting, event planning, paid ads, you name it. I’ve been in this role for three years, and while it’s been a great learning experience, the lack of structure is wearing me down. I don’t have a manager to guide me; I create and implement the entire marketing strategy myself.

Working from home has also blurred the line between my personal and professional life, and I'm starting to feel burnt out. As a military spouse who recently moved to a new area, I’m struggling to find a sense of community, and the isolation is making it even harder to separate work and home.

I’m 26, and I’m starting to think more about the future...especially with kids on the horizon and I’d like to feel more settled and secure in my career before that time comes. The challenge is, we’re in a tourist area with limited corporate jobs, mainly hospitality and tourism, so local opportunities in marketing are pretty scarce.

When I was in college, I was torn between accounting and marketing but ultimately chose marketing. Now, I’m wondering if that was the right choice. I thrive on structure and the satisfaction of checking tasks off a to-do list, and I’m beginning to think accounting might be a better fit. It seems like it would provide more stability and open up additional career options. Plus, while I enjoy being creative, I’m feeling burnt out from constantly coming up with new ideas and researching trends.

Would going back to school for an accounting degree be a good idea? Has anyone else made a similar transition, or have advice on how to find more structure and community in a remote marketing role?

1gloyji,Dilemma on choosing job,"Hi,
I am in a delimma on whether to pursue a job interview or not. 
I recently started a new position at a private organization that pays fairly good and has a lot of benefits but before I got this job, I had applied for a government position and done the written assessment for it. 
I passed the assessment and got an invite for an interview just after I had already accepted the new role, so now I’m in a dilemma.
 The $ is definitely much better (difference of $10-15k after bonuses and benefits) in the private org but it is a long commute for me (over an hour drive)
The government job is mostly work from home and also much closer to my place. 
I know the pay is much lower but it’s a government position so more job security and long term benefits so I am not sure what to do.

1glnea1,Liquidated twice in 4 months,"I recently got made redundant due to the company's financial struggles. This was fine, and a good opportunity as I was overworking as a means to prove myself while I was underpaid and could barely afford bills and food and so on, but it was incredibly stressful not having any income.

I then landed my dream job at a small company with a salary I was finally comfortable/happy with. It felt incredible knowing my financial situation was okay. I am pretty bad for stressing over money and savings. I was able to put aside a decent amount each month for a house with this new job.

Two months into my probation, that company also gets liquidated with no indication that the company was even struggling for money. 

I burnt through all my savings while looking for a new job just paying for essentials and bills and so on but have landed another role at a big company now with a really great team. Unfortunately, I have been taken away from my usual role and have taken a massive pay cut of 37% just to keep an income. 

I am finishing a part time masters in a month in my dream field and don't know where to go from here. 

The company I'm with now has a department that matches my dream role and so I could try to pivot into that team on the future.

The way I see it is I have 2 options. 
I either apply to other companies now/after my masters to get back to where I want to be with a more comfortable salary. I'm a little worried about how this will look on my CV and really don't want to let my new team down but feel like I have to put myself first.

Or I try to pivot into the other department which will be low money for the industry, but will offer great experience.

This might sound arrogant or greedy, but I got a taste of what my life could be like in my dream role with decent pay and now this new role just seems demoralising.

I lost my job working customer service management in the Aviation industry about a year and a half ago and not long after that we found out we were expecting our youngest. Not even a few weeks later I was diagnosed with HG (basically severe morning sickness 24/7 the entire pregnancy, I was hospitalized multiple times) so I couldn’t work then. Fast forward to now and I have been trying to find literally any form of work (if not a remote position then something that would pay enough to cover childcare as well as bring at least something home) and have had no success in either category. Most of the remote jobs seem to be scams or MLMs and the only in person jobs that I’ve gotten interviews for/call backs from either the pay isn’t enough to cover childcare OR I end up receiving the, “unfortunately we have decided to go with another candidate.” phone call or email. I’ve been told multiple times that I am overqualified but I feel like that is such a BS reason. I have done everything like updated my resume to include numerical achievements/statistics, tailoring it to be relevant to the job I’m applying for, and I always write a cover letter. My husband is my absolute best friend, he’s the only person in my life that has never made me feel like I’m hard to love, and I feel so terrible about him carrying the weight of all of our financial burdens on his shoulders. He’s a firefighter & even with him working overtime we are barely scraping by.. he never complains but I know it’s getting to him and we are always transparent and honest with each other when it comes to discussing finances, which is often.. He has brought up changing careers (he’s been in the fire service for almost 12 years volunteer and career combined) but I can’t allow him to do that, it’s his passion and where he thrives. I don’t want him to regret the decision and/or end up subconsciously resenting me/our family if he does make that change.. maybe that’s my own insecurities, I don’t know. And don’t get me wrong I love being home and having the opportunity to raise our girls but we are struggling- really bad. I have so many business ideas and I have always dreamed of starting my own. I received really promising & positive responses/feedback from a blog I recently launched and I have a few business ideas that I 100% believe would takeoff and people (family, friends, and anonymous strangers) I have pitched to believe so too but unfortunately these ideas would take money I don’t have. 

This was much longer than I intended and I apologize for that, but any advice or suggestions, even words of encouragement at this point would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for sticking around if you made it this far.

The issue? My salary is way below my expectations, and it’s tough to cover basic expenses, like rent and food. My annual ACCA subscription fee is coming up soon, and I’m stressed about covering it along with other costs. I joined this role mainly because most companies I applied to wanted prior experience, and I didn’t have many options after six months of searching. The firm I’m with now is quite small and doesn’t have that many clients and it's just two employees including me (but it's ACCA Approved). 

I’ve started applying to other firms, and today I got a call back(again a ACCA Approved firm)! The first question was about why I’m looking to leave, and honestly, I’m not sure how to answer. I don’t want to come off as too focused on money, but at the same time, the salary is a big reason for moving. 


Any advice on how I should approach this question in interviews?

1gllrrd,Anxiety and culture fit in Amazon Web Services,"Hi everyone, currently i am feeling the withdrawal of imposter syndrome with alot of anxiety working in a tech company. 

This is my first time working in a 'MAANG' company and after going through the 7 rounds of interview loop and landing a job at AWS, i don't seems to fit into the company culture nor team.

The DEI is loop sided as well as i am the one and only minority in my team within the country. There are no locals working in the same team while my country is ""proclaim/deem"" to be a 'first world country'. And i have not seen anyone truly passionate and happy in my team either building or sharing things excitably. My manager is great and very cheerful guy but he is not residing in the same country as me. The vibe around the team is really not my type i would want to work for long.

Also, I am really not a good slide deck presenter and but a builder, I love building web apps and infrastructure on top of AWS/Azure. I had experiences using AWS/Azure for the past 6 years and all along my past SI company were good or even great environment for me to grow.  

I am hired as a SA (generalist) in AWS and it seems like my **motivation to innovate** and create things  diminished. Previously i was using different tech stack and i could leverage on any technology to fulfil customer requirements with AI Agent eg. OpenAI hosted on any cloud platform (Azure , GCP, AWS)and this accelerate my thinking hat to the fullest potential.

  
Now i dread waking up every day thinking i need to perform a first internal presentation as a mock process via a **Awesome Builder** program. \[AB is a mock presentation to internal AWS folks which act as customer. 3 session of 1 hour each -> \[1) Sales pitch & Information Gathering 2)WhiteBoarding 3)POC \]

I am really not good in doing sales pitch on the benefits of using AWS, usually i pitch Cloud architecture designs based on customer requirements and/or factor in pros and features of each CSP to fit their requirements -> Customer Obsession

Throughout, i had sleepless nights also lost motivation. 

Currently I do no want to speak to anyone yet as i only had been onboard a few months. Am looking out for roles outside of AWS as well to help keep my mental health in check. My health has been affected as well since the first day onboard and my family could see that i am not in a proper mental state as compared to my previous ex-companies.

  
Hope to hear from anyone encountering similar situations, Cheers

1glliua,Should I accept this new job with an 80% pay increase?,"You’re probably reading this thinking “80%? Hell yea brother/sister.” But it’s a more complex than just pay.

I graduated earlier this year and I’ve been at my current job for 6 months. But my growth for learning has stopped a while ago. I recently was offered a contract position at a competitor company with an 80% pay increase, but it would come with a lot of new responsibilities and stress. They gave the offer today and they want me to give a response asap, by Friday at the latest.

To be honest I don’t feel qualified for this position, but they want to hire me. I’m the backup candidate and their previous person fell through because of background check issues. (???)

***Pros for accepting new job:***
- 80% higher pay
- Will be able to comfortably afford moving out of my mom’s house
- will learn a lot
- would make it easier to reach my end goal of getting a job in my dream city by 2026, allowing me to not be long distance with my partner 

***Cons for accepting job:***
- Will need to move apartments or commute 3-4 hrs total to work every day 
- Lack of confidence. I don’t have direct experience with strategy in this sort of role and will be learning how to strategize the project as I go… learning by myself and having no clue if what I’m doing is correct…
- Will need to leave my team which I love and give a <1 week notice.
- Will not have mentorship under a senior leader with the same position. I would be the sole person doing this position. Having mentorship in my next role is something I wanted.

Tbh my dream is to have a low stress job and this job sounds high stress, but like a good learning opportunity. Not sure what to do. Am I crazy for being afraid to accept this new job? Should I just bite the bullet and try the new job even if I’m not sure I’ll do well? It’s a big jump in responsibility and I’m scared.",gobbeers,0,0.3799999952316284,57,1730966541,2024-11-07 08:02:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1glliua/should_i_accept_this_new_job_with_an_80_pay/,11,2024
1gll5fq,Advice On Career in Renewable Energy Industrt,"I'm 28 this year and 2 years ago I started working at a start up solar developer company as an office administration. During these 2 years I got to learn bits and pieces of some solar knowledge, but it's not very in depth. Now at the end of 2 year of my job, I want dabble into sales but honest I'm not sure if the renewable energy industry is one that I want to stay in the next 10 years and have a mastery in. 

My diploma is in film & media and I have zero knowledge/background in such engineering & electrical aspect industries. My identity as a creative was pretty much developed when I decided at 15 years old that I want to do work in the media industry. But after working in the industry itself, the working hours itself are not sustainable for my lifestyle (seldom got personal time due to frequent overtime work). 

I know it is actually very early in my stage of life to determine what I actually want to do for the next 10-20 years, and where I am proved that point. 

So I took a career break and got referred to the current administration job. I was hired as a sales assistant but ended up doing administration for the company, which I did not mind and so I spent 2 years on the job. But my desire to do sales is still in me and it's time for me to think of an industry that I want to specialise in. 

Since young, I disliked Science and Physics, I stayed far away from anything related engineering. I have been a creative mindset.

So I have never ever seen myself as someone to be in an industry like renewable energy where it involves, numbers, engineering, physics, and math. 

I think I sort of have an identity crisis to which I'm not sure if renewable energy industry is what I want to do in the next 10 years, but I need to decide soon because of my change in career. I'm lost because I'm going against my own belief of my own identity. 

I do have an interest in circular economy and sustainability but more in aspects of recycling, specially into textile waste. Not renewable energy, but I believe there is some relation some way and I want to be part of the Net Zero goal. 

I need advice on whether I should put my next 10-20 years to develop myself as an experienced professional in the renewable energy industry. Thank you and I appreciate all of your advices!

1gll4q1,Should I migrate?,"I’m seeking advice as I’m considering a job offer from a company in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My current contract is ending, and I’m open to new opportunities. The job offers a salary of 13,000 MYR (approximately 170,000+ PHP), which may be reduced to 12,000 MYR due to budget constraints.

Currently, I earn 140,000 PHP, and the market in the Philippines is offering salaries up to 160,000 PHP. The job would be hybrid with 2x a week in the office (The commute would take me at least 3 hours). However, the role is quite saturated in my industry.

I have 8 years of experience in my field and am confident in my skills. However, I’m not particularly strong in interviews.

1glk59c,Career Guidance for Sibling,"My apologies for the long post but I'm looking for some career advice for my sibling that graduated back in 2020 with a BS in Chemical Engineering. He attended a top 20 engineering university and was able to secure a great job in consulting upon graduation. At that time due to COVID, his workplace was a complete mess and never provided the proper onboarding training and new hire/grad support he needed. Like a lot of younger engineers, he was also quiet and never formed any strong relationships with mentors and was often left to figure out everything on his own. This had a significant impact on his attitude in corporate work and greatly affected his performance. 

Fast forward to 2023, he was let go as apart of a restructuring and moved back home to live with my parents. For the past year he has been applying to work with no luck often times only getting past the second round of interviews. Due to the disorganized work structure of his last company, he's picked up some habits that has not helped in his job search (waking up late, hanging out with hometown friends all day, low drive to apply for jobs). My parents and I have suggested that he should keep an open mind on his job search given how competitive the job market is currently and that he might enjoy the job once he gets used to it. After all his job experience has been strictly consulting with some undergraduate research. The problem here is that he refuses to apply to any job business related role and is only seeking jobs that align with his undergraduate experience. 

This greatly narrows down job opportunities and I'm worried about offending him with suggestions. Each time we bring up any ideas or potential career paths he gets super defensive and states ""Shouldn't I be interested in what I do"" or that ""I don't care about money"". The issue here is that he doesn't have any practical non academic experience and is competing with PhDs and other more tenured engineers for these research positions. I've mentioned that sometimes in work life, we have to take a job just for the experience. I understand its a tough job market but it's been over a year now and he still doesn't know what to do. He's not receptive to suggestions and refuses to share how many jobs or how he's applying to them. I want to help him but how can I get him to be more open minded and not so laser focused on one type of job. He doesn't have any bills and has a decent amount saved up so there's no hurry for him but I'm also worried about how this unemployment gap would look on his resume.

1gljwf3,Making a difficult job decision ,"Dear Redditors,
Things always seem so simple from an outsider's POV, so lemme ask you what you would do if you were in my shoes.
My current job (almost 5 years):
- I love it
- well paid
- flexible with remote working 
- great conditions such as 6-month maternity leave and a small bonus if company does well
- awesome team, very healthy environment
- tasks: varied and interesting, related to what I studied
- the big problem: long +2hr commute

The opportunity:
- not as well paid but should increase more over time (+ I can substract a substantial amount that I currently pay for my commute)
- fixed days for working from home
- other perks that are interesting (e.g. they pay some $ towards commute) but maternity leave is only 4 months 
- seems like a healthy environment as well
- tasks: more admin and much less to do with what I studied
- big plus: I could work with a relative and the commute is shorter by a full hour

Other factors to take into account:
- I am 32 and in a relationship, with the idea to have kids someday (new job = delaying this by a year at least). My current boss knows about this and even suggested I work more remotely once I get back from maternity leave. 
- My current job is as an editor and I feel like it's a dying job due to the efficiency of AI. I have been thinking about switching careers for a while.
- Moving is not really an option, as my partner works a 25km away in the opposite direction of current job and has very limited opportunities elsewhere. There is also a language barrier issue, as my current job is in a region where a different language is spoken, which my partner doesn't speak. Also, where we currently live is much cheaper and taxes are lower. I could end up with a lower net salary if I lived closer to my current job.

Apart from academics I'm pretty good at illustration/art and have worked with the same friend in his SMM agency as a Graphic Designer and Video Editor but I'm not sure if it's worth getting a degree in a related field.
I'm also SUPER into teaching but BEd is out of question. However, I can teach at a school/college after pursuing Master's but the pay won't be that great.

1glj1nh,28yr old sucking in the business world,"I’m a 28yr old women in marketing who until recently was hourly (only been salaried in the last 2-3 years). I have a masters degree and have tried to work my way up in companies (going above and beyond requirements, staying late, getting there early) but have had to job hop for raises. I’ve never had a mentor and in fact have had managers who instead of coaching or providing concrete examples when giving feedback (even when directly asked) point to weird thing (like I’m too casual, but they couldn’t give an example) plus what I do know to be true of what I need to work on (attention to details, slowing down, speaking up). I have come to the conclusion I’m not particularly good at what I do, nor do I know how to maneuver corporate politics or workplaces. I’m slowly loosing my passion for marketing and any confidence I have in my abilities I’ve had to build up over 7 years in the work place. 

Anyone else feel the same ? I’m a bit tired of having no one else to talk through this with. Is this a normal feeling?

1gliq85,Need some help deciding what to do. ,"I have two options right now when it comes to work which is a good problem to have I suppose. My current job I really like, it’s easy enough, the days go quickly usually and great benefits such as medical, dental, pto and stuff. The problem is the pay I’m making 22an hour on a single income with my wife and baby at home in a high cost of living area. The benefits are good but expensive and my check is already half of what I used to make. Other positives at current job are a lot of potential to grow into a higher salaried position I am also close with upper management who hired me so I can move with them to a new venue. Another con of current job is I’m working 40-50 hours a week which isn’t terrible. Alright, so option 2. I just got an offer and it’s sounds like a decent move. I would work a 4day week at about 30 total hours and make close to six figures. Cons, no growth and I potentially burn a bridge with my friend in upper management at current job, although I don’t think he would be too upset about it, he understands better options and is always looking for something better to spend more time with family while making more money but his position now is pretty cake and I don’t see him going anywhere soon. But ultimately that’s my goal as well, more time with my family and more financial stability. We are struggling right now and have fallen behind on bills. New job would relieve that almost immediately but I feel like I’m throwing away a good opportunity at my current job. I don’t know what I’m expecting from strangers on the internet but I guess just another humans opinion would be welcome. I’ve explained this to chatgpt and it’s just telling me stuff I already know, weighing pros and cons, etc. 

Additional info:
1. My wife and baby are currently on my mother in law’s insurance and my wife also has state insurance as well so they are covered I am the only one who needs coverage.

2. These are both food service and hospitality positions. Currently a kitchen manager at a very popular entertainment chain that involves golf. The new job would be a bartender and server at one of the finest establishments in the city. My current job is much more physically demanding and I have much more responsibilities.

1gliora,CNA,"I let my CNA expire. I enjoyed the work, but I got burnt out within my first 6 months. I was in a high acuity geriatric long term care unit. I was a prized employee, largely because I actually cared for and loved my residents like they were family, but also I was a yes person. I said yes to anything and everything, because I was new and wanted to please. I had a hard time asking for help when rolling people; I felt incompetent by asking for help, so I injured myself twice by rolling heavy individuals on my own. I wasn’t trained to ask for help help. In hindsight, I should have asked for help. At any rate, I tried to quit and the wrangled me into staying on my last day. They made me feel valued and needed greatly. But I was still physically strained at this time, and still wanted to quit. I made up a pretty awful lie that I knew would repulse them from ever asking me to stay. Unfortunately, doing so made me unable to use my employer of which would have had a sparkling review of me. I lied that I was hitting my partner at home and was afraid that I would start hitting the residents. It’s completely absurd, but it’s the best lie I could come up with to make them not ask me to stay again.

1glfpzw,Work/Life balance ,"Earlier this year I started to work at my mum's company, I took on the role as an admin assistant, I expected it to be stress free. All was well and I had no complaints, my position is casual so my work hours where flexible, free coffee, pretty bad pay but its better than nothing. Over the past few months, I have started to feel incredibly depressed and stressed out, I am starting to think it is because of my job. 

Wake up at 6:30am - get ready for work - drive an hour to work - start at 8:00am - finish at 5pm - get home at 6pm. 

11.5 hours of my day I dedicate to work... I am becoming incredibly exhausted. Realistically, I know lots of people live this lifestyle, but I am only 19. I feel like I am missing out on a lot of my life. Every weekend while my friends go out on a friday night I just lay in bed because I feel so exhausted. I have no motivation to leave the house, no energy to see my friends or enjoy my hobbies that I work very hard for. 

Luckily in 2025 I will be going back to studying. I will just need to put up with it for a couple more months. Any advice on how to deal with it for the time being?

1glfiiw,What would you guys do in my situation?,"I graduated with a BSME (Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering, US based) and have been working full time for ~6 years years now. I had a short 3 month stint at a company but got a more enticing offer and left for my current company where I've been since. I'm a design engineer working for an OEM in Idaho.

I've got kind of a weird living situation: I've been living with my mom and grandma since college graduation. At night, I help take care around the house and I do all the yard work and so on because my grandma's health is such that she can't. My mom is retired and is pretty much set financially, so I don't have to pay rent (they won't take it even if I offer).

I've begun to suspect I'm underpaid at my current job (I make $76,000), but because I'm in a small town, there aren't any other engineering jobs. I'd likely have to move hundreds of miles away to get a different engineering job.

1glefab,Guilt/Anxiety about leaving job that now has potential opportunity ,"After almost 5 years at my current company I’ve decided to take a new position at a new one. The main reason for this is because in that time frame I’ve been passed over 4 to 5 times now for a promotion and the last attempt earlier this year felt like the last straw to me, especially when I was told the next opportunity might not be for another 2 or 3 years. After many months of searching I’ve found new employment with a connected company (still kind of working for my current company but in a more independent role) and I will be starting this position some time after the new year. It’s a good position that will see me grow in my field and also pay more in the long run. Fast forward to now and a higher position has opened up within my current company which could inadvertently open another opportunity to advance within my current employment range. Ever since this revelation I’ve felt nothing but anxiety/guilt about leaving. Did I jump the gun and should I’ve waited longer? Is it best that I’m moving on now since this potentially new opportunity is definitely not guaranteed?

1glcad6,Would you take a 15% pay drop to leave a role you feel burnt out at and leave a toxic company but there’s a catch,"So I(F, 31) am currently in a role I’ve been doing for 7 years and I’m just done:
1. it’s repetitive 
2. it’s so niche that it’s hard to progress.
3. at the same time I’m at a company that is very clicky, every group talks shit about other group and it’s been very isolating, and I’ve noticed since I’ve started my anxiety has peaked. My husband has also noticed my confidence has declined dramatically and he’s not liking what the role is doing to me. 
4. It’s impacting my personal life and Sundays become a doom day. 
5. I also just don’t feel any form of motivation and I am caring less and less about going above or extra mile. 
6. my manager has a condescending way of communicating and it makes me feel stupid sometimes.  

Positives are pay is respectable, and I get to WFH 3 days a week.

I’ve been offered an opportunity at a company I used to work at. 

1) It’s a completely different role, which I’m interested to see if it’ll be something I’m good at long term. 
2) Teams amazing(everyone heard I was considering it and were super excited)
3) My manager is someone I consider a friend and we’ve worked together for years in the past
4) 3 days WFH 

However the pay will overall be about 15% drop considering I won’t be getting sick or holiday leave(going to a 12 month contract role) but if I hit my targets I get closer to my current pay. My husband and I were planning on not doing any major holidays for a while to just build up some savings so I’m not stressed about taking any major leave in those 12 months. 

Admittedly it’ll be a tough financial pill to swallow but my husband and I think believe we can adjust, we have savings and are comfortable and believe we can still build up our savings. 

My thoughts are it’s an opportunity for me to ‘reset’, learn something new, and also be with a team I loved working with. At the same time it’ll be in an industry I’ve always loved. I also think it would allow me to explore more opportunities at the new role.

Management and I previously discussed I'd get one at the beginning of next year, however, the promotion they offered me is two classifications higher than what I anticipated which is extremely intimidating.

I enjoy my job and the work-life balance it provides so I never actively looked for other jobs. Recently, I had two colleagues that work a different government agencies encourage I apply to some openings because they thought I'd be a great fit. Both roles would have an salary increase starting at 39% plus whatever extra I can negotiate, have better PTO/ holiday schedules, and are junior-level roles that dont have as much responsibility as this new promotion would.

I've made it far along the interview process for both roles but have no written offers at this time. It's likely they are waiting for the holidays to pass.

This promotion is a huge opportunity but I'd feel bad about ditching them if I want to accept one of the other roles in the next few months. What would you do?

I recently left a job for a promotion elsewhere which didn’t work out after a month or two. Luckily I was invited back to my old role on a bank contract to ‘earn back the trust’ of my old manager before the opportunity to be made permanent would be available.

2) Do I stick around on bank until January when it’s not certain the budget will be there for me to join permanently and I am missing out on benefits such as sick pay, holiday pay etc.

I’ve been with my company for 20 years. I was pretty rapidly promoted on, but at one point was moved to supervise a division I had no experience or expressed interest in, and that was more routine work.

1glbhyl,How do I edit my resume for getting this seasonal job unrelated to my actual career?,"So, my usual job over the past 6 years has been electrical engineering (specifically in the solar field). However I currently am not employed, after a series of short to mid-length stints at grand total of 9 different companies over those 6 years since graduating college (longest tenure somewhere was almost 2 years, shortest only 2 months). I also typically include on my ""engineering job"" resume the research lab I worked in for 2 years in college and the super rad internship I had one summer. 

I am currently at a point where I don't want to have another 9-5 corporate desk engineer job, for various reasons. I have been driving Uber/Lyft but calculating out my net after expenses it seems like I'd be better off getting any job that pays ~$18+. Conveniently, I've found two different listings I should be a shoo-in for because they are very much the same role as the part time jobs I maintained in both college and high school (basically, front desk and other roles at a specific type of rec center). One is even hiring a supevisor which I think I would be qualified for given my prior ~4-5 years experience working at two other similar arenas. 

Obviously, I need to add that relevant experience to my resume for these jobs, but after doing so, and trimming down the details for all the other less relevant jobs, I still wind up with a result that is two pages long (front & back). I know that is definitely too long for this. 

Is it best if I just leave off ALL of my non-relevant day jobs? Or maybe just keep like the two longest-lasting ones, with only 2-3 bullets each?  It's gonna look weird doing so with all the gaps that causes though, and if I leave everything off it's going to beg the question of what the heck I've been doing for the last 5-6 years (or why I haven't bothered writing a new resume since college 😅).

I was instead offered assistant manager role which I accepted as I was transitioning from a slightly different setup. The plan was I would develop necessary skills based and would be promoted to Manager in 6 months or a year, as I discussed with my line manager too and he agreed. 

It's been close to 2 years now. And the most senior director in my team who makes all decisions just wouldn't promote me. I have given my heart and soul to this role, been taking part in internal team initiatives, worked hard on my client communication as they mentioned it needs working etc and given late nights to my projects. I never received negative feedback on any scientific work or lack of skills, but only on improving communications. I don't believe my communications were that off, but still, took on the feedback and worked had to improve it and I know it's way better now. 

I have exhausted all my strategies now and I believe it's all coming down to likeability. Two of my subordinates have been promoted to assistant manager level and I used to oversee them. They are nowhere near the scientific skill required too. The director always makes jokes around everyone and connects with everyone but never with me.

1glac04, Need career guidance. Should I leave engineering to pursue IT? ,"So I went to community college for essentially a 2 year mechanical engineering degree and currently am working as a CAD designer. I've been in the industry for over 2 years now (2 separate jobs) and I have come to learn that I really dislike it. The work isn't difficult, it is just incredibly uninteresting to me, feels like data entry and I think I am capable of much more. I also have the issue of being pigeonholed into non-engineering / CAD jockey roles wherever I go due to me not having a 4 year degree.

I'm much more interested in IT work and have considered pivoting careers for the last year. I've been taking 3rd party classes to transfer towards an online degree in compsci (33 credits done after transferring my associates).

I don't know if I should take a risk and leave my job to grind out school or maybe grab a cert take a pay cut to work help desk while also working on my degree. My current job is comfy and I make good money (65k) , but I'll reach a ceiling soon where I wont be getting paid much more. I could keep my job and work on school but it would take many years to finish.

I know the industry is in a bad spot right, the doom-posting in the IT and CS subs is very discouraging so I don't know if I'll be shooting myself in the foot by doing this.

1gl9ojo,Struggling with Taking Work Too Personally – Looking for Advice,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been realizing that I’ve wrapped a lot of my identity around my job, and it’s starting to impact how I handle feedback or challenges. I’m always focused on doing the best I can and take a lot of pride in my work. But lately, any kind of critical feedback seems to hit harder than it should. I feel like I can’t separate myself from my role, and I end up taking critiques as something personal rather than just professional.

Part of it might be the nature of my job, where I have a lot of responsibility and need to solve complex problems every day. Even when I’m not at work, I find myself in “work mode”—thinking through issues, trying to anticipate scenarios, and mentally planning out solutions. I love being invested, but it feels like I’m too tied to it all sometimes.

For anyone who’s been in a similar position, how did you find a balance between doing meaningful work and not letting it entirely define you? How do you protect your sense of self from being so tied to your job?

Would really appreciate any advice or practical tips that have worked for you. Thanks in advance!",jonnodraw,2,1.0,4,1730928562,2024-11-06 21:29:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gl9ojo/struggling_with_taking_work_too_personally/,11,2024
1gl9id8,To Use ChatGPT or To Not Use ChatGPT,"Hi Y'all! I'm a new Mom recently unemployed after leaving my stressful job in an office as an Executive Assistant to search for a remote job in Operations Coordination. While I have a lot of experience, I'm a little concerned as I haven't received so much as an interview invite to any of the remote jobs I've applied to (and I've been applying for 4 years, maybe 100 applications total) -- and this includes remote jobs that I'm highly overqualified for.

  
After doing some research, I learnt that a lot of applications fail to make it past the watchful eyes of these new AI programs recruiters are using to quickly filter out unqualified candidates before personally reviewing them. The recommendation for getting past these AI ATS spiders was to use ChatGPT.

  
I started using ChatGPT yesterday -- I updated my LinkedIn, resume, and filled out 3 job applications with tailored Cover Letters created by ChatGPT. While I haven't given this much time, I got to thinking -- will recruiters recognize that I'm doing this?

  
The cover letters, I'll admit, are immaculate. ChatGPT also condensed my resume into a very easily readable, shorter, and far more impressive version of my pre-existing resume (all accurate information, just worded in a very impressive way).

  
So my question is -- will recruiters realize I'm doing this? Is this the new trick to finding a job? I've never been hired to work remotely, but have worked remotely in previous positions. It seems like so many people I know have a remote job... what makes me so different that no one wants to hire me?

  
Can anyone recommend how I might land a remote Operations Coordinator position? I have over 10 years working experience wherein several of my positions included operations and project coordination (my resume reflects this). Also-- will recruiters realize I'm using ChatGPT? If they do, will they think I'm lazy? Or modern?

  
TIA!

3. I have pets, and I will need to get a pet sitter if I'm gone for multiple days

1gl6is7,Should I give up and change my plans? ,"
Hello! This summer, I graduated with a degree in Modern Languages, specializing in German, Portuguese, and Communication. During these four years, I had two unpaid extracurricular internships with the same company (I can’t disclose the name, but it is fairly well-known in my region) in the sales department and as a translator for some documents. I was offered the second internship after successfully completing the first, but that was over a year ago.

Now that I’ve graduated, I applied for a paid internship with that same company, which was looking for candidates with my background. After an interview, a test analysis, and a period of waiting, they informed me that the position would ultimately not be filled due to structural changes within the department.

This year, I had to take a gap year because, due to my indecision about how to continue with my studies or career, I didn’t secure a spot in any master’s program, nor did I apply for a scholarship. Given the situation, I don’t think I can start a career in the corporate world right now, especially as I lack experience and only have my undergraduate degree. Because of this, I’ve been considering a master’s in Tourism Management and Planning, hoping it would allow me to make use of my language skills and eventually work in a hotel.

Do you think this would be a good idea?",catbus_02,2,1.0,0,1730920629,2024-11-06 19:17:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gl6is7/should_i_give_up_and_change_my_plans/,11,2024
1gl5u9f,Canadian CPA Applying to MBB in the U.S.: Realistic or Overly Ambitious?,"


Hi

I’m considering a major career shift and would love some insights from anyone who’s been through the MBB recruiting process, especially in the U.S. Here’s my background:

Currently a Manager, in a Big 4 firm’s International Tax department. I have several years of experience across Big 4 firms, specializing in cross-border tax structuring, advisory for international clients, and tax consulting on reorganizations. I also have audit experience in a midsize Canadian firm.

Certifications Canadian CPA, AICPA (licensed to practice in Washington, New York, and Connecticut) and CFA

Education: Master of Tax at the University of Waterloo and MBA at SFU.

Goal:Aiming for a role at MBB (especially McKinsey) in the U.S.  - I'm in my early 30s. 

My questions:

1. Given my background and age, do I have a chance at breaking into MBB in the U.S.?
2. As a Canadian citizen and resident,  will applying to U.S.-based MBB roles be a disadvantage?
3. What should I focus on to increase my chances (e.g., specific skills, networking strategies, additional experience)?

My previous job was help desk technician. I got fired from help desk technician due to me having a crippling anxiety of the calls, my mind got blank during the calls and frequently i wouldn’t comprehend the issue to solve it at the moment. At some point, even I would hear the sound of the call in my mind when I was taking a break or in the restroom. But it was all in my mind. After getting fired, I found jobs:

1) Provisioning Coordinator at ISP (no call with the customers)
2) IT Project Manager
3) Sysadmin

In the 1st case, I have already passed the interview, but I don’t know the end result yet.

In the 2nd case, I have passed the interview and they gave me the learning material, but I’m not sure whether I can manage people and do tasks (since I might have ADHD going on but I can’t get diagnosed because it’s not considered a disorder here). I have also crippling anxiety to the point where I took the phone and couldn’t comprehend what was the customer saying. I get overwhelmed easily, my social battery is low. I get mentally drained after being around people after an hour.

In the 3th case, I told the employeer/whoever that I have no experience in system administration and he told me I have experience with technical stuff and maybe I can be fit for that position. But I need to go to the capital and we should talk about it and they will ask me apparently technical questions. I’m not sure about this one as well since I don’t know what they will ask.

Basically I was given minimal training and told to just play around with one of the systems to get the hang of it and then pick up any incoming work assignments off the board. The issue I’m having is that most of the stuff on the board is with systems I had no training on and the ones I do are assigned to other developers. When I ask those developers if I can take them they say they’d prefer that they work on them. Another thing is there’s another guy that was also hired at the same time as me and he was put on a major new project so he’s constantly working so in comparison I look like I’m getting no work done. 

I asked my manager a week ago if there’s anything else I can work on and he just said to pick up items off the board. At my last job my manager was always giving me assignments and putting me on various teams so I’m not used to this sort of structure and kind of at a loss.

1gl5j9l,wanting to level up my career,"hello, I am 29F and currently have been working as a Licensed Massage Therapist full time for 2 years. I actually really enjoy what I do and I'm incredibly good at it. I also have a certificate in teaching yoga and Holistic Health Coaching but I mostly use my yoga and massage license in my current practice. as I said, I do really enjoy my job it's very fulfilling and rewarding and I overall just get loads of compliments about my technique etc everyday which is a great confidence booster and only encourages me to get more defined in my skillset. obviously every job has its downs but mostly all the ups outweigh the former. I mix a lot of therapeutic techniques with some loose energy work and have never had a client not enjoy their massage. I'm highly sought after in the area I live. 

my big passion and dream my entire life has been writing and I still do write and plan on continuing with that more as a side thing. 

Im at a point right now where I just want to do more for people. I make decent money now as an LMT and could probably easily make more by just working a little extra. however, i desire to be deeply fulfilled by my career in all aspects and while massaging hits in a lot of the right places, it isn't always a high respecting job - meaning that people don't like get impressed when i say what i do for a living even if they are impressed by my skill and technique when they are on my table. 

so basically i just want a career that is like leveling up a little. I'm very smart, to my knowledge, i have like a 135 IQ but i also have a deep longing to make a big impact on people's everyday lives, hence my current career. I have thought about becoming some sort of doctor but really hate the hospital residency aspect of that. I'm just at a loss. i love what i do but just want more from a career. i want to be well respected in a highly respectable field, make comfortable income, but I also want to work with everyday layman citizens and just help people get through the ins and outs of being a person on a daily basis idk if that makes sense.

1gl2u98,"Grew fast, forced to step down faster. Next move?","Hi guys,

Thanks in advance for your time reading this, I'm using a throwaway acc. I've been working for roughly 6 years as a Product Manager in digital products (ecommerce. marketplaces and some digital transformation products). I've had the trust of the CTO, collegues and other managers that helped me grow up to being a ""Product Lead"" with a small team. But recently we have a new CEO and now my new managers and the CTOs have been either fired or left the company. Plus, I've been forced to step down from my position as a Product Lead to be replaced by Sales Director friend/person of trust.

Sadly, I've been told by this new Product Lead that my grow potential in this company is ""over"" but the Head of Digital Products (our boss) says that I have potential and the HR values me. Also that he has a business-related position that can help me ""outgrow"" my current product lead... but I am highly skeptical (promises in my current company is classic bait). Also, the Deputy Director of IT says that he has a new position for me as a Project Manager (again, highly skeptical) since I've been the one that have designed the new digital ecosystem of this company.

Right now I've enrolled in a ""Tech"" MBA since I want to work for tech companies as a product manager, but I lack the ""technical background"" as I majored in Business...(hence the ""tech"" specialization of the MBA) As far as I am able to understand the situation I have three options:

1. Looking for another opportunity as a Product Manager or Digital Transformation Consultant
2. Staying in my position and hopefully moving into a more ""business development"" position under the digital business department
3. Staying in my position until I am able to move to the ""Project Manager"" position in the IT department

For a while now number 3 has been my favourite option since I lack this ""technical background"" that is much requested in almost any Product Manager position in a tech-related company. As a Project Manager will work much closer to IT and may have a good impact in my resume, the downside is that I am skeptical that this will happen in the near future. Number 1 might seem logical but I do not know if I will be attractive to tech companies. And number 2... I fill it's just bait from my boss (I have a strong know-how on the internal applications and the new ecosystem so I guess that I've I leave that will be a mess for him) and also, I just do not enjoy ""Business Development"" as much as ""product management""...

So, people that have been in this similar situation... what should I do? Am I too focused on ""technical background"" or is it really that important to get a Product Management position? Also, I try to be as objective as I can, part of my inner anger wants to leave and forget my current company... Thanks in advance :)

TL;DR: I grew fast into a kind of a middle position manager due to my work and the trust of my managers. Changes happen and I've been forced to step down from my position and some friend of the Sales Director now manages me. I have various options: leave to a similar position (Product Manager, Digital Consultant), stay and maybe change to business development or stay and move to project management.",throwaway-Gap-3246,1,1.0,3,1730911437,2024-11-06 16:43:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gl2u98/grew_fast_forced_to_step_down_faster_next_move/,11,2024

They ended up coming up to just under 10K below the other offer and giving me a title change as well, they seemed to acknowledge they flubbed it when it came to hiring me and not giving me better comp & better title given my experience. That said, this leaves me ineligible till spring of 26' for bonus or merit increase. 

I do feel like I am drawn more towards the current employer but perhaps that is because I know the people and the job. My current employer has a positive reputation, the job itself is a bit mundane and not totally as advertised. However, workload is lighter therefore not as stressful as previous job but pays more than my last job by a bit. 

That said the other employer is also very well known and if I went to them I could almost guarantee I would be working more, but have more money to show for it. It also would be a change of pace and perhaps more exciting.  I would then think I could go nearly anywhere with their name behind me. 

  
So question is - stay with the known, more relaxed/less stressful role and known quantity or move to new role with more money, possibly more excitement/ stress?",lc2015,12,0.9300000071525574,34,1730911109,2024-11-06 16:38:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gl2pnf/started_new_job_4_months_ago_have_another_new_job/,11,2024

So so far I just plan on doing a levels for subjects that I like (which are maths, eco, psychology and business/accounting) and I don't know what I'm gonna do after that. 

Everyone is encouraging me to study abroad because the unemployment rate in my country is high. However, every time I do my research about possible careers or countries to go to I get anxiety. Its either the country is getting overpopulated or it has a high inflation rate. If its not the country that the problem, its the career. Its scary how every time a career that I might be interested in may or may not be obsolete in the future.

1gl2507,Should i stay with my job or move? ,"Hello, everyone! I would appreciate your opinion on what you would do if you were in my shoes.

1) I have been an intern at an international card payments and financial services company for the past year, and I finally secured a job with them starting on October 1st. It's a reputable company that will look good on my CV. Here are some details:

   - I am receiving a basic salary.
   - annual leave is 30 working days 
   - Health insurance is provided.
   - There is car parking available.
   - I have flexible working hours (7 AM - 3 PM or 8 AM - 4 PM).
   - However, I am not learning much; my work is primarily computer-based, and I mostly just click to complete tasks.
   - I asked for more learning opportunities, but the employees believe this is not part of their job.
   - The environment is toxic, and I often have to deal with managers who are disrespectful, yell, and treat me poorly. When I raised this issue with management, their response was that I need to learn to handle it, suggesting that I should remain silent when they yell, as it will pass; they said it's just part of the job.
   - I have been on edge since I joined and have experienced a lot of stress due to the bad behavior of managers, coworkers, and the team leader. I have somewhat gotten used to it and started to ignore what happens at work.

2) I recently received a job offer from one of the Big Four accounting firms:

   - The Salary is less by 100
   - Health insurance is provided.
   - There is no parking, which is significant since the company's location lacks free parking, and I would need to park a bit farther away and walk.
   - I would learn a great deal there, which could open significant doors for me in the future, especially since I want to work in the banking field. This opportunity could be a stepping stone.
   - I would be working in the audit field, which I understand can be challenging, and my working hours are likely to be longer.
- annual leave is 22 working days 

I am really confused because I don’t like my current job, but I’m afraid I might regret the decision if I choose the other offer.

1gl24pa,I need to make more. ,"As the title says, I need to make more money, per year. I went to school for illustration and design for commercial art and had dreams of being a game concept artist or comic artist. I still love to draw but that field became too competitive and flooded with AI its impossible to break into so I had to start working else where to pay bills.  I have worked in pest control for the better part of 4 years, 2 in the field as a technician and 2 in office as a route builder, salesman, and customer service rep, and my gf of 3 years is a teacher. I make 43k a year base pay before sales commision. This year i was #2 in the entire company nationwide in sales and only made 50k (before taxes so not even) . My gf makes 60k

  
Without getting too controversial, the results of the election combined with the ever rising cost of living has lit a fire under me. I want to make MORE. I NEED to make more. I like the company im with, i feel heard and supported by my management and my team, but I need to get myself and my soon to be fiance/wife into a better place and I don't know where to start.

I would absolutely thrive with remote work, but am not sure where to look with my current experience.

1gl21rz,Young engineer working for a start-up,"So I recently had an interview with a small company that has 5 employees that went really well. They are looking for a design engineer to do 2d layouts and 3d models. I have been working as a design engineer for the last 14 months for a company that I don't really want to work for anymore due to high turnover from a lack of respect or knowledge of what we provide for the company. After a disappointing 4% raise even though I am the longest tenured design engineer at this point due to everyone else leaving, I have decided that I should start looking for other opportunities. This is also my first engineering job so I don't have a lot of experience although I have kind of had my feet held to the fire and learned a lot over the last year. Do you think that as a young engineer it is a good idea to work at a startup? I definitely believe I can do the job they are asking as the 3d modeling and 2d layout stuff for their company seems relatively simple compared to CAD work I do now. I expect I will end up wearing multiple hats as well and would like to, as I think this would expand my skillset. I also expect I will be in charge of setting up all of the software as well. I use solidworks at my current job and would probably choose to use that at this job as well. The job seems a little scary but also exciting. The two owners also have two other companies that are still small but are  a bit more established. Is taking this job a good or bad idea? What has been your experience working for a start-up or getting hired on as the only engineer for the company. What challenges should I be prepared for, what red flags should I be looking out for, and what questions should I ask them?

The company I work for is going from bad to worse and I need to plan my next move, as I fear it may be shutting its doors soon, but I still feel very green in many career aspects. I want to keep working remotely.

I got a job in market research the pandemic when I was hired for a low salary by the owner, who is the parent of an old friend. Even know it was a friend hire for super specific contract work, over the years I worked there, I managed to grow internally and landed a solid position as research associate and panel manager. I make $27/h. This is the first and only real company I've worked for, and I worked while going to school for Psychology (B.A.) for most of my time there, until I graduated last year. Now, I don't know what's the best way to move forward!! The market in my country sucks, and I have no idea what to aim for.

**Qualifications:**

B.A. in Psychology, experience in Market Research (focus on qual research), some knowledge in Python but I'd have to relearn (adding this here as I'm open to focusing more on software if it's useful in any way)

**Challenges of my experience:**

The company is not very well unstructured and chaos reigns. There are no SOPs. Even though I've worked in the corporate world for over 4 years now, it feels like I have no experience of what a ""normal job"" is like. Most of my roles have been junior roles due to working part time. I have limited experience actually managing anything.

**In my position, would you:**

\- Look into a masters program in Brazil? They are **free** here, but less well known and will give me less connections. If so: in communications? In psych?

\- Look for another remote job in a market research firm?

\- Invest in learning a programming language better, and look for a research job that leverages that?

The IDEAL goal is to not make less than 50k-60k per year, and have a remote job that lets me move around - but this may not be realistic.

After being there for a week I met with the office leader and they were happy with me and said to ""keep doing what I'm doing"". I was happy and relieved that we both felt the same  way about my being there. I continued to show up every day and give it 110%. 
I had a few issues with the on-boarding process and was confused why no one seemed to be much help. I also noticed certain people there changed from being nice to being distant and not as nice and friendly to me anymore. 
Sure, I was timid and not very confident. But I was focused on training and learning their programs and procedures. I know once i got it I will be and feel more confident.  Not even a month there and that's when I was let go. It bothered me because I got the short end of the stick with training. I was in a small dept and 1 girl was only there for a week before she had to work from home for personal reasons and the other girl was so busy wearing multiple hats and getting ahead on work bc she was taking off a few times the following month.

1gkve7i,[Advice needed] How to work with a manager who micromanages your deliverables?,"**Background:** I've been with my company for 8 years, with the past 4 years as a commercial expert involved in creating and maintaining commercial programs. I work closely with finance and legal, I also ensure that internal processes and tools align with internal rules.

**Situation:** Due to a mass restructure, I'm being moved to a new team with similar tasks and objectives. This new team has very senior, experienced members, but a high attrition rate due to frustration with the boss.

**Manager:** The boss isn't a micromanager but insists on doing things his way. Projects tend to be long (4-12 months), which makes mid-project changes very painful. He is often unavailable for guidance, leading to last-minute major revisions. Imagine you're creating a 40-slide document, and once you're done, he wants you to rearrange everything and change the wording and maybe even go back to the stakeholders and start from scratch. 

**Questions:**

1. How can I effectively work with him to make sure my time is well spent? What do to, what do avoid? 
2. How can I communicate with a manager that tends to be unavailable? I've had such managers in the past and was really struggling.

1gkv9ry,What to do when you think a job isn’t a good fit for you anymore? ,"I’ve been working this at the railway job for almost 2 years now. The pay is amazing, the work is decent and the colleagues are nice. I’m 29 and I feel like at this age I should have found my ‘final’ job since I’ve had quite a few jobs in the past few years.

But recently I don’t feel safe anymore walking home (or outside) in the uniform we have to wear because i’m afraid people who don’t like the company I work for will attack me for some reason?

I try not to meddle in things that could compromise my safety like drunkards/beggars/big groups/smokers around the station or in the trains but it feels unjust because I do sort of have the task to make sure those people don’t hang around/harass people or do weird stuff. And if needed we can call security. I notice when I do try to solve it in a polite way it backfires and even though nothing big happens (usually they just yell at you) it’s still unpleasant and I worry about it when I get home. Because of this I keep thinking that maybe this job is not for me even though I’m good at it and it has it’s good things for sure. 

Edit: also to add as some examples; there are people who will try to kick down the check in gates to get through if they don’t have money (which can end up as a problem for the train conductor cause they have to deal with that in the train), follow people in without checking in, smoke on the platform which isn’t allowed, scam people at the ticket machines and then try to scam us by asking money back from cards they didn’t even pay for. This all annoys me and I feel like ‘they can’t get away with it’ because the gates either break or become defective. And it’s just so stupid. I just wish the station was a safe environment for everyone. Part of my thoughts also are like what am I so worried about? Letting those once in a while rude people ruin my mood? 

When I just started working there allot of my colleagues have been working there for yeaaaarsss so I thought wow this must be a really nice place to work! And it is but the small bad things make me forget all the good things. There are allot of very grateful and nice people/customers who really make the job worthwhile. 

At what point should I decide to look for something else? And then what should I be looking for? I still have a temporary contract that would be extended next April if all goes well and my team manager isn’t the greatest so i’m worried that if I try to look for something else inside the company he thinks i’m ‘weak’ or ‘unfit’ for the job and won’t extend my contract in the worst case scenario. But then again why would it be the worst case scenario? 

Any advice given is greatly appreciated and I’ll take it into account! In the meantime I’ll also just ask how others deal with negative stuff and what makes this job worthwhile for them.

1gkuw4w,Job is killing me but so did my last one. Idk what to do. ,"So I started this job late August. I was at my previous job for 2.5 years. I somewhat enjoyed it. The pay was shit, I busted my arse for the first 2 years and never felt rewarded. I routinely stressed about money and fell into a depression my last couple of months there. But I enjoyed the work and I enjoyed the people. I was also really good at it. Got this new job that pays around $200 more per week after tax but it fucking sucks. 



I’ve made a fair few mistakes as does anyone new but most of the people there treat me like a fucking idiot bc of them. My manager is fine, he’s understanding and helpful but I’m not dealing with him the entire day. Multiple times this week alone I have been blamed for doing things I didn’t do. Something gets put in the wrong place and it’s my fault. I get told to “post and print” something the first time doing it but I should’ve been just “posting” it the whole time. At no point in the last 2 months did they tell me that. We’re down a guy a few weeks back and it’s busy. I bust my arse trying to get shit done, my manager has no issue with the pace I’m doing things and yet 15 mins into my shift I get told by one of the guys to pull my thumb out of my arse. 



Then we have the issue of there being no work to do for a good chunk of the day. I have never swept more in my entire life than I have at this job. Sweeping the floor would take up a good 1-1.5 hrs of my day. Some people may love that but it’s fucking mind numbing. 



I took this job even though I was iffy on it because it was so much money. It’s $41/hr and I fucking sweep floors for at least 1 hr a day. I’ve never made this much money before and it’s nice but fuck me it’s killing me. I dread having to go to work every damn day. Not like “ugh I have to go to work” kinda dread but the “I wish the speed was higher on these roads so I could crash the car and die” kinda dread. 



I wanna mention the examples I gave are just some of the most recent ones. It’s like 2-3 times a day I get blamed for something that I didn’t do and it’s always made a big deal of. Shit will literally get moved by other people but because I processed it and it has my initials on it, it means I put it there. I can’t say anything because it makes me sound crazy. I literally put all the shit that needed to go in a pallet in there with the paperwork. Then went and took a shit. Came back and one of my supervisors is like “where’s the paperwork”. I’m standing there for 5 mins explaining to them I put it in there and that the shit in the pallet had been moved since I put my shit in there. Whole time it was under something in the pallet. I get blamed for putting it under shit. Like bro I didn’t put it there. 



I just sound like a fucking idiot. Idk what to do. Legit just wanna cry because I feel like I’m always gonna be poor and unhappy. I’m at a shit paying job that I enjoy, with people I like working with and it makes me wanna die because the money’s shit.

1gkuobr,Need outsiders' perspective on whether I should take a job or keep looking,"Hey folks, need a fresh set of eyes on this one, might be on tunnel vision mode in this decision. Anyway I got a job offer after multiple interviews and a few months of looking, but here are the factors:

* it is 20% less than my previous salary total, in that it's a day shift (versus night shift, hence the extra 20%)

* it is a full office job versus my previous one where it was fully remote

* it requires me to move cities for the office position, I'm not getting any moving benefits/bonuses so the entire process will be out of pocket

* I don't know anyone in the new city, but then again that may also be a good thing? A fresh start?

* Half of the offered salary should cover the total monthly expenses, but the full time office job would add further expenses that a fully remote position wouldn't have, versus me saving up to 70% of my salary from my previous job due to working from home

* Barring any major expenses like medical surgery or whatever, I have enough savings to maybe live off of that in my current expenses for up to 3 years total, which gives me a little wiggle room

So, do I take this job, the first job offer I got after getting fired a few months ago, or do I keep looking for something that either pays more or is fully remote?",homebase99,1,1.0,0,1730885432,2024-11-06 09:30:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkuobr/need_outsiders_perspective_on_whether_i_should/,11,2024

I am asking this because my boyfriend is studying for a bachelor's degree of Hospitality Management in college.

He finished 2 years of college so far.

He temporarily stopped his college studies to work as a stock clerk in a grocery store for 1 year.

After 1 year- he will return to college and finish his bachelor's degree.

(I already graduated college years ago and I have a bachelor's degree of Nutrition & Dietetics).

I thought that it is okay for me to ask this question here because this reddit community is about hotels.

1gkqbe5,Internship and training experience with Null Class.,"Hey everyone,



I wanted to share my experience with NullClass because I've seen some people questioning its legitimacy. I recently completed an internship there, and here's my honest take.



So, a bit about me—I'm a data science enthusiast and had been wanting to learn about Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for quite a while. Unfortunately, my college curriculum didn't offer much depth in this area, so I was always on the lookout for a place to explore it. That’s when I came across NullClass, which had a project-based course specifically on GANs.



I decided to give it a shot and enrolled in their program. I started with detailed video lectures, which covered the basics really well. The instructors explained things clearly, so even complex concepts felt approachable. By the end of the course, I was able to build and train a GAN model, which was a pretty cool milestone for me.



After finishing the course, they offered me an internship. Now, this wasn’t just some certificate for watching videos—I got to work on a real-world project involving AI-based image colorization using GANs. During the internship, I received guidance and prompt support whenever I ran into issues. The team was genuinely supportive, and they took my questions seriously, which helped me stay motivated and learn a lot more than I initially expected.



After completing the internship, I received a letter of completion, a letter of recommendation, and a stipend. I won’t lie—those were really helpful for my resume and future applications. Overall, my experience was positive, and I genuinely feel it was worth the time and effort.



To be clear, I'm not being paid or anything to write this. I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else is considering NullClass and feeling uncertain. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I received 3000 rupees stipend also. Just complete their all task , and you will also receive the same.

I need help on how to navigate this. Manager is very toxic and narcissistic. I have been under her for about a year as a supervisor. She is disorganized, lacks providing feedback, expectations or job role clarity and to top it off she is away most of the day. She leaves myself and the other supervisor to drown in work daily. 

For whatever reason it seems like this manager is protected which i don’t understand. I can’t understand how upper management does not see this manager knows nothing and is constantly offline or away from her computer. 

The team is growing and things are just getting worse with the lack of follow up and clear guidelines. We had a meeting with her manager today and she asked us to tell her what the problems are and how can she help. The problem is no one feels comfortable enough to really be honest which I don’t blame them as fear of retaliation. It’s almost like you have to say it in a way you’re not throwing that individual under the bus.

1gkoxnj,Technical Program Manager vs. Network Engineer?,"# 

Hey all,

I’m set to graduate this December and currently have two job offers from tech companies. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Technical Program Manager (TPM)**: Offers mid-to-low $70k with a $3k bonus, starting in February.
2. **Network Engineer**: Offers low $90k with a $15k sign-on bonus, starting in September.

While the Network Engineer role is the clear winner financially, I’m more drawn to the TPM role as it aligns closely with my career interests and long-term goals. The Network Engineer role feels a bit too niche and could make it tough to pivot later on.

My issue at the moment is that I need an income soon after graduating since I don’t have much of a financial cushion. Waiting until September for the Network Engineer start date is rough, but the February start for TPM doesn’t leave me completely stranded. My idea is to go with the TPM role first, and if it doesn’t work out, I could pivot to the Network Engineer position when it starts six months later. (This would mean I would have to accept the two offers)

However, I’m concerned about how it might look if I left the TPM role so early. I’m honestly not overly motivated by the money right now—I’d rather work in a role that fits well and pushes me to grow, hoping that’ll pay off financially in the long run.",born123321,2,0.75,0,1730862807,2024-11-06 03:13:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkoxnj/technical_program_manager_vs_network_engineer/,11,2024

1gkkoee,Ghost Quitting on PIP?,"Hello - I work in software sales and have been with my company for 5 years (subsidiary of IBM). I was recently put on a PIP a couple of weeks ago due to underperformance. I was very unhappy with this, as just six months ago I was receiving awards/recognition, but there are other factors (not important to this discussion) that I feel influenced their decision.

Fortunately just this week, I signed an offer with a new company and will be starting in mid November. I would like to put my two weeks in with my existing company, but feel that they will let me go day of, which will make it so I do not receive pay over the next couple of weeks. Due to this, I was planning on informing them the Friday before I start at my new job.

I have a check in meeting on the PIP scheduled for early December with my existing company, where I feel that they will fire me. My friends have advised me that I should NOT even tell my current company, and try to garner as many paychecks from them as I can at this point. In this case, from mid November until early December, I would do the bare minimum with my current company to attend meetings (albeit I anticipate not being able to attend all due to ramping up with my new organization).

I would like to understand the implications of this potential decision, from…

- A severance standpoint 
- Being paid out unused PTO
- Networking implications
- Anything I am missing

1gkj91v,Switching from fully remote role to hybrid role?,"I (27M, Data Analyst) have been fully WFH since 2020 and recently received a job offer that would require me to come in 3 days/week with a 30-minute one-way train commute in a large city. The pay increase and added benefits are pretty negligible.

I've been thinking about switching to a hybrid workplace moreso for a change in lifestyle - I definitely get cabin fever and feel a disconnect from my work when fully WFH and I hope that working in-person would be an improvement for me socially and mentally. Has anyone switched jobs for similar reasons and if so, how was the transition for you? Would you still have done it even if the added compensation was small?",BathshebaJones,1,1.0,0,1730845687,2024-11-05 22:28:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkj91v/switching_from_fully_remote_role_to_hybrid_role/,11,2024
1gkhhvh,Not sure where to go from here.,"I'm currently 35 and I've been jumping around from job to job. 

Past 15 years:
Army
Material Handler - Hospital 
Sale and service representative - Tire company
Correction officer - the state
Customer service - tire company 
Parts specialist - car dealership
Inside sales - hvac company 

As you can see it's kind of all over the place. I'm not sure where to go from here. I've tried starting a business but that completely failed. Now, I'm kind of in a place where I want to invest my time and grow. Hopefully even specialize in something.

1gkh8d3,Negotiation Tips,"I just accepted a position after being out of work since August 29th. It’s a great job with a lot of growth and opportunities and I’m really excited about the role. I negotiated pretty hard for what I received and wanted to share what worked for me. 

The initial offer came in lower than I wanted and I was only able to get them up 10k higher. What I did ask for was an additional week of vacation (pretty common and he said yes right away). The other thing I negotiated was a guaranteed 10 percent increase for the following year (assuming that agreed upon goals are met). He was onboard and accepted the counter offer. 

It’s better than a bonus that you receive once and your annual increase (should you receive one) will bank off of the higher rate.

1gkfkop,Advice for someone in management at a struggling business. ,"This may be longer because of context so I apologize in advance. TLDR: I’m struggling on whether or not I should stick it out at my current company or leave due to our AP being over 350K and not being able to do any production because of material holds. 
Backstory: 
I started in August of 2021 at a higher end kitchen and bath remodeling company as the office manager. There was 5 of us in the office at that point. In May of 2022 we were bought by a new owner. 2 months after that the GM of 20 years became ill and never came back to work. Nobody was equipped to take over project management so we started struggling on schedules and material deliveries. We made money the first year, but year 2 we lost $600K. We have high turnover in the office, because the owner has other businesses and combined them under our roof which strained employees, as well as just not having the right people. 
This year is looking like we’re going to lose around $400k. I am the Operations Manager now, and basically hold the company together. Several employees told me if I leave they’re done too, so I feel an obligation to stay. The owner has also taught me a lot, and given me fair compensation compared to where I started, but the stress is eating at me. Everyday vendors are calling us, I wake up every day and wonder if this is the day the locks are changed because we haven’t paid rent since May. The owner keeps taking what money we do get in the account for the other businesses, since we have also taken money from them. It’s a nightmare, but I feel stuck. I feel embarrassed because we have an office full of new employees who hear bits and pieces of our struggles, and I’m also in a smaller town and everyone talks. 

The owner also does not live in the area and only comes into town once every 6 weeks and has a higher up day job as well… 

Any advice is appreciated.. I’m just feeling like I’m on an island and have nobody else to talk to about this. ",jeashley,2,1.0,1,1730836281,2024-11-05 19:51:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkfkop/advice_for_someone_in_management_at_a_struggling/,11,2024
1gkffkp,Taking a New Job to Pay for Career Change,"Hi all, curious what your thoughts are on this situation. I'm currently interviewing for a better paying position at a different company in an industry I've been employed in for eight years now. For years now I've wanted to make a big career change into a different, more technical industry that requires very specialized training, but due to existing financial obligations and the high cost of entry, I've mostly been treading water at current jobs trying to save for the leap. Eventually I decided my strategy was to keep seeking out opportunities to boost my income so I can more aggressively pay off debt and build up a good savings base for the eventual jump without taking on any new debt, but that ultimately means seeking new job opportunities only to use them as stepping stones. 

My question is how do I then approach the question of what my career aspirations are for new roles? It seems interviewing companies are eager to see a willingness and desire to advance within the company, and while I don't outright hate the work I'm doing now and am a reliable, hard-working employee, I'm just really not interested spending the rest of my life doing this. It feels wrong to lie about career aspirations, and I know the age-old advice of don't just take a job for the money (been burned by that before), but I'm pretty set on switching careers at this point in my life and would really like to just use these opportunities to become financially stable (before I shake it up and possibly lose that stability again haha). I just don't know how to approach this specific question, or maybe there's something I'm not considering or I'm thinking about it in the wrong way.

Thanks in advance.",robdabear,1,1.0,0,1730835917,2024-11-05 19:45:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkffkp/taking_a_new_job_to_pay_for_career_change/,11,2024

1gke6g5,Need Advice: Want to apply for another role with company I’ve only been employed at for 1 month,"I’ve been in a new role at a new company for a little over a month. It doesn’t seem like it’s been long enough for me to gauge my happiness with the role, but I have this gut instinct that it is a mutually wrong fit. However, I saw another job posted today within the company that I applied for earlier this year when I was still with my former employer. At that time, the job had been filled internally and I never interviewed for it. Now that I see it posted again, I’m interested in applying because I think it will be a much better fit for me, but that would mean informing my manager first because she will receive an alert about my internal application. If I decided to do this, I’m curious how others would approach the situation. Obviously, I would need to have an honest conversation with my manager, but I need some advice on the approach. I know it would throw a wrench in things with my current role but I really do feel this other role will be better aligned with my goals and personality. I just want to go about this tactfully and mindfully. IF I go through with it. I want to, I’m just hesitant of the awkwardness. Especially if I applied for it and didn’t get it because my manager will then know I’m in a role on her team that I’m not totally happy with. Would appreciate any advice.

1gkdixw,Telling the company I am interviewing with about a delayed joining date.,"I am currently in the final round of interviews with a mid-size biotech company and I believe the topic of when I can join will come up. I was seeking advice about how to answer that in a way that won’t hamper my chances of getting the job. For context:- I haven’t been to my home country in 6 years and a couple of months ago I booked tickets to see my parents and my currently ill in laws in Jan 2025. It’s a month long trip that I am crazy excited about and I can’t even think about cancelling that trip. On the other hand I’ve also been applying for jobs persistently for months now and have finally found something that might work. 

I was wondering if things go well in the final round is it possible to convince the team to maybe get a later start date of Feb 25? So far in none of the interview rounds have we spoken about a potential joining date but I think they might be looking for someone to start in Jan right after the holidays. Does a delayed(by one month) start date affect hiring decisions?

1gkcu0v, I decided today,"I took this job because I’d been a contractor for a while and didn’t have full time experience. They hardballed me on salary, gave me an entry-level title, my boss claimed the credit for my work and the incentives bonus for it, and I report to coworkers with 1/6th my experience. It’s high stress because the business isn’t doing well, and that breeds toxicity. Deadweight is abundant and blame is handed out 100x before credit. My minor learning curve mistakes were my performance review, and to read it you’d think I didn’t do a thing for the last year. 

In my field, give 10 people a project and you get 10 different products, all right. We’re paid for applying our experience, not following a formula or checklist. Today I finished a project that another writer destroyed. This isn’t the first time she’s taken the initiative to review my work and rewrite it, not to any other standard than her own internal standard. I could do the same, if I was a dick and had the authority, but I’m not and I don’t.  

Condescending would be a good start, but I know my work exceeds industry standards. Because she has title and a degree I don’t, it’s not what she said, it’s that SHE said it. At our status meeting this morning they discussed how to proceed with the project, while I was sitting there, without including me. I wasn’t there. First 6 months when I wasn’t working with her my work was fine. 15 years working for clients my work was fine. Now it won’t be. 

Today I decided to leave as soon as I can. I’m close to retirement and hoped to end my career in a high, but it’s not happening here and I don’t have the personal credibility to start another job or fight it out at this one. I am done. 

Going straight to retirement will be hard, if I live too long I’ll be in trouble, but living in this place isn’t worth it. They can fire me or I’ll just put in my notice.

1gkckfn,2024 Graduate Working as a GCP Cloud Engineer Trainee – Seeking Career Guidance on Next Steps?,"Hello everyone,

I'm a recent 2024 graduate currently working as a ""GCP Cloud Engineer Trainee."" I just learned that my role is mostly support-based, and to be honest, the pay is low. I'm starting to feel insecure about my career path and the potential growth in this area. I am hoping to transition to a role with better salary.

1gkcabp,I’ve been thinking about quitting my apprenticeship since I started and the feeling won’t go away.,"I’m 17 and last year I did an Administration course that I really enjoyed, so I decided to do an Apprenticeship to get paid. I get £12,200 (about) every year so around £1000 per month which so far is great and I haven’t even been payed 1 full month. I started at the beginning of October and I work 8:45am - 5pm Monday - Friday (4:30 on Fridays) and I like the work environment, my manager is nice but strict, nobody is necessarily toxic and the workload isn’t that bad. 

But ever since i started, I really have wanted to quit due to the hours and the sheer boredom of an office job. I wake up at 6:30am every day, leave the house at 7:20, get to my job at anywhere from 8-8:30 depending on bus times etc. I leave at 5 and get home from 6-7 once again depending and it’s really taking its toll on me. I feel like I have no time to do anything. Originally I gave it a month to see if it got better, it got slightly better but nowhere near enough.

Every time I remotely complain to my family, I get lash back ‘You’re getting paid be grateful’ ‘Oh stop being dramatic’ ‘You chose this’ (which I kinda didn’t because my mother was the one who pressured me into it slightly) ‘Other people have it so much worse than you’ ‘Just suck it up’. 

I have until July 2026 on my apprenticeship but I don’t know if I can last that long, this is the most draining thing I’ve ever done. Am i genuinely just being dramatic and this is normal? Or should I quit? And if I do quit, what do I even do?

1gkc22b,"Coworker acts extremely rude to myself and other colleagues, how should I deal with this professionally?","It's a very long story but to give some context: I (25F) work with someone in research (32M), while this group is a funded research group, it is rather lax on professionalism.

This has already been creating tension with two male post docs, one of which is the subject of this question. They instigate conflict, treat others poorly and have no respect for professional boundaries. One of which various complaints have been made to our boss about but he does nothing. 

Now with christmas approaching I and another colleague volunteered to plan the christmas party, but one of our colleagues is measuring abroad, the aforementioned 32M. In the email for the poll about the party I asked for a response in a week, I waited two before picking a date with the most votes (originally I asked for them in a week). Now I didn't know when this colleague returned (we're not close), and the week of the 16th (when he returns), I'm not available due to my sister visiting, and someone will be leaving our group the end of the week before, so we wanted to include him. 

Now this coworker made a snarky reply to everyone complaining we didn't make a date that would include him. I responded that there were two weeks for him to respond and if it the future he would respond more promptly and directly, we could've offered more dates (even knowing I and the other would not be available). I sent this message directly as I felt like people in the work environment this shouldn't be made into a public spectacle. His response was even ruder saying ""this isn't the presidential vote, so he expected we should be more flexible"", furthermore he CC'ed our boss in such a rude email (not that he'll do anything). I decided to not respond to such an email, as if he wants to be rude, then I shall not entertain him. But this is only a small instance of it, he talks behind our backs, points blame when there should be none, is we have screenshots and voice clips of him being horrible, but most situations are done in person. 

At this point we're so used to being ignored that we don't know what to do or if it's even worth trying to do anything. Does anyone have any professional advice? To add context he is funded by an external organisation but his funding ends in 5 months.",ineedawaffle3,3,1.0,2,1730827487,2024-11-05 17:24:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkc22b/coworker_acts_extremely_rude_to_myself_and_other/,11,2024

1gkai4m,Should I add my current (not so good) job to my CV for a new opportunity application?,"I’m a fitness instructor specializing in things like yoga, pilates etc, mostly working for hotels and resorts. For the past two years, I worked for a major hotel brand, and things went well—I had strong KPIs, my managers liked me, and I fit in really well with the company culture. But over time, I felt isolated and pretty unhappy living on a small island with no social life, and I started feeling a bit neglected by the company too. So, in August, I decided to leave.

In September, I took a new offer with another hotel chain, which is part of the same holding company as my previous job but has a totally different culture. I thought this change would be a good move, trying a new company and living a new place etc. But it's not the best. The island is even smaller and feels almost uninhabited, basically just tourists and hotel staff. I don’t hate it here, but I don’t love it either.

The work isn’t as good a fit either. My current hotel focuses on activities I’m not super strong in and they’re not giving me many opportunities to teach the classes I excel at. I’m in this kind of “internship” phase where they don’t fully trust me yet, which is frustrating given my experience. Overall, the culture here doesn’t feel right for me I also feel I'm not the right fit for them, and I’m already considering leaving.

Here’s where it gets interesting: A few days ago, one manager from my previous company reached out about an instructor role opening up in a few months at a different resort. The location is amazing and it's somewhere I already wanted to try when I was working with them. I also know that company culture is a much better fit for me, and I functioned better with them than I do with my new company. But I left that company for reasons, I don’t want to get carried away by excitement over a new location without thinking it through.

The manager from my old company asked for an updated CV. My question is: should I include this current job on it?

On one hand, it shows that I’m still active in the industry and gaining experience. But I worry that my potential new managers might contact my current hotel, where things haven’t exactly been smooth. Since both hotels are owned by the same holding company, I also wonder if they might feel weird about “stealing” me from another brand within the group.

What would you do in my situation? Include the current role or leave it off? Thanks!",atropezones,1,1.0,1,1730823613,2024-11-05 16:20:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gkai4m/should_i_add_my_current_not_so_good_job_to_my_cv/,11,2024
1gka1gd,Meeting our new svp during a reorg - should I treat this as an interview? ,"For some short context I'm 30F and work in marketing and have been at my company for 7 years. 1.5 years ago another (huge) company bought us and August they announced basically a reorg/mass layoff which consisted of jobs going to india, layoffs and merges. The issue is that they announced it and they won't know where we all sit until January. This has caused so much unrest that they have turned off comments during town halls and suddenly we've had like 3 surveys go out about 'how they're doing' but we have had to input our employee numbers. 


Onto the issue. The new svp that oversees our new global marketing department is coming in. This will be the only time we see her between now and when the reorg occurs in January. We have never met her before since the company who bought us moved her over. 


My manager (senior director) keeps saying don't treat this as an interview and that this is casual. But he also says bring in work I've done and really put the spotlight on myself. But then he says stop worrying it's casual. But THEN he says make sure to bring your best work with you! I ask why and he just goes because you want to make yourself look good. Okay but if it's casual why does it matter? 


I am also meeting with a co worker at the same time so it'll be the four of us. I asked what they were bringing and they go why would we bring anything this isn't an interview? And I go but I figured we'd show off... And I got cut off and they got sort of stern with me and goes this isn't an interview this is strictly casual why would we need to bring anything? 


Then I asked my manager to clarify and once again he goes don't treat this as an interview just keep it casual but THEN goes make sure to bring some stuff you've worked on that you're proud of and to shine. 


I don't know how to feel about this? She's coming in once, meeting all of us then vanishing until the reorg happens.


Half the department is treating this as this is it, we're meeting her and she is going to determine our fates which is how I feel. The other half is casual and just going in like this is a chit chat session. 


I also need to note during this merge the mother company is merging 7 marketing departments together into one global marketing department. That means any jobs over lap and positions in other marketing departments will be put on a board and from what I understand everyone will be headed together apples to apples to see who fits with the new marketing conglomerate. This was confirmed by our vp of marketing and how they are grading all of us to see who makes the cut.

1gk7xms,Best move from here?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently 24 and employed at a small financial services company making around 56k/year. Unfortunately, from where I'm currently at, there are very, very few options for advancement. I'm currently at the top of the ""ladder"" before management. 

I've applied for 3 management positions now and have been passed up every time, despite having been sent through a leadership program, assigned to train people and write procedures, collaborate with other teams to decide best procedures, and other management tasks. Upper management has also said I am an excellent management candidate and I just need to wait. 

I'm skeptical on this, though, as the last manager role that I applied for was brought to my attention as an ""opportunity,"" but it turns out they already decided on someone external and were just looking for a backup. This was never disclosed to me and I feel like it was misrepresented to me. 

So basically, I want to earn more, as 56k seems low, considering I have been here for nearly 5 years, am an unrecognized/unofficial relationship manager, have the highest accuracy on the team, work lots of overtime, and have helped management do their jobs. 2% raises each year aren't keeping up with the rest of the economy.

1gk7ie2,How should I act after making a mistake at work?,"
Hey everyone! Wanted to share this quiet unpleasant experience at work and see what you guys think about it.

This if my first job out of college. I have been working for 6 months and I work in advertising. The job did not require any experience, meaning they would teach you and train you. I was hired together with another guy who is 10 years older than me. The pay is not great but considering the fact I was excited to learn on the job I accepted the offer. 

I have been doing well. Everybody says that they like working with me and that I stand out with my enthusiasm. I have voluntarily taken more work on myself than some of the others in my team. All in all, I was doing great up until this week.

Two months ago we had a new hire. It’s also a young girl, my age. Somehow I ended up being the one who helped her the most. Answering her questions, teaching, explaining, correcting. All that. And no, that’s not a part of my job but she kept contacting me for some reason. Maybe because we r both girls the same age and she felt more comfortable doing it with me or maybe as she mentioned the reason for that is the fact that she doesn’t understand our team lead very well. Which I get, his explanations are not the cleanest. Mind you, I myself was only working for 3 months when I had to teach her. 

The other guy who was hired doesn’t do anything extra and keeps it lowkey. Only does the bare minimum, never offers to help. I used to judge him, now I think maybe I should have been the same and stayed out of it.

We have a routine of checking each others tasks to avoid mistakes. I wouldn’t say they are done in a way that ensures quality but usually I’ve always noticed the mistakes and pointed them right away.

A situation happened. There was a campaign, which raised questions and again, the girl contacted me to ask. I sent her an example of a campaign but stated that she shouldn’t fully copy it, just use it as a reference. While checking the campaign it looked quite weird to me and I asked her to contact the colleague who assigned the task to her to make sure this is the way its supposed to be. She didn’t specify what they discussed and told me “yes, she said thats the way it should be”. So, I ended up approving the task.

Three weeks later, I noticed that something is off. The bill for the campaign is 5k instead of 1K. I started the discussion in my chat and obviously from here on everything went to shit. 
My team lead started investigating the issue. He asked who gave her the example. She pointed at me. It is true but I indicated that this task should be done a bit differently. Who checked the task? Also, me. Yep. Not looking good. So, all in all, I am in a situation where I am probably the one who will have to take the blame. I don’t see anyone blaming the girl who has been working here for two months and I don’t think she should be blamed. I have been working here for 5-6 months as well, so not that long. 

To be quite honest with you, I wouldn’t say that the learning process was very good. The team lead is constantly ignoring your messages, the explanations are not very clear and the documentation is not consistent. I have even renewed it myself because of the issues it caused. He is overworked, so I understand his point of view as well.

I am not sure if they found a way to settle this issue with the partner. I am not sure whether I am going to be fired or not. But I can see how my team lead talks to me right now and it is obvious he resents me.
To be fair he initially did reach out and comfort me saying this has happened before and I shouldn’t be so worried. But even if everything is settled and I don’t end up being fired, all of my hard work, efforts, enthusiasm, extra help at work, the tasks I voluntarily completed, will now be discredited. I was working so hard in hopes to get a raise but I do not believe they will give it to me after this situation especially when the annual review is only a month away.



What should I do? Nobody has talked to me about this yet. Should I leave this job? Should I keep trying? I have been very anxious about this and have expressed how bad I feel about the mistake.

I’m reaching out here because I’m really frustrated and not sure what to do next. I’m currently in my final semester as a grad student at Bishop’s University, majoring in Computer Science. Before coming here, I spent five years working as a DevOps Engineer, so I have a decent amount of hands-on experience with cloud and infrastructure—fields I genuinely enjoy working in because of the constant new challenges they bring.

Since it’s my last semester, I’ve been applying for internships to gain more industry experience in Canada and ideally transition into a role after graduation. So far, I’ve sent out over 100 applications, but it’s been rejection after rejection. It feels disheartening, especially because each time, the response is along the lines of ""we’re not moving forward with your application.""

I don’t care if it’s a job I don’t really like, but I think customer service is something I really can’t stand, I just want something where I can make my money and be done for the day, please any advice would be helpful - I don’t know if this is relevant but I have autism as well which may link to why customer service is something I find unbearable, so If anyone knows about any jobs people with autism are stable in that would be helpful too🫶🏻",xsoppi,1,1.0,0,1730811182,2024-11-05 12:53:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gk5yq6/i_dont_know_what_job_to_get_into_and_i_dont_want/,11,2024

1gk5pfl,Is there any way to recover from extreme burnout?,"I recently turned 40. I have been in IT for a little over 10 years and I feel like I want out. I have been thinking about going into a trade, either electric or HVAC. 



I went to school for IT about 10 years ago. It was not a good school, one of those cert programs that charges too much for what they offer. I did get a good job in support for a software company. It was supposed to be a short term job (3-5 years) to get experience to get into systems administration. The issue is that sysadmin work generally pays less than what I was making, and I was still learning, so I stopped job searching and hung around. Eventually I got so stagnant, that I applied for a management role and I have regretted it pretty much immediately. 



Now the IT job market is a nightmare, and I did not have the experience needed for what I want to do, and a lot of jobs that are close to the same pay that I am making now are senior roles that are looking for pages worth of experience that I just do not have, nor do I have the ability to fake it. The only other option is to get a bachelors degree and go into security, which I do not think I want, nor do I want the debt from that. 



My line of thinking now is that if I have to take a pay cut to leave, why not just go into a new career. The opposing thought is that it is a rather big risk and if I hate that too, then I have potentially screwed myself in more ways that one. I see a lot of complaints about the IT job market, but that could be mainly because I am in IT. Is the whole job market the same, or would jumping ship get me a better deal and the ability to move back into my pay range over the course of a few years?

1gk5mt7,[Need Advice] Messy career timeline having 8 months career break/unemployment. How can I climb back? Should I even?,"Background \[23M\]:

* Bachelors in IT, completed 2023
* 6 months Software engineer internship + PPO offer got extended to 11 months internship + PPO
* Lay off after the first 3 months of Full time experience. Feb 24'
* 8 months of career gap with no up-skilling or preparation for what's next

\---\*--- Can skip this over - Company exp and Family drama ---\*----

Situation at Company:

I wasn't the best of their employees and no significant work contribution in the end to show on my resume. I worked hard indeed, just didn't know what work counts as significant and when I was being used just as an extra hand. Company was shrewd and I was too naive into the corporate world. (Cheap interns promised good full time CTC then extended internships then layoffs. Voila!) After covid they over-hired undeniably, they admitted. Too many people left unmanaged. It was too late until I realized as I was already laid off. Only afterwards I could connect the dots and so did they align. Having grabbed the shorter end of straw amid this competitive job market after AI and everything where the ceiling for junior developers have been raised, or so I understood.

Family drama:

Next 8 months (more like a year, since I was employed) got dedicated to my impulsive suicidal mom and my abusive harassing manipulating narcissist father (towards not just my mum but me and my lil bro too) and their fights. Or that's how it turned out to be. Got sucked in losing my job or prioritized family over my young career, I ended up as the biggest fool in the room. After lawyers, cops, counselors, seeking advice from countless peers, relatives and officials couldn't fix their marriage nor did they separate them in a divorce. They continue fighting the same way with the difference of me being stuck at home between their crossfire and mind games. Deadlock. From ignoring precious advice of finding another job asap to prioritizing family getting emotional over my mum (In the end, people don't change, neither do they listen, finally giving up on her as well) to having debts to pay and still being unemployed as I didn't apply and unskilled.

\----\*------\*-------\*-----

TLDR: Two big lessons learned but they don't fill the plate or pay bills. So here am I trying again in Tech job market (Software Dev/Eng) 

While seeking/applying for jobs in last few days I noticed 3 things -

I have 11 months internship exp, 3 months full time and 8 months career gap.

1. Hiring for Freshers prioritises 2024 and 25' batch. (I'm 23)
2. Full time hires want people with at least 1 year full time experience, They don't count internship.
3. A huge career gap of 8 months an immediate red flags

Of course If I was skilled enough to bag it I would've or had relevant workex. That's not the case. I know I need to work hard to turn the odds. Where should I start give me some actionable steps to heal the scars on my profile. Or How should I approach the situation. I friend suggested adding fake exp to cover gap, Someone asked me to start learning DSA. Has someone been in similar situation before and how have you dealt with it in past. 

Need insights on how you'd approach this and how should I view this situation amid all the self doubt and being left behind.",WatermelonWOseeds,1,1.0,0,1730810120,2024-11-05 12:35:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gk5mt7/need_advice_messy_career_timeline_having_8_months/,11,2024
1gk5j7k,What line of profession would suit me the best? ,"A little about myself, I'm a 21 year old final year engineering student from India. I'm doing my engineering from a tier 3/4 college.

Electronics and communication is my domain, although I must say I'm doing this course against my will. I originally wanted to do Computer Science or IT within engineering as the tech industry, especially the IT industry, has been a huge employer in my country, but, I couldn't do either of those and ended up choosing electronics and communication. 

I do like coding and I'm currently learning Java from MOOC website but, I don't think I would enjoy doing big ass projects like building an app or a software for a company in future. 

Feels like a lot of work. I was initially interested in coding but, now, I'm losing it. 

Moreover India also has this supply-demand thing in terms of employment in IT. A lot of folks apply for coding jobs in my country. I honestly don't know if I would stand out from the rest of the crowd.

I'm an imaginative person who likes to know information, read and write. So I was wondering if I could try my luck with these jobs. 

What are these jobs for a fresher like:
1) Marketing management 
2) PR management 
3) Product management
4) Digital marketing 

I'm ready to learn skills required for these jobs.

I also looked into jobs like SEO and Market research analyst but, I have heard that SEO and Market Research Analyst jobs could be replaced by AI in near future. 

I looked into product management but, I have also heard that product management doesn't pay well. Some say that it doesn't pay well in the beginning, at least here in India, but, as one gains experience, it would pay well.

Basically, I want a job that wouldn't be replaced by AI and would open up opportunities for me, both, within India and abroad. If possible, I would love to pursue for  higher studies after working for few years.

1gk5go7,New job / Too Idealistic ? ,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

I started a new job in the end of September and I'm unsure if I made the right choice. I often feel uneasy, like people think I'm not capable. Even the person who started at the same time as me, in a technician role (while mine is research scientist), sometimes treats me as if I know nothing.

I have several experience, and people have always been pleased with my work, so this is a new feeling for me. I’m always taking notes, asking questions, and staying open to advice and feedback, but this uncomfortable feeling persists.

I worry that I might be the problem because everyone else has been here for a long time and says it’s a great workplace. The work itself also isn’t what I expected—it’s mostly the same type of projects. The people are nice, but they seem surprised when I sometimes prefer to spend my lunch break alone, since they always stick together, even if they don’t all get along.

I joined a large company that aims to address global challenges, but I feel like I should be out in the field, doing hands-on research and really contributing to climate action, rather than just working here. Am I just idealistic? Should I accept that I might not have the impact I wanted in this role?

I’ve spent 10 years in digital ad sales in Dubai, with on-target earnings around £300,000 (including salary, stock, and incentives). While I’ve enjoyed the lifestyle here, I’m starting to feel ready for a change—both in terms of work dynamics and environment—and am exploring new opportunities for growth.

I’m in the final stages for a position with a major global entertainment brand, in an identical role to my current one (same client base), but as the first sales hire in the region, based in London with frequent travel. The on-target earnings would be around £170,000-£190,000 (salary + sales incentive), with optional stock.

1. **Career Growth**: What’s the potential for long-term growth as the first regional sales hire in a major company like this? Could this lead to unique exposure or advancement?
2. **Salary in London**: Is this compensation competitive for the role and city? What kind of cost-of-living adjustments should I consider compared to Dubai?

1gk376j,How to Negotiate a Salary Adjustment for Relocation to Canada for a Managerial Role?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been working with my current company for 4 years and have been in a managerial role for the past year. Recently, I received an offer to relocate to Canada for the same company, but the salary offered is 55,000 CAD annually. Given my experience, both with the company and in a managerial capacity, and the higher cost of living in Canadian cities, I feel that a salary closer to 100,000 CAD would be more appropriate for my role and experience.

I’m really excited about the opportunity, but I want to ensure the compensation reflects my qualifications and the responsibilities I’ll be taking on. I’m planning to bring this up with HR, but I want to approach it the right way.

1gk327e,Help on next career moves,"Hello everyone,  
Following an analytical as possible summary of my journey so far, then maybe ask for more info if needed, I would like to get advice on how to progress because I am currently feeling very indecisive.  


**Age:** **27**, 28 in 2 months  


**Current RAL**: **43k** from 7 months +3k entry bonus (already cashed)  
**Current role:** Senior cybersecurity consultant  
**Current company**: multinational consultancy but not big 4 (6.000 employees)  


**Previous RAL**: I was billing as vaat number holder/freelancer on a Cybersecurity startup, **annual fixed turnover 37k**  
**Previous role:** Cybersecurity specialist/ all-rounder/Jack-all-the-trades-in-startup  
**Previous company**: Startup, on paper. In fact development of a SaaS for SMEs that offered cybersecurity ‘functions’. Fairly up-to-date software stack, the stack was roughly: nodejs, .net 7, mongodb. 

Obviously I wasn't also a software engineer, but being a startup of 5 people I ‘got my hands on’ a bit of everything, in the sense of having read the code, helped debug, developed functional requirements, devised new functions etc.  


**Total years of experience** in IT security: almost **4** (3 years in the start-up, 7 months in consulting)  
**Educational qualification**, this is the sore point: I stopped at the **Bachelor degree......in philosophy**😅. I know, insult me, I made a big mistake and I am aware of it, I don't want to justify myself in any way.  
**Languages spoken**: **bilingual** since birth **Italian and French**, **English C1,** I would like to try to learn German better but for now let's say A2, so irrelevant.  


I've signed a retention pact, which obliges me to return the 3k received as an entry bonus if I leave my current company before 2 years so, unless I pay this amount back,  I'm stuck here another 17 months at least; but this is not really a concern.  


I'm a afraid that arrived where I am now, barring some small advancement that consulting might offer with a few years of experience, with almost negligible ral increases, my career will become stagnant and movement upwards will be very limited.  


I am ready to get back into the game completely and resume my studies. The problem is that the possibilities are many and the investment I would have to make both in terms of money and time would be very high.  


I cannot predict whether in the long term it is:  


**1. better to focus on a executive Master's (which is not a Master Degree, I think this is something popular in my country, Italy, but that translates into Master degrees elsewhere)** like this one: [https://www.bbs.unibo.eu/master-executive/executive-master-in-tecnologyinnovation-management/](https://www.bbs.unibo.eu/master-executive/executive-master-in-tecnologyinnovation-management/) where I would have a relatively low investment in terms of time: 12 months, part time, weekends. BUT high in economic terms (for me), this one I linked costs 15k€.  
Basically in the 15-20k€ range I'd dip into my savings (without going into debt thankfully). I left home at 18 years old so 20k€ is a lot for me.

**2. better to start over with a  STEM Bachelor degree**, like in electronic engineering (a passion of mine). Economically more affordable. 

I have already done the maths and for a university like the polytechnic of Milan I would be in the range that pays around 2k€ in annual fees, in 3 years (assuming I don't go off course) is about 6k€ investment. A third of the master's degree above and spread over 3 years. Obviously I would study as a non-attendee while continuing to work.  
Very time-consuming though: I would end up with ‘only’ another Bachelor degree at over 30 years old. So I would remain at my current level of education, only in a more STEM field.  


How would you go about this? Are there any other options I'm not considering? If I chose a master's what schools would you recommend for a technical master like the one above, so not MBA?  
  
Thank you!

1gk3219,Switching from Engineering to Creative Agency,"Background: I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree from a large state university in 2018. Worked at a large defense contractor from 2018 through 2022 where some would consider this company to be their dream company (Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, ETC). 

Voluntarily left to pursue full time video and production freelancing in 2022 because I decided if there was a time to do anything “crazy” it would be before I had a mortgage, kids or anything major to consider. I freelanced for roughly 1.5 years and realized how much I hated grinding for gigs, being highly undervalued and getting taken advantage of in the creative/freelance space. 

At the end of 2023, I went back into corporate as an estimator/applications engineer at a medium sized firm. I will say it took me a good 8-10 months to be able to land a job back in the engineering world. There was constant questioning as to why I would quit my first stable corporate role to jump into freelancing.

The job I currently have now is not bad what so ever. I have benefits, my relationship with my boss is good, I work realistically 30-35 HRs a week and never have to take work home with me. The downsides of this job are that it doesn’t necessarily require an engineering degree since it’s more project management than anything and the room for growth at the company is limited since there aren’t many positions internally.

I got referred to a position at an agency working as a full-time video creator this week. The work itself is not super exciting but it would be in the creative space but this time with more stability since I would be a full time employee. The pay would be the exact same as my current engineering position and I would be working remote as opposed to 4 days in office.

My main concern is the longevity of the career as a video creator/editor and would switching again into a creative role kill my future outlook into any engineering position since I could be considered a flight risk?

1gk1wxx,Lost and afraid- help! ,"Background: 12 years of nonprofit/higher-Ed fundraising, got my mpa in 2020 started working for a foundation, had a really toxic boss situation where she pushed me out and effed with my confidence a lot. I’m still not over and it (will get to that in a minute.) in 2023 my husband lost his job and we have two kids so I got a second part time fundraising job that I worked nights. When I got fed up with the way my boss at the foundation was treating me  I felt so scared and lost and reached out to people who I admired or who did work that I admired. I was interviewing like crazy and had some offers. I had coffee with a woman I met with I had worked with many times through the foundation job, she works at a council of government in economic development. She is great and aspirational! During that meeting she said she wanted to hire me and shared three different projects with me. I was elated to continue community work. 

Fast forward to now: I turn down three job offers to take this one as a regional planner.. which I am not an aicp or anything so I was nervous but also excited to learn that skill set and to be challenged. My first day is very end of July and she is out of town for several weeks- she sends me an email of projects to work on. There is no onboarding and I do the best I can but coming off of my last job I’m not feeling confident, I’m feeling lost and like I’m not worth anything, or capable of things. I’m helping someone else with projects when my boss returns- we meet for the first time at the end of august she invites me to conferences and things to learn but we never have a “here is your lane” conversation. The projects I’m working on are inherited and very disparate topically. I push things forward but falter with one complicated project that she’s been working on for years. It’s a multi state project with over 30 stakeholders who Ive just met and who mostly don’t respond to me when I need things for the application. Again she shares things with me and projects that are coming. She’s very kind but then today my coworker is like “did you see the job they posted? Looks like kinda what you’re doing?” I hadn’t seen it, but confided in him that I feel lost because I don’t have a lane or a project- he says that he has been there and to give it time. I read the description and it’s for a “project planner” and there are clear guidelines, the job sounds amazing but also says things like “self motivated, work independently” so I’m starting to feel insecure but brush it aside. Our ED brings me into a conversation about business recovery stuff and then asks me to set up a meeting about this with my boss, myself and him. I bring this up in my meeting with my boss to say “should I schedule this?” And she tells me about the job and then tells me very kindly that we should talk about what I want to take on as my own - I’m elated to hear this but can’t help but feel like she’s disappointed in me and Like I messed up somehow. She’s super busy and has a lot on her plate following a regional thing that happened but, I also still have no idea what my lane options are. And what she wants and needs from me even though I’ve asked. This is a long rant so thank you to anyone who stuck with it! What should I do?

1gk1g46,I’m becoming a rotten human being :/ I can tell my heart has changed from years of different trauma & because of my work culture. Not sure how to even help myself ,"Not using trauma as an excuse but it’s what happened.

I used to be a really kind person. Someone who genuinely wanted to help others and was kind with no motives.

After years and years of abuse from different people- partners, friends, work, etc

I can tell….my heart is different :/


Now I don’t want to help anyone and I secretly hate it when others succeed or are doing great. I feel envious when people have an easier life. I feel envious and I can tell my heart has so much hate, anger and sadness

Im not sure how we got here.


But I do door to door sales and when I first started doing it, I was kind, helped others- but the people I work with were some of the most rotten people I have ever met- the greed took over them. (There is a high commission to this sales job) and it is very dog eat dog

After doing this for 11 years……I realized that I am now like them, those people I despised, the people who wouldn’t want to help others succeed because the company pits us up against one another to be the “best”. 

I ended up becoming the best and when people ask for help, I don’t want to help them because I don’t want to lose being the best. It’s horrible and I hate that I’ve become this way. I am selfish and greedy I feel. 

I don’t know how to stop this when this is the company culture. Part of me is like, well maybe the way to stop being like this is to help someone learn from me but the selfish part of me just won’t do it :/ I’m probably insecure and place too much of my identity in my job, people always try to watch what I’m doing to learn and I get angry. I feel like they’re taking from me/using me for the skills I learned on my own when they’re mean to me 

Sometimes I think it’s better to just quit so I can go back to being a nice person but the bills aren’t going to pay on its own :/ 


Has anyone gone through this or have any tips? Please be gentle :/ 

I am being vulnerable and honest of what I’m seeing in me and I don’t like it at all, I’m turning into something I’m not….I get really depressed about it. Sometimes I wish I never took the job. Being poor was hard, but I was rich in so many other ways. Now I feel like I have a hardened heart ",Ashamed_Caramel8068,9,0.8600000143051147,12,1730792189,2024-11-05 07:36:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gk1g46/im_becoming_a_rotten_human_being_i_can_tell_my/,11,2024

1gk135f,What should I focus on to break into more Creative work as Developer ?,"Hey everyone,

I (indian fresher)  recently joined a top global tech MNC (not MAANG) and on paper, my role is a developer, but in reality, it’s mostly consulting clients. And honestly, it’s not that productive or creative, plus the tech stack I’m working with is super specific to this company and old and won’t be useful elsewhere.

Even though I’m getting paid well, I’ve realized staying here too long could make it harder to switch later, so I want to make a change in the next 1.5-2 years. My goal is to get into something more development-focused or creative where I can actually grow my career and have more stability going forward.

Given the massive oversupply of developers these days, I’m wondering if anyone here can share advice on how I can best use the next couple of years to make that switch. What should I focus on to make myself stand out and land a solid role in the future?

Here are some options I’ve been thinking about:

Learning Go (Golang): I’ve heard it’s great for backend stuff, microservices, and cloud apps. 

Learning Quant (Finance/Trading): I have interest in financial aspect of coding, have heard It’s a niche field, but with a high learning curve.

Exploring Freelancing: I’m considering freelancing more as a side income source sort of thing.

Learning Animation/Content Creation: Digital content is booming, and animation seems like a fun, creative skill.

A bit about me:

I know MERN stack, Next.js, and have experience with cloud platforms like Firebase. I’ve built a few solid projects with these, so I’m comfortable building things and solving problems.
I learn a lot by just building stuff and experimenting, which has worked for me so far.

What I’m not so good at:

DSA/CP — I am Okayish here, Definitely not my strong suit.

I tend to be a bit weaker on theoretical knowledge since I mostly learn by hands-on experience.

I also have significant knowledge in ML/AI have won few compititios as well, but I know without a master’s or Ph.D. it’s probably not a viable career move for me.

So yeah, if anyone has gone through a similar situation or has advice on what skills to focus on to make a career switch in the next 1-2 years, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks in advance! 🙏",Melodic-Funny-9560,0,0.5,0,1730790550,2024-11-05 07:09:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gk135f/what_should_i_focus_on_to_break_into_more/,11,2024

Managers are no more an ""umbrella"", choosing priorities and assignments and feel very comfortable to mess up with you instead of your own Manager. I should step up, but I have very little social skills and I don't feel like I know how to choose my battles to gain respect, or get the most valuable things done, or avoid to become the hardest working person that will never grow.

1gk0ejs,Should I quit my MS in Finance from the top uni? Advice needed on changing careers.,"Hi everyone, I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.

I’ve been working in investment banking as an Investment Analyst for over 3 years. I landed my first job right out of college in the banking industry, and this is my second job since. Initially, I thought the struggle I felt was just because it was new, but even after getting better at the work, I still feel no satisfaction or sense of achievement.

This year, I thought the lack of fulfillment might be because I was missing some core skills—especially since everyone around me is a CFA, ACCA, or FRM. So, I enrolled in an MS Finance program at a top university (it’s a hybrid program), hoping to level up. But I hate it. Looking back, I realize that I was never really good at or interested in finance. In fact, my worst grades in undergrad were in finance subjects; my GPA only looked decent because I got A's in other courses.

Now, I’m stuck. The MS program and my job are both draining me, and I can’t see myself continuing in this field. To make matters worse, I’ve had several panic attacks at work in the past two years, and my mental and physical health are declining.

I’ve tried applying to more creative roles, but no one has contacted me, likely due to the disconnect in my experience and education. Here are my main concerns:

1. **Should I quit my MS Finance program?** I’ve invested a lot in it financially, and in Asia, leaving a prestigious institution is a big deal. There’s also the fear of what people will say and how my employer would react if they found out.
2. **If I leave finance, where should I start?** I don’t want to stay in my current role, but I can’t just quit due to bills. I’m lost on how to pivot to something more creative, as my resume doesn’t match up with the jobs I want.

I feel like I can’t take it anymore, but I’m also scared of making the wrong move. Any advice would be really appreciated.

Today I've been asked to hand in a resignation letter by my boss. My country is Malaysia, I'm pretty sure there's severance pay equalivent to a month for termination here. I've only worked for a month, contract says probation could go for up to 3 months, so I'm currently still on probation. 

Contract states grounds for immediate termination are as follow:
Serious misconduct.
Breach of provision contract.

I'm pretty sure I did neither so they shouldn't be able to terminate me without notice like that even on probation.

So was it right that I didn't go in today? I've asked em about the termination letter and haven't gotten a response so far. Are they waiting for it to pass a certain amount of time so I'd be deemed illegible for severance?",MaskedApez,2,1.0,7,1730782562,2024-11-05 04:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gjz25d/advice_regarding_termination/,11,2024

1gjxtlg,Am I running out of time? ,"I’ve always been ambitious. Since I was young, I had dreams—dreams bigger than the place I grew up in, bigger than what I was told was possible. I wanted to see the world, achieve success, and make my family proud.

The last five years have been the toughest. I watched my mom fight breast cancer with every ounce of strength she had. Through chemotherapy, through pain. And just as she was finishing her treatment, our home was hit by the biggest flood Brazil had seen in eighty years. In one day, everything changed.

I had to focus on what was right in front of me—my family, my responsibilities. But deep down, there was always this fear: ‘Am I running out of time? Am I losing sight of my dreams?’”

And yet, through everything, something happened. I realized that those struggles, as painful as they were, built something in me—resilience. I became stronger, not just for myself but for the people I care about. I learned that when life knocks you down, you don’t just get up. You rise, and you keep going, even if the dream feels like a distant memory.

This is a reminder. A reminder to myself, and maybe to you too, that it’s never too late. That despite the setbacks, the doubts, and the fear of time running out, the only way forward is to take that first step. Because time is moving... but so can we.

So here I am, putting myself out there, making this to push myself—to chase those dreams I’ve held onto for so long. And maybe, by reading this, you’ll be inspired to chase yours too. 

If you made it this far, thank you for hearing me out!   
  
I don't know what I can do anymore, I'm desperate to find a remote job and stay closer to my family, hopefully, something will happen anytime soon, not sure if it was a good idea to share all this, but hey, we never know.

1gjxmge,Boss Won’t Answer Emails about Pay/Growth ,"A little context here - I’ve been at my company since late 2021 so about 3 years. About 6 months in, right before summer 2022,  I got switched from hourly to salary which is where I am now - making roughly 52k/year. That was my last official performance review and every time I inquire about a review to bring up concerns of pay - I continue to get pushed off saying the time isn’t right and it’s too busy to do a review. It’s also worth noting that the job capacity that I’m In is during the graveyard shift, so it constantly feels like me and my team are overlooked and forgotten about. So, I never directly see my boss or really anyone in the office since me and my team oversees the operation in the night shift, and they handle the day shift. 

Then, when the increased salary law was put into effect about 6ish months ago, I inquired about it since it was getting raised to a salary that would be more than I’m currently making. I wasn’t 100% if I was eligible for that since there’s so many exemptions and non exemptions so I wasn’t entirely sure if it included me. So, in early July, I sent an email to my boss inquiring about this and he promised to get back to me. He has not gotten back to me about that since. Since it won’t officially go into effect until January 1, I let it go and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

Over the last few months, there have been life situations that have arisen that has hurt me finically so the lack of performance reviews to bring up a salary rise has pissed me off to say the least. So, 2 weeks ago I sent him this email -

“Hey Boss, 

I wanted to touch base with you on a few things. 

For starters, I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation regarding the new salary law going into effect on January 1st and how it might impact our team, particularly my role. I’d appreciate any updates or insights you can share on how this may affect compensation adjustments.

Additionally, I wanted to inquire about my next performance review. My last official review was before the summer of 2022, and I believe an updated evaluation would be beneficial, especially given the current economic landscape. Since inflation and cost of living have significantly impacted the value of my salary over time, a review would allow us to discuss fair compensation adjustments and ensure alignment with expectations.

I'd also like to talk about my potential growth within the company as well. With my background education, and experience, I am very interested in the opportunities to take on added responsibilities and expand my role where possible. I would be glad to discuss how I can contribute further in any capacity to achieve this growth. I don't want to work the graveyard shift forever and I know I could be a great addition to the team. 

Thank you very much for your attention to these matters. Please let me know if there’s anything I can prepare in advance of our conversation. I'm not sure if I had to include anyone else other than you in this email, so if I was, you can send this to the relative parties as well.

1gjwl8y,Job offer after accepting a different job,"Long story short, I just accepted a job last week for a decent job. It’s stable and pays enough for me to afford rent and whatnot. My career is in social media marketing, and this is a marketing generalist position. It’s not exactly what I want to do, and it’s in an industry that is interesting but not what I’m super passionate about.
I’ve been unemployed for almost 7 months since getting laid off, so getting this offer felt like a miracle.
The plot twist?
I basically got my dream job offered to me today. 
It’s unfortunately a temporary position that pays slightly less, BUT will take more hours and receive ample overtime (so potential for more overall earnings). 
However it’s truly my dream position. And it’s for a company that is very well known, and the skills and experience would set up my portfolio and resume *really* nicely. 
The only problem with the job is that it would end in early February. Coming off almost 7 months of employment, the stability of the more boring job is really appealing. But I also think I’ll regret not taking this other job.

Any advice or tips on how to navigate this? I start the more boring job this week and worry about offending them if I decide to do the dream job, but I also recognize needing to look out for me.

1gjvy0c,First Time Ever Being Fired - I feel physically sick.,"F/22 

So, I just got terminated from my creative job for management differences, and it's the first time I've ever been fired from a workplace in my ENTIRE career, teens and all. While looking for other jobs, I can't help but feel anxiety about the future interview questions regarding this specific job because it was \*pretty solid\* for my resume and only lasted 5mo (horrible I know). 

It's really taken a toll on my mental health regarding myself as an employee... makes me question my worth- WAS I the problem or did being fired save me from having to lie to everyone about the shitty management and kiss ass so I can keep my position? Being in the creative field, I'm pretty quick to bounce back from failure but this time is different.

I've been having random stomach pains- painful ones, nausea, and little appetite in the afternoon, sleeping in late even though I'm an early bird, and having a hard time finding motivation in my job search.

1gjvmdo,I’m an above average employee offered a mutual separation agreement ,"I work in talent acquisition and I came to my current company 9 months ago. I was their first recruiter so I basically fully designed my own role from scratch as well as all the structure and trainings for the hiring managers. 

My boss who is the HR Director started 2 weeks after me and has consistently micromanaged me into a deep depression. He calls me on the daily to nit pick at everything I do. I can’t even begin to explain how horrible he’s been and so manipulative. 

We have weekly meetings with upper management to present what is going on and I showed my metrics where the President had decided to ask why they were rejected and I stated I would show him and there was 1 candidate he didn’t understand why I didn’t even call and I gave my reasons. He then suggested we have a meeting where we can go over all the applicants and maybe they’re seeing something I’m not… which was incredibly demeaning. 

Fast forward a few days and my manager tells me he’s disappointed with how I handled things in the meeting and my reasons weren’t enough. I basically couldn’t hold back this time and defended myself which lead me to tear up (unfortunately). My manager decided to manipulate into how he cares so much and said I should get out of here and go somewhere that values me and makes me happy. How I should let him fight for me to get me what I needed to make that happen. 

I agreed to it because at this rate I can’t stand him or the company so I asked for 3 months and a mutual agreement so he went forward with that to negotiate. What he said I have no idea and I don’t trust any of it. He only got me 6 weeks and an outplacement service. 

Does this sound like something I should agree to or is there a way to fight for more?They compared my situation to a different HR employee who was let go but had been there longer.

1gjvb81,Career derailed - now what?,"Long story short, I had to escape a very toxic work situation (abusive boss) where my mental health had really suffered. In order to do that, I found a new job at a new company. Similar pay. My mental health has recovered, I'm over the abuse and am ready to move forward in that regard.

However while I got out of a bad situation, I made a mistake in where I went in order to get out. Basically new job has no real potential for growth in my role due to organization structure and culture, along with no company-wide strategy. No idea it was this bad in the interview.

I work in an industry where there aren't many companies in my industry in my geographic area and the nature of the jobs requires a lot of in-person work. 

Basically I need to: a) accept that my career has stalled for the foreseeable future (several years; this is particularly hard since I'm used to being high-achieving), b) try to leave my industry for another in this economy and enter another, presumably at a much lower salary and seniority, or c) maybe try to make a go of working for myself.

1gjuvvt,Leaving a job after 3 months,"Back in August I accepted a job after applying for months post-grad school. It wasn’t exactly what I wanted career wise or salary wise but I needed the income and it was close enough. From my first day there I knew it wasn’t for me long term — it’s a newsroom job so lots of different shifts, late nights, weekends, and hardly a minute to breathe during the day. It’s not a terrible job; the people are nice, I get to work from home a lot, and I’ve gotten good experience.

Today I got a job offer for a role doing exactly what I want to be doing but for basically the same amount of money I’m making now ($4000 more/yr). It also has work from home flexibility and would be a lot less stressful with a better work life balance. 

I’m leaning towards accepting the offer but I’m filled with a ton of anxiety thinking of the time and effort that went into training me and now leaving my current team one person down. I’d of course give 2 weeks notice which is doing my due diligence but it still feels really bad for some reason. Is it worth it to leave after 3 months for the same amount of money but less stress?

1gjusmu,Switching career fields without going back to school?,"After graduating from college, I fell into an industry that doesn't align with my values, in promotional products and printing. I've been in this industry for about 2.5 years. There's so much waste, and the products I'm creating (while I enjoy the process) will just end up in a landfill most likely. I'm pretty passionate about lowering waste in my general lifestyle, and I'm feeling really unfulfilled in creating useless products to promote random companies. But, I've gained tons of experience in my short time in the industry, and I'm making pretty decent money. I also want to leave my toxic work environment but the pay elsewhere doesn't compare. I want to transition to a different career that is more in-line with my personal beliefs (and maybe doesn't suck the life out of me), but I don't know where to start.

I don't really want to go back to school because it will take a lot of time and money. My bachelor's degree is fairly useless unless I want to go into academia (which I don't), because I believed everyone saying that all it takes is a college degree to get a decent job (they're partially right, but not entirely). Choosing an entry-level job in a different field would significantly lower my income. If I go back to school, it would have to be for something I feel passionate about with good job prospects. If I stick with printing, it would have to be for printing books or something with actual value to society, but I haven't been able to find any jobs like that in my area.

Does anyone have any advice about where to start? I want to do something that makes a positive difference instead of pointlessly contributing to waste and the progress of capitalism.

So here's the thing. I dont really feel comfortable asking for references from my current employer (Company A) but the company I left before that (Company B) was left on some pretty bad terms, which means my best pool of references come from the company before that (Company C), which I held up until Jan. 2023. 

When it comes to former supervisors, I can probably only reach out to Company C, and there's maybe one or two colleagues from Company A/B I can ask for a reference but tbh, we never really worked closely on any projects together, we just got along well.

Comparatively, there's many colleagues at Company C I can reach out to who I'm sure can give a great reference and we've actually worked well together. So right now I'm just thinking, if it comes to it, I really only want to send references from Company C who was my employer two companies ago.

1gjtd64,"Offer from one company, offer for second interview with preferred company. How do I navigate this without sending red flags to my current employer? Help! ","Hey r/careeradvice, thanks in advance for reading and for your help. I'm back on the job market after 5+ years, and want to make sure I'm navigating this situation as respectfully as possible to everyone involved. 

So - here's what I'm dealing with. Due to a number of different factors, I am keen to leave my current workplace. I had two interviews last week that both went really well. Company A is my preferred option. They got back to me today to offer a second interview. They wanted the second interview to happen later this week, I asked to push to Monday because I have commitments at my current workplace that I cannot miss. They understood and we scheduled things for Monday. Company A is pretty much my dream job and the interview went really, really well. 

Later today, Company B called and offered me the position with no second interview needed. I expressed excitement, they said they would send over an offer letter within the next few days so I could review. They sent me the offer letter right away. Company B has expressed to me that they have a much tighter timeline for hiring. 

What's my next move here? I know it's not uncommon to ask for some time to consider an offer before accepting, but I'd need a whole week in order to do the second interview at Company A and that feels like too much to ask for. 

I also am not sure if it's advisable to let Company A know that I have another offer. I'd like to do this, but is it unreasonable to ask them to expedite their hiring processes when I cannot come any earlier than Monday for a second interview? The commitments I have this week to my current workplace are important, have been scheduled for a long time, and I am the only person at my workplace who can do it. If I call in sick or cancel, it will let a lot of people down. And then if I come back after that with a resignation, they'll put the pieces together and I don't want to burn that bridge after being here for 5+ years. 

I could also just take the good things coming my way, and accept Company B's offer, then get in touch with Company A to withdraw my application. However, Company A is my dream job and I think I have a really good shot here. 

Any advice? Thanks again for reading! ",eggheadwunderkind,1,1.0,2,1730764978,2024-11-05 00:02:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gjtd64/offer_from_one_company_offer_for_second_interview/,11,2024

1gjsv7z,How do you navigate favorites in the workplace? ,"How do you navigate favorites in the workplace?

I am working in a corporate atmosphere where I report to a manager (let’s call her Ashley) and she reports to a director (let’s call him Jeff). I also “dotted line” report to a coworker with a few years of experience at this company (let’s call this person Megan). 

This is my first year at this company and I have reported to 3 different managers as the organization has been going through many changes. When I switched to working with Ashley, she mentioned I would “dotted line” report to Megan. I have higher level conversations with Ashley but most (if not all) of my delegated tasks come from Megan. In my HR system, this relationship is not outlined anywhere. It only says that I report to Ashley. This relationship was very confusing in the beginning and I had to get it clarified multiple times from Ashley as it feels I am reporting to a peer and it felt uncomfortable when Megan started giving me tasks that I felt were below my pay grade. 

After the clarification of this conversation, I began to treat Megan as my supervisor as it was advised for me to do.

Now this is where the favorites play in. Megan and Jeff are very close. They text each other daily, laugh at memes, and Megan buys Jeff gifts. Everyone that Megan is friends with on the team go out to eat, do fitness classes together, etc. These activities will even be discussed in team meetings while others were not invited. 

This clique atmosphere has contributed to a major feeling of disengagement and lack of motivation from me. I still do my work and do it well but it has caused me to hate my job when I used to love it. I feel left out and disrespected on most days by my manager and Jeff. I even constantly try to improve relationships by creating group chats with the whole team and trying to facilitate conversations with those in the clique. I know others on the team feel similarly as I do. 

The real kicker here is that as our yearly review comes up, I have gotten feedback from Ashley about how I need to work on my time management skills. When I ask for specific examples, she gives examples of things I am already doing or basically says I should be doing two things at once. I have always been a high achiever at work and have never gotten this feedback in my life. Even after a few conversations, I do not have a clear idea of what exactly she wants differently from me besides speeding up my delivery time for everything. (Even though I am already meeting targets).

I have started to send out a list of my priorities for the week to both Ashely and Megan so they can tell me if I need to prioritize or deprioritize something on my list and have gotten zero input for the past month or so doing this. 

Today, I had a 1:1 with Jeff and I talked to his back the entire time while he faced his computer. I think I made eye contact once from a head turn as I talked for the entire 25 minute conversation. I asked if he had any questions or would like to talk about anything else but he repetitively said “no”. The only thing he brought up was the fact that this side project he gave me should have been delivered earlier. However, I had multiple conversations with him in which I said this side project was on the “back burner” due to higher priorities I had and he was aligned until just recently.

I am wondering what advice you would give for someone in my situation. This favorite system seems to be so apparent on my team and, while I know other companies are like this as well, I am not quite sure how to navigate.

I first got in trouble for coming forward and saying that we couldn’t provide the help that a student needed because he seemed to have specialized needs. He then was diagnosed and sent to a school that can support him. Since then, my administration has been high critical of my work in all aspects.

The recent situation that got me into trouble was that there is a teacher that works with us that is very standoffish, rude and disrespectful. This teacher already had complaints from another staff member as well as a few parents. That teacher came to me and asked why we did not get along, and I explained that she would be very rude, brag a lot and then struggled to do her job. 

The second situation is that my co-teacher complained about me. A parent came in and invited both of us to a bouncy house with all of our students. My co-teacher then went to administration and told them that I did not invite her explicitly. 

Both situations caused an “investigation” which has now led to me losing my position. Is there anything that I can do?

1gjqq4k,"Weird situation in one of my projects, not sure how to approach it. ","How can I approach leaving a project with my boss? 

I would also like to know if it’s reasonable for me to feel this way and if it makes sense. Any input is appreciated!

I joined this marketing agency as a specialist in a particular area a couple months ago, and I was told I would be mainly leading 2 projects and assist in a couple others. 

Projects and coworkers are honestly great, it’s not perfect but no job is. I’m already up to date and keeping up with the team (it’s a startup so you have to be fast), however there’s a big issue with one of the projects.

Basically, we are hired as a provider for a particular service by another agency, who acts as their “main” agency for the client. I found this kind of convoluted and I’m not sure if it’s common tbh. 

The main agency, when I joined, asked for my CV and references, which I once again found strange since I thought I went through that already with the company that hired me. A few days later, they let us know that I could not participate leading the project because their team requires a minimum of 4 years experience (I have 3). 

My boss decided that internally we would keep the work the same (me leading and working on all the tasks “secretly”) but when it came to facing the client, we would be adding someone else that had the experience that would only act as the face of the project. This person is already swarmed with work which is why the workload would still be mainly on me. 

This has created a strange, confusing dynamic where all the important communication skips me because I’m not even allowed to reply to emails or say anything that could indicate that I’m working on it (when it comes to the client, I’m some sort of assistant). all the communications go through my boss and this other person, who are not even working on the project, so they’re not very aware of new requests and tasks. This causes me to become slow at my job because I get notified the last on things that should go through me first.

It’s only been a month and a half with this dynamic and I’m honestly already tired of it and I can feel myself start losing motivation. I notice that when I approach this project in particular, I do so with way less enthusiasm compared to the rest of my work. 

That paired with the dynamic has made me want to talk to my boss and ask her if it’s possible for us to work on any new arrangements - however I want to reassure her that I plan on staying professional and work on this project as smoothly as possible until a replacement is possible. I’m only entertaining this because my boss is already looking to expand the team as there are a lot of new projects happening.

Please let me know what you think and if you have any advice. I’ve never had this happen to me before. Thanks!! ",crispytempeh,1,1.0,0,1730757982,2024-11-04 22:06:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gjqq4k/weird_situation_in_one_of_my_projects_not_sure/,11,2024

1gjpehh,"Accepting a new job offer, kinda scared, please advise ","

Posted this in r/Accounting but didnt get any response, so trying my luck here! I have 5 years of work experience, worked 2 years in public accounting, had a hellish time and switched to industry as Sr Income tax analyst 3 years back. Best decision I ever made. My current company is private but a well known brand but the company's not doing so well. I got a job offer for another Senior position from a much bigger public company. There's a significant pay raise (~40%) and the position is completely remote which is a huge plus. My current company's tax dept is pretty lean with no room for upwards mobility since everyone plans to retire in their position. Also, the pay wasn't cutting it anymore. I do enjoy working here, my manager's great, I was basically just coasting, some overtime during busy season but nothing crazy compared to public. I have faced some health challenges the past 2 years which my company was very sympathetic to and let me attend Doctor appointments without taking time off. I'm really nervous about accepting this new job offer even though I know it's the right move for my career. During the interviews, the team mentioned they expect a lot from their analysts, it's not like your preconceived notions of industry and they do have busy times. They pay overtime which I've never heard of in industry but I'm afraid they'd expect me to eat hours if I take more time than they expect. They also have heavy provision work which I don't have a lot of experience in since my manager does most of provision, and I help out a lot with compliance. I expressed my concerns to the recruiter I'm working with, and he said I wouldn't have cleared the several rounds of interviews if the team didn't think I could handle the job, there were also a ton of candidates that applied, I did mention my lack of provision experience during the interviews but that I was excited to learn. 

I'm just looking for advice on whether I'm making the right move, I'm worried if I'm gonna be in over my head as this job has a lot more complex work than I'm used to and if I should leave my cushy but dead end job for this new but challenging opportunity.

1gjofbi,Which job to take?,"Hi yall. I need some advice about what to do. 

Currently I am a Jr Network Engineer/NOC tech with a utility company through a contractor. I absolutely love my job, I've learned a lot, my coworkers are amazing and they've been prepping me to become the Lead IT analyst (though not guaranteed, it'd be a 50% chance when interviewing). I've worked hard, being the only tech 1 in the Agile pod along with various projects concerning other departments. Going so far as to help train new hires since they liked my organizational skills.
With this contract, I have NO benefits. No PTO, no health insurance, no 401k, though I can work from home some days. My current wage is only 26/hr. I've been asking for a year if a FTE will open and the answer I get is ""we're trying for January of 2025."" My fellow contractor has been here for 2 years getting the same answer. 

So... I got mad. I raged applied to 2 jobs. I got an interview, after the first interview, I got the job. It'd be for a Subsea NOC Engineer position. The day I got my offer letter, the manager I interviewed with reach out and said to come meet the team before I make my decision - he told me I was the first candidate they wanted and that they would make a day shift for me (the job was supposed to be night shift).
Starting at 43.27/hr and full benefits - even 1 month of PTO to start with (UK based company branching to US). I know I would learn a lot at this new place, but as IT people know, Network Engineers can be very closed off, not teach each other tricks and tips in fear of losing their job (justifiably). 

I'm afraid that I'll struggle in this new position, forever having imposter syndrome. I'm not smart, I know this, but I can say I'm dedicated. I relied heavily on my coworkers in the beginning as it was my first IT job. 

I told my current job about the offer letter, they were only able to counter offer giving me a raise to 30/hr with no benefits. But gosh, I love my company and the possibility/opportunities it can lead me to. Everyone is saying to take the new position, it's an FTE with benefits and almost double the pay but I'm so damn conflicted. 
I'd be the only woman at the new job, but I was the only woman at my current job until 1 month ago so I'm used to it. 

So... which company do I go to? ",Terrible_Science6586,1,1.0,1,1730752304,2024-11-04 20:31:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gjofbi/which_job_to_take/,11,2024
1gjofb5,Am I being paranoid or is this sign of a layoff? ,"Hey all. I could really use some advice on a job situation that’s been causing me a lot of anxiety. I was hired under the previous leadership team, but since then, a new executive team has come in, let go of the old leadership, and many of my colleagues quit shortly after. I'm the last person from the old team still here, and most of the new hires are people the new leadership has brought in from their previous companies.

While the new leadership has said they’re happy with my work, I’ve noticed several changes that make me nervous about my job security:

They’ve brought in a third-party service to handle some of my job responsibilities.

They’ve hired new people with different job titles, but they’re doing tasks that overlap with my role—and I’ve been asked to train them.

I generally feel like I don’t quite “fit” with the new team culture, and there’s this growing sense that I don’t belong.


This job is remote, pays well, and ideally, I'd like to stick with it. But I can’t shake the feeling that these changes are leading toward me being phased out. Am I just being paranoid, or are these classic signs that my position might be at risk? Any advice or similar experiences would be really helpful. Thanks.

1gjocfy,"I Am Hardworking, Hungry, Intelligent, and Ready to Begin a Professional Career","Hello all, I will try to make this as concise but descriptive as possible, as I know this sort of post is very common.

 I am 24 years old and I graduated with a degree in Data Science about a year and a half ago. While attending school, I paid very little attention to life and work after school (real life, in other words). I also spent much of my free time training and planning a cross-country bicycle tour. After graduating, I spent the next six months bicycling more than 8000 miles around the US and a little bit of Canada. When I returned, I moved into my parent's house thinking that with my degree, my grades, and my confidence, I would be able to find a job in my field within 4 months. 

Well, a year later and have not been able to find a job, despite hundreds of applications and around 15 interviews. The interviews have gone mostly well (I have definitely improved the more I interview), but none have resulted in a job. I have been working full time (roughly 30-40 hours per week) as a barista at a Starbucks just to have some money and to stay busy. But I am tired.. I desperately want to be given a chance to excel. I know I can. Every boss I have ever had has complimented my work ethic and ability to work well with others. 

So here's what I'm coming to you all for: I would appreciate advice about my resume (Here's a link to a redacted version: [Resume](https://imgur.com/a/zz1Wyj8)), interview tips, what jobs to apply for, what side projects I should work on for my portfolio, networking (I have no connections in real life) and anything else you think I should know!

1gjo2ig,Should I leave my job?,"Forgive me in advice this is going to be all over the place. Sorry for the long read. 

I would appreciate some advice as l'm having trouble making up my mind and making the ""right"" choice.
My current job pays me $54k a year for a marketing coordinator position. I work from home other than one day a month when I go into office. I get 3 weeks off a year and pretty good benefits. 

My responsibilities are 4-5x more than what I was originally hired on for and I've been here for about 2.5 years now. I asked my manager back in May about what steps I need to take to get a promotion. I was told I need to ""sell myself"" so since then I've been saying yes to all extra projects that come my way, optimizing existing processes etc. I've had another meeting with my manager a few weeks ago and had the same conversation but I felt like I ""sold myself"" by listing out all of the things I've done since our last convo, how l've made things better, the value I bring to the team, my ever growing work load, the list goes on. The conversation felt really great at the beginning and I was really hopeful, however it ended with the same thing that I need to ""sell myself"". I was given an example how another team member who went from a specialist to a manager worked on a big project that was ultimately why they got the promotion(they didn't ask for the promotion btw). I told my manager I understand, but I don’t work on large projects like that I work on a lot of smaller rocks stuff but there were some really great projects I worked on that I was proud of and highlighted in our convo.

I also get a lot of overflow from the specialists, so I felt kind of annoyed when my manager said that if promoted I would be working on hire level projects so I need to continue optimizing my projects to create more time for these “hire level” projects but I’m already working on the same stuff the specialists do as I get there overflow I’m just doing the same work for less money. 

Another point is that I don’t like how I’m expected to now work on additional projects to “sell myself” instead of looking how I managed to optimize so many things and the projects I worked on over the last 2.5 years. Why is none of that being considered ?

I felt super discouraged leaving the conversation and I applied for some other jobs. I've had two interviews for different companies and was invited for second interviews for both which are later this week.

Role A - marketing coordinator $65k / 2 days a week in office / have not confirmed benefits or vacation 

Role B - event marketing specialist $65k-$75k / 3 days a week in office / 3 weeks vacation + similar benefits package 

Role A is within the same marketing retail space and it’s a brand new role with a startup so think long term there might be more room for growth/promotions here. 
Role B is a completely different market but it focuses on events which really interests me. They said this role manages about 15-20 events per year. It also pays a higher range and comes with a higher title. 

I have a lot of loyalty to my current job and the people I work with so I'm having a hard time accepting the idea if I should leave or not. I would appreciate some outside feedback on what I should do. Thank you :(

I also only have a small investment portfolio and insurance through the marketplace so a role with benefits and retirement would be ideal.

I've tried a couple sales roles on the side this past year (D2D Roofing, entry level SaaS sales) but both were pretty soul-sucking in their own ways. I was considering transitioning to another trade but was also curious if there is a career path that would utilize my current skillset that I'm not aware of.

1gjm0jy,My current employer wants me to sign a 1 year contract for my raise. What should I do?,"Hey guys so I’ve been working for this company as a contractor for the past 8 months and have been told that I’d be getting a raise soon. My manager just invited me to his office and told me that they’d like to give me a raise from $20 an hour to $24. The only downside is I would have to work there for a year and wouldn’t be able to apply for other internal jobs within the company. (I would be able to apply to jobs outside of the company) While most people I feel would take this opportunity I feel a bit distraught. Like I said I am a contractor and one of the main reasons I took this job was to get my foot in the door as a recent college graduate. I had my mind pretty set to stay here for a year and then apply to other internal jobs in the company because I really want a full time job. Another reason I wouldn’t want to go for it is I’m getting for lack of better words bored at my job. I basically fulfill hardware requests all day with a shit ton of tickets coming in everyday which is stressful. I’m also moving all around the office all day which is pretty tiring and doesn’t really make me feel fulfilled as a person because I want to get into a more IT/analyst field.

I’m wondering what you guys think I should do? I’d love to have on my resume a full time job and be able to start somewhere where I can grow instead of staying as a contractor, but I’m aware that this pay increase is really good and a year is not that long.",AdministrationHot325,4,1.0,14,1730746417,2024-11-04 18:53:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gjm0jy/my_current_employer_wants_me_to_sign_a_1_year/,11,2024

1gjkax5,I (M21) got offered an intern role in the semiconductor industry 1000+ miles from home. Worth the move?,"I am currently in the midst of my fourth year in a five-year mechanical engineering program in the US, in which I must take internships/co-ops to graduate. I currently attend school and work in the aerospace manufacturing industry in a Midwest city (LCOL), but I am having a difficult time breaking into a role with an aerospace design firm. Additionally, the semicondutor industry, a field which I’ve always had interest, is nearly non-existent in my immediate area (2.5 hour drive radius).

I recently got offered a role with a major analog device company in Texas (MCOL) at a semiconductor fabrication site. While I am being offered a relocation stipend (vs living at home), the difference in COL between my current and proposed internships would result in a net “loss” of ~$2/hr, and would likely require me to get a new car due to having to transport out for the summer.

The job itself seems really rewarding, and the ability to live and network in a major city could help me develop both professionally and socially. However, I am wondering if it is worth uprooting my life for ~14 weeks to live and commute in a city which hasn’t previously enticed me.

1gjk2tn,"Got PIP'd, need encouragement","Hi all. I have been lurking on this subreddit to get some insight. I was PIP'd back in September. The back story:

I had left a job I enjoyed for a job working for the state. Much better benefits and pay, plus I needed health insurance. My fiancé's friend helped me get the job as he was looking for a legal assistant for his office. 

I started in August 2023. Everything was fine until April 2024. My boss yelled at me over something trivial. It was intense. I did not want to report him to HR considering his initial help to get the job, but I saw on his calendar he had arranged a PIP meeting with our supervisors the day after screaming at me. The supervisors dropped the PIP talk after hearing my story.

The supervisors then offered us mediation. The mediation was not scheduled until July. For months before the mediation, he constantly berated and micro-managed me, passed notes about me around the office and turned my coworkers against me. No one would speak to me when they entered and left the office. I endured it for the benefits, remote work and pay. After mediation things seemed to improve. Coworkers were saying hi to me and my boss's emails became less berating.

September rolls around and the supervisors come into our office and hand me a 90 day PIP plan. They took away my work from home privileges and ordered me to create checklists, email as I'm arriving, leaving and returning to my desk, etc, etc.

The supervisor told me a PIP isn't a death sentence when you work for the state, but from what I gathered on this website and other forums I should leave. I am a decent worker. Sure, I make mistakes, I am human. But I did not deserve to be yelled at or berated constantly. My boss is a perfectionist and now I am thinking he is a narcissist. I may have another job lined up, but things are still in the air. I am not sure how much longer I can stay here- it is affecting my mental health. It is a shame because I like this job and I finally feel like I can afford the cost of living.

I guess I am here for support to leave this place behind. My family is telling me to give a two weeks once the other job is lined up, but I am ready to burn bridges and live off the money I have saved until the new job works out. I have never quit or been treated like this before. I am scared. Thanks in advance for any insight.

1gjjojy,"I don’t know which direction to go, should I stay within my industry or leave?","Hey everyone,
I am stuck at a crossroads in my career. I am a 25 year old who works in the oil and gas industry(Propane). I was hired out of college through a development program and have now worked at my company for 2.5 years as a daily router/manager in training. I manage the daily work load of 25 drivers and manage all of my regions deliveries. I currently make 75k a year in a Mcol area. I like what I do but I feel like I have taken all I can take from this role and I am ready for a new job. My career goals are more life goals, I want to be able to provide for my wife and our future children on just my income. I have to make a decision on which direction I want to go and I am so torn I figured I would ask you guys. 
The way I look at it, I have 4 options. 2 involve staying in the Propane to consumer industry, 1 is in compliance and another is trying to switch over to the gas side.
1. I can become a District Manager/Plant manager. This job usually brings in 80-100k and the job entails managing the employees , truck compliance and overall yard operations. I would do well in this role for many reasons but mainly due to my people skills. 
2. I can go into propane sales. This would probably garnish 80-120k. I have dabbled in sales a little bit  and have been successful. But I am not sure if I want to commit to feast or famine like that. 
3. I have looked into working for the local municipality in DOT compliance. This would be a safe option but definitely less of an earring possibility. But the benefits are great.
4. Last would be trying to leverage my experience with propane into the gas industry. I know there is a lot of money to be made over there, but honestly I have no clue how or where I would even apply
This is more of a rant but any advice helps so please comment

1gjitb6,I hate my job,"Hi. I’m 25 years old and I worked in corporate for a year after I graduated college. I started a part time serving position, quit corporate & became a server full time. It wasn’t fulfilling enough for me and ended up leaving my serving position and now work full time for the company I’ve been dreaming of working for. This was all overlapped. 

I am 7 months in and I cannot stand what I do/the people I work with/ the people I work for. I have been applying internally for 2 months now and haven’t gotten any return emails after reaching out. I interviewed for three jobs and one ended up calling my current supervisor and after that, I heard nothing back. One said no and still waiting to hear back from the other. My pay in my position is higher than what I’m qualified for. So now my current supervisor knows I was trying to leave and I feel stuck here. Any position I apply for wonders why I would want to cut my pay. 

I’m not sure how much longer I can take of the job searching while still being drained of my happiness/overall well being in my current position. I know it’s irresponsible to leave before finding something new but I feel so disconnected as of lately, I’m not sure what to do.

1gjihul,"Underperforming, stuck, and dejected at my new role - what should I do to further my career? ","Hey, throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I'm in my 20's, still in my early career, and work at a large corporation. Last year, as my team at the time couldn't afford to promote me, I chose to change teams for a chance at a faster paced environment and an increased chance at promotion. I've been at the company for several years and performed well above average in my other groups (who admittedly were slower paced and more welcoming).   
  
Immediately upon joining this new team, not only was I not onboarded and thrust into a lot of responsibility with high expectations and no grounding, I was told essentially from week one that I was not on par with the skillsets of the team by my manager (referred to as ""not ideal but not terrible either"" at the one and a half month mark) and wouldn't be promoted in the near future. I should mention, the team I'm on and my manager are well-liked fairly widely, yet I (who normally doesn't struggle with this at all!) haven't felt I've clicked from the moment I joined the team.   
  
As this is something I've never encountered and most people in the surrounding teams love my teammates and manager (and there have been a handful of people who have left because of similar issues), I've been left confused and have come to doubt my abilities and self. Though the negative comments have subsided as of late, early on the team, my manager consistently would make comments about being my and my work being mediocre all the while offering little advice on how to improve in their eyes. It's hard to come back from that feeling. 

Now I'm a-motivated, really struggling with performing my daily work to a level I'm proud of, and have been moved by my manager into an area on the team where it's clear that there's zero chance at promotion in this year or the next AND no chance of internally leaving the team successfully. I'm seeing others rising around me quickly and am increasingly worried I'll be laid off in a tight market. I worry I won't be able to find anything in my immediate area for work - what would you do in this situation? What are my options?

1gjhnrj,Should I go to med school?,"Idk where to post this - if there’s a better sub pls lmk;

My boyfriend and I currently live and work in the US (I am here on a work visa). I recently got into medical school in Australia (my home country) and we are now torn on what to do as he has also received his dream job offer. 

The thought of losing my income for 4-5 years is scary, and he would face a significant pay cut (earning maybe 1/2 to 1/3rd less in Australia), as well as limiting career opportunities. I would also be financially dependent on him if we were to move to Australia as I would be studying full time.

Our other option is to move within the US for him to take his dream job and I would continue in my current field (I don’t hate it, but career growth options are limited, and i don’t earn super well), but he would be earning more than both of us could ever in Australia (even if I was a doctor).

I’ve wanted to go to medical school for about 4 years, but now the option has been presented to me, I am pretty intimidated by the time and financial commitment it poses. (The tuition would be low, but my personal expenses would need to be covered by my boyfriend). The option of going to medical in the US is pretty out of the question as it is too expensive - I would however be interested in trying to come back to the US to practice after a number of years.

I also have considered doing long distance for 6 months to a year but I think this would be very hard as the time zones of the places we would be living are virtually opposite, and it would be 24hrs on planes to see each other. This could be a short term option, but I don’t really see the point for only 6 months?

I don’t think either option is right or wrong, but I am stuck on what to do. At this time one of us is going to be having to make a sacrifice to our careers and live in a foreign country. I can’t ask my family because everyone says to just put myself first and not worry about finances, but that’s just not something I can do. Any advice or perspective is appreciated!

The reason I’m interested in this program is  1) the degree aligns with my career interests. The course catalog is appealing 2)im used to remote learning and completing coursework in the mornings before work. I also enjoy my job(mostly) and there’s lots of opportunities to create projects to present my analytics skills.   3) It allows me to continue my jazz guitar education I’m doing on the side at community college a few hours a week. 

I’m just worried how it will “look” though. The diploma is awarded as a normal B.S, won’t mention anything about being online on it.  However if you were to analyze my resume, you’ll see that I worked full time in San Diego while completing a degree from SJSU… which might raise some questions.

I went to college for IT and got a certification in the field and haven't been able to land even an entry level job since I graduated two years ago. So now I feel trapped in the job I'm in now and it has burned me out so badly that I have to do breathing exercises before I even get there to calm myself down. There are no benefits like paid time off so if I don't work, I don't get paid, making vacations and breaks nearly impossible. Initially I wanted to either be a mechanic or go to school for environmental science but changed it all for IT. But now I'm thinking I made the wrong career decision because sitting in an office dealing with people all day sounds like a nightmare. And I'm expected to take some low paying help desk job as my first job, but I have a house, and $15 an hour isn't going to pay rent.

1gjegmo,What should I do about this under the table job offer?,"I've wanted to become a dog groomer and switch careers from graphic designer to dog grooming for the past year. I've been doing graphic design for 8 years and I've found it incredibly difficult to find a job in my area or remotely that pays decently and has health benefits. I'm from Ontario.

I started volunteering at this dog grooming salon every Saturday from 9-5 since July of this year. They finally want to hire me on! But the offer is pretty bad. It's minimum wage in cash only. ($17.20 an hour). I worry that by the company not claiming me as an employee that I will not be covered under their insurance. What do I do? I really want to be a dog groomer and I can't find anyone else to volunteer or apprentice with.

I really want to become a dog groomer. But I really don't like that the position is under the table cash as a full time job. I'm also not allowed to advertise ""free"" services to people to work on their dogs due to the volunteer contract I have with them. 

The options I've tried or thought of already but they don't work with my budget or location:

* Going to a private dog grooming school in the United States or Canada -> can't afford it (would need to quit my job and move for those programs)
* Volunteering elsewhere I used to volunteer for another person in the area and she hit a dog with the clippers and would often scream at dogs that were being bad. So I quit there as I felt like it was unethical. I have contacted by phone, email and in person every dog grooming salon and vet clinic in the area within a 40-minute range and only the 2 got back to me (the one which I quit and the one that gave me the job offer)

The only thing I can think of is getting another part-time job, that way I still have one legal job.

1gjdoxq,How do I go about asking my boss about a different position?,"I work as a technician in a medical clinic and have been here for a year and a half. I don’t get along well with my coworkers; as an introvert, I feel treated differently. The large office has other departments with less social interaction, where I think I’d fit better.

Since this is a private practice without an HR department, I’m uncomfortable discussing workplace bullying with my manager. My colleagues have established friendships, and many have been here for 4-30 years, which makes integration difficult. My immediate supervisor shares personal information about others, and I know she dislikes me, so I prefer to approach our clinical manager—who also handles HR—about switching roles. However, I fear they’ll ask why, and I want to avoid getting my coworkers in trouble or creating drama. I doubt she would believe me if I mentioned bullying, and I don’t want to name names; I just want to move to a different department.

I struggle with workplace politics and believe a position with less interaction would reduce my anxiety. How should I request a change in positions? What if she asks for specific names?

1gjd9r8,Should I make my family move for a job?,"My employer of the last nine years recently informed me that my position will be eliminated at the end of December. I have known for about a month now, so they gave me lots of notice and I will also have severance for 6 months after the termination date. All this to say that I have not panicked applied, but instead have tried to be mindful of where I submit applications. 

I submitted an application with one of the big tech companies and to my surprise I received an interview. I am now one of the finalists for the position, which is both exciting and anxiety provoking. The job listing did not explicitly say that the position was hybrid, but the recruiter on the first call informed me that it is company policy for new hires to be in office 3 days a week. This is the issue. If I end up with this job I would have to relocate my family from Ohio to Washington DC. I have lived in Maryland before and I love the state, but I don't love the cost of living. My husband and I built our home two years ago and I am not sure that we would be able to afford a home this size in DC. 

Some additional information, my husband lost his job in April and recently started a new job. He works for a company out of California and is remote, but is on an Ohio sales team. He thinks he would be able to transfer the job, but has not yet confirmed this. Both of our families are here in Ohio and they help us out with childcare for our 9 month old. 

If I receive an offer, I plan to try to negotiate the relocation given that the team I would be working on is located overseas and one of the requirements is to work autonomously. I would be willing to travel 3-6 months weekly to get a feel for the company culture, if they allow me to be remote after that period. I would also be willing to travel as needed after that initial period of time. 

My question is, if I am unable to negotiate, should I move my family for this job? ",FunRemove206,6,0.7200000286102295,22,1730724048,2024-11-04 12:40:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gjd9r8/should_i_make_my_family_move_for_a_job/,11,2024
1gjcth8,"Wanted to get into programming, failed several times and I am not even sure if I want it. ","28 M

I am from an Eastern European country, now living in The Netherlands, working in a warehouse. I feel that I could be much more, I would like to be creative, do business, have opportunities, make money, do something I care about, but I don't even know what shoud I do. 

I tried to learn programming, I started, failed and started again, like 5 times so far, but I didn't get far. It's not that I don't understand it, or I am too stupid, but whenever I started it was incredibly hard to stay focused. I was diagnosed with ADHD a few months back (probably I have Autism too though no diagnosis), started medication, it helped in my physical job, made me less lethargic and more enegretic, but it doesn't help with sitting down and focusing and it makes me anxious so I won't take it anymore. 

Maybe I will switch to another medication, but I am starting to think that I just need to find something I really care about, and also find a lifestyle that works for me. I am confused.

When I hear the experiences of programmers, sure I like what they say about the money and the opportunities, but I worked in an office for a few months in an administrative position, I was around  engineers and programmers, and for some reason I am not attracted to this way of living, sitting in one place for hoursevery day. I have a friend who works as a web developer, and complained about the useless meetings he has to attend and the management. I only started to learn because of the money and because I was a quite smart student (mental problems contributed big time to not achieve anything so far) so I figured I could make it then live a better life, but I can't imagine myself doing that anymore, so here I am clueless what I am going to do. 

The only positives of my life: 

\- I am fit and I like to exercise. 

\- I like to learn languages, so far I only know my mother tongue and English but I am the process of learning Spanish. Maybe I will leave my job and travel there and look for opportunities regardless of what the reddit users say about Spain. I have saved money, if it doesn't work out, I can come back anytime, or go back to my home country, I have a supportive family fortunately so I am not going to starve even if I do something like that.

I want adventure, feel like I am really living, but I don't know exactly what to do, I know this sounds ridiculous.

I feel so pressured to decide now, and I’m very worried that I’ll take the wrong subjects in college and it’ll affect me later on. Like I suddenly find something I want to do in uni but I can’t do it because I didn’t take x subject. 

I was very into medicine, at one point I wanted to be a surgeon, but I feel like I’m a very emotional person and wouldn’t do well there so I kinda lost that interest. Other than that, I haven’t been truly interested in any other career paths. I’d really like to go into something like theatre or voice acting but it isn’t very plausible and I need something where I can be financially stable. I have done those online tests where they suggest careers, and I got stuff like actor, astronaut, marine biologist and so on (mostly arts). 

My parents would really like me to go into something like IT and AI, but tbh I’m not very interested in that. I’ve been going for coding classes but I’m not very into it. I’d like to do something that I’ll enjoy, but I’m not sure what. I’ve been searching online and looking at different jobs, but it hasn’t really

1gjco7q,How to get an internship in state without lots of opportunities? (Northwest),"I have a pretty weird situation. I graduated high school in 2020 in the US. Took a gap year to save money and then in 2021 went to film school in Germany. In 2023 that school went bankrupt and I realized that film wasn't my passion anymore. I then went to the Netherlands to study economics, but I am now returning to the US for personal reasons. I will be returning to my hometown, which unfortunately only has a low-ranked school and am scared about not getting any internships. I will be studying Finance. I should end up being around sophomore status after transfer credits. I am getting ready to apply, but I have no idea how to phrase my previous educational experience. Just listing 3 different colleges on my resume in 3 different countries sounds weird, but I don't want to just leave it off either, especially since the school in the Netherlands was very highly ranked.  

Experience wise the main thing I have is that I ran my own photo/film business for three years. I did gain a decent amount of transferable skills through this and had 40+ clients. Besides that I've had some experience in sales as well.

  
Another problem is that my state doesn't have very many internship opportunities. I'm open to doing out-of-state internships, but wondering if they would even take someone from a school like mine.

1gjc6w4,Do you take a promotion if you don’t respect the boss,"I’ve been offered a promotion (well, told I’m being promoted). But I’ve absolutely lost all respect for the person I’d have to report to. He’s always been fairly average - avoids hard conversations, poor communicator, doesn’t foster strong engagement or performance culture. Lately he’s added to the mix: impossible to get a hold of and doesn’t show up to meetings. Originally, everyone thought it was only to their meetings, but it’s starting to become clear that he’s not showing up in general (this isn’t a small company, and he’s an employee, not an owner). 

After a particularly challenging conversation with him last week I have absolutely had it. When I finally got a hold of him, he was at the golf course - it was a work day and as far as I know, he was working that day. He was meant to call me back, but instead called my current boss (I’m assuming to complain about me, my boss didn’t say). 

I have a personal rule: I will only work for people I respect. I no longer respect him. 

But it’s a promotion so refusing will be unusual and career damaging. It’ll also lead to questions from his boss on why… and without throwing this guy under a bus, I don’t really have an answer. And this is a hard promotion to get (earlier in careers, the promotions came quickly, but at a point, they slow down - if I don’t take this opportunity, it may not come up again for a while). 

But I really don’t want to work for him.

Ive worked for the same employer for 7 years, they’re wanting to expand my role. It will still involve my current job but some additions and not a new role entirely. It’s kind of nice to get some new responsibility but my concern is that I’m being asked to sign a new contract with new probation period and a clause that says I can be terminated any time within that period. 

Earlier last year they fired someone on their probation for not showing allegiance to company goals (not the reason on paper but that was the closed doors chat) and now I’m worrying this is the first step of something similar. 

I have time before signing so. Looking to get a range of ideas.

1gjb9yc,Choosing the right MSc for a future in IT,"Hello everyone,
I’m a 25-year-old student, and I’ve just completed my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering.

However, I’ve realized that, despite my studies, I don’t feel a true passion for this field, especially concerning the typical job prospects in mechanical engineering. I now find myself at a crossroads, unsure about which direction to take; I only know that I would like to continue my studies.

I’m mainly undecided between two master’s degree programs. On one hand, there’s Complex Systems Physics, which focuses on modeling complex systems across various domains (biological, physical, social, computational, etc.). This field fascinates me because it considers both computational aspects and the physical and mathematical representation of processes, aiming to create models that can also be used in computing. However, even though this area is interesting, I perceive it as very theoretical, and I worry about the specific career path it might prepare me for. My goal, however, is to work in the Information Technology sector.

The other choice is a master’s degree in Computer Science, which, while appealing, concerns me due to the saturation of the field. I see that many recent graduates struggle to find stable employment, and I worry that the role of software engineer (toward which this program is directed) might be diminished in the future due to artificial intelligence, which could automate some of the required technical skills.

So, here’s my question: has anyone else been in a similar situation? Do you have any advice on how to choose the right path, which will likely lead to the career I’ll be working in for the rest of my life? This decision is important and challenging for me, especially because I’m currently ""on hold"" and have already missed the current semester.

Thanks to everyone who would like to share their experience or offer any suggestions.

1gj7yt2,"How to handle an extremely toxic, egomaniacal, asshole boss? ","So I'm asking for a friend who works at a very well-funded early-staged startup with a lot of growth potential. They have a small team of only 4ish people right now, and no one has a definitive role so to speak. There's 1 founder and the rest are early-staged employees, effectively. The CEO is pretty famous and has exited brand named companies before, so even getting the chance to be near him is considered a flex by most people and this company is pretty much a guaranteed success.

My friend just joined this company, and has a literal tyrant for a boss, who has let his power get to his head, mostly due to his proximity to this CEO. So I've met this guy before, and he's a literal egomaniac. Think finance bro but 10x's worse. And apparently, my friend says he's even 10x's worse than when I first met him because of his newfound 'power' now that the CEO has promoted him, and he's the first to get promoted of this small team. 

He thinks he controls everything and believes he's the companies' COO even though by title, he's not, and in fact, he's the least knowledgable person on the team. He knows the least, does the least, and the only reason why he's even in this role is 100% due to nepotism because he knew the CEO before. However, he's the least competent person, and everyone else is doing 90% of the work and actually driving the project forward. 

To make matters worse, he's the greatest asshole you'll ever meet, and my friend is no regular joe schmo either. He's extremely well educated, went to a great school, has ran numerous successful businesses, and this egomaniacial asshole is literally treating him like dirt, and like an assistant, having him run petty personal errands and talks down on him like a dog because he thinks he's the shit. He literally talks to him like a dog like ""Do this, do that"" and treats him as if he's a lesser person. 

My friend doesn't want to leave the company because he knows it has great potential, and he's in the company early so he believes he'll get a huge payout if he sticks it through, a payout that could get him to retire early. But this guy is literally ruining the project, and making it extremely uncomfortable for everyone on the team with his toxic, disgusting, vile and debaucherous personality.

He's unfortunately very close to the CEO, so this is a very delicate office politics matter but... I'm not sure how he should handle this situation. This guy is literally the worst human being I've ever met. He's void of any real substance, so now that he has a modicum of power, he's abusing it like crazy. I always thought these types of people only existed on TV and I'm astonished that someone this disgusting and power hungry actually exists in real life.

I accepted Company A’s offer 2 weeks ago, and I’m supposed to start next week. Company B extended an offer 4 days ago, and is better in some ways:

> Company A’s total comp is 180 base + 5-10% bonus, depending on company’s and your performance ($189-$198k)
> Company B’s total comp is 175 base + 10-20% ($193K - $210K)
> Company A’s commute is 40 mins, Company B’s commute is 15 mins. Both by train. 
> Company B offers employee stock discount, Company A doesnt
> Company A’s team is all based in NYC, while company B’s is scattered in the US (I’m the only one based in NY). I think meeting and collaborating with your team/leaders in person makes it easier to get promoted, but not seeing them in person can also mean less stress/pressure.

- Both are 3x hybrid
- Both have 20 days pto
- Both have 6% match 401K
- Both are senior manager levels
- Both seem to have similar work culture, similar teams (I like both teams), but Company B might have better life work balance bc the team is scattered
- Company B offers stock discount program
- Both are in Banking/finance.
- Company A currently consists of 1 director and 2 senior managers (I’m the second). Company B consists of 1 vp, 1 director, and 3 sr managers (I’ll be the third).

Career growth seems to be more feasible at Company A, but Company B has way better commute and might pay more in bonus + stock discount program.

1gj779d,Tingly sense about being a pilot,"I've got this really strong feeling that something is calling me to become a pilot. Like it's something I was actually made to do, it's very undescribable. It's almost like passion but stronger and special. What's weirder is how aviation has changed the way I view the world. Whenever I think back to when I was younger, I remember being out in a soccer field by myself and all my other teammates were practicing. At the time, I had no interest in aviation at all, but when I think about it, it feels like it's been in my heart the whole time without noticing, like I was secretly aspiring to be a pilot. I even remember going to the ER when I was 4 and the doctor let me choose a toy from a large plastic box, and I chose this matchbox style F-14 and B-2 that were together. I played with it all the time with no interest in aircraft at all. Sometimes I drift away from aviation and will focus on something like tanks, or cars, or some other career path, but nope. Being a pilot just pulls me right back in, and for no apparent reason either. Recently I went to a museum, and a retired pilot gave me a tour of his C-141 before the tour started. He let me sit in the cockpit, I immediately grab the controls, and I hear the best compliment I've ever gotten. ""You're a natural."" This really touched my heart, all I did was touch the yoke and start moving it and he said I was good at it. What's even weirder is the fact that just days before I was wondering if its possible for humans to actually be a ""natural"" at something, and google said no. But the pilot seemed to have answered my question, it's more like the universe answered it, or maybe it was just a really weird and motivating coincidence. But something is telling me that being a pilot is my purpose, and it's like I can almost sense that there's an airplane out there, waiting for me, like a long lost sibling. Like something I'd connect to more than anything. It's really been a long way since I've discovered aviation. It even saved my life at my worst. I just wanted to hear your guys thoughts on this, and see if anyone else shares this amazing feeling.",2e_Advanced2,0,0.25,6,1730698224,2024-11-04 05:30:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gj779d/tingly_sense_about_being_a_pilot/,11,2024

I left the client's funding in a very good state. The problem has been created by an issue with the companies CRM software. It's happened before. The system has been telling me that there was more money available than there actually was. 

But the company is not telling the client that it was their mistake. They're allowing the client to think that I knowingly used that amount of funding.

The outcome for the client is not dire but it's definitely not great. It's nowhere near as good as the state I actually left their funding in. 

If I tell the client, then I will probably ruin the client's and my relationship with my (soon to be) ex-employer. If I put the employer offside, it might have ramifications for my future work in this small sector. 

If I don't tell the client, then my employer throws me under the bus for their mistake.

1gj50re,Keep WFH customer service job at regional bank or take offer from Morgan Stanley?,"Hello,

I am recently getting my life back together and accepted a phone customer service agent at a regional bank in Chicago. It pays $19 an hour and is WFH mostly, but is located an hour away. I took the job as a “for now” gig until I find a role in marketing which is what my background is in. I have more flexible hours since I work 11-8 and have been interviewing since. 

I recently was offered a financial services rep role for Morgan Stanley that is located in the city about 25 min away, onsite for the first 16 weeks to study for licensing exams and pays $26 an hour. It’s still a phone based job after receiving the licensing you need. It’s in person 8-5 and then the shifts will change once you’re on the phones. 

I’m wondering if I should take the Morgan Stanley job or not since it’s still a phone based role and I’m looking for work in marketing. The name on my resume would be great and so would the pay increase but I’m not terrible interested in banking/morgage. I’m still also under consideration for a few marketing roles I applied to. The job starts next Monday. 

Would you take the MS role or keep the current job?

1gj4sm0,How do you even begin to keep track of all the words and phrases that now offend everyone? ,"So I am trying to figure out if this situation is uncommon, or something happening in all workplaces.  I have noticed more & more that my current employer is almost overly-accommodating to certain people & certain beliefs — to a point that they are creating a workplace that is very stressful & anxious to work in. Bear with me as I am trying to explain this all in the most respectful way possible. 

Examples: 
1. In the last year I have actually been called out for saying common phrases like:
- “Hey you guys.” (In general reference to a group of collegues.) 
- “Deadline” (Instead of saying due date.)
- “Let’s wrangle up the team to discuss.” (In reference to gathering everyone together.) 
I have been told all of these phrases are now offensive to some people.    

2. We got sent a company-wide email saying that we are considered to be hateful & struggling with our beliefs if we didn’t agree with a certain side of a protest occurring, that one of our team members was participating in. This protest had nothing to do with our company, our line of work, or our jobs and the email was honestly not considerate of anyone else apart of different cultures, regions, and/or personal beliefs. 

I have always thought work was supposed to be a neutral space and inclusive to all. I would never intentionally ever say anything that is obviously hurtful or offensive to anyone, and I don’t believe in discussing things like religion, sexuality, politics, etc ay work. But, because of all of the above I am struggling a lot lately to understand and remember what is ok and what isn’t anymore because it feels like everything is offensive, and only certain beliefs are accepted. I have to lead a lot of meetings and now I am getting extreme anxiety about speaking at all. I am fumbling and losing confidence, and am just scared to say anything wrong. 

Any recommendations? Is this normal? Is this a new thing?

1gj0efw,"30, Lost, and Ready for a Fresh Start: Cosidering UX/UI Design?","Hello everyone,

I'm 30 and, honestly, feeling pretty lost.

My work journey started with selling phones at Verizon, where I was pretty successful. Eventually, I moved into tech roles—help desk, tech analyst, you name it. I've done everything from running wires in new buildings to setting up networks and imaging PCs. But then COVID hit. I spent a lot of that time traveling and isolating when I could, not working much. If I'm being real, working just to get by has never felt right to me. I think a lot of us can relate to that.

When I got back to California, I found work in the solar field. I thought learning more about electrical work would be both personally useful and look great on my resume. Having a mix of mechanical, electrical, and technical skills felt like it could open some doors. But the reality was different. The industry is full of ""solar cowboys""—people who don’t follow the best or safest practices. So, I adapted and taught myself the right way to do things. I actually found a bit of a rhythm there, going out, fixing things, driving the company truck, and just getting it done.

But it didn’t last long. During a meeting with the execs, I dozed off unexpectedly. Turned out I was diabetic. It was embarrassing and honestly scary. I immediately sought help, kept my boss updated, but they still fired me. They said it was because they didn’t think I could handle the work due to “fatigue and being diabetic.” That was a rough blow.

I took some time off to be with my son, but now I’m a month away from being broke. I thought my experience would make me a solid candidate for other jobs. I guess not.

I've always had an eye for art—it’s what I would’ve pursued in college if things were different. UX/UI design has caught my interest lately. It seems like something that could be fulfilling, something I’d stick with. I didn’t grow up with much—lost my mom at 17, dropped out of high school, was homeless for a while. Life's been one thing after another, so no FAFSA or traditional support.

So I’m here, wondering if this could be the right path. How would I even get started in UX/UI? Are there any resources for someone without a diploma? And what does a day in the life of a designer actually look like?

**TL;DR -**   
  
I'm 30, feeling lost, and exploring UX/UI design as a new direction. I've worked in tech and solar, but health issues and layoffs have made things tough.

1gizcxg,Should I drop out of Engineering to pursue the Arts?,"I am currently studying my second year Mechanical Engineering at a great school in a nice town. I like my friends, I play a sport and I enjoy my hobbies in my free time. I just feel like I am doing nothing with my life. My classes seem pointless, my peers seem so much better at everything than me, and overall I feel very out of place in my program. I also have a bad GPA because I don't like what I am studding and the classes are HARD, but for my program it doesn't really matter. By the way, I'm a girl, so although there are other girls in my class, it can often feel like a boy's club. 

I was looking into engineering jobs and everything just seemed horrible. I'm not really after the money and I don't want to hate my job for the rest of my life. Most of all, I feel like I am playing to my weaknesses because naturally I am not good at engineering and I rather be great at something less stable that I enjoy than mediocre at something stable I hate.

I am a very creative person and I have always wanted to go into product design/industrial design and marketing. Do I drop out at the chance of getting into an art school, adding 2 more years to my academic career, moving to a new city again and spending thousands of more dollars to get a degree that may not be as employable (also disappoint my family who think I change my mind too much).

1giz4qp,I feel lost now,"I’m 25, I don’t have a Diploma, GED, or Degree. I dropped out when I was 16 due to family reasons my father had a stroke and me and my mom weren’t getting along so I moved out at a young age and did everything on my own.

When I first started taking my career seriously at 18, I was never asked for anything, I started working in utilities, then switched careers to fiber optics where I make around 6500 a month my old supervisor whose also my friend quit the fiber optic company we were both working at and went to subsea fiber optics, he’s been telling me for 3 years to make the switch as well, and that the money and schedule was unbeatable which from what he’s saying 65k for 7 months of work and around 3-4 months off a year but that’s with me working every single day which I’m fine with, I’m single, always travel out of town anyways.

My uncle who I haven’t talked to since I was 9 randomly called me, i don’t know how he got my number but we caught up, my part of my family were the black sheep of the family we never had family gatherings or anything but he asked me if I graduated and what I do for work and I told him how I dropped out when I was in 10th grade and how I make decent money doing fiber optics for not having anything and he convinced me to get my GED which I have a goal to get within 6 months, but now he wants me to goto college and I told him I’m not really a school type of person I’ve been out for so long I don’t think I can commit to college and possibly waste time or money on it even though I know it could help me possibly make more and advance in life. He told me how he was in the navy then he used the navy to pay for his college and now he’s a doctor, and that all my cousins are engineers and it made me feel like a failure even though in my head with the cards I was dealt I feel like I made something out of nothing.

I love fiber optics, I wake up everyday ready to work and learn and just take on the next challenge, if I did decide to goto college I don’t even know what I’d go for, I know he just wants the best for me, he told me he felt bad for me, and that me and him were alike and how he also left home at a young age but stuck with education because that was all he had. He says he’s trying to help me but I don’t know what to do. I had goals planned already doing subsea fiber optics but would college really change my life more than subsea fiber optics will? College will take 2-4 years out of my life when I could be getting more experience doing sub sea fiber optics.

1giyr7y,"Marketing - bored, career change? Any ideas welcome!","Hey all!

So throughout school i was a bang average student, ok at all subjects. Got to GCSE and realised I really enjoyed business and was good at it.

As time went on, I took a liking to Marketing and followed a degree in it. At university I worked my ass off and got a first class honours in Business Management & Marketing. Doing a placement year at Microsoft in the consumer marketing team.

Since leaving uni, I worked at a cyber security firm and then an ecommerce SaaS startup. Im a problem solver, i have a really unique perspective on things and it allows me to solve problems with ideas that others havent thought about. I get hyper focused on something and dont stop until it's done. I quickly fell into CRM and automation within platforms like Klaviyo, HubSpot and am pretty good at it.

4 years in the failing start up that has generated no real revenue added by the team getting smaller and smaller means Ive gotten pretty burnt out. One with the workload but two because of the boring product/business - extremely difficult to sell and inability to see real impact from the marketing.

Now I'm contemplating a complete career change as the UK job market but particularly marketing is horrendous meaning im not landing a position anywhere else. My problem is im not sure what career route.

As i say, i love problem solving, im crazy good with tech and one thing thats said about me throughout all my roles is my attention to detail and fast learning of multiple platforms at once is ""unbelievable"".

Does anyone have any ideas what other careers i might enjoy or could explore please? TIA for any help!",AdTechMax,1,1.0,3,1730671893,2024-11-03 22:11:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1giyr7y/marketing_bored_career_change_any_ideas_welcome/,11,2024

1gixzpt,Quitting after using PTO,"I am a 22M bar manager living in Minneapolis MN USA. This is my first salaried management position. It is not going as well as I had imagined it, and a couple days before my vacation my GM and I had a pretty intense exchange of words that I decided was my final chance with the company. 

I was completing my 30-day notice at my previous job at the same time as I was training at this current job. I was never given a copy of my job offer or contract, just a copy of the employee handbook we give to all of our hourly and salaried employees (don’t sexually harass people, pages of leave information, etc.) I have asked for this multiple times.

Is it possible that they can void my PTO if I were to turn in my notice when I get back, although it is before payroll processing? I’ve heard horror stories from other employees about our manager finding every way to not pay out PTO to those who are leaving. 

If I were to submit my notice after payroll is sent over, is the PTO still something they could retract?

1gixyxy,Has anyone ever had Stockholm syndrome while in a toxic workplace ?,"Hi guys !

Let me be clear about my situation. I am currently working as an AA at an IO and it has been a year and a half.
It started out great and the role is interesting but after a year or so, I started management’s real colors.
Implementation of long admin (often useless) processes, ego battles, unfair treatment (all my colleagues are allowed to work from home at least one day per week, but when I ask to do it occasionally, it is subject to bargaining and most of the time, the Directors make it clear they don’t like me doing so).
However, management is not outwardly mean or aggressive but they are very micro-managing and always argue it is in everyone’s best interests.
My dilemma is this: I get along well with my colleagues which is something that doesn’t happen very often. Hence, I am afraid of the next work environment I will be in.
I know it doesn’t make sense as I have described management above but somehow, the Director likes me and I feel like it’s a secure place. 
But I also want to evolve professionally.
I know some of you will probably laugh and troll but I do value well-being at work and I think getting along with everyone is key.
Also, the Director gave me a chance and I feel like I would be ungrateful.
However, the micro-management and the long useless processes are wearing me out.

1giw2ph,Executive Recruiter Ghosted,"Here’s a refined version:

I recently met with an executive recruiter who informed me that I was in the final selection of candidates and that a meeting with the hiring manager was planned to discuss next steps in getting me to meet with them.  

During our conversation, the recruiter wanted to get to know me and understand my motivation for potentially moving from a large organization to a smaller one. They indicated they’d follow up within a week with next steps, but it’s now been 2.5 weeks, and I haven’t heard back. I sent a follow-up email to check on the status but haven’t received a response.

I’m considering my options and could use some advice:

1.	Should I just move on, accepting that “no response” is, in a way, a response?

2.	Would it be appropriate to reach out again to the recruiter or even someone on their team for an update?

3.	Would connecting directly with the hiring manager on LinkedIn to express my continued interest—or even introducing myself—be advisable - we’ve never met.

I’ve often felt that recruiters prioritize the needs of the hiring organization and their own interests above all else, which can be frustrating. I’m in a challenging position, as I’m prepared to leave my current exe position due to its increasingly toxic environment, but I have no new prospects lined up yet, which is starting to take a toll on my mental health - perhaps being unemployed is best!",CoolPackGod,1,1.0,0,1730664878,2024-11-03 20:14:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1giw2ph/executive_recruiter_ghosted/,11,2024
1givyu9,Need Advice on Relocating for Cloud Sales Career: USA? vs. Middle East (Riyadh/Dubai),"Hi all,

I’m a Cloud Sales Director currently based in Portugal, with extensive experience in cloud platforms. I specialize in cloud sales and API management, working closely with major providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. I currently manage a team of seven Account Executives and oversee an API Management Center of Excellence (CoE) for the EMEA region. I work for a large tech consultancy that’s a top partner for cloud providers across Europe and the Middle East. Our company has a strong market presence and focuses on digital transformation, helping enterprise clients maximize their cloud potential.

Considering My Next Move:
I’m looking to further expand my international experience and have two major options: relocating to the USA or the Middle East (with Riyadh and Dubai as potential hubs). Both destinations have unique appeal, but I’m struggling to decide which would be best for my professional growth and personal life.

What’s Drawing Me to Each Option:

	•	USA: The U.S. tech ecosystem is incredibly dynamic, especially in cloud sales. I feel there’s a solid network and a thriving market, which could offer a fast track for career growth. While the U.S. market is more competitive, I believe that level of competition would really push me to grow and evolve professionally. The U.S. would also align well with my family’s lifestyle preferences, especially with access to good schools and a vibrant community for my small children. On the practical side, there’s potential for lower taxes in certain states, and the climate in many areas appeals to us. I’d appreciate recommendations on which U.S. cities might offer the best mix of career potential, lifestyle, and family-friendly environment.
	•	Middle East: Both Riyadh and Dubai are investing heavily in tech and cloud services, with ambitious projects and strong government support. The financial incentives, tax benefits, and lower cost of living (especially in Saudi Arabia) are appealing and could boost our savings significantly. Dubai also has a more established expat community, while Riyadh’s growth trajectory is intriguing. However, I’m mindful of the cultural adjustments we’d need to make as a family, and I’d love to hear from others who have relocated to these cities with young children.

I’d Appreciate Input on These Points:

	1.	Career Growth: Given the current landscape, where is the demand for cloud sales expertise—especially with a background in AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure—likely to grow faster and provide more stability?
	2.	Family and Lifestyle: For anyone who has moved with their family, how was the adjustment, particularly in terms of schooling, social activities, and overall quality of life for young children?
	3.	Professional Networking: Which market—the U.S. or the Middle East (specifically Riyadh or Dubai)—would likely provide better access to relevant networking and career advancement opportunities?
	4.	Practical Matters: Moving to the USA seems trickier, as many U.S.-based companies hesitate to recruit internationally, and my current employer doesn’t operate there, so a transfer isn’t an option. Any advice on navigating work visas, cost of living, or other logistics when moving from Europe?

Thank you in advance for any advice or experiences you can share. I’m excited for the next chapter but want to make sure it’s the right fit for both my career and family life.",Annual_Quantity5523,2,1.0,0,1730664599,2024-11-03 20:09:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1givyu9/need_advice_on_relocating_for_cloud_sales_career/,11,2024
1givwjf,Negotiating Salary After Receiving Verbal Offer – Advice Plz,"Hi all, I’m currently in the final stages of securing my second job move. I received a verbal offer from HR last Friday via phone, and they mentioned that the salary range for my role is $75k - $85k.

I’m wondering if this range is already taking into account that I’d likely negotiate toward the higher end. In other words, does mentioning the $85k cap mean that it’s realistically attainable through negotiation?

After hearing the range, I mentioned that I’m looking for $90k. However, I’d be willing to accept if they offer $85k but would probably decline if it goes below $80k.

For those who’ve been in similar situations, does this $75k-$85k range suggest that reaching $85k should be fairly achievable, or could it indicate that they’re likely aiming closer to the middle? Any advice on handling the conversation from here would be much appreciated!

1givuwy,I want to quit my office job,"I'm a 25-year-old guy who, after a bachelor's degree in biology, decided to take a programming course to enter the digital world because I didn't want to work in biology. Four months ago, I managed to get an internship at a large company in the sector, one of those I didn't expect to be able to reach while I was studying.
However, in these 4 months, I've realized that I don't like office work. In fact, more generally, I don't seem to care at all about the classic idea of a career. Seeing my superiors, it seems to me that it just means taking on more responsibilities (I often see people working on weekends or late at night) for glory and a salary that's only slightly above average.
My colleagues are nice, the work is theoretically interesting and in line with what I wanted, and I also work remotely, but these 4 months have been terrible.
I don't like the office dynamics (frequent calls, frequent messages), deadlines, schedules that don't allow me to live outside of work, nothing.
Plus, I always start before 9 am and always finish after 6 pm (at least 7 pm) because there's so much to do and personally I can't be very focused and fast because I'm a bit demotivated.
Besides not liking it, it stresses me out a lot, I sleep poorly, and I'm not happy at the moment.
The alternative I have in mind is to work in the sandwich shop owned by my parents. The pay is higher, the hours would be 7:30 am to 3:30 pm, and the prospect is to take over the business in a few years (although this prospect scares me a bit).
I think the stress would be less and I would have more free time for myself, loved ones, and my hobbies. I'm just a little afraid of regretting it, because I'm throwing away an opportunity and because maybe I'm underestimating the fatigue and boredom of the shop. (I would like to interrupt the internship, or at least not accept the offer to continue).
Sorry for the length, but I wanted to be clear about the situation. What do you think? Do you have any advice? What would you do?",No_Clock_675,7,0.8199999928474426,14,1730664332,2024-11-03 20:05:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1givuwy/i_want_to_quit_my_office_job/,11,2024
1givsmg,Overworked/underpaid,"I have been in a situation for over 5 years where I feel generally over worked and underpaid. 

I started as an analyst for a company that was functioning largely as a start up. I built the data stack effectively from scratch. As we grew and were acquired, I was continually promoted and am now at a director level. I started at 57k with around a 3k bonus, startlingly little pay for what I was doing, and the hours worked, but I felt it was worth it to own the data strategy and gain that experience. 

I am now at 130k with a 20k bonus. The data stack grew with me. We’re now global, and I won’t get into revenue specifics but it’s a massive number compared to the start. I was a core part of that growth. During my time I’ve curated nearly every KPI we have and built every widely used dataset. I also directly oversaw architecture on pipelines in the stack. I’ve dealt with more emergencies than I can count and had many sleepless nights saving the company from major issues. I’ve also built several key systems. Effectively, I became a full stack engineer over the years, developing pipelines, applications, you name it using everything from Java to JavaScript, orchestrating our cloud environment in GCP, and controlling costs. Hundreds of dashboards, KPIs, etc. 

I want to be objective and don’t want my ego to cloud my judgement. However, i feel my work is only noticed when I have to save the day. My datasets and KPIs are often copied directly by other teams
Now that we’re in a big org, and I’m given 0 credit. A couple execs understand what’s going on, but can’t seem to really control it. I’m all for other teams using my code, and I don’t need credit, as long as I get paid well. The problem is I’m not. I don’t think 150 total comp is enough for what I do or the value I bring.

I’m also in a difficult position strategically. I’ve asked for additional engineers and analyst consistently, it was finally approved this year and I got the job descriptions in right away.

1givl6m,Advice who wants to change his career from civil engineering to business analyst,"Hello. I am 24 years old and live in Turkey in a middle-income family. My father does not own a shop or company and will soon retire. I am studying Civil Engineering at one of the leading universities in our country. I feel very undecided about continuing my career in civil engineering because civil engineers are not valued enough in Turkey, and their income is very low. Currently, I am doing an internship as a Business Analyst at a technology company, but most things in this field seem very unfamiliar to me. At first, I really wanted to pursue this job, but now, as I see how challenging it is, I feel reluctant to continue in this field. However, I know that changing from civil engineering to the software field is really difficult because the only software-related course I have taken is Numerical Analysis. Currently, I am learning what Agile is, and I have learned it well. I am also learning Postman and Python. I feel like my company will want me to continue with these. For graduate studies, I am considering doing a master’s in Economics, MBA, or Industrial Engineering. I am really indecisive. I truly need advice from those who have been in my situation and successfully overcome it or anyone who can help me advance in my career.

1give9f,Being undermined by senior colleague,"I am facing a confusing situation at work, I would greatly appreciate your views on this. I work in corporate and I have experience approximately 4 years from this company. So, compared to my seniors I’m fairly junior. I have recently noticed a behavior pattern from senior colleague, who I considered as my mentor, to be hostile towards me. First, my thoughts were that he considers me as incompetent. However, we have not worked together in that capacity that would allow him to assess my capabilities so it’s not really possible that he could come to that conclusion. I try to give some examples. Some time ago my role changed and I do more similar tasks to what he does. My supervisor at the time advised me to go to senior colleagues to request a supporting role in their projects (my supervisor was also above him) and I went to him. He promised to include me. Few weeks after he messages me and wants to let me know what he has chosen my junior colleague to support him in a huge project and hopefully I wouldn’t mind even that I asked him first. I pretended not to care. The person he chose was taking over my previous role so her role was different, thus I was confused. I have no blame against her whatsoever, but my seniors actions felt that they were calculated. 

I ignored it and carried on. Since then I moved teams and my senior male colleague and me are now reporting to the same person. Since then my line manager has allocated me to big projects with him. In summary, he does not include me and makes excuses as to why. In last stages of the projects he might ask something, I always deliver, and then he tells me to be quiet on calls with management. Then he might give me a reward for minimal involvement but is very careful to manage my visibility and role as he pleases. I am very confused and do not understand his behavior. Does he perceive me as threat? Does he think I’m an idiot? I feel like my career suffers from this and need advice how to navigate it.

1giv5dt,Should I choose money and work life balance over prestige and more appealing job?,"

Hi, I'm M24, based in Central eastern EU. I'm currently finishing a master program at a university in Austria. In a couple of months I will need to commit to a full time job. As of now, I have two student jobs:
1. Relatively managerial position at a technological startup with a moderate potential of scaling up in the future
2. Part time Management consulting job in a boutique consulting firm.
Right now, I'm splitting my time between these two but I will need to choose the one to commit to. 1st is able to provide my with a above standard salary + commissions but the job is kinda monotonous and will probably not change that much. I'm pretty sure that I do not want to focus on this job position in 10 years trom now. On the other hand, I can get pretty decent work life balance, being able to work trom anywhere and more or less anytime I want. 2nd is great for having a broad knowledge, the learning curve is steep. The disadvantages are the long working hours, and the starting salary is just average, however it is supposed to grow rapidly with promotions. This is the job I can see myself in 10-20 years.
The dilemma here is whether to chose money (1st job) that can help me skip a couple of years after graduation (I'd be able to get a mortgage on a flat right after finishing uni), or to choose consulting with an average pay and pretty shitty work life balance in exchange for reputation and potentially, more advanced job in the future.",Lumpy_Bench7451,2,1.0,2,1730662530,2024-11-03 19:35:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1giv5dt/should_i_choose_money_and_work_life_balance_over/,11,2024

1gis99b,How to deal with nice but incompetent manager? ,"I started a new job about 6 weeks ago. I really like the work itself and the company is incredible. I am on a two person team--just me and my manager. They started about 6 weeks before me, so we are both new. 

They are very nice, but I have growing concerns. For one, they don't seem to have a good grasp on their role yet and are frequently misunderstanding important directions from their manager (my big boss.) They also make a lot of mistakes (at least once a day) like sending the wrong documents, not linking things correctly, not reviewing things properly, typos, etc. They are not great at communicating which leads to awkward and embarrassing moments during meetings. They always use ChatGPT to write emails and it's painfully obvious. 

Because of these things, they are constantly at odds with big boss. I know my manager is trying, and imo big boss did not set them up for success, but there is just lots of frustration all around. 

Day-to-day I'm of course growing tired of constantly fixing their mistakes. But on a larger level, I'm concerned that this will reflect badly on me as we work together so closely.

1gir6f4,Not happy at work. ,"Working as a non-Japanese in a Japanese company, I’m part of a small, primarily Japanese team, with a strict manager who often critiques my work.

Conversations are typically in broken, simplistic English, and when I speak up, I’m often questioned repeatedly, even if my point is clear, leaving me feeling as though I’m constantly in the wrong.

My manager frequently reprimands me, sometimes over minor misunderstandings or simple errors. Public criticism, especially for mistakes like missing details in meeting minutes, is humiliating, and it feels undeserved. I also struggle with public speaking, which makes me hesitant to contribute in meetings unless I have something meaningful to add, but my manager interprets this as a lack of engagement.

1giqrmu,"I need some advice on switching jobs to one that pays in a foreign currency, and also asking my current company to match the offer!","I (20f) tutor on the side of my degree, mostly uni admissions tuition for international students wanting to be accepted onto the course I'm currently studying. It's a very useful income source, especially as my degree gets pretty intense so it's great to have something flexible with no commute time.

I've been offered a job at a new company that pays double my current hourly wage. This company operates from Hong Kong. They are going to pay me via Paypal, quarterly, in HKD. The pay is quarterly rather than monthly because there is a fixed £8.50 transaction fee for them sending money abroad via Paypal. I assume the £8.50 means that Paypal does convert the currency so I end up with GBP? (please correct me if I'm wrong here and the fee is for something else!!!)

One of my close friends teaches from this company and said he's never had any issues, but he's from Singapore and living there currently, so it may be different for him.

**The advice I need is**: would you, in my shoes (broke uni student) switch to a tuition company paying double the wage and take on the inconvenience of the PayPal thing? I know the obvious answer is yes, but I'm not sure what the implications are of being paid via Paypal in HKD which is why I'm asking for help on here. I'm completely clueless about it.

Also - my first point of call is going to be asking the company I tutor for currently for a pay rise. My wage hasn't changed since I started working with them 2 years ago, so my real wage has decreased despite gaining additional experience. Doubling my pay is a big ask, BUT luckily the course I study has one of the highest applicant : acceptance ratios in the UK, meaning there's lots of applicants and not many students who can tutor them. The company is also constantly sending me messages saying that new students have seen my profile and specifically requested my help. I have purposefully never referred any of my course mates to tutor for them (most of my other friends do work for them now through my referrals), so I believe I'm one of the only tutors the company has that studies the course I do. I'm hoping that they do see me as a rare commodity - I know they've made a LOT of money off me in the past 2 years.

So, any additional advice on asking the company to match the other offer and double my pay would be appreciated. I'm a bit nervous to do it because it's such a huge ask, but the optimal outcome here would be my current company matching the offer so I keep getting paid by a UK company, in GBP.

Anyone have more life experience than I do and know how to approach this ask?",emmaemmaemma1,2,1.0,0,1730651289,2024-11-03 16:28:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1giqrmu/i_need_some_advice_on_switching_jobs_to_one_that/,11,2024

over the past year, i have a new manager overseeing literally every single thing that i do. my previous manager was pushed out of the company, and now there’s no flexibility with this manager who i honestly believe is a misogynist. he disregards any opinion that i have or suggestion i bring to meetings, always having a counterpoint or just simply saying no and moving on. men who have been in the company for a year are getting paid significantly more than me to do less of a job. hes also demoting people who don’t deserve it and when i question him about it he just doesn’t answer me for a few days and changes the subject. 

he breaks labor laws left and right and forces employees to work in brutal weather conditions and fire them for calling in sick on busy days even if they genuinely are extremely sick. he doesn’t give people breaks either unless they ask for it and even then they’re told no unless they bring up labor laws. 

i stopped going above and beyond because i rarely get a thank you. this company has an awful turnover rate and im the longest standing person in my position. anytime anyone fucks up, they say to me, “everyone’s replaceable even you”. no one likes this manager and there’s nothing we can do about it because the owner of the company is wrapped around his finger. it just really sucks and i needed to vent because i need this job for schedule and financial reasons but i absolutely dread it and am so shocked at how this one person managed to ruin the morale so quickly.

For context: I'm 21 and this was my first job, started Nov 2023. 

Part time, pretty easy stuff just had to stand which was a pain but do-able. This year I got to do harvest season (basically 12 hour shifts, outside, lots of time sit between loads instead five hours inside and standing the whole time) and I really really enjoyed it but it ended quick and part time started up again. After that I had trouble adjusting to the short hours and the cold, got sick too quickly and too often and as a result I'm now unemployed.

1gik4qs,"I have tried to fix another person’s mistake, and am now being fired. What to do next?","TLDR: I have tried to fix another person’s mistake, and am now being fired. What to do next?

So I graduated college about 1.5 years ago and then got my first full-time communications job with a very large company. So overall, my first impressions of the place were generally positive - there was a branch-wide party/event within my first two weeks, and people seemed pretty welcoming for the most part. Now, the only part of the role that I initially struggled to adapt to at first was that my direct report was located in the UK, which is on the other side of the world to me. While I do have some other comms people in my branch, at first I found it a bit difficult to adapt at first as the time difference means that there is only a \~30 minute window to meet with my manager each day. 

Now, skip forward to my 6 month probation meeting: I am told that I am performing well above expectations, and that I am in line for a promotion within the next year. In the following \~6 months, I feel as though I made small-ish errors in my work at an increasing regularity, perhaps due to my workload increasing. Now I am aware of these errors, and I was very hard on myself for them and after my manager discussed it with me, I worked to improve my precision and made significant progress in the following months. Although I began to take a lot more time on my work and make errors significantly less, it began to felt like whenever I did something wrong, I was made to feel like it was a big deal and that I was doing it all the time. I should mention that bythis point, I was doing tasks that were, in my opinion, too senior for a graduate to be doing, especially considering that I am being paid a graduate wage. 

Now, onto the ‘incident’. As I mentioned the company I am working for is very large, and we have about 40,000 contacts in our CRM platform, all of which are contacts that we send emails to. Now it is important that each contact is labeled correctly, because emails go out according to region codes associated with the user. About two weeks ago, my manager emails me and tells me that there were some issues with some of the region codes and tells me to fix it by bulk downloading a spreadsheet of all the contacts and matching up their region info, which can only be found by searching up a name individually in our CRM. I should mention that this was through no fault of my own, I am unsure how this issue occurred. And as I had never done anything like this before, I was very confused as to how to go about it, so I asked. He gave me a pretty unhelpful answer and basically told me to ask a person who I worked with. I then asked said person, and they said that they did not know how to search for issues within a database of 40,000 contacts, without individually matching up region data with the data in another online platform. So, with no help, I formulated a plan and reached out to my line manager and branch manager, both of whom were now pushing hard for me to fix this, and told them my plan - I was going to use excel to auto populate each region in relation to the email. So for example, .UK email addresses would make the region UK, and so on. They both responded that they were happy with this strategy, but to be comprehensive. I agreed, and spent 3 full days researching each email domain for each country, and spot checking until I was sure it was fixed. Throughout the 3 days, I received more follow ups from my line and branch managers asking why the issue was not yet fixed. 

I was upset at being made to feel like I was at fault for this, so after 3 days of continuous work, I re-uploaded the spreadsheet to our CRM. I also made a comment to someone in the comms team in my branch expressing that I felt as though I was being treated unfairly and being made to feel at fault for this. The following day, my manager angrily emails me and says that the database is still incorrect. I said that I had no idea what else to do and that I was trying my best to fix this, but that I had no idea how to do it as I’d had no guidance. I am told that this is a huge deal as regional emails can’t be sent out properly, company wide. I am then told by my line manager that they want to chat to me in a performance meeting, so that is scheduled for the following week. 

Yesterday, I met with my line and branch managers as well as a HR person. After the HR manager introduces herself, my line manager tells me exactly what I’d told my team member (me saying that I felt as though I was being treated unfairly), meaning that the team member I’d told that to had gone straight to my line manager. Both managers then tell me that how I dealt with this situation was incredibly poor, lazy, and distasteful. I reiterated that I was thrown into the deep end considering that I had no knowledge of the issue, and spent 3 consecutive days trying to fix it. These words seemed to go in one ear and out the other - I was told that i should have known better, and should have asked for more help. My branch manager then said that the work I was doing was just adequate, and then criticized me for not engaging with company content on LinkedIn (unsure how that is relevant), and then told me that a weekly email that I send was sent a few hours late each week (again, news to me). Finally, I was told to stay and go on a performance plan, but encouraged to leave and ‘work in a smaller organization ’which would be ‘more my speed’. I think I am going to quit, but from another point of view, how much of this is my fault?",PopularAssistance239,18,0.7200000286102295,46,1730630661,2024-11-03 10:44:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gik4qs/i_have_tried_to_fix_another_persons_mistake_and/,11,2024

1gij524,Smartworking e ambiente di lavoro?,"Buongiorno a tutti, scrivo per chiedere un consiglio, soprattutto a chi si trova o si è trovato nella mia situazione. Sono una donna single di 45 anni che lavora in un ente pubblico. Per andare nella sede di lavoro impiego un'ora e mezza in andata e un'ora e mezzo al ritorno,utilizzando mezzi pubblici che sono talmente pieni da sembrare carri bestiame.Il mio ambiente di lavoro è composto prevalentemente da persone molto snob,i cosiddetti figli di papà,tanto che quando 7 anni fa presi servizio mi prendevano in giro perché abitavo in un paese vicino Roma,e non a Roma centro.Diciamo che a lavoro non ero benvista perché spesso utilizzavo la 104 per aiutare mio padre che aveva 90 anni e non era autosufficiente.Ero completamente sola in quanto mia sorella si è rifiutata di aiutarmi,voleva farsi la sua vita senza avere queste problematiche.Poi mio padre è' morto durante il Covid ea quel punto sono stata malissimo.Per fortuna avevo stretta amicizia con dei colleghi che mi sono stati parecchio vicino,ma si contano sulle dita di una mano. Nel frattempo a lavoro avevo conosciuto un uomo single della mia età, a cui piacevo e che a me piaceva. Non c'è stato nulla tra di noi poiché io sono molto diffidente e ho bisogno di sentirmi veramente apprezzata come persona per cominciare una frequentazione.Lui si è stranito della mia diffidenza e ho saputo tramite amicizie fidate che lui sostiene che dovrei corteggiarlo io in quanto lui non solo è un bell'uomo ma è anche più alto in grado di me e più ricco.Ovviamente non ne ho voluto sapere più nulla e quest'anno,sfinita dai viaggi e stufa delle persone che popolano il mio ambiente di lavoro,ho chiesto il telelavoro.Mi e' stato concesso ma sono stata criticata da molti perché secondo loro così starei eliminando la socialità nell'ambiente di lavoro.Il punto è questo: 1)il solo pensiero di dover fare 3 ore di viaggio al giorno sui mezzi pubblici mi fa stare veramente male.Ora vivo in una casa di proprietà di 100 metri quadrati con posto auto;vendere tutto e acquistare una casa vicino alla sede di lavoro(parliamo di Roma centro) significa dover fare un mutuo di almeno 150000 euro a 45 anni. 2)secondo punto,e forse questo è il punto più importante,non so se mi faccia bene psicologicamente stare a contatto con un ambiente di questo tipo.Dopo la morte di mio padre e il comportamento di mia sorella che si è precipitata solo ed esclusivamente per i soldi dell'eredità, ho avuto una forte depressione, da cui mi sono salvata per miracolo. Ora ho ripreso una vita normale. Ma non voglio più stare così. Infatti cerco di andare in sede il minimo possibile, un giorno alla settimana. A volte sono combattuta, temo di stare commettendo uno sbaglio e di isolarmi. Qualcuno di voi ha avuto situazioni del genere? Voi cosa fareste al mio posto?

1gihsnq,Career Change? Is it possible? ,"Hello, I am looking for some advice. Please be kind! Ty! 

I’m feeling a lot of uncertainty about making a career change after spending over four years in early childhood education. My experience in various roles, from ABA, instructional assistant to in-home care, has shown me the rewards of working with children, but the burnout and realization during my recent time off this summer made it clear that this path is no longer right for me. Despite my initial intention to stay in the field for only 1-2yrs max. I’ve found myself exhausted, frustrated, overwhelmed financially, and crying almost everyday by the demands of the job (due to various factors). 

Now, at 27, I’m at a crossroads, I quit my last job due to burn out and my mental health. I have been unemployed for four months and searching for a more financially stable career that allows for flexibility — I don’t mind a 9-5. 

Note: I have a double major in pre-law & liberal studies, with a minor in psychology that I really never used. I want to go back to school to find but I have interests in several fields—such as law, medical speech pathology, and even tech, etc but I feel lost and unsure about the best direction to take.

2 years ago something traumatic happened which caused me to develop a phobia of needles and any large amounts of blood.

But now I’ve been having some new questions

Is there a career in the medical field that I can do that has minimal contact with needles and large amounts of blood?

These past few years my focus has been on doing nursing, but I’ve come to the realisation that maybe my phobia and anxiety would be too much to continue with this career. 

I’m currently doing AIN nursing assistant. My next step was to do a diploma in nursing which would make me an enrolled nurse.

My question is- what other career options do I have? My main focus would be the medical field- BUT as long as the job is helping people emotionally, to feel comfortable when they are struggling is my main priority. 

It’s seriously fucking with my head. Please help. I am in Australia. Sorry if you see this in other places, I’m trying to get as many answers and advice as I possibly can.

1gifdux,Annual review help— can I ask my boss to stop nagging me?,"Background info: I work on a very small team at a small engineering firm. I have two managers that do high level review and project check ins but spend most of my time reporting directly to a PE who also reports to these managers. I track my hours meticulously because I have to bill my hours to different projects/clients, and my managers review my timesheets each week to ensure I’m not billing too much time to tasks I am assigned. We have a hybrid schedule and any deviations from our set remote days each week have to be approved by my managers, particularly if we ask to work our assigned remote days from anywhere other than our home office, like if we want to work our regularly scheduled remote days out of town the two days before Thanksgiving, for example. This is my first full time position out of grad school, and this will be my second annual review. 

At the end of my first year, I did not have any real negative feedback for my team. I am happy with the position I am in and generally like everyone on my team. I am expecting to be asked again this year by managers how they can better support me, and I have a concern that I could use help phrasing or deciding if it’s even worth bringing up with them. 

One of my managers repeatedly says things that come off as passive aggressive and somewhat accusatory, although I’m not sure that they’re intending them to come across this way. 

Some examples: 
-Over the course of working a hybrid schedule while on this team, things have been said to me in passing like remote work is nice but “we don’t bill clients for laundry”, but “things call to me at home that don’t call to me at the office”,  but “I just like to come in everyday so I can get more work done.”
-Asking me to do a lot of rework because available information changed on the project that had cascading effects (important to note this was not due to any errors on my end) and saying “I’d like this to be done efficiently.” 
-Being approved to work remotely out of state for 2 days but also being told “be mindful about your timesheet, working at home is distracting especially if it’s the holidays and you have family members around”
-If I inform this manager that files are really big or crashing a lot or taking a long time to open, they will immediately suggest that my Internet is bad and I should come in so we aren’t overcharging clients. My Internet is NOT an issue. Sometimes files are large and things crash at the office as well. 
-This manager will sometimes ask if I would be willing to come in on my scheduled remote days if they feel we can collaborate better that way— this is infuriating because often when we are in office on the same days we will still just Teams call each other from our own desks. 
-This manager accepted a request for me to work my regularly scheduled remote days out of town but added “I just want to acknowledge that we have a deadline in this period.” 

These are small but repetitive statements that make me feel like I am not trusted and that I am being spoken to like a child. Like oh, no, I was planning on doing task A B C as INefficiently as possible! I LOVE being distracted at home and billing clients for personal chores and activities! I have proven time and time again working remotely that I am honest about my hours, under billing for full days and taking an hour or two or PTO when needed if it’s the holidays or I have family in town. And suggesting that I don’t know when a major deadline is is just insulting. It should be emphasized that I was supposed to be remote for this deadline anyway due to my set remote schedule. I did not request extra time out of office. I go above and beyond for deadlines, it is documented that I will work overtime and come in on weekends when needed. I understand this is the nature of consulting/the position I am in. 

It’s important to note that this manager claims to be very pro office and to go in every day. I feel that their own inability to work remotely is projected onto me often. This manager claims to be extremely time conscious for clients but simeltaneously wastes a lot of time with meaningless conversation inside and outside of meetings. I am often more productive at home because we have a very social office. I find these sorts of comments to be especially grating because I completed much of masters degree, classes and research, remotely during the pandemic with minimal supervision, and am disciplined about my work hours and accurate time reporting. 

To be clear, we have never had any conversations about my productivity being low, specific suspicions about me billing time in a fraudulent manner, me working too slowly, or me being untrustworthy in previous reviews. 

I just feel like I’m being talked down to undeservedly— this is bad for morale and makes me feel like they don’t trust me unnecessarily. It’s an irritant and the other people on my team have expressed similar concerns. I firmly believe that someone can only take so much criticism in a 9h work day and those criticisms should be reserved for critique of actual work being produced or ongoing/confirmed behavioral problems, not wasted on cautionary statements that make it seem like I’ve done something wrong. The PE I report to and work with on a daily basis does not have concerns with the things she is constantly saying— I think it’s extra irritating that she is saying these things with no basis and we aren’t even working together on day to day tasks. 

The question: How do I bring this up to my managers? Or do I bring it up at all? I don’t know how to say this without saying “stop talking to me like a child— if you don’t trust me why do I have a job?” I don’t want to damage my relationship with them, but I also don’t feel that I deserve to be patronized and it makes me feel undervalued, which I’m worried is also felt by other members of the team, which is upsetting because I think we all work hard and work well together. I could really use some help phrasing this concern in a way that I can present to them verbally, in person, during my performance review. Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!

TLDR: is there a polite way to ask my boss to stop saying unnecessary naggy and passive aggressive things to me in my upcoming performance review?",birdsarentreal19,2,1.0,0,1730609309,2024-11-03 04:48:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gifdux/annual_review_help_can_i_ask_my_boss_to_stop/,11,2024

Tips for this and on improving?,"I've worked from home for four years and am now going to be in office full time in a brand new postion at a much smaller company.

Would you know someone working in Marsh Asia please ? I have an interview coming up and it is very important for me to get some insights about the work culture etc.

1gi7zt3,"Is it worth going into aerospace engineering?
","I'm currently in Year 12 in the UK, studying Maths, Further Maths, Physics, and Chemistry. I'm considering two possible career paths: aerospace engineering and economics, but each has its pros and cons.

For aerospace engineering, I’ve come across both positive and negative feedback about the industry on this server. My biggest concern is that, evem though I’ve lived in the UK my whole life, I’m not a British citizen, which could limit my job prospects in aerospace due to industry security restrictions. I might be able to apply for British citizenship, which could improve my options. Another option would be moving to the US, where the aerospace industry is much stronger (thought for another day). Getting work experience in aerospace is challenging where I live, though it would strengthen my personal statement. I also feel it would be much easier to write a compelling personal statement for aerospace, as I’ve been interested in topics like rockets and planes from a young age.

On the other hand, I’m also considering studying economics. I find it moderately interesting, and there are plenty of job opportunities with good salaries. Work experience would be easier to find, making it simpler to build a strong personal statement. However, since I don’t have the same longstanding interest in economics as I do in aerospace, it would be harder to express genuine passion for it.

I’m torn between following my interest in aerospace and choosing a more straightforward path with economics. Which direction would be best in your opinion?",Randumredditguy,1,1.0,0,1730585937,2024-11-02 22:18:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gi7zt3/is_it_worth_going_into_aerospace_engineering/,11,2024
1gi7ckw,How do I change career paths without getting another degree,"I am truly feeling lost in life mainly career wise.
I recently turned 30, with no career no savings and no job, I feel like a total loser.
I live in the UK, and went to university and completed a BA in Footwear design. Since finishing university I have been going from job to job, with no actual career.

I landed my first Footwear design job shortly after finishing university, this was an internship for a year. I really enjoyed this role. Once that was over I tried looking for other footwear roles but there aren't  many available, so I settled for an admin role whilst I looked.
After about a year of in admin, I landed another design role, however I found I did not enjoy this anymore and after a few months I got fired. 
 
A week ago I got an admin role but I'm not passionate about this and it's just a job whilst I find another role in design. 

Having said this, I am terrified that this is my life. Get a design job, not enjoy it, f*ck  around, get fired,  get an admin role and then the cycle continues. 
 
Whilst working as a designer I discovered I loved the sustainability aspects of what I do and I also loved learning about the materials.

I have thought of getting a masters mainly because I believe a degree in footwear was silly on my part and a masters in something more serious/academic would help me find a better more interesting job. 

Studying something like footwear at undergraduate. Generally makes getting a master in sustainability or materials impossible. 

After researching my interests, it seems I would have to do a second undergraduate degree, which I really do not want to. + (It's a lot of money and time) 

  Does anyone have any ideas on other routes to take?

1gi5jz3,Help in finding a career path!! Please,"Hello! Im not sure if I’m on the right subreddit for this but I thought I’d give it a shot and ask you all a question. I (17F) just graduated in may and I’ve been taking a break/ researching colleges/ secondary education options. At first I was thinking about going to college for a large animal medicine, but I decided against that because of the cost and a few other things. I figured I could just work with animals in my personal life rather than an obtaining a degree and ending up with a $200,000 debt that I may or may not be able to pay off. Anyways that’s not what I’m here to ask.

While I was researching on what I should do based off of things that I like/what I’m good at here’s what I gathered .

• I want to be a writer.(I’m working on writing my own books/poetry.)
• I really enjoy being creative ( painting, drawing, charcoal and sculpting).
• I’m working on making a collection of my art to sell. Nothing huge but something small on the side. 
•Illustrate for my own books
•I enjoy teaching others what I learned
•I love researching topics in depth 

Also side note, I want to start a yt channel soon and I hope to intertwine my education, experiences and hobbies into it. Idk if that helps with anything but yeah lol.

So I was looking at starting at community college for two years then maybe transferring to a university in the state I’m in (IN).{{Also I was homeschooled in high school but it was more of an independent study situation. I took a test and I graduated with honors and a gpa of 3.5. I say this bc public high school and recommendations is out of the picture.}} 
I was debating between getting a BA in one of the following (maybe):

visual communications
Liberal arts
Professional communication 
MAYBE, just MAYBE liberal arts or fine arts.. 

I’m under the impression that these are more of entrepreneur type degrees, which I’m fine with. I was considering doing freelancing as well. My only draw back with visual communications in the digital art.. I don’t know how I feel about doing all of my art digitally as my profession. Correct me if I’m wrong about having to do it all digitally please. I’m trying to type this all out fast too, so sorry that I keep messing up my grammar etc lol. 

Financing. So basically I cannot apply for FASFA, for reasons I’m not getting into for my families privacy, but I am a US citizen born and raised just to clarify. My family will not be helping me pay for any degree so I’ll be paying it off my self and with the help of other scholarships that I could apply for online.( please list any that you know of🙏). 
I think thats pretty much it. Please give me your insight, I really REALLY appreciate it. Thank you so much! ",tumericcocoa,1,1.0,2,1730579131,2024-11-02 20:25:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gi5jz3/help_in_finding_a_career_path_please/,11,2024
1gi55b1,How to prepare for a job shadow interview (Customer Service Rep for State Farm agent),"I recently applied for a Customer Service Representative position for a local State Farm agent, and was contacted by HR to complete a few assessments. I quickly got a phone call saying I did well, and she told me that rather than a traditional interview, I would be coming in for a couple hours for a job shadow. All she told me was that I’d be getting a feel for the work environment and that we’d get to know each other in a less formal setting.

I’ve never done an interview like this before and I have no idea what to expect. Usually I’d prepare responses for common interview questions. I’d research the company and thoroughly go over the job posting and try to tie my experiences to the specific job/company I’m applying to work for. If I will mostly be observing the work day, what are they looking for from me to demonstrate that I’m a strong candidate?

Also, I’ve done a lot of online research for the customer service representative position, and the job duties really seem to vary depending on the agent you’re working for. Some people have mentioned sales and meeting quotas, but there was no mention of sales on the listing I applied for. It was essentially resolve customer inquiries, maintain records, update clients about policy changes, etc. The listing was a bit vague and people have described vastly different experiences for the same position on the forums I’ve read through, so I’m struggling to feel prepared/know what to expect.

I’m desperate to get out of bartending/the restaurant industry and, while I’m super confident in my customer service skills, I lack any sort of office experience and am totally psyching myself out. Any tips/guidance/advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!!

I am recently getting my life back together and accepted a phone customer service agent at a regional bank in Chicago. It pays $19 an hour and is WFH mostly, but is located an hour away. I took the job as a “for now” gig until I find a role in marketing which is what my background is in. I have more flexible hours since I work 11-8 and have been interviewing since. 

I recently was offered a financial services rep role for Morgan Stanley that is located in the city about 25 min away, onsite for the first 16 weeks to study for licensing exams and pays $26 an hour. It’s still a phone based job after receiving the licensing you need. It’s in person 8-5 and then the shifts will change once you’re on the phones. 

I’m wondering if I should take the Morgan Stanley job or not since it’s still a phone based role and I’m looking for work in marketing. The name on my resume would be great and so would the pay increase but I’m not terrible interested in banking/morgage. I’m still also under consideration for a few marketing roles I applied to.

* There is no annual pay raise or merit-based bonuses. 
* My commute will be an hour and they don't allow you to work from home.   

At my previous company, I got $73,700 per year with an annual KPI-based bonus, which was typically around $6,000 each year, **so about $80,000** per year. **I also got a 3–5% pay raise every year** (3% if I did my job; more than 3% if I exceeded my KPIs).

So my base salary is about the same, except I got about a $6,000 bonus each year at my previous job and this job does not do bonuses. **There's also no annual pay raise process, so I will be stuck at whatever salary I accept.** The lack of formalized annual raise irks me.   

The market rate for editor positions can be all over the place. The original job listing listed the pay range as $65,000–$90,0000. I don't think I can negotiate other things like PTO. They emphasized their great benefits at several points during the interview process, even alluding a couple times to how the benefits package compensates for a lower-end salary. In my opinion, the benefits are ordinary except for two things that standout: 

* it's employee owned, after one year of employment you become eligible for the profit sharing retirement plan
* Tuition reimbursement after two years so long as the program has to do with your job. Your spouse and children are all eligible for tuition reimbursement too, and they'll pay up to the amount of whatever the University of Illinois is charging that year. So man, that is AMAZING for people who have kids! However, I am 36, single and already have a masters, so even if I were to meet someone and make a bunch of babies, I wouldn't be able to take advantage of that benefit for 20 years.

1ghy0ph,"Why do I keep failing to hold a job, and how do I fix it? Or is it impossible?","

Here is where I struggle with at work…

I’ve been in 2 companies at this point post MBA. Both have (current job will in 3 months) been terminated for the same exact reason ultimately:

Executive presence and likability. Actual job performance is solid (not exceptional though) - moving projects along and even coming up with several novel approaches to problems. I make people money ultimately, but apparently my personality doesn’t outweigh that.

This isn’t a problem that I just had yesterday: I was bullied and uncharismatic my entire childhood, from K to 12. I was very much the outgoing kid that wanted everyone to be their friend, and ultimately got taken advantage of a lot for it. So i have a highly extroverted personality, but life has taught me to be highly introverted due to the cost-benefit in being hurt and betrayed by people.

In college I also wasn’t very well liked. I tried making friends but I ended up either getting fun of or having people ‘forced’ to interact with me due to being a shared club officer or similar (this will become a trend moving forward). I only ended up having a couple friends from college, but those friends are lifelong at this point.

Ever since college, I’ve never been able to hold a job longer than 2 years. And only a couple times it’s been due to performance. I had one job where my boss would routinely insult me as ‘weak’ and eventually got let go. My first job out of college was very similar: I would get insulted by my type A boss daily, and when I decided to leave because of both being constantly disrespected and underpaid, he begged me to come back.

Even at my first job out of my MBA, the VP right before firing me from my PIP gave me a whole lecture on how I am a weak person.

When returning to my full time MBA, I can tell I was labeled as one of the ‘weird ones’ in my class. It felt very forced when people ever included in things, and often I would have gotten excluded.

I think I might be undiagnosed Asperger's or some kind of issue. There has to be a reason why for my entire life it just seems people are so utterly negative about me. Or maybe some other condition? Idk….

It seems like the universe wants me to do a job that’s highly technical and doesn’t interact with people, but I find those kinds of jobs utterly boring. I thrive when I get big puzzle problems and leading a project and team. The issue comes in how to get people to like me back…

I’ve read How to win friends, and various other books on social introversion and shyness over the years. They’ve helped to get over the trauma from past experience in childhood, but the underlying issues (whatever that is) keep following me.

I’m starting to suspect it’s mannerisms: I have a hard time sounding confident when grilled by those in authority. I use a lot more hand gestures than normal. I have a fairly raspy voice that could sound like a chipmunk. And I have a habit of talking about long form problems and going into tangents (my MBA coach would say I had a ‘nutty professor’ problem when recruiting).  I also stutter and talk way too fast. Those mannerisms get judged, and people make assumptions about competence even though there’s no reason to assume so.

Because at work I keep to myself for the most part: I intentionally stay quiet and don’t really talk about my personal life all to much. I don’t think I intentionally come off as annoying…but it’s highly possible that my mannerisms and unaware behaviors may.

I do a really good job at making a solid first impression to hiring managers because I do talk fast and have a strong strategic mindset, but that ‘nutty professor’ behavior bites me on the ass after awhile I think in staying credible.

Has anyone interacted with people like what I’m describing? Are there ways I can learn to either ‘fake it’ or just embrace what I am?

I’ve gone to therapists so many times and they’ve never diagnosed anything wrong with me: as a kid because I was bullied so much my school forced me into a psychiatry program to assess me for a long time, and the therapist after months evaluated that if anything I was too mature for my age, and that the only issue was I have ADHD and hyper sensitive…but reason to explain it. In college the staff psychologists evaluated me and said I simply lacked social skills training and recommended exposure therapy (which did work). I’ve done various teletherapy since and they’ve never diagnosed anything wrong.

I’m thinking of starting a business once I get my next job because it doesn’t seem I can hold a job no matter how hard I work. If I can’t get people to like me, then I need to sell them things where they don’t have to like me to give me money. At least that’s the theory….

Thank you all and appreciate any advice!!!

1ghxr61,drastic schedule change; quit or stay?,"some background: i work in transportation logistics, and because of the sheer number of workload we have, my position is split between two people who work 12 hour shifts — me and my shift partner. 

the 2/2 work schedule (two 12 hour shifts, then two days off) is perfect for me, because i live almost 2 hours away from the office, and commuting there and back home can be pure hell (the traffic after 5pm can last for hours). i've worked a regular 5/2 8-to-5 during my shift partner's sick leave and vacations, and i *hated* every moment of it. it was so bad it made me near suicidal, counting days until he comes back and we can go back to our usual schedule. 

anyway, he's transferring to another department within the next week, and as my boss had told me, they haven't found a replacement yet. just thinking about having to work 5 days a week and spending 4 hours on the road for the foreseeable future is making me sick to my stomach; sick enough to think about throwing in the towel and quitting.

so the question is: should i? should i hand in my resignation letter immediately, or wait and see if maybe they can find a replacement soon? the pay is average for this field of work, i have 3 months worth of savings to survive comfortably while unemployed, and i already have 4 job interview offers just from having my resume up on a headhunting site for a day.

My current job isn't being a Software Developer but my manager thinks it's great if I can add those skills to the team.

The only thing he asks is if it's done and nothing else. Also, I feel like he wants it to function perfectly pretty much. Then, on top of this he wants me to spend 5 hours or less per week working on this task.

The situation now is that it functions about 80%  to 90% of the way. Then I go back and forth saying how I feel like I need a lot of extra time if it needs to function perfectly.

1ghwy7s,"33F, RN school, realtor, what should I do?","Hello, I’m a 33yo F, living in LCOL area.  I have been on a search with what to do with my life.  Job satisfaction is important, I also realize this is what you make it and the people you work with account for this too. 

I have an associates degree in accounting (from 10 years ago).  I worked as accounts payable clerk (8hr shifts at desk crunching numbers) and didn’t love it.  Otherwise I have used my accounting skills in all my endeavors.  Out of high school got my real estate license and have worked under my mom’s small brokerage.  From the get go, I haven’t felt like real estate is my calling and I’m honestly pretty sick of it, grew up in it and would like to branch out, I don’t do that well.  

I’m currently in first semester of nursing school and excelling.  I am book smart and school comes fairly easy. My plan is to get a bachelors in nursing and hopefully get experience and branch off of that with some type of masters.  My thinking is that having a RN job will provide me a livable wage while I work towards more, and I do enjoy it so far.  

I lived in California for 6 years and helped manage a commercial cannabis farm, leaving right before the market tanked, I really loved this as well.  I grew up as a 4th gen farmer.  I also went to massage therapy school but my school was shut down a month before finish, loved that too.  

I’m always looking into what different careers pay, what degrees are required.  Yes I want to do something worthwhile with my life but I also love money and want to provide for my family.  

I’ve thought about becoming a NP, CRNA, engineering sounds interesting and seems like many paths.  Sometimes I wonder if I should’ve stuck with accounting but just not sure if desk life is for me.  Advice?  I have a 14yo daughter, single mom.  Determined.  Have had my share of rough patches but am resilient.  

I like helping people, I love psychology and have thought about LCSW (for ability to do therapy), Psych NP, private practice NP.  I love being outside (farming), I like using my hands.  Real estate is cool but it’s a 24/7 gig, no built in benefits, a very localized career.

I am working at Accenture from past 3 years and now I am planning to make a switch. I had some opportunities come up, but whenever I mention the 2-3 month notice period, the follow-up seems to get stop. It’s been frustrating, so I’m considering resigning and then actively looking for the job. I know it’s risky, but I don't see any other option.

I’d like to avoid resigning during months when hiring tends to be slow. Assuming I’ll need to serve a 3-month notice period, which months would you recommend for resignation?

1ghsapj,"28F, Content Strategy | What should I be doing next? ","
I am 28, studied MBA and then a Post Graduate Diploma in Strategic Innovation & Digital Marketing. From New Delhi, India. Work with Data and Analytics org that services F500s. Before you think I must have had opportunities line up for me due to the MBA, I must confess, I did MBA from a bad college. But without that degree I was barely employable. 

I have always worked in content, and off shoots of content. Social media strategy, copywriting, campaign management, and currently do content strategy for data and analytical products. 

Have total work ex of 4.5 years, three of which I spent in social media marketing and now in data product strategy. 

This role requires building adoption plans for analytical products, starting with scoping and planning for what kind of content collaterals will we develop to help the TG get excited and aware about a complex data tool. Think - videos, ebooks, one-pagers, playbooks, cheatsheets, cue cards. Post which I write for the mentioned collaterals. I also write UX Copy but not extensively. 

It’s a unique role but it is heavily reliant on content and right at the edge of product management. The niche nature of it makes it hard to lay down a path for development. 

Now that I have been in it for a year, I need to know how to plan for the next 18 months. I am confident of my ability to produce engaging and informative content, although I would love to do better at that. Beyond which, I am confused - what are the skills I need to hone? Should I take up product management, I have no tech skills, so that will be hard. I am genuinely curious about comms, content, customer experience and UX. 

What is it that I can focus on in the next 18 months to do better at the current role and also set myself up for success as I enter the mid-career years?",findingmeemaw,1,1.0,1,1730537813,2024-11-02 08:56:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ghsapj/28f_content_strategy_what_should_i_be_doing_next/,11,2024

""Don't worry you'll be given 2 weeks pay""

I worked around 10 months. The work I did for xyz client, was the one which took a lot of time. The client was already on a thin ice with the company. I did exactly as the project lead wanted me to do. The communication factor was bullshit. Instead of getting the approval of the client the project lead was just giving her own suggestions and opinions about the project making me change a lot of minor things a million times. 

I am assuming they lost the client. The project was from Jul- Aug. After that I just did what I was given. There was no trouble there. They hired two new people around the same position as mine. And fired me. Offered me two weeks of severance. The company operates completely remote. I was an overseas employee.   
The company is based in NYC but all the people are from different part of the world.    
They never gave any company handbook and I never asked for one (this was my first job, I didn't know shit about corporate stuff, it's a small company).   

Is two weeks of severance normal? Should I ask for more? I never took any PTO (3 PTO/quarter).

1ghqznp,New manager being difficult,"I have been at my current job for 10 months. The company is growing so they have been hiring more new people. My old manager moved to another newly created team and they hired a new person to be our manager. She’s been at the company about 1.5 months now.

I quickly realised that this person is a control freak. As I mentioned, the company is growing, we currently have our financial year end (I work in the finance team) and it is extremely challenging to manage conflicting priorities as there are so many ad hoc things that pop up. This new manager wants to add a lot of structure to the team (which is not a bad idea but currently does not work) and she is trying to impose her working style on us. Because she is being so difficult, I am trying to navigate the additional challenge of managing her, besides being overwhelmed by my workload.

She has been attacking and criticising me (and my other 2 coworkers, but they had annual leave for some of the period, so I was the main person) for every little thing. She is taking everything as a personal offence herself. One example of this is - one day I said to her something is already ready for review so she could look at it that day. Her response was: “YOU DO NOT MANAGE MY TIME!” on a not very nice, raised voice. This is just one example. I have also been trying to bring more structure so I have been emailing her with work updates. Then she was complaining that I send her too many emails and she does not like it. It seems like anything I do is not good enough for this person. 

Another time I have sent a recurring piece of work to a person that’s requested it (I have been preparing that for about 6 months and this was an update for year end where 2-3 values have changed). I just sent it directly without telling her and she exploded that I am hiding things from her. 

There are daily instances of attacks and aggression.

I am taken aback by this behaviour and quite frankly I am afraid of telling her anything because I don’t know how bad of a reaction I will get.

I want to raise this with a more senior person, but I am afraid of the repercussions it will have on me. My manager is still on probation and I don’t know if this is a good enough reason for her to fail it or it’s just going to bring her more stress and give me more hard time.

Anyway me and ex C-suite boss and I have been sending some texts back and forth trying to set up a time to have lunch because of all the events that have transpired and because they disappeared him, and we had no chance to talk before he was booted mysteriously in company style.

The last text while I'm driving home, he warns me to be wary about putting anything about the company on Reddit and that he can tell me more over the phone. So I call him as soon as I'm home and he keeps repeating how he doesn't care etc but the CEO suspected a profile on Reddit was me and he named some minor details that he thought were all in one ""thread"" that are clearly about him, and this was apparently talked about in meetings between the CEO and him and at least one other C-suite person. These conversations happened \~1 year ago and apparently it was brought up in more than one meeting.

I searched for a comment he could have been talking about and found it - it was in a highly personal parenting sub where we all talked about our daily lives. The thing is, the only way that anyone could have identified me by this comment would be by stringing it together to other comments. There was another personal detail about him that was only in other comments, so there were at least two containing the short blurb of info he identified. I never once mentioned our company name in any comment. So I think it must have been from maybe overly niche or personally identifying comments I made in a sub for my industry, or comments in a sub for investors for one large company in our industry, that led someone to then read more of my comment history maybe wondering if it was someone they knew, and link things together. That's the only way it's possible, but I'm already very disturbed since the comment mentioned had nothing to do with any comment that could have led them to start reading things on my profile. I definitely recognize the huge mistake here and lesson well learned (I originally had different accounts for anything remotely work/career related and highly personal stuff, but kept making mistakes on the idiotic Reddit app posting from the wrong account, back when it was especially awful for this, and eventually said screw it and consolidated to one), no need to tell me what an idiot I am. I know.

So now I don't know how to proceed with this knowledge. This was from at least 1.5 years ago that they knew (that's when the comment my former boss referred to was made). I don't think it's been brought up recently in any meetings, and I don't know how much they've read. I have reams and reams of medical stuff, personal life frustrations, details about my relationship, the works - daily thoughts on there going back over 10 years and I'm absolutely mortified. Obviously I was never reprimanded as I never gave any company info other than vague descriptions of what sub-industry I work in and some comments showing general expertise in that sub-industry, But now that I know that they know this, how can I go back in there again? How can I know the depth of it? All I can think of doing right now is asking for more info from my former supervisor as to what exactly they were discussing about my comment history. He kept repeating it sounded all ""highly personal"" and he graciously but pointlessly refrained from implicating it was for sure even me, but I think he knows it definitely is. And obviously I'm hard stopping using that account, will probably delete it to avoid any additional recreational reading.

So I call him as soon as I'm home and he keeps repeating how he doesn't care etc but the CEO suspected a profile on Reddit was me and he named some minor details that he thought were all in one ""thread"" that are clearly about him, and this was apparently talked about in meetings between the CEO and him and at least one other C-suite person. These conversations happened \~1 year ago and apparently it was brought up in more than one meeting. 

I searched for a comment he could have been talking about and found it - it was in a highly personal parenting sub where we all talked about our daily lives. The thing is, the only way that anyone could have identified me by this comment would be by stringing it together to other comments. There was another personal detail about him that was only in other comments, so there were at least two containing the short blurb of info he identified. I never once mentioned our company name in any comment. So I think it must have been from maybe overly niche or personally identifying comments I made in a sub for my industry, or comments in a sub for investors for one large company in our industry, that led someone to then read more of my comment history maybe wondering if it was someone they knew, and link things together. That's the only way it's possible, but I'm already very disturbed since the comment mentioned had nothing to do with any comment that could have led them to start reading things on my profile. I definitely recognize the huge mistake here and lesson well learned (I originally had different accounts for anything remotely work/career related and highly personal stuff, but kept making mistakes on the idiotic Reddit app posting from the wrong account, back when it was especially awful for this, and eventually said screw it and consolidated to one), no need to tell me what an idiot I am. I know.

So now I don't know how to proceed with this knowledge. This was from at least 1.5 years ago that they knew (that's when the comment my former boss referred to was made). I don't think it's been brought up recently in any meetings, and I don't know how much they've read. I have reams and reams of medical stuff, personal life frustrations, details about my relationship, the works - daily thoughts on there going back over 10 years and I'm absolutely mortified. Obviously I was never reprimanded as I never gave any company info other than vague descriptions of what sub-industry I work in and some comments showing general expertise in that sub-industry, But now that I know that they know this, how can I go back in there again? How can I know the depth of it? All I can think of doing right now is asking for more info from my former supervisor as to what exactly they were discussing about my comment history. He kept repeating it sounded all ""highly personal"" and he graciously but pointlessly refrained from implicating it was for sure even me, but I think he knows it definitely is. And obviously I'm hard stopping using that account, will probably delete it to avoid any additional recreational reading.

My company is doing a bunch of layoffs. I have been advised by a let go manager that my best bet to stay employed I will need to switch to a neighboring  department. The role is similar to what I do but it has more responsibility and it doesn’t necessarily align with my long-term career goals. But I do see the value in the new skill set I could learn (project management). They also have tough standards for promotions and such. 

I have been job searching since July but I have not gotten a single interview. I work in the tech space so lots of competition although I have been trying other fields as I have a diverse background.

1ghnzhz,Do I have grounds to file an ethics complaint even if I’m leaving?,"Tomorrow will mark 6 months at my nonprofit job. I don’t want to doxx myself, but let’s just say I work for the elderly and am one seat away from directly reporting to the ED. It’s about 12 administrative staff (including myself) and 30 direct support staff. I have been told multiple times I have more than exceeded performance expectations and that everyone is very happy with my work output.

I still don’t have my own desk, computer, email, or office. I have been working on a tiny table in my supervisor’s office. My supervisor is extremely difficult, not in the sense of work or her expectations but in her personality and quite frankly, concerning behavior. I think my ED has seen my struggle with not having the space or resources to do my job as advertised.
The executive director offered me my own office today. I was thrilled; the best office in the whole place. My direct supervisor shut it down INSTANTLY. Flat out told the ED she wasn’t happy with me leaving her office. I asked my supervisor if it was a performance issue or if she felt I need more supervision and training. Both my supervisor and ED said I have exceeded their expectations. My supervisor simply said she “works better with me around” and “it makes more sense for us to share” which is why I can’t have my own office. My push back fell on deaf ears. My ED simply said if it works for me, my supervisor could “keep me”, effectively leaving the decision in my supervisors hands despite my repeatedly expressed displeasure.
I have over 30 documented instances of harassing or inappropriate comments from my direct supervisor. My supervisor used to be board president and hired almost all of our admin staff after fully cleaning house. She executed massive takedown campaigns against all of the old admin, and has done this multiple times in multiple jobs. Her final blow was to fire the woman whose job she wanted, resigned from the board, and then took her job. 
I was essentially hired to help clean up the fallout of that decision. I cannot stress enough what a manipulative and dangerous person my supervisor is. My ED on the other hand is one of the sweetest and best people I know. I don’t know if my ED is being strategic in handling my supervisor or if she’s actually toothless, but my supervisor seems to be running the show. 
I also have experienced extremely inappropriate behavior from staff who are not my supervisor, all of which I have documented and addressed with my ED. My ED and I have a very trusting and positive relationship. It is very possible that I will have a new job offer Monday, with better pay and my own office. If I had my own office, I would rather stay at my current job because my current supervisor is retiring in a year and I will be promoted to her job. I’m not sure if I want to play the long game at this org. My main question is if I should leverage this new offer and go above my supervisors head, straight to the ED, or just thank them for the opportunity and leave without trying to negotiate? Do I have grounds to file a complaint with the board even if I’m leaving?",unemployedbird,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1730519201,2024-11-02 03:46:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ghnzhz/do_i_have_grounds_to_file_an_ethics_complaint/,11,2024

1ghnngv,[ company review ] My Internship Experience at NullClass as a Full Stack Web Developer.,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my recent experience interning at NullClass as a full stack web developer. It was a two-month journey that combined training and hands-on work, and it was a great learning experience overall!

During the first month, I completed an intensive training program where I worked on building a web app to showcase my skills. This really helped me get comfortable with new tools and frameworks and made me more confident in applying what I’d learned.

Once I transitioned into the internship phase, I focused on enhancing the app by adding key features that NullClass wanted. However, I ran into some limitations when implementing production-ready features that required premium services. For example, I integrated Twilio for SMS functionality, but its basic plan only supports local testing, not production usage. As a self-funded intern, I opted for free services, knowing they were limited to local environments.

Unfortunately, this restriction meant some features couldn’t be fully tested in a production setup, even though the implementation was correct. As a result, NullClass deducted part of my final payout, which felt a bit unfair since the limitations were due to the budget constraints rather than my work. But overall, I still found the experience very rewarding. I learned a lot about the industry’s expectations, honed my skills, and worked on an actual project, which was invaluable.

Despite the hiccup, I’d say the experience was worth it specially for the beginners at their respective fields.",ABHISHEK7846,2,1.0,0,1730518046,2024-11-02 03:27:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ghnngv/company_review_my_internship_experience_at/,11,2024

1ghmn5t,Stick with current remote job or take hybrid offer with a $15k raise and stock options?,"I’m currently working fully remote, making $61k. The work is super easy, and I like my boss and coworkers. The only downside is the product, which is kind of lousy, and the company itself is evolving slowly with no room for growth. I know I eventually will have to leave.

Recently got an offer for a hybrid role in Manhattan (3 days a week, Tues-Thurs), with a $15k pay bump plus stock options. But I feel like the added cost of commuting or getting an apartment in/near NYC would eat up most of that increase. This new job is in ad tech, which honestly doesn’t interest me much, but there are more growth opportunities here than in my current role.

I’m also working on my CompTIA A+ certification to eventually switch out of customer success and into IT—something more tangible and hands-on, which would suit my personality better.

Given all this, should I stick with my remote job and work toward the switch to IT, or would the hybrid role with more money and growth potential be worth it?

1ghlnqh,Reschedule An Interview With The Company That Ghosted Me? ,"Hi, I have been job hunting for the past month and it’s been a little slow. I’ve been waiting for schedules to interview but haven’t really heard back from the clinics that have reached out to me already. I *was* scheduled for a virtual interview with a company this past Monday. I logged on 10 minutes before the scheduled time. And… no one showed up. I stayed on the link for 40 minutes and no one showed up. I triple checked the link and the email that was sent to me and everything appeared to be correct. 

I reached out to the clinic that scheduled the interview as well as the company's recruiter to follow up. I asked if there was a mistake in the link that was sent to me or if the interview was rescheduled for a different time. I heard back two days later from the clinic and received no explanation as to why no one showed up for my scheduled interview or what happened, etc. They just went straight into asking me what my availability was for rescheduling the interview. I was a little shocked and taken aback and ended up letting them know that I would call back next week to let them know my scheduled availability. 

But now… I’m wondering if I should even reschedule. I felt disrespected that no one showed up to the scheduled interview and that I was not given an explanation as to why the interview did not happen. I guess I could’ve asked if I could know the reason as to why the first interview fell through, but I guess I felt like I shouldn’t have to ask? I guess I felt like they should have at least given me a heads up or some kind of explanation. 

But I also need a job and don’t really have any other interviews lined up. I was wondering if I could get some advice as to whether I should reschedule or just take this as a sign that this company is not meant for me.

1ghkush,Advice Needed on Negotiating Full-Time Offer After 7-months of a 9-Month Contract  Role in Process Documentation ,"Hey everyone, I’m hoping for some advice on a job offer situation. I’m currently working for a family-owned greenhouse company on a 9-month contract as a Process Documentation Specialist, earning $65,000/year. My main responsibilities involve documenting ERP-related processes, creating SOPs, and assisting with ERP implementation. It’s been a great experience, and I’ve enjoyed contributing to the team.

Recently, I was offered a full-time role as a Process Improvement Specialist with expanded responsibilities, including inventory control, CFIA compliance, and cross-departmental backup. This new role aligns with my background in production and compliance, but it’s also a significant step up in scope from my current role. The initial salary offered was $73,660/year. (This is including a 1.6% adjusted rate increase because of inflation which the whole company got)

My Counter and Rationale

I did some research and found that similar roles in Ontario can range widely, with a base starting at $64,000 and going up to around $137,000. Based on my 8 
7 months of experience with the company, my prior experience in production optimization, and the broader responsibilities of this role, I asked for a range closer to $90,000–$95,000. I mentioned that if $90,000 was more feasible, I’d be open to an extra week of vacation to help balance things out. There is a full benafits package which i am ok with 

The Company’s Response

The HR manager came back with a thoughtful response, explaining that:

	•	The local salary range they found was between $65,000 and $85,000, with the higher end generally requiring engineering degrees or certifications like Lean Six Sigma or Kaizen.
	•	Salaries in our area are about 10% lower than the provincial/national average due to cost of living.
	•	Job sites often list inflated salary ranges to drive traffic.
	•	They also highlighted that the additional tasks in this role don’t require significantly higher qualifications than my core role, so they didn’t affect the salary much.
	•	Finally, they’re aiming to maintain internal equity with similar roles at the company.

She did say, though, that she’d discuss possible movement on the salary with the higher-ups when they’re back in the office.

Next Steps

I want to get closer to my target range if possible. I’ve replied, emphasizing my commitment to delivering value in this expanded role and adding that I’d be willing to pursue any certifications that might strengthen my fit for the higher range.

Would love some feedback on how I’m handling this or any other strategies to maximize my chances of reaching the $90,000-95,0000 range. Thanks in advance!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I work in sales/account management for a service upkeep 

- I place jobs for the tech team to go and repair/access, they probably don’t show up to or complete 40% of these calls and we receive complaints daily

- My trainer or go to person in the office to ask questions to. Just expects you to know, he occasionally helps but it’s always very brief and he makes many mistakes teaching. He’s a great guy but he can’t explain anything to save his life. So leaning has been all self learning and the books we use are out of date until recently and we never got notified of this. 

- There is constant drama and two faced people. You can’t trust a single person. It’s very cliquey. A lot of people are shitting where they eat for a lack of better terms and bring that life and drama into work. They make you feel like the outcast when you don’t divulge in this stuff.

1ghgs7u,CS vs Medicine,"Hey everyone,

I am a high school senior and I don't know whether to go into cs or medicine. All my extracurriculars are based around cs currently and i feel i have a good shot at a top 10 cs school. i feel like im not that good at coding, but really good at math. is the job market oversaturated in cs as well? yes. this is why I am hesitant.

ive been bouncing with the idea of startups, but it is very unlikely that it will work, so i looked into venture capital and it seems interesting but i don't really know about doing an mba and a lot of people say vc is for past startup owners and i dont know if i can get a good high paying vc job right out of college. i also looked into quant finance and this is really interesting to me, but also so competitive. i really don't want to burn out early with stress either.

On the other hand, medicine has a lot of job stability and i want to apply to a bs/md program. im also kind of scared of medicine only because of cadavers and stuff (REALLY scared of dead people maybe bc of movies) but i feel like i can handle the work because i know there is a guaranteed outcome at the end unlike cs which isn't stable. I also don't have an issue for the debt because i come from a high income and my parents are doctors. my parents say being a doctor isn't good but they seem happy and have money and they think cs will give me money but its so unstable. one of the biggest things for me is i don't want to be another random corporate person working their way up the ladder, working on useless software, and barely contributing in the big picture. i want to make a real impact in some way shape or form. i don't really like being in hospitals either because they feel eerie to me.

All this has really been stressing me out. i want a really high starting salary (think 400k) and a good wlb. i also want to have prestige in my life and i feel i cannot get that with cs career. i dont know what to choose and any guidance would be much appreciated because all this is keeping me up at night. Anyone with any one of the jobs i mentioned, your feedback would be really valuable to me. also any other job suggestions would be nice",One_Duck_634,0,0.33000001311302185,1,1730497455,2024-11-01 21:44:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ghgs7u/cs_vs_medicine/,11,2024

1ghfnjt,Is plumbing/trades for me?,"
I’m 18 and currently in college for Electronics Engineering Technology and not enjoying it at all. I did a technology/computer/electronics engineering course in high school and enjoyed it which prompted me to take this program. But about 3 months in, I’m not enjoying it at all. I’m not interested, unmotivated and the work load is getting to me. I’m not sure where my skill set exactly lies in but I know I can handle physical work and don’t mind the grind which is what led me to looking into trades. Plumbing was one of the trades on the list and my school has a program that will help me become a licensed plumber in 4-5 years. Essentially it’s I become an apprentice for about a year, go do an 8 week in class part and rinse and repeat 3 times then I write my exam and I’m a licensed plumber. But my only worry is that I have no prior experience and am worried if I’ll like it. I don’t mind physical work, don’t mind getting my hands dirty, not the smartest but can understand most concepts and had good grades in high school but I am not the type to sit and study outside of school. Just looking for some advice from anyone who is/was in a similar position or any plumbers that can give some words about the trade.

1ghfgto,How to navigate getting an office job?? ,"
Hi all. Been thinking about what I want to do with my career. I have been spending the past 10 years in food and beverage management at a pretty large theme park company in central Florida. 

I have always been a self starter, teaching myself what was necessary in this field. Became a leader amongst my peers, a go to resource. And so on. 

The part I’m stuck with? I keep getting told I’m on the track to the promotion. But I just keep waiting while going above and beyond to get myself out there. 

The other side of things. I have been pulled for a temporary project in this field and I am LOVING it. But there is no spot or career position in this, essentially to be a project manager in foods here is very very select and not like other project managers in other companies 

So I am not sure what to do. I have been pretty miserable in my position prior to starting this project. And now that I have had a taste of office life, am I the outlier wishing for the 9-5 life? 

And if so, how do I get there without the experience these postings are looking for? I have applied to hundreds of these job. Some went through an interview process and then rejection. Anyone have any advice??

1ghewnj,Any advice on what I should do here? A rival company is trying to poach me.,"Hi guys, 

So basically title. I'm an assistant manager in a large retail/trade business in the UK. I was recently approached by a rival company for the same role and I'm really conflicted about what to do, I had the interview/meeting today and it went really well, they were very impressed. I'll list some information about each one:

Job I'm currently in:
- the base salary isn't anything amazing
- I earn commission on every sale, some weeks I'm making 20% extra on top of my salary
- quarterly bonuses based on exceeding store targets, once target is met, anything on top I get 10% of as the bonus
- national chain which is very unlikely to go bust
- 4 employees in the store including me and the store manager
- less career advancement opportunities
- even if we don't do budget, I will always be earning commission
- 30 mins commute time that costs me next to nothing
- warehouse type layout
- awful, old systems that can be a pain in the ass to use but I've gotten used to the jank 

Job I've been offered:
- 8% increase on my basic salary
- no commission but monthly bonuses based on gross profit margin targets being met which will be 10% of my salary
- annual bonus based on gross profit margin targets being met which will be 5% of my salary for the whole year
- much smaller business with only about 5% the number of branches as the other business
- more room for growth and opportunities at head office which is local to me
- double the commute time
- bespoke showroom environment
- newer, more comprehensive systems to use

It just feels like such a risk to leave the role I'm comfortable in not knowing if the store will consistently hit budget to get the monthly bonus or the annual one. 9 times out of 10 I'm the top salesperson in my current role and we exceeded budget last quarter due to me, so I received the quarterly bonus.

Just looking for some opinions really, normally I trust my gut but my guy isn't telling me anything.

1ghdwk5,Should I tell my boss I feel unwanted around my colleagues?,"Basically when I first got hired around a year ago I went to the company party so they flew in all the remote people, I’m one of them. 

Now to start I’m a very friendly and welcoming person and always try to get to meet and know people especially since we’re working together. 

But basically went to this Christmas company party event and just felt like an outcast….nobody really tried to talk to me or really get to know me. I went out to drink with everyone after the company party and while at the bar I was told, “hey you don’t have to stay here if you don’t want to”. Now I’m not sure if I’m jumping to conclusions but kinda felt like I was asked to leave? 

A year later I asked my boss how I can get to my senior position. He told me not only on top of my client work (which I do very well at) he wants me to do so more leadership and interaction with the team. Basically lead some meetings or skill type meetings. But I feel like I’m not well respected or cared about. So it would be hard for me to get anyone’s attention when it comes to me trying to showcase my skill on how to do something better or how to improve something 

So idk. Should I express to him I can’t complete that part of the promotion because I feel not well respected ? Or is that a risk of me getting fired because they could pin it on me and say it’s my fault some how.

I want to make sure if they say yes to the second option that I get additional money on top of my raise. 

I don’t know if I should ask before my review so my boss has time to allocate extra money in the budget. Or during my review so I can see what my original raise was going to be.

To keep this short - I just finished my onboarding for a position that I accepted this past Wednesday morning. The position isn’t my dream job and I had actually applied to another job within the company that I *really* wanted but hadn’t heard back on. 

Whelp, on Wednesday afternoon (right after I finished my onboarding for the first job) the second job that I had actually wanted reached out to me (it’s in the same company though.) 

I *really* think I’d be better suited for the second job. My thing is -the interview is not until next Wednesday (I’d already be two days into the first job with a company computer and everything.) 

Is there any way to, professionally, accept this interview without looking like a complete flake to this company? 

Even if I get the job - I’d have to tell the interviewer “oh no need to schedule a laptop pick up, I already have one” which I feel would change her mind about me. Especially as I’ll have to tell her that I just started the job two days previously.

1gh8ruz,Engineering to… what? ,"I’m five years into my career as a Mechanical Engineer in the USA. I have my Masters and could earn a PE with another YOE. I was liking being a design engineer at my company, but lately we have been floundering. It’s stable, it’s remote, it pays decently well but not outstanding, and I work 40 hours a week. But I’m bored of it. 

Some things I’m interested in are renewable energy, sustainable and green buildings, housing, and vehicles. These seem more like Civil and EE career paths so I’m not sure how to break into them. 

The thing is, I want to have an impact. I don’t want to continue being solely task focused as an individual contributor, and I am tired of the fiddly little details. I want to work with a bigger picture. A little more cross functional would be fun, without going into project management or just getting promoted to supervisor. I also value having some free time, which seems to conflict with the supervisory and PM roles. 

I seem to know what I don’t want to do but can’t quite figure out what it is that I want from there. Engineering is my core, but branching “outside of the box” isn’t immediately obvious to me. I’m sure there will be sacrifices to get somewhere I want to be… Any wisdom or experiences that could help me would be much appreciated!",goometr,1,1.0,1,1730476717,2024-11-01 15:58:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gh8ruz/engineering_to_what/,11,2024
1gh8m54,Addressing dissatisfaction in a 1-1?,"Hi! Looking for advice on how to have rough conversations at work. 

I have never been good at corporate meetings, nor 1-1s. But next week I may have a 1-1 with the boss of my boss, and I would want to address some points with him. However I don't want to come too blunt and ruin my chances to improve my career at this company. 

I tried to raise with my boss how I'm doing a good job and I'm not just there warming a seat.  However he's not listening or even trying to acknowledge I'm the one with most projects at the team (including important ones). 

Next week, his boss is going to be at our office, and he may have a 1-1 with me. So, I'd like to address this, how I'm the one who's been assigned most of the projects, delivering always good results (I have project tracking notes, and dashboards to support my case), but never recognized and even belittled, all of these in corporate lingo (but it turns out that I suck in corporate lingo haha —never know which words I should use).

Could someone help me? Please.

1gh87ka,Income Stalled for 5 years at a less than desireable level - How to leverage my high level experience without being business saavy?,"Hey everyone! I have an important question as I have found my income has stalled for the last 5 years much lower than I would like. Basically, I would like to know if there is any way to leverage my experience which is pretty vast to improve my income after moving to a smaller city.

My background - I have a degree in Kinesiology and Massage Therapy. I have trained all over the world with some of the top researchers and clinicians in their fields. I have instructed some of the top courses, worked with professional athletes, billionaires, and celebrities on a  daily basis... the issue is I moved away from the big city where all that can happen during covid, back to my hometown, right when i was getting offers to triple or quadruple my salary from clients. This was due to a multitude of factors including my own dissatisfaction with the big city life, stress, and my wife attending school.

Now I'm at an impass. I've been trying to grow my own business while working a 9-5 and I simply don't have the energy to do both effectively, considering my 9-5 also involves a lot of tasks related to growing a business (tech).

I have started a youtube channel, and am trying to figure out how to monetize a back pain course. Opening my own clinic is financially impossible while I support my wife who has been searching unsuccessfully for jobs for a couple years (getting part time seasonal positions only), as I cannot afford an unpredictable income at the moment.

Is there anyone that could offer some advice or mentorship on what to do? I am quite stuck and don't have anyone who is a business person that I can turn to for advice.

1gh82mj,Should I switch to tech or stay in engineering?,"Currently on the job hunt and have been out of work since April (job market is hell right now). In January 2023 I decided to leave my mechanical engineering job to try to start a career in data analysis, with the goal of eventually working my way up to either data engineering or software engineering/development. I got a job at an electric company doing somewhat data-related stuff but was only using MS Access databases. Then a recruiter reached out to me about a data modeler contract role, which I took. However they didn't keep me on when that contract ended and I've been looking for another job since then.

I liked being an engineer but I wanted to switch fields because I wanted to be fully remote (hard to do in most engineering jobs, especially since I was mostly in manufacturing environments) and I wanted to get to a higher earning potential. Mechanical engineering doesn't pay as well as other engineering fields, and I thought getting into tech would get me there. I have a computer science minor and a love of programming and data, so I like the nature of the work and am not worried about hating a job in tech or engineering. I also have a looooot of student loans, and rent gets worse every year, so earning potential is very important to me.

It's been awful trying to get a data analyst job right now. The fully remote jobs are crazy competitive and if I manage to get an interview, my feedback is always that they like me and how I present myself but I don't have the work experience they're looking for. Since I've been out of work so long I've been applying to engineering jobs too, and I'm wondering if I should stick with that or keep trying to get into data analysis. 

I'm worried that data analysis/data engineering/software engineering might be getting too saturated and impossible for someone with my limited work experience to break into (no matter how many portfolio projects I have), and I also worry that AI will change the nature of those jobs moving forward, making them even more competitive and possibly decreasing their earning potential. I wouldn't want to take a data analyst job, find myself out of work again in a few years, and unable to fall back on my engineering degree after not using it for so long. And since so many companies are forcing people back into the office these days, I'm not sure how realistic it is to be fully remote for the rest of my career. 

Does anyone have any insight into these markets, and any advice on what might be a good path going forward? ",arodfishing,1,1.0,3,1730474915,2024-11-01 15:28:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1gh82mj/should_i_switch_to_tech_or_stay_in_engineering/,11,2024

I've seen coworkers take food out of the trash and attempt to give it to our clients, not follow dietary guidelines, not do a lot of things we are obligated to do (general house chores and cleaning, doing laundry and even cleaning up fecal matter) A lot of my coworkers don't do their job. A lot of it gets dumped on one of my coworkers (the only one who does things up to standards) and everything he has spoken out he has gotten in trouble with the management. We have been told not to report things or ""cause issues"" because it's a hassle getting the state involved.
I've seen a supervisor and another coworker administer insulin to a client (we are not allowed to do that) when I was poked by a clients insulin needle i was not let off to go to the ER for over 2 hours. I was told that nobody would be told about what happened as that would violate HIPPA, but when I came in the next day one of my coworkers jokes about it and asked how it happened.

I'm a high schooler, but I'm trying to see what I should pursue in college. I really like business and things related to that (especially entrepreneurship), but my main end goal is money. In all honesty, I just want to make a lot of money so I don't have to worry about it (among other things). So I had a question: how much money would I make as an entrepreneur/business major, and should I just switch to another degree? As one would do, I researched about the topic but couldn't get a straight answer. Some sources say business and entrepreneurship are great paths and could lead to major money (CEOs and business owners), but others say it is a terrible idea, since most entrepreneurs struggle financially and almost never make more than 50k annually. I understand there is no such thing as get-rich-quick, but I find that 50k to be a little underwhelming.

I thought about a degree in medicine, since my brother is a doctor, and realized how much money they make. However, I don't think being a doctor is for me because to be honest, I'm not very kind. Not that I am mean, just that I don't really care about people that aren't related to me. I also heard it was very time consuming, although I'm not very concerned with this part as I study and work all day anyway, so I guess I could just dedicate that time into medicine.

I also thought about something tech related as I also really like tech, but most jobs in tech seem to include coding and scripting, which I'm not very good at haha.

In conclusion, I'm unsure whether I should pursue something related to business or pursue something else, as I want to make a lot of money (as everyone does).  
Another thing to note is that my father has many businesses, which I could run if I pursue business.

During 2 year's time i I’m looking into certifications and volunteer work to gain clinical experience, but I’m unsure how to enter the field with my background. Any suggestions on certifications in Quebec that could help me get clinical hours or relevant experience?

I’d appreciate any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share! I’m very motivated but also feeling overwhelmed trying to navigate this process, especially with a family and financial responsibilities.

I was not told about any kind of recording of any sort that they needed before. I did everything, they pushed my certificate thing for like 5 days so that I stay available for doubts. I stayed then I asked when the task was done. Now they want me to get back to work, and make a screen recording video of the KT and all. This is a new thing they told me about like 10 days.

1gh1vbx,Holding a Job Offer due to a Promised Promotion,"Hi all. I'm 33M and I am currently working as a technical trainer in a shipping firm for 7 years. Last month, managers and consultants were telling me that I will be leading our team soon which I ignored since I don't believe anything until they are put into writing. I also have a history of failed promises from the management that is why I don't expect anything for what they have to say.

Pay is sufficient, working environment is so so but involvement and the feeling of being valued as an employee (for me personally) is terrible - which is the main reason I always look for other jobs.

I recently got a job offer with a slightly higher salary. Work set up is hybrid and work time is flexible. The main office location is also just 3 km away compared to my current office which is 20 km. The job offer that I recently received is already revised since I negotiated a higher salary. Upon receiving it, I immediately talked to my manager about my intent to resign.

The manager ask what the issue was and I told him that it's about the workload and salary (but I have a lot of other reasons including the sense of being not valued). He then mentioned that I am due for promotion in the next two weeks which entails a 24% increase in my salary. I just need to wait for the final decision and announcement from the owner of the firm. I like to believe that the statement isn't a counter offer since the 'rumors' of me being appointed was already circulating last month and my application that landed me the new offer is just 3 weeks old.

Again, I don't believe anything until it is written or documented so I have to wait until the 2 weeks. My decision is to wait for the promotion and if it is official, I will not accept the offer. If the promotion will not push through, then I will accept the offer. 

The problem is I need to respond to the new job offer since it is due on the next business day. I have researched email templates on how to hold the offer but I am having issues if I need to share my lengthy story or not. What information or what sentiments are relevant to share so that I can justify holding my decision for 2 weeks? And if the new employer urgently needs a reply, will I go for it or not? Worse case for me is missing the offer and not getting the promotion.

PS. Sorry for the long post, I needed to vent out since I've been overthinking about it a lot and I don't want to regret my decision, I don't want to miss my opportunities since I've been very unlucky in investments, careers and finances.

1gh0sp4,"I need help! Advice, insight anything!","Okayy so this is going to be kind of a brain dump but here we go....  
  
I'm currently a first-year student in psychology, and while I love studying it and have great scores,  I just don't see myself as a counsellor/ psychologist. I know there are other jobs you can have in psychology such as research (which doesn't pay very well) or something in HR but I just feel like I am not satisfied with this.  
  
A teacher did mention to me that I would do great in law, as I love ethical and philosophical discussions. But I still don't know how much I would like law as a career. I feel like studying it and actually doing it as a job are verrryyy different things.

Another subject I've been interested in is economics, I did it as a major in year 11/12 and heavily love love loved the subject. The only reason I didn't go for it is cause I'm kind of scared about the maths (I'm pretty average at maths). Also again idk how much I would like it as a career.  
  
The idea of a 9-5, 7 days a week also intimidates me. While I do like structure and guidelines I feel like I wouldn't be happy?? Another issue with me is I LOVE STUDYING!! I want to do everything but I can't. That's why it's so important to me to choose a career I'm happy with.   
  
Random insight as well - I love the creative side of things/ideas,  detective/ forensic work sounds super interesting, I love reading and writing, my personality is INFP/ ENFP (ambivert) (not that it matters but might bring insight). I would also totally love to go into astronomy and astrophysics but physics and I are kind of enemies :(.  
  
Another huge thing for me is travel!! I would love to travel and be financially stable (I mean who wouldn't). Maybe finding a job that aligns w my interests and needs is unrealistic... 

but any advice/ insight on careers in general would be wonderful. I know I seem so lost and need to set my foot down, but it is just so hard and the anxiety of missing out/ regretting decisions really eats at me. It is so hard deciding a career at just 17/18 and sticking with it my whole life. I know I have plenty of time and It's never too late... but my parents are urging to just stick to psychology and finish it (but what if I regret it and want to change after 3 years of study!!!).  
Once again any insight/ recommendations/ advice would be heavily appreciated!

  
p.s I have to make a decision before the end of this year.

I majored in Finance and Business Analytics and minored in Fintech. My goal is to work in a business strategy role for 2-3 years before pursuing an MBA.

During university, I was fortunate to complete three internships, primarily in Malaysia’s fintech sector, and participated in multiple case study competitions. However, the job market here isn’t very favorable for international students because of visa sponsorship issues. While I did receive an offer from one of my internship companies, it’s conditional on securing an employment pass—which has a roughly 50-50 chance of coming through.

Given this uncertainty, I’m also considering opportunities back home in India. Unfortunately, most Indian fresh grads get placed directly from their campuses, which doesn’t apply in my case. I’d love advice on the best approach if my offer in Malaysia falls through.

Right now, I’m actively applying for roles via LinkedIn, but the response rate hasn’t been great. Could I be doing something differently to improve my chances? Or would you recommend that I consider going straight into an MBA program?

As of now, I think I want to become a financial planner, though that might change.

I’m curious on how to best ensure I get a job relatively quickly after graduating. I know that there is no 100% guarantee but I would like to be prepared.

Can you do internships while also doing school? Even if you haven’t completed classes that help you much in that field yet? I don’t know how much of it works.

WGU is a go at your own pace college, and I plan (at best) to be finished in a year, but if I’m being lenient it’ll be 1.5-2 years before I get my degree.

I will probably try and get some certifications along the way also.

Augh I’m trying to figure out how to word my question so it makes sense.

I know all careers are different, but is there any order of events that I should do to further my knowledge in the field I am pursuing?

For example in case that doesn’t make sense, something like this.

Get my degree, get whatever certificates are absolutely required, then stack some optional ones certificates, internship, etc.

Again I know it will be slightly different for each career, but I love having goals and I don’t know where to start.

Thank you for your help. :)

1ggw4n7,Switching from aero?,"Hi I am a second year aerospace engineering student at a top UK uni. However i have come to the realisation I dont actually like engineering practically and dont really want to work as an engineer. (I cant change degrees here like the us ,I have tried changing to cs to no avail and it would mean i have to drop out).

However I still have the opportunity for post grad degrees which most likely would be in cs/ds ml

Honestly when looking for a career I have 2 priorities (in order of importance):

1. I still would like the job to be quantitative / technical and involve coding and or maths (so no IB)
2. Compensation / career growth

Some options are:

Software engineer (I know the market is horrible but I would have a aero beng + self taught + cs msc so hopefully I have a shot at some grad schemes)

Quant dev/analyst: Probably aligns the best with my career ambitions and also my interests however it is obviously very competitive and while an aero/cs background is good enough (I think) it isnt as good as math/cs/physics

Data Scientist/MLE/DE: Id probably view this as the easier version of being a quant. While i wouldn't mind a full on data science role id prefer one where I could use skills in development however, such as MLE/DE.

Data Analyst (I am unsure of this field): Honestly I have tried researching this one and Im still not quite sure what they acc do. I saw a role in AQR for portfolio implentation and it involved finance + data science which seemed intresting.

It seems most people get into HR by starting in admin or recruiting, which would be fine other than they don't seem to pay enough at my age unfortunately. 


The support roles I can do generally do pay enough (barely). 


So is getting to an HR role that pays enough (60K in a MCOL) from a support role a likely or viable path?

I currently work for an agency and have been with a client long term (<3 years). Client has vaguely whispered about how they’d like to bring me on but contracts forbid it (or it’s a steep buyout, details haven’t been made clear to me since it isn’t my contract per se). 

The company I’d be working for is also an agency but the client I’ll be interviewing with has strictly chosen this firm because they do allow conversions. 

I really like the client I currently work for and they’ve made some recent changes which will definitely create more work and maybe a greater financial runway to change things in my favor. But I’d be “waiting to see” and I’ve been feeling a little burnt out while they’ve barely kept us busy for several months now. This could all change quickly in any number of ways and while I’m one of the “original” contractors on this project, I’m also one of the last. 

I obviously don’t know that I would “love” the new client/company and while on contract, there is 0 PTO (presumably, days off are just unpaid). I’m also unlikely to get a raise so this change is just giving me a contract that I have a bit more control over, in that I gain the potential for conversion.

These discussions can be complex, potentially leading to misunderstandings or tensions. To foster a respectful, productive workplace, here are strategies for managing political conversations with grace and understanding.

**1. Set Personal Boundaries Early**

It's okay to set boundaries if political conversations make you uncomfortable. Let colleagues know you prefer to avoid these topics, establishing this preference early to redirect future conversations smoothly.

**2. Find Common Ground**

If a conversation starts to heat up, look for shared values or goals to bring unity. While finding common ground in passionate discussions can be challenging, it can help keep interactions positive and respectful.

1ggtmzh,I'm not projecting enough confidence,"Hi!

I travel to clients and work as a consultant. This last on site was me filling in for another team member and it was for a massive event. I was not prepared for it. 

I did my best, I felt I did well, but I didn't make the client feel confident in me. And my boss is telling me despite the problems being out of my control, I did not do well. It seems clear it's because my non-confidence in myself shined through so the client didn't feel like they were in good hands. 

I HATE that I didn't succeed. But the feedback I'm getting is correct and this is an opportunity to grow.

So going forward I see drastic changes I need to make immediately with my mental state so I can convey that I'm the guy for the job. I've had success, this isn't always how I am.

But for this meeting I'm having tomorrow with my boss... is it appropriate to open up about what I'm going through personally? Or is that a detriment? Basically my mom died 6 months ago, I was her caretaker, and my father and brother were awful during this period. I couldn't keep the family together, and ended up moving accross country and I just feel so lost with my whole family falling apart. This isn't an ongoing issue, I'm getting it together, but do I share any of this with my boss?

My instincts say no. He's nice, he's just all business (I respect that). I worry that explaining why my confidence is lacking will just make him lose confidence in me, or maybe it'll be seen as an excuse. The goal here is my growth, not excuses, so maybe I don't unload any of this. My hope would be that I can get a bit of grace while I pull it together.

Thoughts?

Failing at something SUCKS! I hate it...",The-Gorge,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1730422035,2024-11-01 00:47:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggtmzh/im_not_projecting_enough_confidence/,11,2024
1ggsvwi,Chill or Challenge,"I’m recently applying for a job and upon learning what the job will really do, I find it challenging and new. A totally different aspect of my field (design). The pay is also okay. 

But thinking about it, my current job is really chill. I’m on the lead position but because of the laying off of employees, I’m doing junior design work and filling in some shoes. 

Any thoughts on whether to pursue the new job or stay in my current chill company? ",ielocin_todoroki,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1730419716,2024-11-01 00:08:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ggsvwi/chill_or_challenge/,11,2024
