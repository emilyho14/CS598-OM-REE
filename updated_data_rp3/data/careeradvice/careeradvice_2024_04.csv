My responsibilities are beyond my job description, including handling certain emails that should be addressed by my supervisor. Additionally, my department's involvement in numerous events and interviews adds to the workload. I lack proper training and find it difficult to learn amidst these pressures. At this point, I'm questioning if the corporate world is the right fit for me and considering exploring alternative career paths, such as the trades or the service industry.  I'm grateful that financial obligations are manageable with my boyfriend's support.

1ch6b5b,Looking to make a total career change.  Where to start?!,"I've posted this elsewhere, but I'm looking to get as many thoughts on this as I can!  I (27F) have reached the point in my career where I've realized continuing on the current path is unsustainable for my overall career growth. I'm an estates and tax paralegal in a big west coast city where the job market for paralegals is abysmal. As steady as paralegal career is, especially in the world of death law where there's always business, I've lost my groove for the field. Pay and career progression opportunities are limited for paralegals and I'm nearing that point. Plus, I'm having health issues from the stress, which has happened in every legal environment I've worked. I'm the only (non-attorney) employee at my firm, so I do just about everything except advise clients and pay the bills.

I'm looking to change industries/fields all together and I'm not sure where to start with it. I have a metric ton of desirable, transferable skills, but my experience isn't industry-specific, product-specific, etc. Part of this is because I'm a non-tech professional living in a tech-heavy city.

Quite frankly, I'm not even sure what industry to look into or what job titles to search for, mostly because corporate job titles are funky. In any case, the corporate world is where I'm interested in heading, *hopefully* away from law and finance (this should come as a surprise to no one, but working in taxes sucks).

Another thing I'm concerned about is retaining what salary I have now, at minimum, while identifying jobs/careers that have growth opportunities once I hit the ground running in a new position. I understand that with any lateral shift, salary is going to be contentious and I'll have to cross that bridge when I arrive at it.

I'm prepared for this to be a long, brutal process that involves my seeking out a lot of help, so this is where I'm starting. Where do I start? Headhunters, blindly applying for positions that look interesting? How do I even identify what type of field would be interesting and simultaneously not kill me?

1ch5tmk,New job offer/school conflict.. advice?,"I'm not sure if this post is allowed here, but I'm hoping maybe one of you have navigated a similar situation and can give some advice..

I have 2 semesters left (summer and fall) before graduating with my BA. I’ve worked a full time job (not within this field) the majority of the time alongside going to school. I just got offered a new job that I’m really excited about and will look great on my CV when I apply for grad school. 



The problem is, I’m already registered for my summer and fall classes. I setup one of my lab/lecture classes for the summer semester because albeit longer days, I will only have 10 days in total (Mon/Weds) for the following 10 weeks (short summer semester) versus taking that particular class during the fall and having the longer semester. 



The schedule for the new job is M-F 8-5:00pm and the 10 week summer lab/lecture class is from 8-4:45pm two times per week. The job I was offered doesn’t know I’m currently a student because I didn’t want them to think I wouldn’t be able to manage school & work (I’ve been asked about this in prior interviews and didn’t end up landing the job although this may not be the primary reason, it was a worry for me, so I just didn’t mention it this time). The degree isn’t a requirement for the role, but again, it will look great on my CV. My question is, what would you all tell the employer about needing two entire days off per week, for the following 10 weeks, at the start of a new role? I’m worried that they won’t be willing to hire me anymore if I make that kind of request. What would you do? Do I just take the ""L"" and move on? Fwiw, my fall classes won’t interfere with the new work schedule.

I also have to attend these in person to prepare the venue and close down. 

This management position has taken over all of my time to the point that my coworkers have taken on a few of my admin responsibilities. 

I am considering asking for a temporary raise, but my coworkers think it won't happen because they also haven't received raises despite being given ""promotions"" (higher level jobs with more responsibility). This was a conflict that was brought to upper management right before I started, also because my coworkers think my boss is generally incapable of doing her job.

1ch4y99,What is my next step after a year of job seeking with PhD in chemistry?,"Hi everyone,

I've been trying to find a job after my PhD graduation February 2023 in the UK but still no industry offer. It is now almost May 2024. What should I plan for my career? Should I continue in job seeking or change to another field? My job seeking visa only have two years left. I am still living on my parents' support which is assured but also uncomfortable. I had to reject a university offer last year but now I am ok with all offers. 

I believe my CV is ok because I had 20+ interviews last year and received several feedback that said I was ranked No. 2 (probably I wasn't good enough compared to No. 1 and those companies and universities didn't want to hurt my feeling).

Recently, HRs started to concern my gap. I only had little progress in the past year such as German with basic fluency, interview experience (I question its quality because I have no offer), basic understanding of software like minitab.

Should I choose a field I am interested in and join a bootcamp for a rapid training? Are there anyone with similar experience and happy to share some thoughts?

Its a great company with great coworkers except for that one grumpy and frustrated coworker.

Eventually said coworker recieves a call explaining about how the issue lies at the external third party package/library which is being used.

This coworker also randomly grunts and bursts out laughing behind his desk out of nowhere. Often gets into heated discussions about other people including the leading managers and directors, but somehow is allowed to work at the company.

1ch3288,Management trying to force me into taking on additional tasks without compensation,"2 months ago the veterinary hospital I work for fired one of the managers. This was very unexpected. They fired her because she would report back to employees about any bs the other managers and owners would spew during private meetings. 

After they fired her they asked me to take on one of her roles- the inventory management. I asked if this would come with a pay raise or dedicated time to complete this task. I was told it fell within my current job description and that I wouldn’t be getting a raise. It is an extremely time consuming job and if the clinic does not have proper supplies people become frustrated. I would easily take the blame. The extra stress and work for no additional pay is not something I signed up for. The hospital manager also said we would discuss it more in the coming weeks. We never did. In that time, my direct supervisor, the head technician was expected to take on this role. She did not. Instead she kept “asking me for help” to complete it. She was very rude about it as well and shoved it on me like it was already my expectation. Got frustrated and snippy every time I would put it back on her desk at the end of the day.

Today I get a text message from the hospital manager with two of the supervisors, mine and the receptionist supervisor. She wants to go out, on my personal time unpaid, to discuss inventory over dinner. I assume the dinner would not be paid for either. I would prefer a meeting during working hours. I would also prefer they do not text me and only use slack to communicate about work items.

I am in need of advice. What should I do? Contact HR? But what will they even do about it? I would rather not have to find a new job but I will if they continue to pressure me into taking on additional responsibilities.

* Job description: [https://imgur.com/ktaFNex](https://imgur.com/ktaFNex)

**Additional Context and Personal Goals**

While the pay at the CDMO is significantly higher, it should be noted that is for a night shift and while I understand $21/hr in the Madison, WI area would have to involve running a tight budget, I am mostly concerned about which position is the best choice for my professional growth. The CRO has also expressed very firmly that the pay is non-negotiable despite my attempt to and even telling them that I have another offer paying $33.25/hr. They are also firm on their ""inability"" to offer relocation assistance.

I am a recent B.S. chemistry graduate (December 2023) and for the long term I am looking for an organic chemistry position with a synthetic chemistry focus. Med chem and process chem are my two first choices, with med chem coming first, I am not deadset on these two titles and would be happy working another organic chem position if it involves a focus on synthetic chemistry. I understanding taking an analytical/QC position now may not be in my best interest, but even getting an interview for synthetic chemistry positions with a bachelor's without extensive experience through undergraduate (which I do not have) has been exceptionally difficult. I was getting noticed for roles of analytical/QC nature, and decided that if I can land one in the pharma industry that will give me experience working in a federally regulated and GMP/GLP environments, I can suck it up despite not enjoying this type of work at all, since I think it will be good experience. My plan is to stay in a position like this for a year or two to get industry experience, and then apply for graduate programs. But even this has me worried as my academic background is not that strong and I'm not sure of the likelihood of my being accepted into a graduate program so I can get the synthetic chem experience I would need to be considered for a synthetic role. Since my long term goals are to be more on the R&D side of the industry, I am hesitant to take a QC position at a company and location with a heavy emphasis on manufacturing, but I am not sure if this would really matter in the grand scheme of things.

1ch2lrl,My boss is making a series of bad decisions and is too stubborn to listen. What do I do?,"I work for a company with around 100 employees. My manager is making a series of terrible decisions that’s costing the business a lot of money. Through her direction, the company acquired an expensive software, which is clunky and doesn’t really solve the problem we are trying to solve. She’s trying adopt another software tool that also will NOT solve the business problem we are trying to solve. These are enterprise softwares, so the licensing costs + resources required to migrate to these new systems are very expensive.

The thing is, there are many other superior tools available in the market. But she’s is an old head and she only wants to work with tools she’s familiar with, many of which are from like 20+ years ago. 

There are at least couple of us who spoke out and said we need a different tool, but she is way too stubborn to listen to any of us. Each time we bring it up , she just shut us down and doesn’t heed any of our concerns seriously. She is also gatekeeping so our opinions don’t make it to her boss.  

What do I do about it? Do I say nothing and just go with the her directives? Or do I speak up and let her boss know? I’d hate to go behind my manager’s back, but if we acquire this “new” tool, it will be us who have to suffer through it again, so I feel our opinions should at least be heard.

The second option is to suck it up and get a degree in Business Administration. I've the skills to do well here but I find this space extremely draining and vain. Additionally, I'm afraid I'll not excel because I'm not naturally inclined to it unlike others.

1ch1rfx,Looking for suggestions for jobs as a communications/theater major,"Hey y'all, my friend is struggling to find jobs and doesn't really know what to apply to at this point. She graduated college with a B.A. in Communications and Theater Studies. Likes being creative i.e. writing, reading, and critical thinking. She is looking for a full or part time job to get through the next few years, but isn't necessarily looking for a permanent career. With a college degree, it would be nice to find something that pays a livable wage. She has past experience in catering as a server, bartender, and manager. Has of course done waitressing as well. She worked in customer service for an insurance company for a while but hated it. Recently, she has been intermittently working as a director for middle school and high school musicals as a part-time contractor, but this income is not regular or dependable. She is tired of all the rude people in customer service jobs and doesn't want to do that again. She's currently applying for Social media and marketing type jobs.

1ch0u4b,need advice on making this decision ,"I've been with my family's company in California for six years now. My father, who owns the business, has provided me with housing and a car, which keeps my expenses low. However, this arrangement has also limited my earning potential, as he seems reluctant to let me advance and grow within the company. It feels like a control tactic, keeping me stagnant despite my desire to progress. Complicating matters is the fact that my work history isn't documented on paper, which is starting to impact my career prospects.

Recently, I've been offered a job in Florida, a state I've been eager to move to for quite some time. The salary is $11,600 more annually than what I currently earn. However, I'd have to account for rent since my father is unwilling to swap my California apartment for one in Florida due to his control tactic. Despite this challenge, I see the move as an opportunity to start fresh, meet new people, and establish valuable connections. Plus, the potential for growth is promising, especially with the opportunity to earn commissions.

While paying rent initially might seem like a setback, I believe the long-term benefits of taking this position far outweigh the immediate financial adjustments. It's a chance for me to break free from the constraints of my current situation and pursue both personal and professional growth in a new environment. Therefore, I'm inclined to take the position and embrace this opportunity for a brighter future.

1ch0ozr,"Constructive Dismissal, hostile work environment - Maryland","Hi there, 

I live in New Jersey, company is based in Maryland.

I have been in limbo at a small management consulting company for the past few weeks.   
I was hired in a dual role as a Senior Financial Analyst and Project Analyst. Before being hired full-time I worked 2.5 years for them as a contractor through a 3rd party company.

**Here's a quick timeline of events. (obviously working off memory and had to stick with highlights)**

* Nov 16 - Hired
* Jan '24 -  I was responsible for project budgets and resource planning of 7 projects. Company begins berating me for not being able to complete the work they assigned to me due to their poor management skills. Project managers have no knowledge of project budgets and CEO had no time to give me the information I needed to get the work done. 
* Late Jan '24 - given 2 warnings in the span of 4 days. Accusing me of not getting my work done. Put me on a unofficial ""pip"" (they didnt use this word) where I had to meet with my manager daily for 2 weeks. I completed that process successfully.
* February 5th - Owner calls me and says she can't afford me anymore, and has to convert me to part time. No written record of this was provided. The following weeks I get about 5-8 hours weekly of work. Which means I'm no longer making good money.
* March 10th - I submit my application for unemployment citing lack of work and get approved. 
* March 30th - A contractor refuses to renew his contract, has his final paycheck withheld for over 2 weeks.
* April 5th - A Project Manager is fired. 
* April 12th - Owner calls me up with an extremely hostile tone and accuses me of not doing my work. Nobody has warned me. My manager says i'm doing good work. The auditor she hired says i'm doing good work. Completely unwarranted. I ask ""why dont you part ways with me then?"" Owner says ""ok if you want that, write an email to HR and resign."" I respond ""why would I resign?"" She says ""YOU don't want to do the work, therefore you are verbally resigning."" Turns into an argument where she uses personal attacks - ""I wrote a rec letter for your university for you!"" ""I know your parents raised you better than this!""   

* April 15th - Owner removes me from meetings stating ""Thanks for the discussion on friday, thanks for letting me know."" I immediately forward this to HR declaring that I have no declined any work and that the discussion on friday was extremely hostile. HR said they would meet with me.
* April 16th - my access from email and Teams is removed. IT doesn't respond to my email. HR ignores this. 
* April 18th - 45 Meeting with HR, they record on zoom. I record on my phone. I tell them everything that happened on that friday ""discussion"" with the owner and then:

***I state the following to HR:*** 

Since being hired I have experienced the following:  
1. Abusive work environment with pervasive office politics and mistrust, an environment that sets you up to fail.  
2. Unreasonable work expectations and accusations of incomplete tasks and declined tasks.  
3. Inappropriate personal comments about the way my parents raised me and guilt-tripping over a recommendation letter.  
4. Physical and mental health issues exacerbated by excessive work hours, evidenced by an average of 4 hours of sleep per night in January as per my sleep tracker device. As well as exacerbated ADHD symptoms which have become even more prominent under the pressure I am experiencing.  
5. A shift from full-time to an undocumented prorated part-time status.  
6. Assignment of tasks beyond my qualification, notably in advanced accounting.  
7. Removal of my financial analytics duties due to unattainable expectations.  
8. Lack of trust in management and fear of retaliation.  
9. Pressure to resign if unable to meet the constant changing job requirements.  
10. Impact on my education, leading me to drop my graduate course for the semester.  
11. Consistent reframing of what I've said and making it out to be something it is not.  
12. Character assassination to delegitimize my work efforts.   
13. Access to the system shut off as of the 16th, which is when the new pay period started. No response from HR until yesterday, no response from IT.   
14. The above point also impacts my ability to request PTO which considering I just had it sorted out with HR and it was stated in writing that I would be able to begin utilize it this pay period, with everything else, is quite suspicious.  
15. OWNER admitted interest from Friday in protecting her unemployment insurance rates.  
16. No warning from my current manager, MANAGER. From her perspective, I have done nothing wrong and there was nothing to give me a warning about.  
17. AUDITOR who is managing the PROJECT NAME projects also had no criticism toward me in the context to my work there.   


Attorney friend said that I scared the shit out of their HR team but legally speaking they're only liable for discrimination and EEOC complaints, beyond that, I could potentially pursue a legal case but it would be a pain in the ass. But in regards to my case to keep my unemployment benefits from being disrupted, from her understanding, is likely very strong.

April 30th - HR offers to pay out 40 hours of my accrued PTO plus 35 hours of pay for a ""soft landing"" but asks me to sign a document stating i'm the one resigning. I show it to my attorney friend (although she specializes in a different state and isn't familiar with Maryland or NJ) and she says that if I sign this, I won't be entitled to unemployment. 

I refuse to sign, and declare that I am not resigning and have never stated an intent to resign and that they should send me the recording links, which i've asked for before and they never sent it. They ignore everything I say and just say ""ok we will fix the address on file and update our records.""

Am I fucked? Why are they trying to fight me so hard? I have witnesses, screenshots, proof in every ounce of everything I state even though they've conveniently locked me out of the system. Is this not constructive dismissal? Some people said that small business owners take benefits payouts personally and they can be vindictive when faced with situations like this.

Man, i'm exhausted dealing with this shit and just want to move on but if they want to fight this I swear to God I will go to the deepest lengths possible to fight this to the full extent of the law. It's destroying my mental health and i'm doing my best to prepare for technical interviews but it's so distracting to deal with.

1ch03rn,Is my logic sound?,"I'm currently unemployed.   I'll also starting over.  Was in a pretty exciting part of the military, got out, ended up in an area I don't like and discovered factory work.
I want a career again (not just a job) and I want to move.
Moving has to come first. It's the priority.

I've never relocated outside of the cocoon of the military before. I've never left and started from scratch before. 

I, very badly, want to leave my current area, before the holidays or ASAP.  Its a ""my clock is ticking""/I've held myself up enough sort of scenario.  

And since I'm not working, I have a clean slate to plan how I wish. Therefore, I see it making more sense to work part-time as opposed to full-time for the following reasons:
1. I see a full time job ad something that would tie me up. It implies a long term commitment.

2. Part-time would allow me the flexibility to travel to check out my new locale.  Whereas I'll have to wait for vacation time with a full-time job.

3. Part-time will allow me to travel to interview with my new employer. And/or make it more flexible for the hiring process.

Is my logic sound? Does my plan work in that regard?

1cgzg8s,Engineering Job Advice,"I am wondering if I should stick at the job I have currently or if I should start looking for new ones.

 I have a mechanical engineering degree. I currently work at a mechanical contractor doing HVAC controls. I have 2 years interning here and 4 years of full time work. This is my first job in engineering. My job has me doing many different aspects from design/CAD, to PLC programming, to project management on site with electricians. I make 75k base and around 10k bonus yearlyand a few thousand profit sharing along witha 3% 401k match (I live/work in the north east of the US). I have friends with the same degree and same level experience making 25 to 30k more base pay than me in the same area. 
   I would say i thoroughly enjoy my job about 25% of the time and really do not enjoy it 25% of the time and the rest is kind of in the middle. I kind fo feel like I want to get out of construction. I also feel that I only really need to put in alot of effort about 10 to 15%. Most of the time I am ""idling"" or ""cruising"". My boss has said ive exceed expectations every year on my performance reviews.
  My company is very nice, the atmosphere here is very friendly and helpful. They do lots of employee appreciation things like food trucks and cookouts and christmas parties. I have a overall pretty good boss. But I dont believe there is a lot of room to grow in salary here. I believe I am worth around 100k base. Work is definitely not my whole life. I have lots of hobbies, friends, a fiance and a home.

Looking for any advice.
   
TLDR: mechanical engineer 4 years experience, making alright pay from what I understand, want to make more, but dont know if its worth leaving my my current job that i somewhat like but has good work culture.

1cgyybp,"Old, lost and looking for advice!","I need some job advice. My situation is a bit complicated, but I will try to condense it down. I am older. Mid 40s. My career life has been very strange. I have a music degree along with a gen ed degree. I moved to Asia during the (2008) financial crisis to find work as an ESL teacher. Lived there for many years and eventually moved back to the midwest (USA). I currently work in the entertainment industry. I have had my job for over 10 years now. Some would call it a “Dream Job”. I think it is hell. I enjoy the work, but the pay is demoralizing and it’s starting to impact whether or not I will ever be able to retire. My job is extremely multi-faceted. My title is technician, but I wear many hats as I deal with a lot of the technical hurdles in the background of live/recording parts of the entertainment industry. I have experience with circuit repair (both SMD microscope reflow work and old circuitry from decades past.) I set up large studio/live sound infrastructure (patchbays, networks, cable running, computer systems etc.) I travel constantly to integrate this infrastructure (which I hate) . I am constantly on the phone with high-end clients troubleshooting their systems and infrastructure. I also travel to these locations to troubleshoot their infrastructure (which I hate) I have loads of experience running Windows, Mac and Linux systems and networks. I also dabble in coding a bit. I do all of this for essentially $25 an hour and I have to work less than 40 hours (Usually 30), so I don’t get benefits. I need a better job… I can’t even afford to get my son braces. A college fund for him is a pipe dream at this moment.  
The thing is, I have no idea how to get a better job or what I can do with my weird experience. I don’t want to work in the entertainment industry because everywhere is paying trash. I am stuck where I live geographically due my partner’s career which I am 100% okay with. I have never navigated getting work in these times. I don’t know which sites to use or which to avoid. What are best modern practices? Can I avoid the hellscape that is LinkedIn? I don’t even know what type of career, if any, I am qualified for due to my age and experience. To be completely honest, I have stayed in this job for so long because the idea of navigating the job market with my experience is terrifying.  
I don’t want to sell things or work in CS. Consulting is not something I do. I don’t really want to start my own thing like that. I need a steady paying job. I don’t have much of a “network” of people to lean on. I keep to myself mostly.

1cgy52h,My family is encouraging me to quit my job,"I am 25m, and my father just died 2 months ago. I have been unhappy at my job before this, but stuck it out for close to 2 years trying to improve and grow.

Needless to say his death was devastating, we were very close and understood each other well. He was my best friend and I loved him dearly.

I have not been performing well at work, I have not been motivated to do well as I was also denied a promotion a week or two before he died.

I have shut down emotionally and have become irritable as I try to keep up with a demanding position, as I am seeing the images of my father taking his last breath.

I was there in his final moments, and it did have an impact on me. He couldn't speak and with his eyes half open his life ended anticlimactically, with no fanfare, and that is what awaits us all.

For better or worse this life philosophy has compelled me now more than ever. I find myself wanting to prioritize different things than all of my friends and colleagues around me.

I have talked to my mom and brother about this and they can see how unhappy I am, and they want me to quit. My brother has said that he leaves the decision to me, but my mother really wants me to quit to the point where she would even scream about it.

Her and I are living in this house alone, and she says that she can't stand to see me so unhappy. She says that she wants me to take 3-5 months to decompress and reassess.

I personally would like to do it, but there is some hesitancy. I have decent money saved up as a frugal person, and we would have no problem supporting ourselves for a year or even more.

The conflict comes in with the fear that I won't be able to find another job when the time comes, and if I do that it'll be worse. Society's expectations and comparison with peers also plays a part.

Everyone's situation is different so I just wanted to ask what your thoughts are on this?",Mondongo48,1,1.0,2,1714497211,2024-04-30 17:13:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cgy52h/my_family_is_encouraging_me_to_quit_my_job/,4,2024

I don't know how to approach this meeting at all. I have been very, very sick of the turnover so I'm having a really hard time going into this new era with a positive attitude to the point where I can't even think of how to fake one.

So, my question is how can I approach this meeting in a way that lets me air my frustrations without 1. Making my boss look bad (love working for them and not a single one of my frustrations are their fault) and 2. Coming across as jaded/negative. Is this even possible?

1cgxi5n,Where do I go from here?,"Hello everyone. I am 23M and a subcontractor rig welder in Alberta. I run my own welding truck doing maintenance work for a large oil company, my hourly rate is $121/hr which translates to about $300k a year, more or less depending on how much I work. I have a girlfriend 22F and a daughter 1F who I support fully, my gf is in school to be an accountant. 

I made some good choices in my early adulthood and it got me to a good spot now where I have financial security but there are a few things I dislike about my situation. Namely:

- I work at a remote site so I basically live there ~26 days a month, the camp sucks and the food sucks even worse
- My work is project based, so they call me up for a job whenever and I go home when it’s done. Jobs run anywhere from 8 days to over 30. It sucks to not have a schedule and never know when I’m home
- The work is physical, sometimes very hard and taxing, and 12hr days give me very little time for anything else. 

I think ahead so recently I’ve been considering what to do as my next step. Here are some options I’ve considered:

- Construction management / project management, this is a logical next step for someone in the trades however every job wants management experience which is basically impossible to get as a welder. They want me out there welding, not managing, so I can’t get the experience and I don’t know how to get my foot into that door without taking an extreme pay cut to be a low level foreman somewhere else. A benefit to this is that construction management is a certificate and not a degree and it’s more likely I’d be able to obtain it while continuing to work, and the pay is fairly similar to what I make now. 
- Business, skipping the whole middle management level and trying to get into a company in upper management leveraging my real-world experience to make me successful. The issue with this route is that I’d need a bachelors degree, requiring me to either sell my soul or take 4-6 years off work to go to university, and I would still have to take a significant pay cut as I obviously can’t jump right into C suite lol
- Tech, I love computers and always have, but again id have to get a degree (tried to teach myself programming, didn’t go well) plus it would basically throw away everything I’ve worked for up to this point as tech and industrial have zero overlap. I’d like to do something where I can point to my work experience to give me a leg up over a new graduate. 

Wondering if anyone has any input or if there’s anything I haven’t considered. Thanks for any advice.",angry_iranian1989,1,1.0,1,1714495503,2024-04-30 16:45:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cgxi5n/where_do_i_go_from_here/,4,2024

1cgxaa8,Advice for pivoting away from the IT field and into business?,"I currently have an Associate's degree in Business Administration and I am about to graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity in about a week

I realized halfway through getting my degree that I didn't enjoy Cybersecurity, wasn't very good at it, and couldn't see myself having a career in it. Plus, the field is currently extremely oversaturated and difficult to get into. I have connections that could help me get a job in the field but I still don't want to do it. 

But since I was already so far into my degree it would have been a waste of money to quit. I  want to go into a business related field like HR, finance, or accounting. I'm considering going to grad school and getting an MBA just to have a higher level business related degree on my resume for a better chance at getting a job in that field. 

My short term goal post graduation is to get a job that makes at least $20 an hour. Any corporate job in any field. Should I go to grad school and get an MBA for a chance at working in a business related field in the future? Can I pivot to a business related field with my Cybersecurity degree?

Hi all. I’m a 27 year old dad and husband. A touring musician, audio engineer and really a Jack of all trades. I have my bachelors of applied technology in Audio Production (audio engineering) with a double minor in contemporary music business and contemporary music performance. 

I’m at my wits end with working for a brick and mortar company. I can’t get the things done I need to at home, because I’m exhausted from spending 40 at the office. The time I get with my family isn’t as quality as it could be for the same reason. My freelance work as an audio engineer is slowing way down because I lack time and mental capacity to complete the work. 

I have been working for the same company for nearly 3 years now. They are honestly great. Our ideals don’t exactly align, but they compensate me well for what I do, they treat me with respect, and they allow me the time off I need to tour with my band. 

Every time I try to look for WFH jobs, they pay is incredibly lackluster, or the assignment is very short term. 

I am just looking for advice. Where should I be looking for WFH jobs that might cater to my degree/skillsets, or that pay decent enough to pay the bills and support a child.

I’m a computer science student and I interviewed with a company for an almost hybrid tech/operations role as I want to get into IT/software/etc. They filled the role internally and have extended an offer for an operations supervisor position. 
My largest dilemma is the commute, which I was willing to make to get into tech, expecting I’ll move closer later on.

1cgum2j,Teen Choosing A Potential Career ,"Hi,

I’m a 16-year-old who feels lost on deciding on a career. To give some background, ever since I was in kindergarten, I wanted to be surgeon (either a neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon). Fast forward to about 12, I changed my mind and settled on being a lawyer. Not long after, I decided that pursuing an engineering degree would be a better option for me since I have an interest in aerospace. As of now, however, I’m having some doubts on this plan. After talking to my father, he suggested that I pursue dentistry since my aunt is an oral surgeon who runs her own practice. He told me that she would be more than happy to provide me with the opportunity to shadow her. In addition, he said she would likely provide me with the opportunity to work for her once I finish dental school. This honestly sounds a bit too good to be true considering the fact that I don’t live with him, and I’ve met him only a handful of times in my life. When the question of debt came up (which, for dental school in particular, I’m aware it can be upwards of $600k), he said that it won’t be an issue since her practice is in an underserved community (debt is forgiven apparently). At this point, I’m not sure what to do. Dentistry does seem like a promising career choice that can directly impact people’s lives, while engineering seems to be more “interesting” and “cutting edge”. I know money isn’t everything and isn’t my primary motivator by any means, but, from what I’ve researched, dentists seem to make significantly more than engineers. Any advice on this would be appreciated.

My dad wants a monthly share when he retires, other than that half of this company would be mine. Wİth all the responsibilities of course.

1cgt6ds,The Paradox of Plenty: Unpacking Layoffs in the Video Game Industry,"Hey, Reddit community! Amidst the glittering success of blockbuster games and breakthrough tech, there lies a less glamorous side to the video game industry: the distressing trend of widespread layoffs. In 2023, over 10,500 game developers faced layoffs, and the forecasts for 2024 are looking even grimmer. Despite soaring profits, why are so many talented creators losing their jobs?  
  
The Hidden Toll on Workers  
Young and marginalized workers in the video game industry are facing the brunt of these layoffs. The high turnover, fueled by intense project cycles that end in layoffs, offers little job security and undermines long-term career growth. It’s a cycle that’s not only tough on individuals but also stifles the broader innovation within the industry.  
  
Systemic Issues at the Forefront  
The explosion in tech and creativity has outstripped the pace of developing sustainable employment models. Educational institutions continue to churn out qualified graduates into an already saturated market, raising questions about the role of academia in preparing students for the actual job market dynamics they will face.  
  
The Role of Unions and Corporate Accountability  
Unions are stepping up, pushing for fair labor practices and trying to negotiate better terms for workers. However, their efforts often clash with corporate goals that prioritize short-term profits over employee welfare, particularly in scenarios involving mergers or acquisitions.  
  
Causes and Calls for Change  
The notorious 'crunch culture' of extensive overtime to meet deadlines is a persistent issue, leading to burnout and high turnover. The industry needs a systemic overhaul to focus on sustainable growth and employee retention, enhance corporate accountability, and align educational programs with industry realities.

1cgszu5,I hate telling people what I do,"I work as a freelance marketer and pr manager and I do pretty much every single thing surrounding the job. I think it's pretty natural to do so. However people tend to not get what I do and it's making me furious. Especially in times, when I meet with customers who don't have a clue what they're talking about, eventhough they're in a high marketing position within the company.   
  
For example, people tend to think, that I'm a photographer, since I take them myself and I've won several awards for them as well. However people tend to put me more and more into the category of a photographer, rather than a marketing professional. Absurd as it is, I have no idea how to send that message out there other than to work on as many projects as possible and let word of mouth do its thing.

\- great project flow, would almost certainly be staffed right away

\- I hear it's difficult to get staffed as project flow isn't great  
  
\- Brand recognition for exit opportunities

1cgqnum,Should I tell the external recruiter that I’m in contact with the company?,"Should I tell the agency that I am in contact with the company?

HI,

About 2 weeks ago I had an interview with a small recruiting agency specializing in a fairly niche sector in which I already work in Italy. German agency that told me about a position in Switzerland that I am very very interested in (no IT).
Now, through acquaintances, I have contacted and met several people from the companies I could work for (if I were hired, one would be my boss).

The guy at the agency tries to offer me other companies in Germany that I'm not very interested in.

Should I tell him that I'm in contact with managers of the Swiss company I'm interested in? Or wouldn't it change anything?

I thought, if I tell him that I am in contact with these managers, he will definitely propose me to them to take the commission (that's how it works, right?). If he doesn't propose me, because he has better candidates, he risks them hiring me without going through the agency.

I'm not an expert on how agencies work (never had anything to do with them).

1cgql96,What are some careers where “work stays at work” (eg. I don’t have to do anything work-related after hours)?,"Hi all, I currently work as a teacher making about $68.5k/year. I’m beginning to see what else I may want to do, but a big thing for me is that there is nowhere near enough time in the workday to do all the things we’re meant to do and therefore a lot of things like prep work, grading, etc have to be done after hours. While I do have defined contract hours, if we take “work hours” to mean “hours spent doing work-related activities,” then there really is no telling how long my work hours may be.

Therefore, while seeking a new career, one of my main points of interest is to find a career that only requires work to be done during stated contract hours (or perhaps even makes it impossible to work outside of contract hours). I’d also like to make about the same money or better, though I’m more flexible on that point.

I’ve only had the one career, so I’m not very knowledgable about the states of other careers outside of it. All I know is, I need to leave the classroom sometime within the next few years as I can’t take the constant stress and exhaustion. 

(Oh, and if the career is away from children/childcare, that would be great. I consider myself a caring person and bond well with my students, but I can’t take behavior bs, drama, etc anymore. However, *if that’s all that would be available to me, then I’ll still consider it.* Needing to get paid beats out my desire to not work with kids anymore, after all.)",OctoSevenTwo,196,0.9599999785423279,448,1714476811,2024-04-30 11:33:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cgql96/what_are_some_careers_where_work_stays_at_work_eg/,4,2024

1cgnxwb, How to deal with bullying co-worker? ,"For anonymity's sake, I'll keep details fuzzy.

I've been working at the current job for a few years now. The project I am working on is medium age (not really legacy, but definitively not new). It's pretty complicated and had a total of \~100 people working at it over the years, with high fluctuation. Currently, there's roughly a handful of people working on the project, with the team getting continuously smaller. The company isn't doing great, so people who leave are usually not replaced. Onboarding time is \~1 year, due to the complexity, so gettin The team is split up over multiple locations over the whole continent.

The collegue that I have to work with most has been on the team a few years longer than me. He isn't part of the original team either, but he's been there for the longest time and knows the most.

Sadly, that guy isn't easy to work with. He keeps bullying everyone around them, doesn't accept any other opinions than his own. If someone has a different opinion, he filibusters until everyone else gives up. If he doesn't like someone, he blocks reviews of the contributions of these people, has them rewrite everything multiple times and thus makes these peoples' numbers go down a lot because their tasks can't be finished. He then escalates that to the manager (without talking to the collegue in question at all) to make them look bad.

He managed to get a few really good people to give up and leave the project so far.

About 1.5 years ago, it got so bad that our boss gave him one last chance (the boss told me, but not him, that it was his last chance). They called all the team members to one location for a multi-day mediation session with a professional mediator. After that, things got better for a bit, but that was only temporary. The team kept shrinking and now I am the only direct coworker left with that guy and things got worse again (We have more a few more team members but they do different work.)

Last year I got into burnout, largely due to that coworker.

My bosses boss and after that my direct boss resigned and now we got handed over to a different boss who works in the same office as that collegue in question.

Over the last two weeks I had a change in medication (due to the burnout) and it was hard for me to concentrate on my work. That team member in question took this chance to review block me again for two weeks and directly escalated that to the new boss, probably trying to get me fired.

Luckily, my old boss is still on their notice period and alerted me to what's happening.

While most people who had issues with him already left the company, there is one rather high-up person left who had serious issues with him too, and I also am friends with one ex-coworker who left the company because of that guy.

TLDR:

I am getting blocked and bullied by the most-project-senior member of the team. He's done the same with others and got them to leave the company. Company doesn't want to let him go due to staff shortage and his product knowledge. Now he tries to get me in trouble with the new boss.

1cglk8e,Am I making the wrong decision?,"
Hi. Im (20M) an international student in not a reputable university in Canada. Im doing bachelor’s in Data Analytics and just completed second semester. Im working in security from last 8 months. I took 5 courses in first semester and failed CS course ( I didn’t gave it the time it required) and again took it in second semester and scored 90%( i had understanding of every topic from first semester). Took Only three courses in 3 courses in second semester and failed Calculus II due to academic dishonesty ( i think i would even failed the course if it was not for academic dishonesty). I was working full time in the second semester. 

I got accepted for a two years diploma in Computer Networking Technology & Accounting and technology at a local college. 

My yearly fee at university is around 20k CAD and in the college it’s around 25k CAD for two years. 

I haven’t found my interest in coding, stats and math yet(even though they were just introductory courses). I have invested one year of my life and paid the tuition fee of one year( which will be of no use if a transfer to college because they say the courses aren’t exactly relevant and they won’t transfer the credits). I can’t imagine myself siting in front of a computer and do SQL, python and excel for every day for the rest of my life. 

And computer network and technology is more about hardware related stuff. I had good relation with computers since i was a kid and i think i can grow in it. 

After completing my studies and getting the work permit, i will get PR status and then i want to join RCMP. I deal with Cops almost on daily basis( because of the place where i work) and i like that job. I can see myself as a police officer and im sure i would love that job. 

I come from a middle class family and my parents sold a property to fund my studies in Canada and I don’t want them to sell another one for me. If i do data analytics i have pay about 60k CAD and for diploma 25k CAD. Also i have to take courses in at least two summers to complete my bachelor’s in four years. 

I can complete the bachelor’s if i have to but I won’t score good marks and I won’t be good at it which will make it impossible to score a good paying job. So why should i invest that much money in it?

On the other hand i can pay the fee for diploma by myself and i can join the Police. 

I have talked with student advisors and career advisors at both university and college. The career advisor at university was saying do whatever you like the most and the student advisor at the college was saying doing a diploma would be beneficial for me( i think her opinion was biased). 

Some people say if i don’t like data analytics, it will still give me bachelors degree which can be useful if i don’t get into police. 
What should i do?
Should i complete my bachelor’s with a minor in psychology and then join the police or should i switch to the diploma and join the police. Even if i don’t get into police after completing the diploma and see no career opportunities with diploma, i can still go back to school after getting PR and pay less( i will probably graduate at the age of 27).
Personally i think diploma would be best for me because i don’t find myself great at studies and its less money and it will give me PR quicker.

1cgk1wv,Advice on how to proactively avoid burnout as i start a new job?,"I just started a new job I landed after getting laid off several months back. The layoff/unemployment era was rough. On one hand, I feel eager to “prove” myself and get a sense of job security in my role. On the other hand, I learned the hard way that being a top performer doesn’t necessarily mean you’re safe. I’m honestly still recovering from the exhaustion of the old job hunt, and now know that no matter how much I give to a company, and no longer as trusting. 

My new role is trying to get me started on real work ASAP, and has a backlog of assignments they want me to jump in on, but I’m still trying to navigate everything in my new role. I know that now is the best time to set the tone for how I work, and what my boundaries are, so wondering if y’all have any advice for how to set yourself up well in a new job to create a balance?

1cgji1d,"Got fired because of ""reliability issues"" what do I do?","To give some background, I'm a music instructor. I'm young (a little above 18) while my coworkers are much older than me and I teach guitar, bass, keys, and drums.

This morning I woke up to a bunch of notifications saying I was removed from all the lessons I was supposed to have. I got worried and hoped that maybe it was an accident? I got no reason for it or warning so I sent my boss a message saying if it was an error and if I'm still coming in today. He responded hours later saying he'd give me a call.

Call basically confirmed it, I was afraid to go further and ask why because I don't really want to argue and I don't know if it's right to do that as an ex-employee. All I said in the end if I could know at least a reason and he said the main reason was the reliability aspect, he can't have someone who doesn't have that for the business.

I've only missed when I was sick or when I had a family emergency. I told him in the beginning too that I have chronic migraines and that sometimes they're too much that I have to stay home. I've still gone to work with them at times.

I missed a week because I got Covid, I missed a week because a family member died and I had to help take care of all that. And I rarely missed a day when I had a really bad migraine.

The thing that pisses me off though is that my coworkers have missed too, and their excuses were vacation or they had a show to play at. My coworkers are all older than me, I don't know if that was a reason he acted this way toward me. He would always put down my achievements but praise the others. He asked for advice and critique to make the school better, I gave my two cents and he shot it down but then still did it.

It makes me even more frustrated knowing that he misses more than I do. He would call me last minute to cover the front desk because he needed to head out real quick. He'd be gone an entire week to go to vacation or go to his kid's competition. He was gone at least once every week. I would usually be empathetic towards this because I have a little sibling and I know important it is to pick them up or go to their events but, if he's going to question me and get mad when I miss because I'm sick then my mind changes.

I don't know what to do right now, I still have things to pay every month. I have dogs who's insurance, food, and medication I pay for. I wanted a job because I wanted to help with payments so my parents didn't have to stress too much, but now I can't do that. I don't know where to go from here, all the other places I could apply at are full. I found out in my state it's legal for employers to fire you without warning so I don't think I can do much there but, any advice helps.

TLDR: Boss fired me because I would ""miss too much"", the days I missed were because I was sick or had a family emergency. He misses more than me and I've covered for him at times too. I still have stuff to pay for every month, what do I do?

1cgio9r,Career change from dream job? Help,"Hi! Seeking some advice/thoughts. I'm currently employed at what I thought was my dream job (international board certified lactation consultant in private practice.. took me over 3 years post bachelors and lots of sacrifices to make this happen). For the most part, I love my job, but my company has made some changes and I feel that I have gotten the short end of the stick on some things, as well as experiencing burnout and compassion fatigue. I'm not an RN, so hospitals are essentially out of the question, thus my job prospects in my current position are limited. I'm recently married and moved approx 1 hr away from my job so that my husband can be more available for his business (he put his career on hold for me to pursue this with the ultimate goal being me able to stay home or work minimally). Naturally, quite a bit of guilt surrounds this because I feel bad that I asked him to make sacrifices for a job that I'm looking to take a break from. I have the option to explore starting my own practice in our new city, but that involves quite a bit of effort and ground work, that frankly I don't think I have in me right now. I've been pursuing ideas on other options for jobs with less emotional investment and more work life balance. I'm looking for mostly remote or hybrid, as my current commute has contributed quite a bit to my frustration. But, I'm stuck on what to apply for. I've also not had much experience with applying for ""big girl jobs"" as I pretty much worked in restaurants until my current role. 

In my current job, I manage families care over weeks or months at a time to help them achieve their goals. At any given time, I'm managing care for 40+ clients, who I meet with in person or virtually, and communicate via messaging or phone call regularly. There's a lot more than that that goes into it, but in a nutshell, that is the gist. 

I would like to find something that has room for growth/advancement, but not a big time or financial investment to get into (certifications, etc). I will likely end up pursing my own private practice in the future, unless I find another job and choose to stick with it. I just need something different right now. Suggestions on what that something different should be based on everything I mentioned?

1cginje,"Three Interviews, Three Job Roles, One Company","
Hi everyone! I've been a lurker on this subreddit for career advice for a while and have always found the responses very enlightening. I've been on the job market (engineer w abt 4-5 years work experience) for a few months now for a new position and have been very grateful for a number of interview opportunities I've had at different companies. However, I've found myself in a conundrum and thought it'd be worth a shot to ask the sub for some advice.

I've been applied to three positions in different departments at the same company - it's a fairly large corporation - and as it turns out, I was called back for an interview for each one of them. Again, since it's a company I'd be excited to join, I feel very lucky. However, I got an offer back today for one of the jobs, and unfortunately it's less than ideal (less pay than my current job, and in a higher COL area). I'm still waiting on a update on another job from the same company (my top choice in the mix) and I'm scheduled to interview with the last job later this week. I'm also supposed to decide on whether or not I'll accept the first job by the end of the week. 

I know I can leverage this salary offer if things turn out well with the other jobs, however I want to maintain a good relationship with the company and not step on any toes. What do you think is the best way to handle this? What would you do in this situation?

1cgi1q5,"From being fired from a prestigious management consulting firm to starting, scaling, and exiting a multi-seven-figure business within 20 months—sharing my story","My name is Crystal, and I had a typical resume like many people in management consulting until four years ago (INSEAD MBA graduate, working at Oliver Wyman). After working my butt off, pulling 80–100-hour weeks, and traveling non-stop for half a year, I got fired and found myself in a psychologist's office due to severe burnout. I decided to start an e-commerce business instead of looking for a job. For a few months, I was directionless with massive anxiety, waking up and lying in bed without knowing what to do next. Initially, I wanted to work with my co-founder (another consultant from McKinsey) only to realize that he was not as committed as I was. Eventually, I decided to take a leap of faith, started an eCom brand from scratch by myself, completely bootstrapped. One year later, it became a seven-figure business, and I exited it within 20 months. I then started another eCom brand, and it has been generating five-figure revenue from Day 1.

Fast forward to 2024, I realized that the biggest lesson I learned from my entrepreneurial journey post-consulting does not lie in creating businesses, but in breaking my addiction to achievement and external validation and creating a career path that aligns with my values and passions. I realize that high achievers on paper, such as consultants, typically have a chip on their shoulders. That and our strong work ethics can easily be exploited by employers or co-workers who do not have our best interest. If we walk down a career path that is wrong for us, it will slowly chip away at our confidence and self-worth, leading us to leave in desperation. Most of time we actually love working if it’s something that lights us up. However, without a clear understanding of who we are or how to break through our trauma and heal, we risk getting into another wrong and/or toxic job/career path, and the cycle perpetuates until time runs out, and we resign ourselves to not fully recognizing our potential.

From my own experience, therapies take a long time and are not always effective (therapists usually charge by the hour and they want you to stay in therapy as long as possible), and business schools sometimes make one want to fit in even more instead of seeking one’s true callings. However, there are frameworks that we can utilize to rapidly change the trajectory of where we are heading and save us a lot of time, opportunity cost, and mental damage in wrong career paths. We can find clarity and purpose (including starting our own business in a completely different industry) quickly if we focus on a holistic, heart-centered approach.

If the following describe what you feel right now, I am happy to answer any questions and hopefully provide some insight. If you are not comfortable sharing your experience in public, please add me on LinkedIn (link see my bio), drop me a DM there or on Reddit:

1cgi1n2,Am I Being Forced Out?,"I've been getting burned for the last two years on compensation (I have been focused on developing expertise in my current role, but in retrospect I should have been advocating for yearly compensation adjustments.)

I'm now in the midst of negotiating either a compensation adjustment or promotion but my organization is being comically ambiguous on how to reach said promotion despite my work the last two years, and is intentionally avoiding offering me a competitive compensation adjustment in my current role based on my new qualifications. 

I'm currently making around \~$10k under market compensation for my position, and I am on the edge of making the senior role based on my work in the position, certifications, overall expertise, an considering I have been doing the role for the last two years (peers in the senior role are making \~$35K more than me at a minimum have been senior for a few years). A constantly moving goalpost is working to the organization's benefit which they can maintain by being ambiguous on what is required of me to make the senior jump (the requirements changed every year). I have accepted they will likely never give me the role, so now I am advocating for just the compensation increase with the intent that I will proceed to do as they have asked to \*eventually\* make senior.

I am negotiating for a compensation adjustment of $20K (10K to bring me up to minimum market value, and 10K to compensate me for new qualifications) which would put me in the middle of the market bracket for this mid-level position. The organization has argued that this would put me above what they consider the mid-level compensation bracket is, and into the senior role. They also told me the internal pay cap for the senior position was 10K lower than what I know the lowest compensated senior is currently making. 

Their last offer was paying me at the bare minimum of what the market value of the mid-level position is. I have offers from other organizations for higher pay with the same responsibilities, but the organization keeps going back to ""there are other forms of compensation that we offer that the company you received an offer from might not.""

I really like my team and the people I work with, but leadership is throwing such a fit about this I'm having second thoughts. Am I getting played or is it even worth my time to negotiate further? The company is aware of what I bring to the table, and I have advocated for the value I bring to the organization. My last plan was going to use new-hire acquisition costs as a way to negotiate (15K in acquisition, on-boarding/ramp-up, training, lost opportunities in the interim, etc.) but have never had to go this far before.

1cgi0bu,"Moving twice in a year, need advice","My boyfriend and I are moving across the country to LA by the end of the year (still TBD). We live in his college town (he graduates in May) but our lease in our current apartment ends in June. Landlord will not let us lease month by month as it is student apt. Until we have jobs and and apartment in LA set up, we are going to move to his hometown two and a half hours away where his parents have a free, dormant house. I currently work as a nurse in the college town (graduated school 12/2022 & started few months later). 

We are unsure how long it will take for plans to move to LA. Best case: end of June. Likely case: late July to early September. Worst case: the next year in April (if license is denied). I need advice for what my best option may be. 

Option 1: I stay working here until we move to LA.
Potential consequences - long drives, bumming at friends’ apartments or hotels between shifts, not a job I love anyways but I am part time so two shifts per week which I can TRY to bunch together 

Option 2: I quit my job here, and find a nurse job where we are moving. It could be a summer camp position, a temporary travel nurse position, or hospital/nursing home. 
Potential consequences - look bad on resume, stressful job, job not lasting long enough or lasting longer than desired, or potentially unable to find an employer due to my honesty about unknown length of time spent at company near hometown. 

Option 3: I find a non-nurse job until we move to LA. I would aim for something like a barista job to improve in my hobby (I have a home espresso machine). 
Potential consequences - future RN employers may not take me seriously if they see I stopped as an RN for a few months, not as good pay

1cghwn1,Help! Need advice on how I should handle this potentially explosive discovery at work.,"Sorry in advance for the long post.

I've run into a situation in the workplace and I'm not sure how to best move this forward.  My discovery would likely look bad for a Sr Exec in the organization and potentially our CEO considering this happened during his watch.   I'm currently an executive in the organization looking for an opportunity to claw my way to the next rung, potentially a SVP role or a C reporting to another C that's not the CEO.

When I entered the organization several years ago I found that we were heavily dependent upon a third party vendor for a critical IT function that's in our revenue path.   We're spending close to 2M per year with this vendor and it's a huge strategic risk.  Not only do they have relationships with our competitors, we have intel that they are gearing up to compete with us directly.  They house our customer data which is an incredible advantage for them, as they are able to see our best customers, sales volumes, pricing, everything.  

After a quick analysis of the functionality I estimated we could rebuild this capability within 4-6 months.  This would be owned IP, create an asset for our organization, decrease our opex, remove the strategic risk, and open up the path for us to innovate around it at our own pace.

I put this proposal forward to our CEO and was quickly show down by the Sr Exec who was responsible for negotiating and maintaining the relationship with the vendor.  There's a govt mandated compliance element to this capability and that exec hand-waived and dismissed my proposal on the basis that I have ""little understanding"" of the difficulty level of the compliance requirement.  He was successful in getting the proposal killed and being new to the company at the time, I really wasn't informed enough to rebut him.   He convinced the CEO that I was underestimating the effort, and honestly, it made me doubt myself as well.  Maybe I did overlook something?  

In my spare time I've continued to investigate this problem.  I've dug into the compliance requirement which involve handling and reporting data to the government.   I've analyzed the arcane details of file formats, uncovered the who/when and how of the govt's reporting infrastructure, found and read the relevant statutes- and then I found something unexpected.

In reading through the relevant documentation, I discovered that the compliance obligation doesn't appear to apply to our use case at all!  I literally couldn't believe my eyes!  To validate this, I found and contacted the govt's program administrator and had a long conversation about the requirements and our use-case.   The administrator confirmed my finding and agreed that this doesn't apply to us.

It appears that for years we may have been been paying for a service that we don't need.  I still can't believe it and keep asking myself ""what am I missing?""  However, I've been over this from every possible direction and the facts of the situation seem to hold up-  we've paid millions over several years for a service we don't seem to require and put ourselves at a huge strategic disadvantage for the privilege of doing so.

Where do I take this from here?  A couple of things on my mind:

* I don't currently trust my boss to leverage this information on my behalf.  
* It's possible, though seems unlikely, that I'm still overlooking something.  I absolutely need a legal review.
* If I'm right, I'm ok if this reflects negatively on the original exec.  
* If I'm right, would this reflect poorly on the CEO?
* My current CEO is under scrutiny from the board for poor revenue performance.
   * Could this be a boon to the CEO? Found money?
   * Would the board, if they became aware, consider this mismanagement?  There's a lot of angst over this vendor.
   * Could any blow back be deflected to the original exec, not the CEO?
* How can I best leverage this for the benefit of the company?
   * I think the obvious answer here is that it dramatically decreases the effort, cost and timing of replacing the vendor.  This could be a significant impact on our bottom line in 2024 helping to improve our EBITDA numbers.
* How can I use this to help showcase my value to the organization?

  
Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice on how to handle this situation,

1cgg3j8,Offer rescinded after attempted negotiations,"I have been working at a tech startup for the past three months as a software engineer intern. Although my boss was always annoying and I was given many more expectations based off what I was being paid (which was basically minimum wage), I was fine with it and knew I was in it for the experience. Now that my 3 month contract is up, I had already decided I was going to pursue other options, but I was curious if I asked if they would increase compensation. Even though I was an intern, I felt I was doing a significant amount of work and he was placing the same expectations on me as the other full time software engineer. So I decided to talk to him and tell him I was interested in resigning for another 3 month contract. He said that's fine and when I inquired about the contract he said it would remain the exact same. I asked if there could be any change in compensation, and was given a firm no. That's fine, and I told him that, but also said I would have to reconsider if I would take the offer since I was worried he would ask me to sign on the spot if I said the terms were ok. He then said that he would now have to reconsider even giving me the opportunity and wouldn't you know a few days later I got an email stating he has rescinded the offer. I am upset and annoyed that he did that, but I had already decided I was working somewhere else and have an interview lined up for a well established and better paying company. The problem is I did not expect the conversation to go so poorly and now I am not sure if I can even use him as a reference if any recruiter asks for one from the internship. He was my only traditional higher up besides the full time software engineer there, so now I am trying to figure out how to handle the situation, as I don't want to be unprepared in an interview if I am asked for a reference from the company.

I’ve given presentations and a valedictorian speech in front of 2000 people but I gave my first team presentation yesterday and my voice was shaking and I cried. Now sobbing but tears were on my face and I just finished and sat back down. When I went back to my office I cried even more. Two of my managers came in and said I did fine and it’s okay that I got nervous but I came home and until now I’m fully convinced I’m getting fired. How do I get over this embarrassment. I swear like 10 people saw me cry and panic. ,NeedlePhobic95,22,0.8299999833106995,22,1714437927,2024-04-30 00:45:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cgfmku/cried_infront_of_my_work_team_am_i_getting_fired/,4,2024
1cgfm67,Passed up for internal opportunity,"I work remotely for a very large company as an HR Generalist/Specialist. Currently working mostly on the HRIS side. I’m very good at my job & comfortable overall I guess, but I’ve wanted to be in a more employee-facing role for a while now. 

Over the last few months, I’ve been mentoring with an HR Director to get more exposure to employee relations matters. A position supporting her department was supposed to open up this summer, and I was going to be considered for it.

Earlier this month, the company acquired a smaller company with about 300 employees. I got a call from the director I’ve been mentoring with this morning. She told me that the company decided to have someone from the acquisition take over the position that was supposed to open up this summer. Just feeling really discouraged and not sure how to be excited about my career right now when I wasn’t even really given a chance to pursue this opportunity. At this time, there are no other HR roles opening up within the company.

For background: I’ve been with this company for nearly 5 years. I have an MBA and PHR certification. Taking the SPHR in June. Been casually looking around for other opportunities, but as we all know, the HR job market is not great right now. Not the first time I’ve been passed up for a promotion at this company either.

Anyone else dealt with something like this? Advice, suggestions, and/or words of encouragement are all appreciated!",RadiantStranger7178,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1714437896,2024-04-30 00:44:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cgfm67/passed_up_for_internal_opportunity/,4,2024
1cgfkux,Advice on getting offered a job that I might not be able to fulfill,"I am over a year post-grad and have been applying for jobs in my field with no success. I recently applied for a job as a tour guide and the description of activities was somewhat vague. I saw that there was potential that I would need to go on a boat for the job, but it didn't seem like it was a large part of it. My issue is that I get extremely seasick and medication doesn't help me, so I would essentially be unable to fulfill that part of the role. The manager asked me to come in to interview and she explained the duties and it seemed that I would be going on a boat every day giving tours (sometimes multiple times a day), although that isn't the only activity I'd be doing. She offered me the job on the spot and I said I would take a few days to think about it. I didn't tell her about my seasickness. 

My friends think I should email her and ask if there is a possibility that I could do all of the activities except the one on the boat. I don't want it to seem like I lied to her by not telling her in the interview, as she explained all of the activities and then asked me if I still would be interested in the job and I said 'yes'. It also just feels unprofessional asking because if I can't perform one of the basic aspects of the role, then why did I even apply? But I also don't know unless I ask. I'm not fully sure what I should do, and I only have 2 days at most to respond.

1cgeyb5,"19, going to try and become software engineer without a cs degree","So I’ve been going to school to become a nurse. But I’m only doing this for my mother. I am in community college but I hate it. I’ve always hated college and I never wanted to go. Mostly because I’m afraid of debt and because I get frustrated with the work. I’ve been reading online and watching YouTube videos and all of them have given me the confidence that I don’t need a cs degree to become a software engineer. I’ve always wanted to learn how to code to make my own game one day. I actually was in app jam in middle school, a program where we learned how to make our own apps. That was the earliest coding experience I had. I’ve started on JavaScript not too long ago. I want to learn the most popular coding languages before I try and apply for jobs. I already know that without a degree my chances could be slim but all these stories online have really tempted me to at least try. So yeah wish me luck. Any advice or anything I should know?

I'm working in QA as a consultant and I'm looking for another opportunity. Data Engineering appeals to me. I'd like to break into this space or at least become a developer as I feel like I'm stagnating. I did not actually get a undergrad in CS but in Chemical Engineering. I'm trying to decide whether it would make sense to do a course based masters in CS because it seems like everyone has a CS degree here. On the other hand, it will be a big commitment that may not be worth it so I'm wondering if I should do that over upskilling through projects/LC.

1cgdpz1,How do I leave the field I’ve been in? ,"I (28f) have been working in veterinary medicine for about 7 years now. I’ve worked at multiple different clinics including shelters. I’ve had some opportunities to be an LVT (licensed vet tech) but I could never picture myself staying in this field for long. Most of the older woman I know seem to miserable and negative, and I just don’t want that to be. Their attitudes affect the environment no matter how hard I try not to let it.

My mental and emotional health is constantly fluctuating because of what I have to deal with at work on top of low income. It feels dead end to me.

Anyway, I digress. I’m currently going to community college and have been since may of last year. I’m the first ever to even attend college in my family so I’ve been trying to figure out things as I go, as well as what I want to pursue.

I’ve been applying to jobs outside of veterinary medicine. The problem is all they see is my experience instead of acknowledging my skills. It’s been really frustrating because I just want an employer to give me a chance to get out of this field.

Any advice? I’ve revised my resume endless amount of times and have researched resourses to try and better my chances. I’m exhausted.

1cgd4us,Please help- ex employee suing for wrongful termination advice needed. ,"We’re in California. It’s a small business, and I run admin. Today I got a letter that a former employee that we had let go for attendance is suing for wrongful termination (Employee A) He was fired the same time we down-sized and had to get rid of another guy. 
I wasn’t there for the termination, but  Employee A was angry about it. I was out of the office that day but ended up in a text conversation with him and the owner about why he was let go. I know he kept it to text for a written record, which is fine. I offered many times to have a conversation and then type it up in an email, which he declined. There are a lot of details that I can get into if wanted, but for sake of clarity and quickness, he was fired for attendance but when he filed unemployment he stated it was because he was laid off. We did not contest it, and he was paid his unemployment claim. 
Now the letter is claiming he was fired wrongfully and for retaliation. If he has already filed with the state that he was laid off to get unemployment can he then go back and sue for wrongful termination? I would understand if he was fired and nothing, but as far as the state is concerned he was laid off. 

Any articles or advice would be helpful. We don’t have an HR dept, and google is only so helpful.

1cgcohp,What resources are available to me?,"Long story short, I (25M) have been working in HVAC & metal fabrication for ~5 years in the Columbus OH area, ever since I got out of the military. It’s not something I have any interest in doing the rest of my life until retirement. Mostly because my father does similar work and I see the toll it’s taken on his body, and after only 5 years the toll it’s taken on mine is noticeable. Although the military didn’t help, I’m sure. Also, I just don’t see much more upward mobility at the company I’m at now. I worked my way up *somewhat* fast, but don’t believe there is much more room to move up and quite honestly the small department I’m apart of could be phased out over the years.

Nearly everybody says this about themselves, but I have a reputation at my current employer of being a reliable, punctual, hard worker that is on the quiet/reserved side. They have encouraged me to come out of my shell over the years, but it’s just how I am for the most part and I believe they accepted that. My annual reviews have always been stellar and have always included how happy everybody is with the job I’m doing.

Right now I am an assistant manager/supervisor of a small department within my company, overseeing anywhere from 1-5 people on any given day, tasking them with what needs done, how we’re going to accomplish it, and so on. When my manager is not present, which is quite often, I assume responsibility for the entire department. I have good leadership skills & what I believe to be a good leadership style, unlike my boss. I’m empathetic and lead by example, I’ll never ask one of my guys to do something I won’t. More than likely I’ll be right beside them helping, if time allows it. I also don’t play favorites. Some other responsibilities of mine include billing orders that we get sent, keeping track of/ordering inventory, communicating with various project managers about their jobs, what they need, and how they’d like it done, operating/maintaining various kinds of equipment (welders/plasma table/lockformers/etc), programming specific metal fittings/pieces for jobs we get on the computer for the plasma table, among other things.

If you’ve taken the time to read this, I applaud & thank you. Here are my questions.

What resources are available to me to assist with looking for a new career, specifically one I could stick with? I’m too old for JobCorps, I believe.

Given my experience & job duties, what jobs/industries do you believe would be a good fit for me?

I should add, I’m 100% okay with some kind of certification/training recommendations as well. I will hear out recommendations on certain degrees. Also, if you’re going to ask, no my military training doesn’t have any transferable civilian world skills, as I was a combat MOS.

Thanks to everyone who takes the time! Guess I lied when I said “Long story short”",TheseAd1805,1,1.0,0,1714430077,2024-04-29 22:34:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cgcohp/what_resources_are_available_to_me/,4,2024
1cgc33b,Manager gatekeeps information. Should I start exploring other opportunities? ,"I have been working at this successful tech company for the past 2 years. People are predominantly between the ages of 23 - 39 here and we rarely have people above 40. (Maybe 2%)

My manager and I are 3 years apart and both joined at the same time. I’m 29 manager is 32. We  literally started the department together and there’s only the 2 of us since 2 years ago. 

She promoted me recently and is generally a nice and understanding superior. However, I realised that she tends to gate keep a lot of information from me and does not include me in meetings with other departments or higher management and does not allow me to even communicate directly with my HOD (all comms will be initiated and responded by her). Because of this I feel like my work does not receive a lot of visibility from other departments or my HOD and I exist as a ghost because she controls the work narrative and most of the time meeting invites for important discussions are given to her directly. 

I think the biggest slap in the face is everytime there’s a big event where our team is involved to give a talk of briefing and she introduces me to other people from different department their response is “oh is OP new? / did you finally get a new team member?” Or when explained that I joined the same time as she did they will say something along the lines of “oh I’ve never seen OP before”. 

I’ve spoken to my manager about this a year ago and this year and she said she is keen to let me join stakeholder meetings and management meetings but I have not seen her doing so. It’s making me grow resentful but I feel guilty because she’s nice to me. Is it time to explore other jobs? 

I know it’s not the quality of my work because I often receive praises from her. And I know she’s scared of me resigning because she is not able to run the department if I resign and it’ll take a long time to train somebody new.

1cgb2m8,Realistic pay rise (Spain),"I am a recent graduate and started working for the company I am now in December as a conversation designer. 
I make €23,000 a year, plus bonus which I get in December. If I was to get 100% of the bonus would probably make my salary up to 28/29000. 

When I accepted the job I tried to negotiate a higher salary but I was told if by the end of my trial period I do well, they could make it €25,000. End of May I finish the trial period so I am obviously hoping for a pay rise.

1. The bonus system is pretty bad. Each quarter we have goals, 50% of that quarterly goal is determined by my team’s work, 50% by me. This quarter I got my 50%, I worked a lot a lot of extra hours and I was told well done, but don’t get used to getting 50% (from my part alone) because it rarely happens. So basically I can’t really be relying on it whatsoever. Not that I was but it just means I need a pay rise even more.
2. Even 25.000 is very low and I would not even be happy with that. Unfortunately I compare myself to others but a. All my friends are earning significantly more (30.000+, 60.000…) although different fields and experience etc, and I know for a fact I am earning the least in the company. I have least experience, probably in a lower paying role and one of the younger ones).
3. My responsibilities will not have changed too much since I started. Although I am know wholly in charge of design in English, and the idea is when they have another AI engineer I will collaborate with them to do more computational linguist work.

Is €25.000 really the most I can expect for the first pay rise? I obviously want to push for as much as possible but I wouldn’t want to be unrealistic and say idk say 30.000 (they’re not going to give me a €7.000 pay rise…)
I really enjoy the work but I would like to do more computational linguistics, AI, innovation type things eventually (I know I’ll get there 😊)

What could I say to sell myself into getting a bigger pay rise?
Things I know about myself and I know they see in me: extremely proactive and hardworking and they trust me a lot.

1cgb127,Stay with Ecology or Switch Majors?,"Hey, I'm currently a Freshman majoring in Ecology. I started my second semester, but I am having some reservations about the major/career. For those who do not know, Ecology is a notoriously hard field of science to have a career in. Permanent jobs are hard to get, and the pay is bad for those jobs, even the ones requiring a MS/PhD (roughly 50k is what I have heard). I have always wanted to work for a university as a professor or a government agency as a researcher, but I am nervous about the financial instability/job prospects of these careers/majors. I am not too interested in doing minimal wage seasonal/temp work for years with the hope of landing an okay paying permanent job. Also, I am hesitant to move to rural places for work largely due to some personal reasons/politics. I was planning on attending graduate school to pursue a MS/PhD, but even with these degrees, pay can be low. I am not opposed to working hard for this career.  
  
In high school, I helped an NGO conduct some research and volunteered at AZA zoos. In college, I've already gotten involved with a lab and talked with the GIS department for a minor that I start Sophomore year, and I will be starting upper-level courses Ecology classes next semester. I have already gotten an ecology internship for the summer that I plan to follow through on. I genuinely love Ecology/the environment. I read books about these fields, I keep up to date on the news in these fields, l attend seminars hosted by my university about these fields. I'm just worried about future finances for this career, like what if my parents get sick and I need to help them. Would I be able to own a home on an Ecologist salary? Questions like that. I know this is a decision that I have to come to by myself, but any advice about the question/topic would be appreciated. The majors that I am thinking about switching to are some human health ones like public health/epidemiology, engineering/tech-based ones like computer engineering, or maybe even going to law school. I've done pretty well with math/computer/writing courses, and I am interested/like these subjects and fields, just not as much as Environmental Sciences/Ecology.

1cgan2p,"Help deciding whether to leave a fulfilling, but frustrating, job.","I'm a software engineer currently working for a very big IT company on a project that I honestly find awesome. I've been working on it for the past year and a half, and in many ways I feel like it's ""my baby"". I have friends here that I get along with really well, the benefits are pretty good (pension, training etc.), and the work-life balance is okay (not amazing, but okay enough), which affords me the ability to crack on with my own side business soon. I love the fact that I have come to fulfil a senior-ish role on this project, where I spend a lot of time helping other devs (though yes, I am expected to both help people and get just as much work done myself, which can be irritating).  
  
The big problem is the fact that they do not pay me appropriately at all. I'm an apprentice, I'm pretty young, so they pay me a standard rate, like they do all other apprentices, and I've got a few months until it ends. At that point, I'll be given a pay increase of about 80%. However, most of the people I work with (and some of whom I have greater responsibilities than) are being paid just short of double what I am.  
  
I was offered a job for a little over twice my salary - so higher than I'd be looking at here. It'd be a bit more aligned with my career direction in terms of my actual title, but the responsibilities would be pretty similar. It's a smaller (few hundred people) company though, and not in the tech sector - I'm guessing their infrastructure isn't going to be as technically demanding as my current role entails, given its scale - just perhaps introducing some new technologies to me. Also, because it's a relatively smaller company, I'd probably have much greater responsibilities in terms of getting called out of hours, etc., perhaps not being able to take leave where I need it if others aren't around, etc... I can take leave whenever at my current company, and if I was on call here, I'd probably get paid the same as I would there (Not that I think I have that option at the moment). It makes me wary of what my work-life balance will be like, since I want to focus on running my business in my spare time. Also, their benefits aren't nearly as good - neither pension, training, or others.  
  
I've verbally accepted the offer from this new company, and I have handed in my notice for my current company. My current company have, however, been quite enthusiastic about keeping me. It at least seems like they have gone to much trouble - certainly the likes of managers and those who work closer to me. However, they have not made a counter-offer, because people very high up want to follow a ""process"". I can understand why, to be honest, because it might cause a bit of uproar if I was paid more than others. Also, it'd be hypocritical for me to ask for more than others, when I've essentially cited my reason for leaving as the fact that I'm going to be paid less than others for the same job, plus the fact that I'm already working well above my pay grade. Basically, I just asked for a more appropriate salary when finishing my apprenticeship - i.e., one that matched others I work with. But no - process. There's a lot of what seems to be attempts to scare me out of it - because I'm so early to leave, as an apprentice - with people saying I'm ""potentially making a mistake"", or ""jumping the gun"" - but nobody has been unpleasant or obtuse about it. There have been hints of them offering more later down the line - but nothing tangible, so I can't trust that of course.  
  
But in some ways, they're right. I just cannot get what I'm leaving behind out of my head. I'll miss the project I'm working on deeply. I'll miss the people insanely. I have made plans to keep in touch with people, of course, but it's not the same. I have even told people on the project that they can give me a ring if they need my perspective on something, since I'd love to keep my hand in with it. I think there's something to be said for the benefits I get here, and the fact that I have confirmation I can run my business. But I am also frustrated by how I work so hard and have contributed so much for literally no more recognition than someone who has barely contributed a thing, because of classic mega-corporation rigid pay structures (lol though somehow I end up on less than all my peers). One of my closest friends here is making almost twice what I am and will continue to get more, but I spend a lot of my time helping them. They're great, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me feel bitter. Also, I'm young, and rather ambitious. I want to make as much as possible, as early as possible, as shallow as that may sound.  
  
The potential for progression is higher in a large corporation, but it's a question of whether I can achieve it, when very few people seem to. In a smaller business, it's more likely that I can progress, but I probably can't progress as far - and at what cost will that progression come, in terms of my personal ambitions, like training, or my business? Also, the project I'm on right now holds immense weight - having that as a recent venture in my CV is some excellent clout.  
  
This company offered me a job at more than double my salary almost too easily, and too quickly. I felt like I did okay in the interview, but not staggeringly so. I know the demand is higher than the supply in my industry, but I somewhat worry that they were just trying to get someone in, quick. Or, alternatively, I'm a bargain, and I'm shooting too low. I'm partially inclined to wait and see whether my current company genuinely meant anything with their intangible, hinted offers (unlikely, but possible), and see where my business goes first. If I could get this kind of offer this quickly, I'm guessing I could do the same again, once I'm clearer on my position? I don't know.  
  
I don't think there'd be any problem if I came back to my current company with my tail between my legs and rescinded my resignation - I'd be shocked if they said ""No, too late now"". They're not that sort of place.

So I started at this company in November I’m 23 and got hired in their new program as an admin for 17.50 an hour. I didn’t love the pay but everything else is good and it’s hybrid. Well we got our reviews and basically I’m doing a fantastic job but I can’t get the 3% raise bc I’ve only been here for a quarter so I got a 6 cents raise.

1cg8yt5,What are my options?,"(Semi cross-posted). 

I was placed on an unfair PIP at the beginning of the year. Been with company for about one year, PIP was based off of first six months of experience. The PIP came out of nowhere - I had received a stellar performance review just a few months prior, so this really blindsided me. 

When I challenged the PIP, I was told I was already improving… but that didn’t apply and wouldn’t get me out of it. 

Anyways. Tried everything with manager to make this successful. Manager has been all but checked out throughout the entire process. Had an official progress check-in, and manager says I haven’t improved in all areas. It’s been over a month since that meeting and I’m still in the dark as to what’s going to happen (extension of PIP or getting fired). 

I have been looking for other work. Just frustrated that I’m in the dark and my manager’s sitting there scratching his balls over it.

1cg7qbg,Just found out an antagonistic coworker got promoted to being my manager. Should I call him out on Day 1?,"I have a seasonal job that I'm starting next week. It's an office position that involves occasionally working on-site for our events. I'm the #3 in the office on paper, but I've effectively been the #2 for the past couple of years due to unreliable people in that position.

I found out this year that both the #1 and #2 are leaving, making me the only person returning. In renegotiating for this position, I was told that a coworker who I only interact with on-site (I'll call him L) was applying for the #2 position. However, I was told by the outgoing #1 that because L had a job that interfered with the beginning of our season, he wouldn't be considered for it. I then expressed how I was glad that L was not being considered because he was antagonistic and aggressive towards me in our interactions last year and how I would consider not returning if I had to work closely with him.

Today, I was surprised to find out that L was now taking over as #1. I guess he quit his current job so he could make it work. I was kind of shocked, so I didn't really express my true feelings this time. The outgoing #1 told me that he wanted to acknowledge what I told him about my interactions with L, but that was about it. 

L, who was once hierarchically my equal, has now become my superior, despite my having more experience and knowledge about the processes of our office. He's definitely smart and capable, probably on my level, but now that his title is above mine, I feel like I'm walking into a situation where he will feel more freedom to treat me poorly.

1cg76cb,Seeking job-related advice... Trying to help my wife,"My wife and I are based in NYC. She's a medical office admin/clerk with 6 years experience, she was a CNA for several years before that. Right now she's working 5 days a week and the workload is pretty excessive. She's trying to find an office job (medical or non-medical) that's part time or per diem (less than 5 days). 

I have no issue with this as I'm a RN so financially speaking, her working less than 5 days is no issue. I actually want her to be able to have more time for herself. If my wife has more time for herself, the better everything else is (home life, etc) as a result. 

There's a few issues though. First and foremost, she wants to leave but then she's somewhat scared to leave because she's worried she'll make less money due to not just working less hours and but also a potentially lower wage. Even though I make enough, she still wants to be kinda independent and have her money as well. I told her she has to weigh her pros and cons, what's more important, I suggested choosing her mental health over the money.

Then lastly .. finding a new job for her is an issue because despite her work experience and a polished resume, she still gets mostly rejections or no response. Even for work-at-home/remote admin jobs that require no experience. It's pretty ridiculous and I'm wondering if it's the resume or just the job market itself?

1cg6wg5,"Construction career advice - Accept an apprenticeship for less, or focus on moving/home buying?","Posted this in the construction subreddit, but thought I’d post here as well for general advice.

I’m 29, female, and a union labourer in Toronto, ON. Currently laid off (and definitely not alone) and have a pretty good position (utilities, $45/hr as of next month).

Thankful for what I have (did the whole apprenticeship to get there), and enjoy my work besides winter seasons and layoffs, but my background /previous experience is in heavy equipment and its definitely the route I want to eventually go.

My S/O (9 years) and I are also considering/planning to move to the US next year. His parents are looking at a business, so I MAY have a lot of what I need right off the bat (housing, employment, etc.) but also want to follow my career, as long as it still makes sense to do so. But with this, I may have an easier time waiting and finding what I'm looking for.

Last month, I was invited to take the aptitude test for the Heavy Equipment union. I also met someone who gave me a IUOE rep's contact (to find a position as a journeyperson). The person actually recommended NOT doing the apprenticeship. Rep was great to talk to, sounded like he wanted to help, but obviously not much out there at this time for people within the union, let alone still on the outside.

If I did get accepted for an apprenticeship, I'd have to move 4 hours away for 4 months (housing provided by the union but I'd have to figure something out for my dog), complete the schooling, join an out of work list, and THEN eventually start working at 50% of the full rate (full rate is $44-$50) and just.. Hope for the best? The pay would be the most difficult part, especially now. I'll also likely be back to work by the time this all happens.

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in terms of where I should go from here. I'm still young, but have some crucial decisions to make (moving countries, buying a home).

My current choice is just work as a labourer in my current position, save as much as I can to potentially move, and then try to follow the heavy equipment path once in the US. If the rep gets back to me in the meantime, great. I would also apply for every job in the heavy equipment union just to try to get in, but that's not so easy if I'm working.

If I do stay in Canada, I can buy a home next year but I can't make any moves for the foreseeable future (as I'd need the steady employment, the full rate, etc. to afford it). I really want to own a home and one of my biggest issues staying in Canada is housing (hence the want to move and actually own something decent, not just the only condo I can afford here).

I'm also wondering if it would be easier to get into the IUOE in the US, or just to find heavy equipment work out there.

Any thoughts/ideas and just ""what would you do"" in my position? Any info on the IUOE (like do you think it would be worth it to still take the test? Can I be on the backburner until I'm ready)? Stories of similar experience welcome.

Thank you.

1cg6swi,How do I realistically finish strong after handing in notice? ,"My last day is FRIDAY!! It's a busy season at my job. I put in my two weeks on a Thursday for my last day to be two Fridays from then (so a little over two weeks notice). 

I've followed my supervisor's lead to make all the calls and send all the emails to transition everyone over to my projects. But now there's nothing specifically assigned to me. I can tell from documents I'm shared in and a lack of emails that meetings are happening without me and people are going on and working on things. Which is totally fine! I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. HR scheduled an exit interview the day before my last day so I really have NO idea what I'll do my last day. 

I was never trained well- a long time employee said it several times to me and when I told him I was leaving, he said company did a huge disservice to me. I think there's some truth to that, but I also should've never taken this position. I had been laid off and was a bit desperate and knew in my interview this position would not be a good fit but surprisingly, they made a really good offer so I figured I would just give it a chance. I was a terrible employee but based on reviews, managed to fly under the radar until probably a few days before putting in my notice when my slacking off messed things up pretty bad for another coworker (who is not even in my department so she would never have reviewed me and I wouldn't have asked her for a reference anyway). 

I guess I could reach out and ask people if they need help/ask my supervisor expectations but it kinda seems like what's the point and in all honesty- I'm leaving because I have zero interest in the industry, a lot of the work is over my head, and this whole year have been doing a pretty subpar job. I am starting a TOTALLY different job in a different state (didn't move just live close to a state border). 

Yes, putting in my two week has made me less motivated, but also I genuinely don't really know what I could do that would be super helpful since a) I was never that good or really understood several aspects of my job and b)everyone seems to have already moved on and gotten all the info they need from me. 

I feel guilty with my timesheet/am not sure if this isn't really legal. I'm still logging in but not doing anything work related. I can just put everything on overhead and be vague. Do I take vacation days? The company manual simply says the company is not entitled to give unused vacation days if no notice was given, but does not explicitly state that unused PTO will be given if you give notice- and I've been combing through that thing with nothing better to do. So maybe between my PTO I did not take and the fact that I'm logging in and being available, I shouldn't feel guilty about my timesheet?

My boss(owner) has recently moved out of state and has gone full remote, now he is saying he wants to reduce his hours and wants me to get/carry the contractor's license and to to begin taking over operations entirely. He is asking what my demands are. He is offering 20% share in profit as a bonus at year end. I currently work 40 hour weeks, this would potentially boost me to 50-55 hours per week. (I am going to have a conversation with the Office Manager about what our profit has been the last few years to decide what that even looks like.)

I'm a construction worker, I've never had a chance to negotiation for stuff. Some things that I have thought of are:

* Additional week or two of paid vacation time, if I have to work more hours I'm going to want to take some personal days off here and there for family stuff, kids stuff, or just to relax. 
* 20%-25% raise so that I am getting paid more now instead of just the carrot on a stick of future profits 
* Company car: if I am expected to run around and do more onsite visits and monitor jobsite progress more closely, I'll have to do a lot more driving around. I drive an old (20 years), economical commuter car and it's not very nice and probably couldn't take the mileage necessary.
* New work laptop for my home office, my current work laptop is a turd.

1cg52wm,Want thoughts on counter offers from an executive perspective?,"There has SURELY been a post or two on this before, but wanted to propose an alternative perspective on counter-offers than what you typically see.

I disagree completely with the ""never take a counter-offer"" trope. It doesn't help that you ONLY really hear this from recruiters who are compensated only if someone is placed in a role.

I have leveraged counter-offers twice in my career and given them several times. In zero instances has it created a rift between the employer and the EE, if the EE is adding value. In my own personal experience, I consider probably half of my income is a result of leveraging counter-offers at the right time and have received many subsequent promotions since the last time I did that, approx 6 years ago. Counter offers often come with a promotion that could put you into a different playing field internally and open up substantially more opportunity.

In reality, most employers fully understand the fact that internal pay raises are TYPICALLY synchronous (quarterly or annual promotion/pay raise cycles) while competitive recruiting is completely asynchronous. It's not uncommon for these two timelines to be cross-threaded and require off-cycle adjustments/counter offers.

So - some takeaways from a senior leader in corp. america:

1. Be a reasonable person. Understand that your boss is likely subjected to internal raise/promotion cycles and rules. Work with them to understand their limitations and ask how you can help them help you.
2. Add value before extracting value. There are table-stakes for the EE/employer relationship, sure (pay me a fair starting wage and respect me and I'll give you fair work), but if you want to get off-cycle raises/promotions (""pay me what I'm worth, now""), you need to get noticed by adding value. This may or may not mean working extra hours, but I prefer folks that focus on adding outsized value inside of average working hours, rather than adding average value but outsized hours.
3. Understand that everything in business is a negotiation, ESPECIALLY pay vs work. Take the time to understand your BATNA, MDO, LAA, considering ALL aspects of the trade of time vs money (culture, commute, lifestyle, respect, upside opportunities, training opportunities). No one can know the right algorithm for YOU, but you.
4. Make considerations based on the above at the time and place of the opportunity and what you KNOW. Don't overly worry about the hype that recruiters will spew about counter offers (first on chopping block, black list from promos, etc.). Those things are possibilities, BUT, they are potentials of potentials, AKA a small likelihood to actually occur and should weight VERY little in the calculus here.
5. Have tact when discussing the situation with your manager. Don't give them a reason to just let you leave. What's always worked for me: ""Hey, manager, I have a situation and I could use some advice. I wasn't actively searching for a role but something interesting came up so I talked to the recruiter. Long story short, they made an offer and I'm a bit torn about what to do. How would you approach this if you were in my shoes? What are your limitations as a manager to help me close this gap and how can I help you?""
6. Finally, ""closed mouths don't get fed."" Make sure your manager knows that you have certain financial goals and work WITH THEM to achieve them.

I hope that helps some of you navigate this common concern. Taking advantage of well-timed competitive offers can make an outsized impact on your overall earning potential.

Good luck out there!

Looking forward to dissention from recruiters in the comments...",jmonta2,4,1.0,0,1714412040,2024-04-29 17:34:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cg52wm/want_thoughts_on_counter_offers_from_an_executive/,4,2024

1cg4jx1,Move on or stick it out with current company? ,"So I (26m) have been working with the same company since graduating university, and am coming up on 3 years with them as of next week. It is an entry level role, and I make $60k annually (gross) with small (1.5%) annual raises. It is a unionized environment, hybrid (can work from home 100% of the time if I so choose), 3 weeks vacation, 7 paid sick days per year, and DB pension, and consistent 9-5/mon-fri. 

My dilemma is I am getting bored, I work in a smaller office, not our head office, 12 hours away from Toronto. There will be a wave of retirements within the next 5 years opening up a few jobs here, but until then I’ll be stuck in the job I’m currently in. If I moved to Toronto I’d be able to take advancement opportunities more regularly but as I’m not at head office I’m quite limited. The next position up has a salary range of $70k-$80k, and above that $82k-$93k. 

Is it time to look for somewhere I can earn more? Or stick it out here due to the pension / benefits?",theliljwcptdeux,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1714410775,2024-04-29 17:12:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cg4jx1/move_on_or_stick_it_out_with_current_company/,4,2024

I want to be someone who makes prosthetic devices.  I have always been fairly crafty and have a strong background in anatomy, so I think this field would marry those two interests well.

1cg3xyk,What course should I do?,"Hi, I'm just looking for suggestions! I am about to finish up an undergraduate certificate in art history and am planning to start a bachelors next year but I have no idea what course I would like to do.

I was originally wanting to get into arts administration but I'm honestly not sure I want to do that anymore. I have always had an idea about my strengths and what I enjoy ever since I was younger, but now that I am changing as my mental health as improved and I'm getting older and trying new things I'm completely lost on what to do!

I've worked in offices in data entry before and I've really struggled. I have sensory issues and the sounds really bother me. I do think I could work in an office setting I would just have to be able to wear my headphones. I've worked in retail for a while and I like being able to connect with the customers on a deeper level and help them the best I can. I also struggle with sitting around all day I like to walk around and do things with my hands.

Things I've had interest in include:

Art History, I find looking at how the events happening in the world effect the art being created in certain periods. I do also like making art but I could not do it as a job, just as a hobby :)

I've done a bit of coding which I really enjoy. I like how logical it is. Figuring out problems is really fulfilling to me. I looked into doing a double degree in a bachelor of arts(art history) and computr science but I would have to do an advanced math bridging course. I do feel like I would be able to do it and maybe even enjoy it but it is very out of left field for me and I'm worried it would be a big mistake.

Psychology is also really interesting to me, in particular developmental psych. I really like looking into what causes certain things to happen.

Fashion! I love tweaking my clothes and creating a look with makeup and hair. When I was in high school I subjected many friends and family to makeovers followed by a photoshoot.

Any advice would be really really appreciated! Thanks in advance",Vegetable_Ad_3761,1,1.0,2,1714409311,2024-04-29 16:48:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cg3xyk/what_course_should_i_do/,4,2024

They said I violated a non-compete in my contract by applying to the other company, except nothing like that exists in my contract or in any documentation for the company (handbook, code of conduct, etc.) Also it’s illegal in my state for them to use non-competes or to try to get me enter one anyways. Now job hunting I see many employers ask on the application if you have been let go due to a breach of contract. I am worried this is going to affect my career and getting hired when I did nothing wrong. I was only employed part time and only a couple months. Should I even include it on my resume?

1cg32dn,"I'm 31 years old, how should I move forward to grow my career? (EU)","I'll summarise my journey so far. Started working in 2015 at the age of 22. The job was easy enough, decided to take any extra work that was thrown at me. Worked night shifts for 7 years as a data entry specialist for a company that sold TV and radio reports to other companies. I had gained weight due to lack of exercise and night shifts. During Covid I got really fat (206kg/454 pounds). Decided to change my life in 2021. Finished my BA in Political Science and International Relations in 2022. Sold my house immediately afterwards for 66% more than it cost in 2019. Moved back to my hometown and changed jobs to help my boss run a cultural centre. Ended up taking a project management course on coursera, learned most of Adobe's applications with a focus on Premier Pro and Ill. and a high level of proficiency in event planning, website and social media management, etc. Basically a jack of all trades (master of some :) ). During this time, I was able to get back down to 137kg/302 pounds, working on getting to a decent weight without the need for surgery.  
  
So at the moment I've been paid around 10-15k€/year since I started working, which is close to the minimum wage in my country. Most of the people around me are paid the same or close to it. I was able to negotiate my contract and from June I'll be paid around 25k/year for a 1 year contract, which is a huge improvement. However, to make sure I am taking the right steps, how should I develop my career? I tried looking for jobs on Linkedin, but due to my age coupled with lack of specific experience and certifications, my CVs were easily overlooked and I can understand why. I got a couple of interviews out of 50-100 applications, but in case I become unemployed (and even for interview training), I want to improve my prospects.

Not only am I currently looking at getting some certifications to add to my current experience because I already manage my areas marketing and digital media, but I am just blown away by how frustrating this job market is. 

I have a Bachelors and Masters, and these jobs look at you like you are worth 40k entry level…… 😒 Like are you effing kidding me, I have worked since the age of 15 and have 3-4 years of professional experience, man please. How insulting. Plus I am coming upon finishing my 2 years with my current company…

Someone please give me advice and or if you have pivoted careers from education to MARCOM, please share some tips to encouragement.

1cg11od,"If a company offers an extra week of vacation during a raise, when does it come into affect?","During last year’s performance review I was provided a raise and an extra week of vacation. I just used this week and was informed that since it is within a year of my raise it counts as unpaid leave. They are saying that my raise was only an increase in vacation accrual and not my total number of weeks. Since a year hasn’t passed since my raise I haven’t earned the extra week.

Is it understandable for me to be upset by this? Does anyone else company work the same way? ",Chester_Cheetoh,0,0.5,2,1714402255,2024-04-29 14:50:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cg11od/if_a_company_offers_an_extra_week_of_vacation/,4,2024
1cg0ucq,"Seeking mentor-like advice regarding sales, career, etc?","I have been in outside sales/estimating for a few years now, and feel like I’m going crazy. I would love some “sage” advice from some seasoned, successful pros. This is going to be more stream of consciousness than organized - so bear with me. I also understand that you guys are busy, so I want to reaffirm that I’m very appreciative of your time.

Job Background, 

Industry,
 - Restoration/Remediation
Position
 - Supposed to be BDM, but I also act as a tech and a PM
Responsibilities,
 - Coldcalling
 - Outside sales (driving around/networking with people related to industry)
 - Inspections/estimating 
 - Coordinating with various contractors/employees/clients/other 3rd parties on a project
 - Invoicing/collections
 - Acting as on-site supervisor (involves doing the actual job I’ve just sold - i.e, crawlspace remediation/encapsulation)
 - Inventory/ordering of materials 
 - Miscellaneous.

Pay
 - $25.25/hr (no commission, no gas, no mileage, insurance, etc), I also (as of a few mo ago), get $100 per inspection of toxic materials so I’ve made about a grand from that (around $40-50k/year in total)

Burnout,
 - Expected to be on call 24/7 (means I could be called out for emergency work at 2am on a Saturday)
 - 10mo baby who has difficulty sleeping
 - Work extends beyond what was agreed to/pay reflects
 - Anxiety around ensuring employees always have enough work, and balancing that with company profits 
 - Family owned business that I kind of want to leave, but feel obligated to stay bc the company will go under if I leave + owner sunk $300k into it and I will have to see him often regardless 
- Owner inflates cost of various items/tools which make it difficult to price appropriately (I.e, he will say a tool/materials cost $500 and wants me to price it into the bid - when actual cost is $125)
- Not always paid on time
- High turnover (due to them also not getting paid on time + owner doesn’t want to spend the money on trained/qualified techs, so I also am constantly training new hires on top of other responsibilities)
- My net worth has dropped since starting 

I was kind of thrown into this field during the pandemic when I was I going back to school (29m), and have not had a mentor, or anyone else in sales around me to teach/guide- so I’m figuring it out solo. 

I am looking for general advice on how outside sales should be approached,

- Best way to develop sales routes
- Networking advice 
- How to determine if you’re overbidding, and what to price services at (should I be calling competition and seeing how they price?)
- How to determine whether it’s best to cut losses and seek employment elsewhere (and if so, how to grow a spine and and leave without caring about familial fallout)
- If one were to scrub clean, their current understanding of sales, and start fresh, where would you go to learn, and what industries do you recommend?

Strengths,
- Genuinely not afraid of hard work
- Can adapt quickly/mirror specific attractive traits of any culture or class; and can do it in an honest/respectful way, (I.e, can be in-tune with/connect with and sell to a fry cook, doctor, engineer, carpenter, and a business owner within the same day)
- Not afraid of talking to people, and can pretty easily put them at ease
- Relatively easy time multi-tasking
- Good at remembering names, conversations, details 

Weaknesses 
- Possibly too transparent about pricing and what client can handle themselves 
- Overthinking about price and solution to problems, leading to offering a large variety of options/add-ons to place client is best possible positions - but I think it can be overwhelming for some people to see the price (even though it’s made clear that they can pick and choose which items they would like)
- I have a hard time selling a client what they want vs what they need to ensure that the issue (mold,water,fire damage) is actually resolved (it physically hurts me to sell a “bandaid” solution).
- I have a hard time letting go of rejection/rudeness (though, I remain collected, and nice with clients, it can cause anxiety- i think bc I’m genuinely trying to help in an industry that is mostly unregulated, and predatory) 

Ok. Ik that’s a lot. I’m frazzled and little sleep deprived rn, so I hope this all made sense. I would appreciate any kind of advice, insights, general commentary on what was written above. I’ll probably copy/paste into other subs too.

Thanks again; and I’m happy to answer any clarifying questions.

1cg0fhr,"My job is trying to push me to quit, what do I do?","I'm pretty sure my job is pushing me to quit so I don't claim unemployment. I was hired on full time but have struggled to receive enough work to come close to filling full time. When I first got hired the office and record keeping was a disaster area and filled my time for a couple months, but I've now been requesting a larger work load for about 9 months. I hit 1 year next month and they did the same thing to their designer. Gave her less and less work until she quit for another job and after talked about being ""relieved she made the choice for them"" be so fucking real you just didn't want to pay unemployment. That left me as the only woman in the company, and the only woman to hold any position of authority in the construction company. 

As I became proficient my week thinned and thinned. Tasks that used to take an hour take 10 minutes. As a result I'm losing my job. My boss basically ""suggested that I find a better fit"" if the work load does not suit me and im not willing to basically just work whatever hours I can squeeze out of the week, but also only added the task of now answering the nonexistent phone calls like a receptionist to my task list for the past 6 months. It's basically a bait and switch, move down to part time or be replaced for a part timer. They also denied my request after 6 months of requesting more work to go to salary pay. My owner compared me to his wife and because I don't do the work his wife does I don't ""fit into the category"" of someone who gets salary. Whose going to tell him by that logic he shouldn't be getting his salary nor should our project manager. It's really just sexism. I wouldn't touch my boss with a 10 foot pole he's a good looking case of a terrible fucking person and he's conservative as hell with American flags everywhere. I'm liberal as hell. So why the fuck am I in the same universe as your wife? She works in a health care industry and im your construction company office, HR and marketing manager. She has birthed 2 of your children, and I laugh about your gross life to my fiance. We are never to be compared. It's so fucking weird to compare your employees to your wife. 

I'm supposed to be able to work from home, but I never have work to do. My boss is an insane micro manager who literally made the yearly budget at 8pm an hour and a half after I left the office just to do it alone. He's so fucking weird for that. And then bitches he doesn't have time for his family. Maybe, stop doing my job? As the marketing manager I'm never approved budgets to do anything nor am I ever kept in the loop about timelines on our job sites so I can schedule photo and video. Don't even get me started on testimonials. People will rave about us on Facebook and Google reviews but he refuses to ask any of them to write a testimonial. I decided the website was horrible and outdated, rebuilt it from scratch. Started marketing for the first time in company history, brought a years worth of leads at over a million over goal revenue in the first quarter. But now my position is being posted for part time and $8 less an hour. But they won't fire me! I was supposed to move across country in August so they said they would keep me until then, but started interviewing candidates at the end on March! Owner was saying he wanted to offer a candidate the position last week upon his return from vacation. So obviously there's no intention to keep me anywhere near close to August, but they keep asking about my ""next opportunity"" and I'm like yeah no I'm not quitting you're going to have to fire me. So what do I do?

As a result of this I've signed up for school and start in a little over a month for summer classes, but my work schedule is completely flexible and it's 100% online it's no reason to quit my job. Plus I deserve my unemployment I'm not leaving this job of my own volition I liked my job I just wanted it to be the full time job advertised to me and that I interviewed for and was hired for. 

What do I do? I can't stand being there any more and I can't stand being around him anymore, but I don't want to let them win and quit and let them off the hook for unemployment I'm fucking owed. So many short pay weeks and I've used 3 of my 10 vacation days just to add hours onto short weeks so I could keep my damn health care, which I would lose if I went down to part time.

1cfzsr4,Networking with Executives ,"I am currently working as a consultant. The agency I work for is trying to break into the local market and establish a foothold. Long story short, there is a casual happy hour event this evening with C-level executives. These folks account for many of the major employers in my city that I was invited to. I have no clue how I’ve found myself in this position, but I see it as a great opportunity that I should take advantage of. 

Here’s the thing - I’m a normal dude working in a fairly technical and niche field. I almost certainly won’t know any of these folks or anyone in their social circle. That said, this wouldn’t be my first time communicating with executives. A few jobs ago I worked as a customer facing IT tech almost exclusively for executives and their subordinates so I feel like I know that world. After a while I began to view them like you or me though they live in a different world and perform at a substantially higher level. We would casually chat about beer, cycling, and Motorsports as I worked on their computers. 

My plan:

- dress with a button up, jeans, and a nice pair of dress shoes

- because it’s a happy hour, people will be transient (I assume). It’s probably best to engage with the larger groups of folks first for volume and work my way down to the loners

- I can’t confirm it will be offered, but drink very little to no alcohol at all. Maybe a sip of something to get the social lubrication going but that’s about it

1cfzq7i,How to reject a job offer? ,"Hi everyone, 

I’m UK-based and recently went through a three stage recruitment process for a job in the land/property development industry. 

When I was approached by the recruiter, who is working on behalf of the company to find suitable candidates, the job post I was sent listed the salary as “£65k + package.” I was successful in securing for the job but was made an offer today of £55k, plus a £6k car allowance and a potential 30% bonus (though I’ve been told they usually get 50-70% of that). 

For context, I’m currently working the public sector receiving £51k + £3k car allowance, but with 8 days more annual leave and a generous pension, but with less earning potential since the private sector will offer more promotion opportunities. 

The recruiter said to me on the phone that he’s not sure I have sufficient justification to request a substantial increase to the gross salary. I’m minded to reject the offer, but I don’t want this to discount me from future opportunities that this company and the recruiter, who is one of the best and most well connected in my region, will have in the future. 

Any advice on how to handle this tactfully? ",whyalwaysmoe_,0,0.5,0,1714398978,2024-04-29 13:56:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cfzq7i/how_to_reject_a_job_offer/,4,2024

1cfzl26,Isnew employment the only option?,"So I have been at my position with a small company since August. I came in with nearly decade of experience in same field. When I started they had just hired a woman with no experience in the field and had planned on moving her now that I was in and making her a support role. 

Fast forward to today. This same woman is now taking lunches, walks, and hours worth of closed door sitting with the CEO (who is my boss). She now walks around and acts like a manager/supervisor. She will send emails seemingly telling me what to do etc. 

My issue is this, I have no one above my CEO to talk to, next step is the board. Which from what I can tell the 2 times in recent memory people went to the board it went terribly for them. I spoke a out it with the CEO. Briefly and her solution each time is to talk to her myself. But I am not her named supervisor and that just creates more conflict. 

My issue is She is not my boss, there is clear favoritism being played here and everyone at the places sees it. But is it possible to get addressed or handled when the CEO is the source of it and has let this woman run rampant thinking she is manager/supervisor?
Am I just stuck? Only choice is new employment?

I’m trying to get a feel for what I can do if shit doesn’t pan out. My background is mostly clean besides credit but there’s definitely stuff that an agency could use to wash me from being a cop if they really want. 

I have no degree (might get a AA to be more competitive if I can swing it) , no work experience other than construction trades , no skills , and now I’m 2 years into transitioning. 

My options feel very limited and while I did electrical for a couple of years I didn’t build enough skills to be very marketable and it takes time to get good at it. I can’t go back to it now for obvious reasons.

1cfywre,How would you approach my situation?,"I (22M) am a final year university student who's not far off graduation and currently in talks with a couple of teams in my current organisation.

Almost two years ago now, I joined a massive tech company as part of a one year internship in marketing. It was great and I'd like to think I made a name for myself, at least regionally.

I was offered a part-time contract to remain with the company in a different marketing team alongside my final year studies. I am coming to the end of this contract now, and have expressed to my manager that I want to pursue other opportunities over remaining in this team as it wasn't something I see myself doing in the long term.

I am going to be negotiating with a couple teams soon and I'm not sure how to approach this. Basically my worth isn't in my experience but in my work ethic and abilities, so I don't want to short sell myself. Also this salary will set the standard for the rest of my life so I don't want to mess it up.

Graduate schemes in my company offer £35k base + bonuses. These don't require any experience, and having proven myself over the last two years I believe £40k-£50k is an appropriate band to aim for.

1cfyvge,How do I hire or retain a recruiter/staffing agency these days? ,"Hi all,

This may be a stupid question, but I feel as though I may be missing something regarding leveraging recruiters/headhunters for my job search.

In the past, and even as recently as last year, I never in my entire career actually paid for a recruiting service, nor did I actually reach out as a first move to a recruiting/staffing agency. A staffing agency or recruiter would always make the first move and reach out to me after seeing my resume online on some job board (LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, etc.). Other than directly applying to companies on the careers section of their websites, this has been the common paradigm that I leveraged to secure all of my past jobs for the past twenty years.

In hot hiring times, such as during the pandemic, recruiting/staffing agencies would contact me by the dozens via email or on my phone. However, this year, I am seeing a serious dearth of communication from these agencies. I hardly receive any emails, calls, or LinkedIn messages since the beginning of the year compared to years before.

I realize the job market is stale now, but I keep hearing people ask me whether or not I am working with a recruiter. I am a bit confused by this because it has been my experience that recruiters will make the first move and reach out to me, not the other way around...or am I not doing something that I am supposed to be doing? Should I be actively contacting ""executive search"" firms or consultancies and ""signing up"" with them? If so, then I would greatly appreciate a list of the top agencies that I should be contacting for tech-related roles in both hardware and software.

Also, I am targeting director or senior manager-level roles in product management/marketing.

Thank you.

1cfvl4l,I am so conflicted about choosing this as a career.,"
  Hi guys, I’m a South African [F19] and I’m about to start flight school soon. However lately I’ve been kinda annoyed by the idea of having a career as a pilot, as I’ve learnt about many inconveniences. Not to say wasn’t interested or excited (I was. I believed I loved aviation) but the salary and the mechanics of flying don’t make me happy nor do they interest me. I have funding available  and everyone is really supportive. I don’t want to do this but then I do.  I have other interests in mind like becoming a sea pilot or a ship navigator—perhaps archeology as well. Thing is, I’ve been rejected by the universities I’ve applied too. I am too prideful and ashamed to go to uni now. Moreover my family want me to pursue aviation. I can’t keep being indecisive. I start in May. Convince me into becoming a pilot (especially regarding potential salary in South Africa) because based on what I’ve gathered they are paid poorly.  

Side Note: I was considered an academic.  I’ve received aggregate awards etc. so my grades aren’t atrocious lmaoo.

1cfvhlj,I don't know what my boss want from me.,"It's been 6 months since I started working at a new company, the benefits are great, visa paid for them, computer, cell phone, remote work, in short, in the country I'm in, working for this company is paradise. The only thing that bothers me is my boss. At first she was very critical of my work, nothing pleased her, from the first week, she always said that she thought I was disconnected from work, that I had a huge lack of attention, that I was disorganized and clearly didn't take the company seriously. . I'm not going to lie, in the early days I didn't really take it seriously. But then that changed, everything she asked me to change, I changed. 

She even complained that the environment I worked in was distracting, that she could hear the noises from the TV in other rooms and finally, at the time I lived with a friend and didn't need to pay rent, but of course it was his house. Even that, I changed, I ended up moving to a house just for myself, it's very quiet and really, my work pace changed a lot, I became faster, more attentive and stopped making mistakes, because of this improvement, my salary increased and I was hired to help on another team while remaining on the team I'm on. However, nothing I do seems to please my boss. 

Now her complaint is that I get distracted working from home and I should work from the office, HR said I wasn't required to work from the office, so I'm still at home. She complains that I'm disorganized, but I even implemented spreadsheets to track documents and invoices, since last year she complained that several documents were missing (this was before I joined the company). I arrive on time, I only ""get distracted"" during my lunch break, I no longer make mistakes and I'm quick with my tasks, even that was a complaint for her, according to her, one day, I'll do 6 tasks in 1:30 hrs was too slow and I should be more productive. 

In January, I got sick while working and asked for a day off, she went to HR asking to cancel my contract, because it was unacceptable that I was not available to work, she even complained that the fact that I sneezed in a meeting was lack of work ethic. Now the last one was finding a typing error in the January document, instead of writing the numbers 4236, I wrote 4263 and honestly, I don't remember why I made that mistake (because if I had known, I wouldn't have made it). I really don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to play the victim, but I honestly don't know what this woman wants from me. She always compares me with another co-worker, according to her, this co-worker is a machine, better than her. But, every day that I work with this co-worker, I see her making mistakes every day or not being as attentive when responding to a client (she already asked for a payment of 5k euros from a client and it was for another), or sometimes she It takes hours or even days to confirm simple information.

1cfvbcr,"Should I give a hiring manager feedback on a preposterously bad salary negotiation, and truthfully write it on Glassdoor?","In the last weeks I was in a very intense application process for a social media manager position for a non-profit in Berlin. 

After the second interview (it was interview - test - interview) I finally asked about the salary. 

Instead of explaining their salary policy and structure (which they need to have as a non-profit), they asked me: ""What is the absolute lowest wage you could live on?""

I did not quite engage with the question specifically, and ended up saying a specific number I had previously chosen as negotiation basis with friends and colleagues. I found the question bizarre and did not quite know how to react. 

Instead of following that up with an actual negotiation and at least then explaining their policy, they ended the whole process then and there. 

They said, my expectations (completely sector average) was way above their range and that me posing that as a good salary made me an unattractive candidate. even when I started to stress out how the job and feeling happy there was more important than the money, and tried to negotiate ANYTHING with them, even non-monetary perks (like being allowed to take online language classes I pay for myself during work hours) they just blocked everything. 

I had traveled to Berlin from another city for this interview, which they were fully aware of. I had spend HOURS on that application process, which they were fully aware of. 

Yet, they also always knew, that the only thing that mattered to them was being not knowing the worth of my skills and work, and guessing a correctly low number? 

It just felt like a really bizarre mind game no one could possibly ever win. 

The final rejection call came that same day from the HR Manager of the organisation. I just completely lost  all composure because I could not believe it. previously they had disclosed that they would only interview the last competing candidate this week. I did not lose the competition. 

I lost a guessing game. 

I would like to give the hiring manager who was in charge of the whole process a piece of my mind, they had PLENTY of opportunity to communicate all that LONG BEFORE I had reached the very last stage of the application process, LONG before I had invested so much.

You cannot play mind games like that and call yourself a social enterprise.

1cfuoz8,How to say in an Interview that I'm waiting for other options?,"So I (F23) have been looking for a job for a while now. I graduated last year and stayed in my part time job until my move earlier this year. I got my bachelor's degree in a niche field, so for the most part it has been difficult.
Now finally things are looking up somewhat.

One of the first interviews I had was back at the start of December, even before my move. They said they'd get back to me in mid January. I thought great! That would coinside well with my move in February.

No answer, I only eventually got one when I sent a mail at the end of February. 
I had another interview, on site this time in mid march and they said ""We'll have answers for you in two to three weeks"". 

Well, I sent a follow up mail mid April and they apologised, but said they hadn't come to an agreement internally. 

A family member works at the company too, though not in the same department and from them I know that my future boss really wants to hire me. 

Now, naturally, as I didn't get concrete answers I kept applying for other jobs. 
And finally landed an interview for a job I never thought they'd invite me for because I thought I was underqualified. 
I got that interview at the 16th of May. 

Now finally today I got a call from the first company and the HR manager (they weren't present during the other two interviews) wants to meet me tomorrow. 

Now I've been told it is just about getting to know me and logically they can't assess my qualifications better than my future boss could, so I am not too sure what it is about. 

Anyway, what I want to ask is what do I tell them if they finally offer me the job and want an answer? 

Like, I want to wait the second job offer out, because it would be higher pay, closer to my location and overall not as chaotic.

What's the best answer to give that says I basically want to have some time to consider? 
I don't want to japrodize my chances at getting into the first company if the second eventually rejects me. 

But it's also still some time between then and now and I am hoping to start working in June, because money is getting tight, even with my parents' support. 
Is it acceptable to make the first company wait that long after they made me wait so long?

1cftszb,Wanting to change industries. Feeling lost. What other jobs can my skillset be used towards?,"Hey there,
My name is Jenny. I live in Northern California and have worked in the timeshare industry for almost a decade now.
Like it says, I feel really lost right now and feel like I could use some guidance.

I work in marketing and I am one of the top closers. I’ve worked timeshare marketing in person and over the phone through the years.
Basically what my job is, I persuade people to do a timeshare presentation and have been successful as a top closer.
I really do not like my work environment though :/ Even though I perform well, I strongly dislike it.

For years, I have been thinking of leaving the industry and trying something different. After doing the same thing for over a decade, I’d like to enter a different industry. I’ve always wanted to work some type of job in tech even but not sure what my skillset could be used towards.
 I want to do something different, I just have absolutely no idea what that would be because I have been in the timeshare industry for so long. 

 I look at my skillset and I am great at customer service, great at building customer relationships, great at persuading. I have made it to the top of this industry as my position as a marketer. 

What other jobs are out there that I could use this skillset towards? Ideally I would like a remote position. If anyone knows anyone hiring please let me know. 

Any advice is appreciated 


All the best,
Jenny

1cftgoc,Teenagers in my community keep dying - Note from a Youth Addiction Counselor,"I’ve never seen a generation so overwhelmed by the death of peers. As a high school addiction counselor, I have no idea how to address it at times.

A year ago: one of the referrals I received I never got to meet with. Kiddo was out in the middle of the night and got shot. Friends went to the hospital to see him, got bored, and left for a party. He died that night. I waited too long.

About 3 months after: a kiddo ready to go into the inpatient program my company offers completes suicide. We couldn’t get him in soon enough.

About 5 months after that: We had four kids pass in an accident where a kiddo referred to me (adamantly refused there was nothing wrong with his substance use) drove a car like a maniac and killed everyone inside including himself, no seatbelts used.

A couple weeks later, another kiddo driving recklessly. Lost his life speeding down the road. Friend of one of the girls lost in the first accident. I’m trying to help the girlfriend cope.

2-3 months later, another kiddo insisting “there’s nothing wrong with what I’m doing. It’s just fucking weed.” Stabbed to death. Most stab wounds were in the back as he attempted to run away. He had declined my services but his friends hadn’t. School is in shambles.

Last week: 12 year old runaway found dead in a home that a friends of my clients occupied. They have no idea who that kid was. How he got there. Just realizing their friend was a murderer.

Our youth jail is so full of murderers right now that folks that have beat people within an inch of their life and some rapists are only being put on house arrest. Bond/bail is near always available to them. We have a serial rapist that can constantly make bail after his crimes because his folks are loaded. The community is beginning to consider HORRIBLE methods of vigilante justice that I keep having to turn them away from.

How am I supposed to keep up with this community?

Background: I live in a small city overwhelmed with a growing population, people fleeing the west states after places like Cali and Washington have gone up in flames. Homelessness and crime has skyrocketed. Marijuana use has become recreationally legalized. CPS are overworked and underpaid, it takes 1.5 hours to reach someone on the central intake line. I made a 24 hour call once (kid came to school beaten with marks on his back) and they called me back just to say “I knocked on the front door of the home and they didn’t answer. I just left. Nothing we can do.”

1cfswuf,Should I go back to school? ,"Hi everyone I would need some advice, let’s start about me. I am currently working as a software engineer without a degree in a big corporation. I definitely don’t want to stay there forever. I got quite interested in AI and would love to learn a lot more about it and looking at the current economy I thought it might make sense to go back to school.

I probably want to stay in the software field, so I am not sure if this will be a huge set back for me or not.

1cfs87j,"I have very little working in my favor, but I need out of healthcare and my dream is a wfh job… what steps do I need to take?","
Hi all, 28yo CNA here! I’ve been working as a CNA the last 4 years, but I have a wide variety of things I’ve tried over the years. I’ve worked in manufacturing/maintenance, corrections, healthcare, and food service, as well as a brief few months as an insurance sales rep. 

I’ve been wanting to pursue nursing, but Covid has really killed my passion for healthcare, and I’m becoming burnt out. My back is not in good shape either, and I have planters fasciitis in one foot. 

I really am at a point in my life where I want more of a career that won’t destroy my body. I have a friend in another country who works from home managing a cell phone company’s social media account, and to be honest, something like this sounds perfect, working from home and not on the phone all 8+ hours of my shift. 

I’ve also looked into things like patient care advocates, care coordinators, even insurance adjusters, to stay in a similar field as what I’ve worked in, but even filtering for entry level leaves jobs that expect 2+ years of experience and/or a bachelor’s degree. 

Going to school for something might be an option in a couple of years, but the thought of having to continue working in healthcare while I wait to maybe get to go to school makes me want to cry. 

My wishlist for a good career to settle in to is: not terribly physically demanding, ideally WFH, room for growth and advancement and learning, and not call center type work. 

I understand that I may very well need to take a call center type job to break in to the WFH space, and if that’s the case, then I’ll manage. I’m also open to in-office work, but would prefer WFH, or the option to ultimately advance into a WFH role.

My problem is I have no real desirable skills outside of customer service. I have my CNA license and a life and health and casualty insurance producer license and that’s it. No other certificates or associate’s degrees or anything. 

Is what I’m wanting crazy unattainable? Can anyone just… point me in a direction? ",spade095,3,0.7200000286102295,6,1714372143,2024-04-29 06:29:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cfs87j/i_have_very_little_working_in_my_favor_but_i_need/,4,2024
1cfrqfl,How to document incase they fire me?,"Good afternoon, 

I work in the health industry where we work in the homes of the clients. I enjoy working with my client, but my supervisor has had a lot of stress, and I fell they have recently be projecting that onto our meetings. I can understand that I am not meeting there expectations, but I rarely see them, and they have began to make this feel like a hostile work environment where I don’t feel safe to ask questions, and then get reprimanded for not doing so, well also being expected to just figure things out. 

As important background, I (27f) have late diagnosis ADHD, a bachelors degree, and recently realized I might be on the autistic spectrum with high masking skills. With-in my field, I am not suppose to just figure things out, unless in emergency. My supervisor is suppose to give detailed instruction before I start implementing things, and I will feel unsure unless I fully understand what and why i am doing everything. My supervisor has shown frustration with my questions by snapping at me, calling me controlling, telling me to shut up because I have no idea what I’m talking about, or generally treating me coldly while treating others kindly. I stop questioning as much, and start waiting til I’m addressed to talk over the details. Now I am called lazy, and told I am making excuses, and not being heard when I try to explain that I have no hidden attention, and I am expecting them to guide me as is their position. In our field, your supervisor is also your mentor if you wish to further your career. While we might not be a good match as mentors, I don’t understand why we can’t work as professionals and why they are being demeaning towards me. With their comments, it feels like they are also trying to push me to quit, instead of firing me if I have created such a problem. 
 I try to be flexible and I feel like I continue to try to improve, but the hostile environment has begun effecting my work, making it more difficult to focus on my client and provide the most professional version of myself. 

I know that I should document this somehow, but the company is very small, with my supervisor and the administrative supervisor are best friends and owners, so if feels like a really difficult space to send an email and document the hostile environment. My direct supervisor even yelled at me in-front of the clients, and I have always tried to keep the interactions separate, but I had to take a 15min break (I don’t get breaks on normal days, even on my 8 hr days) to stop crying. The paying client was sympathetic but I hated them seeing that side of my professional self. 

I feel like if I got fired, I atleast want proof that I tried my best, especially because I have never been fired before. I don’t want to assume that my supervisor is intentionally being malicious, but I can not condone the behavior and I don’t want to pretend like nothing happened. Does anyone have advice for how to simplify this for a professional email? I don’t feel like we are beyond working together, but I don’t think they are willing to take me seriously because of the power dynamics. At this point, I want to still represent my best self, which means also standing up for myself and how I expect to be treated, even in criticism. I have always been understanding of criticism when I can understand it. But instead of providing answers, they provide short responses with sharp tones or irritation if I don’t understand.

 I think they see it as question them themselves, and their choices, which is not my intention. I understand with tax season, the stress of owning a company, and the struggles of management, they might be feeling overwhelmed and getting stressed by questions. But as a professional, you can not be demeaning to your employees. 

I do like to do my best in my work, so I look for further understanding. I always like to grow my knowledge, and they liked this when I first started, but now I’m feeling targeted because of it. I would look for a new job, but again, I respect and enjoy working with my clients and rarely see the management. As well as I have a lot of personal and family stresses for the time being that prevent me from being able to focus on applying for new jobs, while also being fearful of my security with my job now. I have never been fired and I feel really disheartens even having to ask this. 

Thank you to all who provide support or advice. ",Exact_Confusion_3126,1,1.0,0,1714370265,2024-04-29 05:57:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cfrqfl/how_to_document_incase_they_fire_me/,4,2024

I have a job offer that I have currently accepted to start at a large management consulting firm in the fall. I interned with the company last summer and enjoyed it. It is a great company, pays well, and by all accounts will be a great starting point for a career. As I inch closer to graduation and the ""real world"", I find myself thinking back to when I was younger and how I always imagined myself chasing a dream of becoming a football coach/working in football.

Obviously starting off a career in sports usually means working for little to no pay. I have applied to internships with NFL/college teams and teams and never really hear back. I had an first round interview for a year-long internship with an NFL front office, but didn't make the next round cut. I am unsure whether I should just take the consulting job, work a regular life, and figure out a way to volunteer at a high school or something on the side OR fully invest myself into coaching/find an entry level role somewhere.

The problem I'm facing is that there really isn't much room to move up in my industry in terms of compensation as an individual contributor. If I went into a managerial position I might get up to $175k base or so, but that comes with a lot of headache and long hours, and I don't want to get into management.

What could I possibly do? MBA is out of the question as I don't want more debt, and moving into management is also not a possibility. I just see myself as having 20 years left before retirement with not much upwards mobility and think I would be better served moving into a different field.

I moved on considering we have a busy week ahead of us. We are supposed to attend a conference this upcoming week. A coworker had mentioned his excitement and I told him I actually hadn't heard any details about it. I told myself I would wait patiently til Sunday for my boss to let me know. After not hearing from her, I reached out and asked. She responded with a link and told me to let her know if I had questions. I started excitingly looking through the link and stumbled upon the ""Attendee List"" which showed all my coworkers names except for mine, which I thought was strange but again tried not taking offense.

After contemplating and feeling bad for hours I started wondering if I was going to be invited at all if I hadn't asked. One thing led to another and I began wondering if other employees were receiving better treatment such as benefits/salary etc. I decided to go to my company's website and actually found my exact job description listed including benefits AND a salary ( which I am not getting either of I am making $22/hr no benefits) 

I am now wondering how to move forward, I dont see myself staying with a company who doesnt value me or have the decency to promote me to a job I already do. I am considering resigning but not sure how to approach the conversation. Pls help.

1cfq4nd,How do I get/hire a recruiter?,"Hi all,  


This may be a stupid question, but I feel as though I may be missing something regarding leveraging recruiters/headhunters for my job search.  


In the past, and even as recently as last year, I never in my entire career actually paid for a recruiting service, nor did I actually reach out as a first move to a recruiting/staffing agency. A staffing agency or recruiter would always make the first move and reach out to me after seeing my resume online on some job board (LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, etc.). Other than directly applying to companies on the careers section of their websites, this is has been the common paradigm that I leveraged to secure all of my past jobs for the past twenty years.  


In hot hiring times, such as during the pandemic, recruiting/staffing agencies would contact me by the dozens via email or on my phone. However, this year, I am seeing a serious dearth of communication from these agencies. I hardly receive any emails, calls, or LinkedIn messages since the beginning of the year compared to years before.   


I realize the job market is stale now, but I keep hearing people ask me whether or not I am working with a recruiter. I am a bit confused by this because it has been my experience that recruiters will make the first move and reach out to me, not the other way around...or am I not doing something that I am supposed to be doing? Should I be actively contacting ""executive search"" firms or consultancies and ""signing up"" with them? If so, then I would greatly appreciate a list of the top agencies that I should be contacting for tech-related roles in both hardware and software.  


Also, I am targeting director or senior manager-level roles in product management/marketing.

1cfq39w,Seeking Advice: Resigning from Job to Pursue Grad School,"Hey Reddit community,

I'm currently at a crossroads in my career journey and could use some guidance on navigating the next steps. I've decided to pursue graduate school starting in fall '25, which means I'll need to resign from my current job. However, I have a few questions about how to handle this transition gracefully. Your insights would be greatly appreciated!

Who should I approach first?
I'm torn between reaching out to my department head, who I have a close relationship with and report to, or my General Manager, who initially helped me secure the job. Any suggestions on the best approach?

How should I deliver the news?
Should I personally meet with them to discuss my decision before formally submitting my resignation letter, or is it better to do it the other way around?

What should I include in my resignation letter?
I want to ensure that my resignation letter is professional and leaves a positive impression. Any tips on what key points to include?

How do I request a well-written experience certificate?
I want to secure a comprehensive experience certificate that will be beneficial for my grad school applications. Any advice on how to make this request effectively?

Should I inform them in advance about needing Letters of Recommendation (LOR)?
I'm considering asking for Letters of Recommendation from my current employer for my grad school applications. Is it advisable to bring this up in advance?

I'm eager to hear your thoughts and experiences on navigating this transition. Thanks in advance for your help",Raxkot,1,1.0,0,1714364310,2024-04-29 04:18:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cfq39w/seeking_advice_resigning_from_job_to_pursue_grad/,4,2024

1cfoue9,"Backed into a corner, advice? ","I am an EA to the CEO of a small business. There are only 4 of us full-time. Since January, there’s been a lot of discussions around reducing operating expenses and she’s let go 2 of our freelancers in the last month. I was managing her inbox and saw an email from her to her lawyer talking about discussing termination logistics coming up at the end of May for a “she” who just signed her agreement last year- I was the only female who got hired and signed an agreement last year. She also mentioned taking another full timer down to part time or contract. This made me sick. I was so stressed and could barely eat. I have been on my toes since January and I’m just so over it.

Fast forward a couple of days later, the COO has a meeting with me. She said starting next week I will need to be on site 5 days a week to package and ship products. I was hired as a hybrid employee and only go into the office 2 days a week… and packaging and shipping product is not an EA to the CEO duty. This made me even more sick. My mental and physical health and overall well being is bad.

I spoke to the CEO about this the next day to clarify what I had been told and she told me that the business is doing really bad and having an EA is a luxury to her and based on business needs my role will need to change to package and ship
product from the office. I told her that I applied for a hybrid role and this is not something I signed up to do, I live an hour away and I would have never taken the job if it was full time
on site. On top of that, I have an autoimmune disease and I can already foresee myself ending up burnt out and sick. She responded by saying well if you don’t do that, then what are you going to do? 

The whole thing was crazy. I feel like they have backed me into a corner and want me to quit so they don’t have to lay me off. I have two interviews lined up this week as a part time server just down the road at a luxury hotel (something I am good at and can easily do) for around the same pay. Any advice? Should I just put my notice in, serve part time, take a break and plan for my next move?

1cfomey,Feeling apathetic about my career,"Hey all, looking for some advice, as I'm not sure how I'm feeling. 

I work in the sciences. I love my career choice and it's very rewarding. However, I haven't moved up the ladder much. 

I have 7 years of experience, but am still at an entry level title. This happened because after I was promoted my current title, the company got bought out, and then they made my promotion level, the entry level, and removed my former title. 

As a result, I'm getting paid more than people at the same title, but still have none of the benefits that come with a higher title. 

The thing too is that I work harder, have more experience, better education, and am more productive than people higher than me. But I'm still so far below where I want to be. 

We just finished the review cycle, and I got a raise slightly higher than inflation, as well as about 15-20% in long term incentives (which is rare), but I still feel ripped off. 

It's incredibly frustrating for me to be in this position with zero prestige, when I feel I deserve so much more..  

Thanks for reading.

1cfmf9k,Should I take a role off of my resume?,"I am a nurse and just graduated with a masters in nursing education in December of 2023. Prior to graduating, I had been looking for a job more closely related to my degree. I found a career/tech ed teaching job and started that in September of 2023. In November, I picked up a PRN position at a hospital to supplement my income and keep my nursing skills fresh while teaching. Unfortunately, this teaching position is not what I thought it would be and I am very unhappy. I have been back hunting for jobs since February. I am starting to wonder if I should leave my current teaching role off of my resume. The full-time job I had prior to the teaching job was an informatics role that I held for two years. If I left the teaching job out, my job history would look like this:

Hospital (part-time job)

* RN November 2023-Present

Post-Acute Care Facility (both full-time jobs)

* Nurse Informaticist September 2021-September 2023
* Nurse Educator - 1yr

Hospital (both full-time jobs)

* RN - 2yrs
* RN - 5yrs

I was thinking I could explain the gap as taking time for clinicals that I had to do for my master's degree. The last semester of grad school was quite busy with the practicum I had to do. Would that raise less of a red flag because I am not leaving a full-time education-related job?

1cfm9q1,2 Job Offers,"All:

I have two offers I'm considering. I'm a lawyer in a VHCOL area. I currently make $230K. I've talked compensation with my current firm and also interviewed with a second firm. Some insight: My wife is expecting and we should be welcoming a child next year. Here's what I'm decideing between: 

Current firm:
-$275K new base. 
- 5% on out-of-state cases I Iitigate since I'm the only attorney at the firm licenced in those states. The cases are valued anywhere between $200K-$2M
- Work from home
- no 401K match
- 12 week parental leave but pays: $4K per month. So less than fully salary. 
- I'm a partner so I get 1% profit from my practice group. Last year it was $110K, but this year might be more since we are doing really well and growing.

Firm 2: 
-$300K base 
- $100K signing bonus 
- promise or $100K end of year bonus at least 
- 3 days in the office, but they said they don't strictly enforce that
- 100% 401K match
- Full salary parental leave for 12 weeks. 

Part of me wants to go back to my current firm and see if they can agree to $300K base and full salary parental leave.  Then I'd likely stay. I'm generally happy at the current firm

1cfkijo,Quit with no notice and nothing lined up. Still fried. How would you determine your next move in a case like this?,"***TLDR:*** *Quit my job with no notice and nothing lined up to avoid an imminent threat of harming myself. Have a small amount of savings & a partner who has income to assist, but I'm torn between applying to new jobs immediately vs giving myself more time to recover before I start looking again. How would you decide what to do going forward in this situation?* 

The job was nottt the right fit. Stuck it out for two years, alternating between applying to other jobs and trying to ""make it work."" I took a week off earlier this month to recover from burnout, but by the end of that break, I was dreading the return to work so much that I started planning s\*icide. Called out the following week (last week) as well on sick leave and ultimately quit on Wednesday while still waiting on my doctor to get back to me about FMLA. I just couldn't stand it anymore, even the thought of returning months in the future. 

I'm already getting treatment for ADHD and severe anxiety. I've kind of suspected ASD too, but my doctor basically said he wouldn't diagnose me because there aren't many supports for autistic adults in my area, so he felt it would do more harm than good. I'm not asking for medical advice about any of those things, I just feel like it's important to the context. 

I have about, say, 3-5 months of savings as long as I can stretch it and no freak emergencies occur. I also have a partner with whom I split rent and utilities, so even once my savings run out, he can afford necessities (it will be tight, though). We don't have kids. He has debt, I don't, but he said that while it'll be tough, he'd rather me quit than deal with the mental health issues it was contributing to. I have two job interviews to attend tomorrow, but honestly, I feel sick thinking about them because I'm still not really in the best state of mind and still super burnt.

1cfjof4,How do I improve my reputation?,"&#x200B;

1. Last week ended badly on an engagement I've previously been doing well in
2. I have high-functioning autism
3. I earned the most money during my time there and brought back one of the largest, if not the largest, sums of money
4. Unfortunately, I mixed up some exam dates and slid off the project early, but didn't tell the manager until he found out from my counsellor snitching on me... I didn't tell my manager bc by the time I found out it was a mistake, my replacement had already been found anyway
5. The client also complained about me accidentally cc'ing an external customer of theirs into an email chain where they were discussing what they can do about the customer's account ( not much cos the client is incompetent and I know what I did wrong-- I should be more careful re email ettiquette next time
6. The manager also told me off for deleting some files and then recovering them from the recycling bin ... he pointed out it was a wider pattern of me doing things before asking/not informing people of things when they happen/ poor stakeholder management
7. All of those aren't material to the engagement except for the client complaint
8. I had to write my own self-evaluation and send it to manager. I was honest with the points I need to improve on:

Points to improve and how:

**1.** **Refresh Excel data analysis skills by attending courses provided by company**

2. **Communicate more with senior stakeholders before taking action** i.e., know when I am making an important decision and inform the senior stakeholders about it before I take action

3. **Stop assuming stakeholders know everything I do so that I can inform stakeholders when I change things** i.e., when I changed the statuses of some customer interactions on the spreadsheet over the weekend, I should have informed MANAGER X as he needed to ensure the client reporting was accurate day-to-day; I should have explained to MANAGER X too that sometimes clients promised to pay etc. and then a few days late would email me with a problem they found and refuse to pay, thereby changing their status

4. **Strike the right balance between problem solving myself and knowing when to lean on others for help** e.g., whilst I have been proactive in reaching out to XX employees to help me, I should have spent more time explaining the issue to them instead so the problem could be solved quicker

5. **Enhance ability to make perform well in time-restricted situations** i.e. through practice, ensure I do not sacrifice quality when finishing tasks to time restrictions",Visual_Collection_76,1,1.0,0,1714344897,2024-04-28 22:54:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cfjof4/how_do_i_improve_my_reputation/,4,2024

The explanation I was given for the company moving in a different direction was that I was not meeting expectations for my role and was not a fit for the company. I held the position for 10 months.

This is the first time I ever been fired from a job and had been working over the past 8 years to get into this role. Former employers reach out to me maybe once every year to see if I'd like to go back to them since they hated to see me leave.

So my most recent job I was let go because I wasn't doing a good job (I argue something else was the reason) but all the steps leading to the role and the people that constantly reach out make me think that I was actually doing a good job.

Anyway, I am now applying for managerial roles and have no idea how to go about saying I was let go from my most recent employer. I am man enough to admit if I was doing something wrong or broke company rules, but I was pouring 50+hr weeks in the off-season to build the foundation for the 75+hr weeks during peak seasons.

1cfiz2v,Soon-to-Graduate Data Analyst Seeking Remote Opportunity to Support Family,"Dear Reddit Community,

I am a final-year student majoring in Economics and Mathematics, with a strong foundation in Data Science and Analysis. As I approach the culmination of my academic journey, I find myself navigating a crossroads that demands your esteemed guidance and support.
Upon graduation, I am confronted with the pressing need to secure remote employment within the realm of data analysis. This necessity arises from unforeseen family circumstances that require my presence at home, where I hail from a small, remote town with limited job prospects. The majority of residents in my hometown are employed in government positions, leaving few diverse career opportunities available locally.

While I am open to traditional office environments, the urgency of my personal situation compels me to explore remote work options. However, being situated in a third-world country, the landscape for remote employment is not as well-developed, posing a significant challenge that I hope to overcome with your assistance.

It is with great humility that I seek your counsel on how I can secure remote employment opportunities from any part of the world, leveraging my skills and knowledge in data analysis. I am willing to adapt to varying time zones or any other factors, as long as the role provides a sustainable income and allows me to remain in close proximity to my loved ones, enabling me to support them during this critical time.
I implore this esteemed community to kindly share your insights, recommendations, or any potential leads that could assist me in finding a remote position that aligns with my qualifications and personal requirements. Your guidance and support would be invaluable as I navigate this pivotal phase of my academic and personal life, striving to balance my career aspirations with the urgent need to care for my family.

Thank you for your understanding, empathy, and consideration. Your advice could potentially change the trajectory of my life, and for that, I am eternally grateful.

1cfisol,What job can I get with just my degree? Please be realistic.,"I graduated 4 months ago in computer science. I did well academically by graduating with a 4.0 GPA, but I have yet to land a single interview for software developer positions. My resume isn’t impressive at all and I honestly don’t think I will ever get a job in tech having graduated from a low-ranked school with no internship or relevant work experience. It’s seems impossible in this job market and most likely in the foreseeable future with so many people graduating in CS with actual work experience.

In terms of my own work experience, I only had two jobs my entire life. I had one working in a hotel doing food service, which I did for about two years. I then left that job to attend community college and I didn’t get a job until two years after that. I then worked that second job at Walmart for only one year and I’ve now been unemployed for about four years since then. Basically I didn’t work at all during school and it took me 6 years to graduate.

Now that I’m approaching 5 months since graduating with a whole bunch of new graduates looking for jobs in May, I’m really wanting to get a good job with my degree. Any white collar job will be fine at this point. Is this even possible for me, or am I going to have to resort to working at Walmart or a gas station with a stem degree the rest of my life?

It's become clear that simply ""liking"" what I do isn't enough when the compensation isn't reflective of my efforts.  
  
Considering a career change seems daunting, especially when I've invested so much time and effort into 3D. However, I've realized that my passion lies elsewhere, particularly in management and working autonomously. I have experience in managing staff, and I thrive when working independently, away from constant interactions with new people.  
  
My dilemma lies in not knowing where to turn next. How do I transition from a 3D-focused career to something that aligns more with my strengths and preferences? Are there any fields or industries that value both management skills and a preference for solitary work?  
  
Additionally, if anyone has successfully navigated a similar career transition, I'd love to hear your experiences and any advice you might have. How did you identify your next career path? What steps did you take to make the transition smoother?  
  
Any insights or words of wisdom would be immensely appreciated as I embark on this journey to find a career that truly fulfills me.

1cfh1x5,Is three months too soon to start looking for another position?,"About three months ago I accepted a new position as a lab Driector in a small company. I relocated for this position, and during the week I moved here, before my official first day I got a call from boss letting me know there would be an involuntary 20% reduction in hours and  associated pay.

Thisn job as presented me was to build a new program within the organization and hire the team for that. Within a week of being there, one manager resigned and I absorbed his team and her responsibilities.  

As a lab director I have found myself spending a lot of time, doing lab cleanings and equipment maintenance, and lab experiments and sample processing.  

The financial stability also worries me, 😟. Getting anything ordered is slow and takes time. For over one month i have been trying to order a reagent ($1000) for an experiment, and haven't been able to, becuase my boss has been trying to find alternate suppliers for a cheaper cost. 

Should I give it more time or is it time to start looking for another position?

1cfgkwj,Need advice for moving up in the Medical Field,"I am currently a Paramedic working on an ambulance and am trying to decide on my next career move. 

Background: I have a college degree and originally worked in Sales, which I found to be unfulfilling. I decided to go down the route of becoming a Fire Fighter Paramedic, in an attempt to join a career that focused on making a difference in peoples lives. Fast forward, I finished Paramedic school and realized that I have more interest in Medicine than I ever thought I would. Fire Fighting no longer has the allure it had originally so I decided to start heading the direction of a PA. I have recently been hearing about other medical career pathways, and don't have many people to talk to in these various professions.

That all being said:

I am between PA, Nursing, Sonography, and maybe something else.

Sonography sounds like a career with much less stress than Nursing or PA, and it still seems to have decent pay. The schooling is similar lengths for each of these. I'd (like everyone else) like it to pay well and have less stress (as far as medical jobs go). I am a solid Paramedic and get a thrill out of making an impact, but definitely don't need the high levels of stress and variability that I have been getting lately as a Paramedic. 

Any advice from current Nurses, PA's, or Sonographers? Other medical professionals with opinions on other jobs? I am happy going to school for another two years, but would like to choose the right path before I get ahead of myself.

1cfgibh,"One year after graduation, still no offer after job offer got rescinded. Advice would be helpful!","I graduated last spring (spring 2023) with my degree in Data Science from a reputable, top university in the U.S. Originally, I had a full-time job offer before graduating in San Francisco for a mid-sized technology consulting firm as a technical consultant who would be working on software integrations for clients. The offer got delayed until February 2024, and in December 2023 it got rescinded due to a poor economic outlook for the firm. 

I graduated undergrad with 3 software engineering internships (start-ups) and 1 technical consulting internship (at the firm that rescinded my offer), however, I'm having no luck receiving offers and I'm worried that my prospects and time of getting a job in tech (ideally software engineering) are running out. I've been having interviews here and there but candidates with real full-time experience are overshadowing my technical knowledge so I'm not really sure what to do in this situation.

I feel that my candidacy seems worse than it really is to recruiters since they don't know that my full-time job offer was rescinded super late by just looking at my resume, so to them it looks like I've been interviewing for almost a year and still have not gotten an offer. Is it a red flag that I haven't been employed for a year after graduating, or do the current circumstances of a poor tech job market give me a little leeway to continue searching and interviewing?

Not sure what to do here, any advice would be very much appreciated!

The job description sounds like a good fit for my skills and interests, and the salary/benefits would be a little bit better than what I have in my current job.

Some of the complaints included toxic managers, structure being pretty chaotic, overworked employees, no annual raises, etc. 

It's a pretty consistent pattern of bad reviews, including recent ones. It's making me very hesitant to move forward with interviews, especially since I'm not desperate for a new job and am just casually looking around.

During my year at the company, I've observed this individual's persistent unhappiness and unprofessional behavior. They frequently arrived late (15-20 minutes) and would often vocalize their frustration with profanity, disregarding our requests to keep their voice down, even when reminded that we share a floor with senior management. Their attitude and behavior have created a draining and toxic work environment.

1cfez8x,Should I quit? ,"Hey Reddit,

I'm 24 and from a developing country. I was super lucky to get a remote job at a successful US startup. My title is pretty unique, but essentially, I work with sensitive data and manage projects. Otherwise, I have a little experience in tech support and softdev.

I make enough to save about $1k each month. The job could really open up doors for me later, the company's doing well on the market and offers great stock options. If I stick around for another few years, I could walk away with at least $300k. It's a crazy amount of money for my family or someone from my country. 

But, honestly, I'm really struggling. The night shifts, overtime, crazy responsibility, bad management, constant challenges etc. On top of that, I'm still dealing with depression and anxiety, which this job just makes worse. I barely have time to chill, travel, watch movies or anything else.

I really want to stick it out to make some money, invest, help my mom retire comfortably, and not stress about finances down the line. But part of me wants to quit so badly, and I feel super lost. Every day my mental and physical health is degrading, and I don't know if it's worth it.

What would you do in this situation and why? Would it be crazy to quit? I know I'm the only one who should know the answer, but I wanted to hear your thoughts and see your perspective. I know how mental health is important, but is it more important in this situation? It feels like I'm trading four years of my life for this money. Does not sound so good... Or does it?

I work in insurance, as a  multi lines claims adjuster.

Been with the same employer for just over 20 years.
Make $96k, plus buyout for personal time and vacation at end of year gets me just under $100k.
Have benefits, pension and life insurance.
Get along with co -workers well.
Company has gone through a change in last couple years and I'm not crazy about the direction they're going and the changes they're proposing.

Have an opportunity to move to an independent adjusting firm, where I could very likely make $150k, or more.
Some $$ for benefits and some $$ towards RRSP.
Know the firm is great to work for.
Would have to get my own life insurance.
Personal and vacation time not an issue.

1cfcjgl,Don’t ever burn bridges at work.,"So throughout my career I’ve had about 6 jobs over the past 15 years. At 4 of those jobs I worked for over 3 years. Ok, at every job, I didn’t 🔥 any bridges, ensured that I left in excellent terms one time even after an unfair PIP, and usually told them I was leaving for better opportunities. Now, I needed a second job, I have debt I’d like to pay off quickly.

In the past week alone, I told 3 of my most recent jobs that I was looking for extra work. All three immediately offered me a job (no interview or anything and one was actually at the place where I got an unfair PIP, they realised shortly after I left that my colleague was the problem) , paying more than I was making and one offered more than I am currently making. 

I am very lucky, but I also make sure I never ever leave people stranded or burn bridges with the bosses and organizations . I invest in work relationships and make friends everywhere, I do everything to develop soft skills and healthy boundaries so people feel safe with me. I know not everyone is an extrovert or a highly friendly person but soft skills are very important especially if you want to build a Successful career. Being memorable and mentionable helps you network even if you are not  there. And when people want help, they will remember your name. It’s like a form of networking while you sleep. 

All they to say, I got offered 3 appropriate positions hours after 1-2 personal phone calls. 

TLDR- don’t burn bridges.

1cfc6is,Quitting a Job in this climate,"Hello all!

I wanted to write for some input on quitting my job. I currently work in an unprofessional “corporate” environment (a call center). I’ve been here for 3 years now. I’ve had my ups and downs with the company but since I began pursuing my MBA I’ve determined this is not the environment I should be in.

To elaborate on a few of the issues:

- Managament tries to enforce unethical policies 
- I’ve been sexually harassed by a superior and a subordinate within the last year 
- The execution of pay raises was done poorly, in which people who just were hired are making the same as those who have been there for years 
- Any issue raised to HR goes directly to the legal dept. (HR can never do a same day meeting)
- People come to work noticibly high and drunk 
- Our attrition is through the roof, yet they do not want any input on how to improve (I’ve tried)
- There’s been huge layoffs in the past 3 months. Only those “exceeding expectations” have remained 
- In its current culture, nobody feels as if their job is safe
- Does not offer any nonfinancial or indirect benefits (There’s no WFH, Education reimbursement, snacks, flexible working hours, drinks, etc.)

Truth be told, I’m at a point where I feel miserable being there. I have my assigned duties but I honestly finish everything within an hour then begin studying for my program. 

My question is: does it make sense to quit? I’m at a point where I really don’t want to be there. My only obligation is paying for school, which this job enables me to do. I’m at a point where this is where I spend my time for a paycheck, yet I do not feel as if I’m advancing myself.

Sounds a little crazy, but he’s open with his books with me, and he consistently brings in over 10-15k a week before materials, after materials like 7-9k with just me and him, on proper payroll through Quickbooks.

And here’s where I feel trapped, if I were to even put in a 6 month notice….he couldn’t find someone to replace me, because he has anger issues and we do top notch quality work and charge top notch prices, which if I leave would definitely make him have to hire some random who would not care as much as I do and he would very quickly lose so much work he’d be filing bankruptcy.

Hello everyone,

I am in my 5th year of hospitality and am starting to feel uneasy.

I started as a doorman at a 4 star resort, moved my way to front desk, and moved 100 miles to work at a world renowned golf resort. I am closing on my last rotation of a management program. I helped manage large banquets teams, the front desk and will be helping manage a busy restaurant  starting next month. 

I am a naturally outgoing and enthusiastic person that loves meeting new people and learning more about their story. I was wanting to go into journalism when I was in college but turned to this path instead. I love style, talking about progressive topics and encouraging my fellow colleagues to be their best.

However, being back in this front desk spot seems like I am shackled again. Especially since working in banquets where everyday felt like an adventure. 

If anyone has any words of advice, I would appreciate it. I feel like 5 years in luxury hotels may be enough, but I had aspirations of being a GM.

1cfbpep,Why do companies interview candidates they don’t intend to possibly hire?,"There are companies out there that I will not apply for positions. Why? Because they like to waste time and resources.

Example 1: I interviewed 3 times at Company A for 3 different positions at 3 different times. I thought I did well, but no offers. Didn’t think anything at the time until the 4th interview for the 4th job. Unlike the others, this was a phone interview. The hiring manager was upfront and told me that she already had someone in mind for the position but had to interview and didn’t want to waste too much time.

Example 2: I showed up on-site for an interview as scheduled by a recruiter. The hiring manager was surprised that I was there and hastily set up an interview in the cafeteria. She couldn’t even look at me straight in the eye when answering my questions.

Example 3: I went to an on-site interview with Company C. Interviewed with several people. They seemed excited about moving forward with my candidacy, but the company required that I take a personality test. The test was geared toward clinical positions and the position I applied for was not clinical. I answered the best I could thinking that my skills, experience and team camaraderie were more important. Wrong! Supposedly because I didn’t pass the personality test I didn’t get the job.

This all seems like such a waste of time not only for the candidates, but also the hiring team. If there is someone that the hiring manager wants to promote or otherwise move into the position then they should be able to do so.

My parents had guilted me to join the family business after my masters degree. I had good intentions when I joined, and I was happy to help. As soon as I joined, my siblings started bullying me at work. I was humiliated and mocked publicly, and I endured this for 2 years. 

I had multiple job offers during those years but refused to join them because my speech started stuttering from anxiety and I was embarassed. So instead I worked for my uncle's small side business. I experienced people slacking off and had some problems with the current person managing the business who also slacks off and didn't want me to interfere with the work culture. 

I had one year of experience in audit elsewhere prior to all of this. 

I had my life planned out when I finished college and before I turned 30, I had originally wanted to immigrate to a different country like Canada after building work experiences. In my earlier days, I even had great interview offers from prestigious firms but somehow didn't work out. 

Now I turned 30... I really don't want to include my family business on my resume or linkedin, but 4 or 5 years of my work experiences were from there. Especially linkedin, where everyone can see my records... and my family can see where I will be working. I had stayed in the toxic work environment for far too long. All I have is one year of audit experience that I can talk about, and I don't think I can immigrate or job hunt with that experience alone at the age of 30.

1cf97d2,"My boss said he ""doesn't know my official job position"" ","I was hired by a vacation rental company in 2022 as an assistant after bumping into the owner at a Fedex when she needed help using the printer. Afterwards she offered me a job as the company's assistant and I have been happily employed since. She recently sold the business to a new owner in 2023 and the transition was messy to say the least. Communication with new owner was minimal and left me wondering what was going on most days.
Fast forward to now, I have built a decent relationship with newly hired staff and things have been flowing smoothly. This weekend the new company owner is in town for a big conference in our city. He invited all employees out for a drink at a live music event. I attended although I have only met him once previously and have spoken to him a total of 3 times. (All my communication is through the regional manager because owner lives out of state)

As employees from other locations arrived the owner started introducing everybody. When it came to me he said "" And this is _____. Im not really sure what her job position is, I guess she's a jack of all trades."" Obviously I was shocked and almost embarassed by the comment. My coworker stood up and said "" _____ gets shit done around here!"" It felt like a slap in the face. I work extremely hard, usually 6 days a week sometimes going into overtime. I do everything as far as managing housekeeping, inspections, guest services etc. 

Im being paid $22/ hr with absolutely zero benefits, no insurance and now the owner claims to not know what I do for his company?

I’ve always thought of HVAC being something I’d be interested in and in theory a career that will always be in demand because of where I’m located. I’m in the state of Florida and my thoughts are because of our high temperatures all year long I know if someone’s AC goes out it’s going to be fixed asap.

My main thing is fixing and flipping vehicles right now so I’d say I’m pretty mechanically inclined and have a good mind for problem solving. 

I’m curious if this is a career I should pursue that could eventually lead to me being a business owner or at least long term growth?

And if it is, what’s the best way to go about getting into this industry. I know I need to go to school but is there any potential a company would pay for me to go to school while I work for them etc..?

What’s the best way to start out? Union, apprenticeship, school etc?

if you had to do it all over again and kind of a game plan career wise from start to 5-10+ years from now?

1cf7ayd,Received Job Offer but worried about employment verification,"So I recently received an amazing job offer for a really great company a month after I was let go from my previous position for little to no reason. My official title was Project Coordinator however my responsibilities quickly aligned with those as a Project Manager as I was responsible for managing the project entirely. My role served entirely as a project manager and I was often referred to as a project manager by several managers. My reference at my old job, who they already spoke too , attested that I operated and performed as a project manager.   

The company I recently signed an offer letter with is conducting an employment verification. And I’m worried that sinc le I listed my title as Project Manager on the resume and application they’ll rescind my offer my old company HR comes back and states I was a Project Coordinator. 

Since I know it’ll be a flag, on the employment verification I went ahead and listed my title as Project Coordinator / Manager. My thought process for doing this is I want to acknowledge as soon as possible that the titles were used interchangeably at my old company. 
And my argument, if my new enployeeer comes back and asks will be that while my title was Project Coordinator my role within the organization served as Project Manager. And I listed project manager in my resume to reflect the industry standards of my responsibilities (which is true!!!!)

But I am just SO worried my new company will rescind their offer over this job title discrepancy, I’m freaking out here guys!!!

I am looking for a change and I want to apply for jobs at a company that has a lot of job postings in my area. I want to apply for a C++ dev positions there. The thing is - I have no previous professional experience with C++. In reality, I've never stopped improving my C++ skills since I graduated (2years), I'm rather comfortable (as one can be) with C++, I keep occasionally reading books about this subject and almost daily exercise it- during my weekends and my work lunch breaks/before actively working at workplace.

I am currently working as a python software/automation engineer for 2years now and prior to this full time job I have two experiences working part time (20h/week) as a C# dev and Linux admin for a year each.

My question is: how to highlight the C++ skills in CV? Should I throw in a bullet point into my current work experience about individual development or something?
I am considering junior positions, but realistically even for this, if I was a recruiter and saw C++ skill on CV without any other mention in all past work experiences, it'd consider it to be a red flag.

1cf5mqv,SAHM looking to reenter workforce - MPA and Marketing undergrad. Confused. ,"A little background, I have been a SAHM for nearly 4 years now and I’m looking to reenter workforce.  I graduated during the pandemic in from Indiana University. As an international student, I was on a visa that didn’t allow work. I was also pregnant with a high risk pregnancy around graduation time. I decided to focus on my child while my work authorization came in. 

I have a business undergrad with marketing focus. Progressive 3 years marketing experience in pharmaceutical and fmcg. Then I did my masters and my career break started. My concentration was health policy. I was aiming to transition from corporate marketing to health policy and consulting roles but that didn’t work out. Anyways, I have a 4 year career gap, I feel so confused on how to get back on my feet. I keep getting rejected to all the jobs I’ve applied to so far. 

Should I get another masters degree? ( worried about funding as I have two kids now- not much family support and childcare costs are insane). 

I’m also confused about what field I should focus on at the moment. Data science is all in rage. I even considered law at one point. Or should I do finance masters? 

I am very confused as evident by my rant. I was good with statistics and loved quantitative part of my MPA. I have always been on scholarships since high school, the thought of student loan scares me as I have little support in terms of childcare as well. Currently husband earns enough to run household but not much more than that. What do I do? Which field would be easier to get into with 4 year gap? I aim to make at least $80k to have financial independence. Looking for advice on how to make this transition and what would be best for my future career and kids.

1cf5gym,Should I start my career at a consultancy or at a fast growing company? ,"Hi, So I am a starter/junior in field of supply chain management and logistics. Long story short I have 2 offers that i need to decide on soon.

One is a large company that is doubling its size in the near future, the pay they offered is very competitive and generous for starter. The position however is operational compared to my strategic background, but it does offer growth opportunities and they told me I look promising to them. This is unsure however as there are no fixed timelines or promises.

Another is a consultancy with a decent education package, personal car and interesting projects at different companies every 8 months. The pay however is significantly lower and ill reach the starter salary of other job offer in 1.5 years, after 2 years (from starting) however there is a significant guarantee in salary jump.

In general i want to be able to work remotely in the near future so consultancy sounds better. But i do lack the hands on operational experience so the other company does sound better because of it, plus, with this high starter salary i could potentially be earning a lot more in 2 years compared to consultancy. So would you go for a basic role at an established company with a potential to move to management and higher positions within 2 years (hopefully) or would you go for consultancy traineeship and why?

The environment is incredibly toxic, no longer even allowed to use the restroom during work while on the assembly line which means being prepared to not use the bathroom for two hours. Mistakes are not tolerated at all we are being threaten with sanctions for making mistakes, this is a legal action in this country and it goes on some sort of permanent record. Possibly as a result of this job (or accumulation over a lifetime) I suffer from constant pains on hands, arms, shoulders and back. On my days off I recover and pains go away then I go back to work and it all comes back.
I really hate my job but any other job I get will mean a pay cut of at least 650 net per month.

My bills are low (350 a month) and the income is good for this country (1400(14x year) after taxes 27k per year before taxes). 
I have employer provided health insurance and health care here is incredibly cheap going private. 
I own my condo right in the middle of down town in my hometown close to Lisbon. 
I am graduating this year from an undergraduate program in European studies from my country’s open university. 
I am 37 and all my life have done unskilled labor. Worked as a janitor, in beverage distribution and now making cars in a factory.

I speak fluent english and have lived in the USA for a decade. There is only one place in Europe I can go where I don't have to learn a language and that is Ireland.
To say there is a housing crisis in Ireland is putting it mildly, there is basically no housing in Ireland to speak of. I wouldn't mind having renting a room in a shared home and I don't particularly care for buying another home or getting into another mortgage so renting a room would be ok with me. There seems to be employment in Ireland but what I am really interested in is a plumbing or hvac apprenticeship.
It doesn't appear that my degree is good for much anywhere, the plan was always to get a masters in information sciences but even to do that I would have to quit my job because of my schedules.

1cf4p6v,"I hate the work culture at my new job, all I want to do is quit, what should I do?","I need to know if other people have had a similar experience as me, I’m so lost and defeated right now.  
  
So for a quick backstory, I’ve recently started a new job (3 months ago) in tech that is a very social role as well. Prior to this I’ve worked in finance for almost 3 years, and have a bachelor’s degree in finance, that basically sums up my experience, I’m 24 for context.   
  
So back to this job, everything is obviously very difficult to learn since I don’t have any experience in tech, but so far I think I like the actual tasks. My problem however is that I hate this workplace and the work culture they have at this company. I have constant anxiety and hate going to the office every day, I never felt this way at my previous job. I’m now working for a middle sized company that has been around for 50+ years so it’s definitely not a startup but the office I work at definitely gives a start up vibe. The HQ is not located in the same city I work in, and we are only around 10 people at this office. All my colleagues are very nice and have made me feel really welcomed from the start, the problem is honestly me.   
  
I just don’t fit in, we are all around the same age, but I'm very different from them. They always talk about things I have literally zero interest in and usually just sit there quietly when they talk. I've tried talking to them and engaging, but it’s so draining and I can just feel all my energy go away as soon as I engage in their conversations. We also work in an open floor plan office, which is fairly small, everything is in one room. And I’m a person who needs quiet around me to focus on my work, but they talk all the time and are loud, which results in me not being able to focus at all. Everytime I leave the office I just dread going back there again. And the company and my office always have a bunch of activities and after work plans, which I hate. I just want to go to work, do my thing, and go home and spend time with my boyfriend and my family. It’s more than enough to spend 9 hours a day with my colleagues. But this whole company is dead set on having to be involved in after work activities and it’s a big part of their work culture, always big trips and retreats planned as well. Normally I wouldn’t mind this, but It’s just so draining being around these people, I have zero in common with them.   
  
All they want to talk about is fancy overpriced food and restaurants they want to go to or have visited, all the fancy activities they like, and going out drinking. While I hate talking about food and all the shallow things they love. I wish I could just quit and never go back again, but since I’m young with no real experience yet, I just know the job search is going to be a pain. I literally applied for 300+ jobs to get this one. And I just can’t stand the thought of sticking around until I find something new.   
  
I can’t recognize myself anymore, I’m always unhappy and full of anxiety, which is so far from my normal self. Please tell me if someone else has had similar experiences? I just feel like I'm the problem with no solution. ",Own-Ad9260,3,1.0,5,1714305475,2024-04-28 11:57:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cf4p6v/i_hate_the_work_culture_at_my_new_job_all_i_want/,4,2024

1cf3ke7,Chose a useless degree - should I drop out of university before I get into more debt?,"DISCLAIMER: This is gonna be a long post where I go into my degree/career choices over the past few years to give better context since my situation is a little different from the norm, so more tailored advice can be given.  
21M BSc Psychology student in his second year at a good UK uni. Came into this degree wanting to help people by becoming a clinical psychologist. Figured I’d go on to do a Masters since that is pretty much required to go anywhere in the field of psychology - a Bachelors in Psychology on its own is useless. The problem is though, my personality has changed so much from when I was a 17-18 year old choosing this degree to now. During my first year of uni I got some experience in counselling (e.g., by volunteering at suicide hotlines) and also did research apprenticeships since research is another career path psych majors follow. All these experiences taught me that a career in psychology is just not for me, even though I find the subject interesting. So I asked the careers advisors at our uni what other potential paths I could take and they brought up marketing as a corporate route psych majors could follow. This was something I’d never previously thought of and considering I was completely stumped for options, I figured why not. So I got some part-time marketing gigs over the summer and found that this career seemed somewhat enjoyable due to the creativity it affords. I wouldn’t go as far as to say I’m passionate about marketing since its corporate, manipulative nature is a little unappealing but the creative side was enticing enough that I figured this is a field I could tolerate doing as a career for the rest of my professional life.  
So before the start of my second year at uni I suspended my studies and took a gap year, working as a full-time copywriter during that year, entering into the industry as a complete noob to copywriting. It took a lot to convince my parents to do this since they were hell-bent on me going to uni, but I managed to reach a compromise by assuring them that once my gap year working in the copywriting industry was done I would go back to uni. I chose copywriting as it lent itself well to my passion for writing, whilst simultaneously being a career that had the potential to be lucrative if I worked hard enough. Nevertheless, the first agency I worked at as a copywriter paid awfully and overworked me to death, but I put up with it since I enjoyed the actual work I was doing and was in desperate need of work experience. 7 months in I managed to land a copywriting gig at another company that paid much better, and worked there for the rest of my gap year. However, the end of my gap year was approaching and ultimately I had to go back to uni as I’d agreed with my parents. Fast forward to now, I’m near the end of my second year of uni and I can’t help but feel like I’m wasting time and money being here still doing this psych degree. I have no interest in pursuing a career in psychology any more. Copywriting is a career that does not require a degree at all to be successful in (I myself am proof of that with my year of experience working at agencies as a copywriter with no degree to my name) - instead your success is determined far more by your portfolio, which is something you build by accruing more work experience. So ultimately, for me to succeed as a copywriter, what I actually need to be doing is not plunge myself into further financial debt with this degree, and instead focus on getting more work experience.  
However, my family argues that I should still focus on getting a degree for stability in case the copywriting gig doesn’t work out. And tbf, I can see the merit in this argument as the copywriting industry is quite unstable - I myself experienced this when working as one wherein the first agency had to lay off a bunch of people cos they just could not afford to pay them anymore. But even so, the job prospects for a bachelor’s degree in psychology are trash. So whilst I can understand going to uni can set you up on a more stable life path, I don’t really see how a Bachelors in psychology on its own can fulfil that. University can only set you up well if you’re studying a degree that is actually deemed valuable by the economy and job market, such as Computer Science, Medicine, Engineering etc. And the cold hard truth is that a BSc in psychology simply does not fit this bill. I don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket by solely relying on copywriting as my career path since it can be quite an insecure profession at times where your long-term future can end up in the air. The thing is university debt is no joke, and I sometimes feel like I’m screwing up my future financially by staying here. My course is 3 years. I’m nearing the end of my second year so I have basically just over a year left. I’ve already accrued 2 years’ worth of debt and I’m wondering if I should get out while I still can before I add another year of debt by entering my final year.  
The problem is, aside from pursuing copywriting again, I’m not sure what else I would do if I drop out. I really don’t know what to do. I’ve considered maybe just getting a physical labour job for stability, and look for another copywriting gig in the meantime. I’ve also considered switching university courses but I have no clue what to swap to. All of the actually useful degrees like computer science or medicine completely bore me, nor do they play into my strengths/skillset. I know I would be miserable in those careers. Not to mention I’d just be adding more to my debt. But considering university is a huge investment of money, time and effort I’ve realised it’s only worth going if you’re actually going to get a high return on investment that outweighs the debt you’d go into via a useful degree like CompSci - something I wish I had realised when I was a depressed, suicidal 17 year old choosing his degree with no clue what he wanted in life. Even now I’m still not sure. If I do drop out, I need a solid backup plan of course, but I have no clue what that looks like, and I’m not sure if I should just stick through the rest of my degree and get it over with. I’m already over halfway through anyway. Helpful advice from those who maybe were in a similar position but emerged out the other side ok would be appreciated.  


Careers advisors at both high school and university have told me that it's not so much what specific degree you're studying that matters, but rather where you're studying at and that you just have a degree, regardless of what it is. I'm studying at a decent university which is ranked no.5 in my country (UK), so the where is somewhat covered. Moreover, since I'm not adamant about studying in a field that's related to my degree (hell I went off to do a placement year in a completely unrelated field), I wonder if that changes things regarding the utility of my psych degree. The reason most people argue a Bachelors degree in psychology is useless is because it won't get you anywhere in the field of psychology itself - you need to pursue a masters as well; a bachelors is just a stepping stone. However, since I'm willing to work in an unrelated field such as marketing for the rest of my life, I'm wondering if just having a degree, even if it is a psych degree is good enough. Some companies in their job listings don't specify that you need a SPECIFIC degree to apply, but just A degree, so I guess a psych degree technically fulfils that?",Sorry-Worldliness665,0,0.5,8,1714301279,2024-04-28 10:47:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cf3ke7/chose_a_useless_degree_should_i_drop_out_of/,4,2024

1cf30uf,Struggling to Get Interviews in Silicon Valley California,"I recently moved to Silicon Valley in the United States. I don't have much experience with American companies in the software field, but I have been coding for the last 10 years. The languages I know are not very preferred here, so I am currently switching to the frameworks that are preferred here (which won't take too much of my time). When applying for jobs, I get about one interview per week, but in my home country, I almost always got interviews from most of the places I applied to.  
I suspect that my CV does not fully reflect my skills. It seems to me that Silicon Valley HR departments don’t take your portfolio seriously unless you are from a university like Stanford or have worked at a FAANG company (or their systems automatically discard the CV right away). Could my theory be correct? Or is there something about the culture here that I'm missing?

1cf1x45,What should one do when your RO does not give much clarity and direction to a problem? ,"Hi! I am asking on behalf of a friend. 

My friend has rejoined his company which he had left 2 years ago. The second stint has been great for him so far; taking up new areas of responsibilities and he is working under the same Reporting Office (A) whom he has worked with previously. Though A has been his RO, he has been learning more from another higher-up throughout his stay in the company (B, who is more senior than A). Reason being, B has vast knowledge of the industry and is able to provide insights to problems and issues faced. 
*Just for context, A reports to B and B reports to HOD. 

Recently, B has decided to leave to join the Parent company. Ever since my friend got to know of B’s impending departure, work emails have been sent to both A and B to seek advice on certain matters. A will either not reply to the email, or merely say that HOD will decide on the outcome verbally. 

My friend has thought of informing B (she was the one whom my friend reached out to for his second stint back into the company), but held back. My friend is stuck. And he knows that it will be hard to seek A’s opinion on matters in future - A will likely not reply to his email or share her thoughts with him verbally, without much clarity and direction on the topic of discussion. 

Hope to hear from the Reddit community on how he should go about to navigate/overcome this to progress his career.

1cf1sgu,"Seeking Advice: Building a Side Income Tailored to My Skills and Personality""","Dear Community   


I’m reaching out to you all in the hopes of gaining some support and advice.  I’m 34 years old, a native German, and have been living in Germany since birth. My professional background is in industrial engineering with several international experiences and an intercultural upbringing. Since graduating, I’ve worked for various large and medium-sized companies, gaining extensive knowledge of business processes. My focus has always been on process and project management, and I’ve never been tied to a specific industry.  
  
Personally, I would describe myself as an open, patient, and rational individual. I read a lot, stay updated on current affairs daily, and have knowledge in psychology and politics. I always strive to identify opportunities rather than immediately focusing on challenges and risks.  
  
Currently, I have about 10-20 hours per week outside of my main job and would like to develop a side income. My goal is to achieve a net hourly rate of around $40/Euros. It doesn’t need to be a continuous stream of income; I’m willing to invest time upfront if there’s a high probability of a good return.  
  
Unfortunately, I’m completely lacking ideas on how to approach this, so I’m seeking experiences, tips, or any other information that could help me.  
  
I would be extremely grateful for any help or advice you could provide. Perhaps you’ve been through similar situations or know of suitable sources for side incomes that match my personality and knowledge.  
  
Thank you in advance for your support!

1cf16mr,Can’t leave this limbo. I want to get out of the best gig I’ve ever gotten. ,"Dumb luck I got a good paying, right at the same point where I really stopped caring about my life. 

For over two years I’ve been telling myself how much I want to get fired. 

I’ve gotten close to just up and saying “I quit”. 

This is the only thing I feel that’s stopping me from giving up in life for good. 

And I want to give up at life for good. 

I hope something major comes along that will force the company to lay people off. And that I will be one of them. 

I hate myself and I hate how long this life continued. 

Since the year start I’ve been really half assing my work and I’m feeling like I’m incompetent. 

I know no matter how long I’ll stay I’ll always be out of the know and I’ll never be able to say I’m confident in anything. 

I’m under qualified, likely a diversity hire, not even a bachelors with a salary that’d close to 100k. 

NYC so I have no hope of being able to move out. 

This damn thing, everything about life is only for people who have people in their lives. 

I live my life moment to moment bouncing from one distraction to the next. 

Don’t give me any infantilization when I go ahead and mention that I’m 22. 

I’ve been telling myself friends are a thing of the past since I was 18. 

No relationship no life experiences cause this person can’t have it and doesn’t deserve it. 

There’s nothing in life for me aside from distraction. Substances, using food as a distraction. 

I will not change, so I’ll keep telling myself I’ll never know how people live. I have animosity that I can’t get rid off. 

The only reason why people do these things and have these things is because they’re wired up differently.  I mean that in relationships, waking up, having their life in order etc.   

I haven’t put any money in my savings account since the year began.  I don’t want a future for me. 

For my 22nd birthday I wished that I got fired but I didn’t.

For past 4 years, I put all my focus on building my resume to apply to grad school and now I’m feeling like it’s not for me anymore.

Maybe going back to school will give me some clarity but for now it’s a complete blur. It’s also a big $$$ investment and I’m scared of making the wrong choice.

I would greatly appreciate hearing from those who have transitioned into management roles about their personal experiences, whether management was worth it, lessons learned, and any regrets.

I have dedicated the past 20 years to IT, excelling as a senior engineer for over 15 years. However, I’ve hit a compensation ceiling, and unless I change titles, I’m stuck. Yet, stepping into a managerial role would mean sacrificing my practical and technical skills, which have been my forte. This concern is compounded by the fear of losing marketability if the transition doesn’t pan out.

The current director of my organization is stepping down, creating an opportunity for me to apply. Both the former VP of IT and the outgoing director have encouraged me to pursue the role, citing my capabilities. Additionally, my peers frequently seek my technical guidance and direction.

I’m conflicted. While I remain passionate about the technical aspects of engineering, I’m unsure if I’m ready to manage people and endure endless meetings. However, I recognize that time is passing, and this could be a chance to advance my career. Are we ever truly ready for management or leadership???

My coworker somehow accidentally sent a screenshot of our (me and hers) conversation about our boss, into the work group chat on iMessage. No names were in it, but it hints at behavior that my boss is guilty of. So one can assume the conversation was about her. 

This boss in particular nobody likes. She then texted me on the side asking for me to shed light on what that conversation was about. I told her respectfully and professionally it is none of her business. It was a private conversation that my coworker accidentally sent into the group chat. (It says her Siri did it so I have no idea how that happened).

My boss then texted me “thank you for your response”.

Only 30 minutes later hits me with, “Once it was on the work group chat it became work related so it is not only my business but Boss #2 & the owner as well.”  

Owner as in who I work for. 
Boss #2 as in, who also doesn’t like this specific boss and has told me not to respond because she knows what happened and what the conversation was about too.

1ceqwwo,Returning to the USA after a 1-year vacation,"Hey, I'm in Argentina now working as an English teacher and I like it but do not envision myself living here. I'm wondering what should I do once I get back to the USA as I pretty much went to Argentina as soon as I graduated university (May '23/coming back Jan '25).

And...there's just so many paths I can take that I don't want to waste my time or have a ""oh but only if I had done this instead of wasting my time here"" moment. So I guess the question is more broadly what should I do for a living?

* Graduated from a state college with BA Geography and Math minor with middling grades. Interned in GIS for a municipality for about a year but didn't really like it too much. I don't think GIS will be my career path.
* Worked a fantastic delivery job for much of college, that paid decent (18$/h now), had decent benefits, and I enjoyed the work itself. And now that I speak Spanish it is likely that I would get a hiring bonus/raise. 
* I could conceivably work this job and take a few months of unpaid leave each year during the off-season which I value a lot.

I am thinking of going back to school however, in which case I'd like to use my free time here studying material. Concretely:

* Teacher (3 months paid vacation is something that very few jobs have, and mathematics teachers I think are in demand)
* Nurse (I heard it is basically 2 years to get a nursing license if you already have a bachelor's, seems quite stressful and long hours though)
* Paralegal? I know very little about what the job would actually be like.
* Firefighter, this interests me a little bit (like it interests all men) but I think they (or more specifically the new hires) are their own janitors and I do not like cleaning for money.
* Accountancy/actuarial science (no long-vacation and seems hard to get into although much higher paying and with my math background I think I could do it)
* A trade? I don't want anything with a long training process though, 3 years max to become fully certified. I figure if I did it all the way over, I would go to trade school as an electrician at 18 but that is 4 years until full certification.
* A master's? I don't think I would want to do academia though so I'm not sure what doors it would open up for me.

Is there any obvious choices or any pros/cons that I'm missing? I'm generally good at math and my work experience has mostly been delivery for a lot of different companies. I've considered CDL trucking but I think I would get burnt out from that as there's no interaction with anybody or anything.

1ceqfdp,Just got an offer letter but their offer letter seems weird,"Hi everyone, I'm new here so I'm not sure how it works, but I need some advise. I just got a job offer but I'm not sure if it is a good one or not so I haven't accepted it and want to ask for others opinion. Currently I'm working as a research associate II in biotech company with salary around 60k. I just got an offer from a company in another city (7h drive from where I live so I've never visited this company), this company seems real according to my research but it's their offer letter that seems a bit weird to me. I applied for an associate role and did 2 rounds of interviews with them (one with the team lead and one with the whole team). They are basically doing the same thing that I am doing in my current job so my experiences align with what they are looking for.  
Here are the problems:  
1. They offered me 80k for a scientist position, I am grateful for the increase but I didn't know if I can be offered a scientist position since I only have bachelors degree. At the same time I'm also wondering if a scientist can get paid 80k, I've always thought that scientists got 6 figures salary. I feel like they should've just give me a lower position.  
2. The offer letter is only one page and basically just listing the salary and benefits without further explanation (it doesn't include the job description and responsibilities as well, just saying that it is a scientist position)  
3. No exact date has been talked about for my starting date and it is not listed in the offer letter as well. I mentioned I need around 1 month to start this new job and they agreed but we haven't talk about the exact date.  
4. They didn't ask me to sign the offer letter and they didn't say anything about the deadline for accepting the offer letter.  
So now I don't know if I should accept this offer or not, it seems a bit too good to be true and their offer letter seems a bit weird. Sorry for the long post, any insights are welcome, thank you!",lifeisokiglol,0,0.5,4,1714255817,2024-04-27 22:10:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ceqfdp/just_got_an_offer_letter_but_their_offer_letter/,4,2024
1cepxi7,"Who Knew My Grandma's Advice on Empathy Would Land Me that leadership role? 
","If you're being interviewed for a leadership role, then most of interview advice focuses on your resume and accomplishments, but what if there're small details that are more important? Simple acts of kindness during an interview can completely shift the dynamic.



Interviews are a two-way street. Sure, they're assessing you, but you're also getting a feel for the company culture. By showing empathy, you demonstrate your ability to connect and build trust, which are crucial leadership skills. 1-upmanship is out, genuine connection is in!



Here are some **interview-specific** ways to use empathy to your advantage:



* Noticed the interviewer seems stressed? Acknowledge it with a calming ""Looks like a busy day!"". This shows you're adaptable and considerate.
* Ask insightful questions about the team and company culture. This shows genuine interest and your desire to be a good fit.
* If you get a tricky question, take a deep breath and ask for clarification. This demonstrates composure and a willingness to learn.

These gestures might seem small, but they paint a powerful picture. You're not just someone with skills on a page, you're a well-rounded individual who prioritizes teamwork and understanding.

1cepcob,"Negotiated for same pay as previous job I left, did I mess up?","Recently applied to a few different management roles and after 4 rounds of interviews with the one I really wanted (last being with the owner of the company) I was given a job offer.

This was on the phone and they told me what the base salary is, I countered with the base I was making at my previous job. I didn’t add anything to the counter besides asking if they had the budget to match my ask. The HR manager said they’d talk with their team and the owner and get back to me. This was a few days ago and no update yet as of today.

The benefits were decent and the company is great, but I really didn’t want to make less than what I was making so I countered. Moving from one HCOL area to a slightly higher COL area and the commute is horrible.

1ceobol,Remote healthcare,"I need some guidance from some resourceful redditors! I've been an Occupational Therapist for about 10 years, recently transitioning to a clinical consultant position with Medtronic. While I love it, and it's been a great change, the hours are almost on call daily. We revolve around surgery scheduling so the hours every day are a mystery. Background- I am a single parent, ex husband is in prison for multiple recurrent DV charges against me, so I get literally zero support with my 4 and 7 year old. Returning to OT is more of a predictable schedule but wages have decreased and I'm seriously burnt out to be completely honest. All of my income goes towards childcare and just living expenses at this point. If I increase my work hours to get ahead, my childcare inevitably increases exponentially and then we're all just stressed to the max. The conclusion I'm coming to is that I need something either remote or hybrid to decrease the strain of working out of the home 5 days a week. I've been applying for a few months but I realize the market is pretty saturated with remote healthcare. I am totally open to transitioning to something out of healthcare, sales, etc. It's a bit difficult translating my marketable OT skills, but really the profession encompasses so many transferable skills- selling patients on therapy, billing, managing treatment sessions, scheduling, coding appropriate diagnoses, cold calling, communicating with physicians and families, etc. The role I'm currently in is very heavy in surgeon training on spine robotics and supporting sales roles. I feel like I could easily transition into a number of roles that would ease my work/life predicament, I'm just having difficulty making headway. My current schedule does not allow for much time to be spent searching and networking and editing multiple resumes, so I thought I'd look to this page for some advice. In no way am I looking for an easy out or someone to do something for me, I just need to fix this before I lose my mind.

My manager is basically the head of those 8 people too, but I report to her directly.

Anyway, shes been okay with me, doesnt really talk to me but always says i do well and that shes glad to work with me and that im very independent which is good.

I sent a message back saying that this is your plan so I followed it. I didnt apologize because I wasnt in the wrong. So she comes to the office and she gets to my room and she goes ""that came off rude im sorry i hope you didnt take it too deep"". Obviously I cant say it was rude or i would probably get fired lol so I was like ok it's fine. Then I just had a bad day overall and talked to no one and she kept trying to like talk and whatever. So later, I had to post smth online before i left work. She didnt confirm so I didnt. Then she emails me saying why its not posted. Then I post it, then she says it's too late so i delete it then she says why did you delete it. Im literally just doing what she says but I guess it's wrong...

1cenoor,Continue in Engineering or Persue Finance (CFA),"Hello everyone I hope you all having a good weekend.

I'm a finance graduate with honors but I couldn't get any finance job, not even as an internship, but instead I was trained before graduation as an engineer in construction, I didn't like the industry so I didn't continue in it, long story short now I work as a networking engineer. I'm determined to get a professional certificate, but I really don't know what to choose, CFA (finance) or a networking certificate.

Finance is my original passion, but I'm alright engineer, the pay is better as an engineer and there are way more opportunities, but it's physically exhausting and it isn't my choice.

CFA is could get me a good finance job but it's way more expensive and it seems harder to get.

Besides as a practicing Muslim most finance jobs aren't ok with my religion.

What I want is to be extremely successful in my field regardless of any other thing (top 5%) not even compensation is as important, and I think in finance it's much more reasonable for me (based on my background) to achieve this goal. 

What would you do?

TDLR: Finance graduate with honors, but couldn't find finance work. Now working as a networking engineer. Unsure whether to pursue CFA or networking certification. Wants to be highly successful in my field regardless.

1cenc7v,Difficult a question about internship situation at work and how I should go about next steps.,"So I have a bit of a difficult situation that arose at work and I’m not really sure how to go about it. Long story (will try to keep as short as possible) I began working for a company as a full time employee on payroll. Went back to school and became part time until I discovered that I needed to complete an internship. I asked the company if they would write an internship letter for me so that I could continue working there. Turns out the company did not have an internship program and it was a long difficult process to get this letter. I think they wanted me to complete it unpaid but ended up still keeping me on payroll. In the end they were willing to write it for me but told me that they want me full time once I graduate. In this conversation they offered me the chance at a specific position that I’m going to school for. 
Now I am close to graduation and have been informed that the position is no longer available. What do I do moving forward now that I have no position there and need a real job? I feel guilty for asking for such a favor as the internship letter and then leaving. Any thoughts?

1cemrgi,Current Bookkeeper/Administrative Assistant needs advice for the future.,"Long story short, I need some guidance for what my next step should be. I want to start job hunting in June for a job that is closer but better mainly because it will be a year since I have started. I'm even willing to accept a job that is slightly lower wage if it means I shave off a lot of time in my commute and that will give me more time to get certifications if necessary.

I want to be able to work closer to my parents so if anything should happen I can get to them faster. Working from home would be preferable of course. I work in DC but live in NOVA if it helps.

Since I am behind in terms of where I should be in life, I have had to leverage whatever I can or do extra work beyond the scope of what I normally do in order to get as far as I did. For now, I will make a list and maybe we can take it from there.

My job chronology - recent to oldest:

* Administrative Assistant/Bookkeeper (Current job)
* Lube Tech/ Automotive Mechanic
* Substitute Teacher
* Math Tutor for the university I was enrolled in at the time

My assets:

* B.A in Mathematics
* Quickbooks Online Certified Pro Advisor
* Have executed improvements such as making training materials, inventory spreadsheet, archiving system, doing baby's first marketing (making a website on Wix and claiming the business on google and yelp), most recently mathematical modeling (As my current boss would like to embellish it as), etc. A lot which I can easily add to a portfolio and hopefully I can impress the interviewer with all the work I have done.
* Willing to go outside of the scope of work (for now).
* I have a car.
* Willing to learn or gain new skills outside of work.
* I do my best to match the energy at the workplace. So if my boss is crazy, since I'm also crazy I do my best to match it within reason.
* I like to think I'm detail orientated.
* I also like to think I'm versatile.

My liabilities:

* I have ASD which means I can't read the room as well as most people can. Also, I am not adept at dealing with customers that are angry but I can remain calm (I won't be able to sell you a pen).
* I have made lots of mistakes at my current job mainly due to data entry or reading information incorrectly (I'm surprised at still at my current job).
* I don't have anything really stand-out to offer which would make me an irreplaceable asset.
* I am not a good listener so I need to be told certain instructions a few times before it registers.
* I am not good at remembering to watch out for every little thing.
* If I have to perform a task that I have not done in many months I most likely have forgotten it or will need to be re-guided on how to do the task.
* When the workday is at an end I'm pretty much absent mentally which means if any last minute task is assigned I'm going to be slow.
* I have not learned to become a full-charge bookkeeper, I just print checks, make invoices, and process payments on the bookkeeping side as well as deal with receipts.

What I'm doing now:

* I'm applying for government jobs since all the cool kids in DC work in government. If I somehow get an interview and it goes well then that might be my ticket to prosperity.

My choices that I can do:

* Stay at my current job for a year longer:

&#8203;

    Pros: I am more marketable, more experience can be gained, I can make more improvements, portfolio will have more content, boss is a good guy, environment is stable.
    
    Cons: I get paid slightly above minimum wage, I do grunt work such as picking up trash, and commute sucks.

* Job hunt in June:

&#8203;

    Pros: Potential pay bump, better commute, more time for myself, and I can respond quicker if there is a family emergency.
    
    Cons: I may be poking the hive, I'm giving up something stable to plunge into the unknown, most likely my new employer won't wait a month for me to start, the potential for reduced income.   

For what I want to do now for the future:

* Continue on as a bookkeeper and probably become an accountant. While I don't mind working with numbers, I do not want to go back to university to get a degree in accountancy, then pursue a CPA. I don't make the money nor do I have the time and mental stamina to go to night school. However, so far this is what I have experience in so far and I have studied up on bookkeeping since I started but I wouldn't say I know everything since a lot of terms go over my head. I am willing to take online courses on accountancy on Coursera or Udemy if it helps. I'm even willing to try getting a bookkeeping certification if anyone can recommend me any good ones.
* Be a math teacher. I passed the Praxis in New Jersey for the math core knowledge to prove I can teach math up to a secondary educational level. I don't want to go into night school to be certified as a teacher (look above) so I don't mind working for schools that don't require certification. However, a lot of it requires relevant references, plus being a substitute teacher was the only job where out of the many years I subbed I ended up drinking a shot of alcohol twice because those days were that bad.
* Dip my toes into Data Analysis. I have a bachelors in mathematics so I at least have a foundation when it comes to math. My only programming experience is failing to make an app. I don't mind taking courses on Coursera or Udemy and if I feel confident enough, I can get certifications as well in Tableau or PowerBi. I heard a lot of things regarding Data Analysis such as the pay and what it can branch off into. So I have an interest and I'm willing to study that online. I know how to use Excel plus this is the best opportunity to work from home on a flexible schedule. However, the market is saturated and I'm not a young buck anymore. So I would be fighting tooth and nail just to be able to get the scraps that is a data analyst job.
* Be a mechanic. I have experience as a mechanic so I can go back to being a mechanic again if the money is there. Getting a certification to be a master mechanic feels like it is many years off and I am not getting any younger. I did like working on cars but I know there is a barrier, plus flat rate would kill me mentally. To me, being a mechanic is the most glamorous low paying job there is.

Thank you once again for reading this whole diatribe of a post. And since I don't want to just take, if you have any questions or you want to ask about my experience, please feel free to ask.",animisimponuntur,1,1.0,0,1714246186,2024-04-27 19:29:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cemrgi/current_bookkeeperadministrative_assistant_needs/,4,2024
1cemofx,"Accepted a promotion, worse off than I was previously","So, several months ago I accepted a promotion. I work remotely and very far away from the office so I expressed concern with office requirements if I accepted the position.

Fast forward to the day I started in my new role, I was informed I would in fact be required to work in the office four times a month. I reiterated what was previously told to me and stated this was my one concern, unfortunately that fell on deaf ears. Not ideal but I figured I could swing it for six months to a year so I could at least have the promotion on my resume. 

Three months later that requirement has changed once again, I now must work on site every other day.

In addition to my work location changes, I was made aware that I will be required to oversee a coworker’s job duties as well, meaning I will have to complete both jobs on a regular basis. The updated job description does not include this detail in it.

1cek0sw,How to deal with an overly familiar manager?,"I met my current manager (lets call her Sue) in an unconvential way as she was a guest practicing-professiobal  invited to comment & give feedback on a final presentations for one of my graduate courses. After schmoozing a bit and giving a killer presentation, she asked me to interview for an open position. I had actually applied to that positoon months prior but I didnt make it past the HR screening because, I assume, I still had a year left of my grad program. As it turns out, Sue was close friends with someone I considered my professional mentor and that made her like me even more. After a bunch of interviews, and a conditional offer (I had to finish my grad program within a year) I got the job. Its a really good opportunity and hard to get in my field because I still don't have my degree yet. 

Now, after a few months working there, our relationship is weird. Because we met in a relatively casual setting and share mutual connections, I think Sue assumes I'm a friend? She is way too casual about sharing her opinion on politics,  religion, or other social topics, and assuming I share her exact beliefs. Its not like she's saying anything bigoted but I'd find myself wishing I knew less about her opinions because I absolutely have no interest in sharing mine. I also feel obligated to just nod my head because I don't want to argue with my fricken boss. Its also tricky because we're often consultants for the public sector.

1cejtv3,Can anyone help me with my career?,"I am feeling completely lost in life. Sorry for the long post but genuinely need advice.

Throughout my school life I have always been an academically brilliant student. I guess it was because of my ability to mug up things as I could not perform well in college entrance exams. I am comfortable when I am told what to do and there is some structure or set of steps that need to be followed to get the results. That's why I was able to score good in school. I have had above 95% in 10th and 12th and above 85% in engineering. I am a computer science graduate. I could understand maths and codes but when it came to write it my mind could not think. 

I worked as a data analyst at a consulting firm for 1 year but did not like the job and I also didn't like coding much, so left my job. I tried giving MBA entrance exam but my profile and score was not that great so I am not getting any good B school. I want to do some impactful job so that I can help others but my education is in completely technical field and don't know which profession can help me achieve it.

Throughout my teenage and early 20s I have suffered from severe depression, anxiety and OCD and due to these I could never develop any hobby and hence no passion for anything. I kept on taking those options which would help me in keeping my option to switch to other field open. I see my ex friends(since they don't talk to me now) succeeding in life with jobs in big MNCs like Google, Microsoft or in MBA entrance exam and here I am completely lost feeling like a loser. I also think I am feeling burn out due to studies.

I am trying to figure out what I like by looking back at my life and I realised I used to like art, infact I was very good in drawing since childhood and tried giving design school exam but didn't have any portfolio so didn't get admission but due to depression I have lost interest in that as well, still I like making crafts and decorating things like garden and other things. It is because of this reason only I decided to go for MBA through which I could get into product management where my creativity might be of some use. I have liked subjects like geography, organic chemistry and interested in knowing how things specially scientific things work. I like spending time in nature and knowing more about flora and fauna, in my childhood I used to like watching national geographic and animal planet because of this reason only. I am very empathetic. I cannot figure out what to do next in life and hence asking for advice here.",tyforlistening00,1,1.0,1,1714238701,2024-04-27 17:25:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cejtv3/can_anyone_help_me_with_my_career/,4,2024

1cej9om,Accept or Decline this job offer??,"I need advice regarding a job offer I’ve received. I am currently working as postdoc in germany. I have been offered a position as a Senior Researcher in another university in Germany with permanent contract. Recently, the head of the department, with whom I would be working, called me and began yelling over the phone, which took me by surprise. This behavior was unexpected, especially since she appeared very pleasant during my interview.

The issue arose from a requirement to present a German doctor’s certificate or a blood report confirming immunity to measles, despite my having been vaccinated in childhood in India. The university is not accepting my Indian doctor letter. After visiting my family doctor in Germany for a blood test, I informed the head that I would have the results the following day. However, she became irate and insisted on knowing why I hadn’t sorted this out sooner. Despite explaining to her that I’ve lived in Germany for the past eight years without this requirement arising, she continued to express frustration. She noted that if my blood report indicated a lack of immunity, I would need to receive two vaccine doses within a month, which would delay my start date as i can not sign the contract before proving my immunity against measles.

She has given me only 15 days to join, citing the departure of another employee, and stated that she expects me to manage despite the short notice. Her approach has left me feeling uncertain about accepting this permanent, senior-level position, as it suggests she might frequently micromanage peoples.

Given this experience, I am conflicted about whether to accept or decline the offer. Can you advise should i accept or decline the offer.",neuroepigen,1,0.6600000262260437,2,1714237245,2024-04-27 17:00:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cej9om/accept_or_decline_this_job_offer/,4,2024
1cej5wm,Career Crossroads: Loyalty vs. Opportunity – Seeking Advice!,"  
About me: I'm mid-senior level engineer in my 30's. Have about a decade of electrical experience. I don't really like jumping around too much. I've managed to get a significant raise this past Fall that puts me at the market value.  
Both positions pay around the same but the new place, Company B, has a very solid pension plan, annuity fund, both of which require no contribution from me. Lots of union benefits and I would be able to keep my union membership + benefits if I switched to another union firm after the initial 5 year vesting period.  
I'm conflicted because my current place (80 year old firm, small, family owned) has been great to me. Been here for 6 years. Had a # of difficult personal issues come up in the past few years and they really were very understanding & supported me through it. I’ve also learned a lot, my mentor is amazing and I have lots of flexibility. I can go in as late as 9:30/9:40 and still be able to leave on time. Great coworkers but the culture can be lacking. There’s never any OT. It’s now 4 days RTO but 1 day WFH. Con is that the projects are of a much smaller scale and have been very repetitive + lackluster for the past 1.5 years. They got an interesting project for me recently but I had already gotten the offer from Company B by that point. My manager wants to grow me into his position as chief engineer and the owner has expressed the same interest in me learning as much as possible from my manager before he retires in 5/6 years. Got a big raise this past Fall. Main reason I started looking was my commute can be hellish: 60-75 minutes in the morning & 90-120 mins in the evening. The bad days are usually from wed-friday and same in the Fall. Upper management will all be retiring within ten years so i guess anything can happen even though it's a 100 year old company.  
The new spot is corporate, much larger, and strict 8-5 so no flex time but they do amazingly complex large scale infrastructure projects that seem really exciting & fun tbh. Like projects you'd be able to brag about some day. They’re also extremely stable w/ consistent gov't contracts and seem like great ppl as well. Lots to learn since it's a different sub-industry. it seems like a place where I can also grow into leadership in the same time frame. The commute is 25/35 in the morning & 45/50 worst case in the evening.  
Maybe I'm emotionally tied to my current job and the lack of stress. Would appreciate any input you have

1cehjt4,I interviewed candidates for the first time and it's making me question how valuable I am [not]. Advice needed.,"As some backstory, I spent over a decade in a low paying field and left for a complete career change 5 years ago to a well paying field. Now I am 40 and at the same level as people who are much younger than me.

I recently had the opportunity to interview several candidates and it has brought up a lot of underlying fears and inadequacies. I noticed that the older candidates had a lot of negative things ascribed to them by my colleagues, and I realized I don't possess a lot of skills that I look for in others.

As far as the age thing, I realized that older people are expected to be at the top of their field or people question why they are not. Also, people look for stagnation, like it's a negative if someone reaches a certain point but does not want to continue up the ladder. This made me realize that I can't just be good at my job, but I need to demonstrate some kind of ambition or drive. 

I also realized that I don't have the skills I look for in other people, partly because I trained for an entirely different career, but also the skills are fairly specialized and require training. 

I am now considering getting a master's degree to bulk up those skills and counter stagnation. The problems are:
1. It would take over 5 years. The last time I studied this was 25 years ago and I'd be starting from scratch. 
2. It would cost over $35k. My company might cover 25% of that.
3. It wouldn't translate to higher pay, but it might provide job security and unlock the next promotion.

I'm not sure if it makes sense to spend 5 years of my life and +$25k if I'm not going to recoup those losses. A huge pay jump is not in the cards or how my company works. However, considering the strength of the candidates I interviewed, I would be very worried about getting a similar role if I was laid off. Also I would be more marketable and the degree could open me up to other fields as well. 

I could use some advice. Is investing in a master's degree worth it in my situation?",monochromatic_clouds,1,1.0,0,1714232762,2024-04-27 15:46:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cehjt4/i_interviewed_candidates_for_the_first_time_and/,4,2024
1cehd85,Interviewing for a company I was previously fired from?,"Hi  r/careeradvice, posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I just got a call yesterday from a recruiter from a big recruiting firm saying they sent out my resume to a position for a company I used to work for roughly a year ago and want to interview me next week. This position I also applied to on Indeed and was rejected without any interview invitations.

I'm a bit anxious about this interview because I used to work for them about a year ago for roughly one year, and was fired for performance. It was my first job fresh out of college and I made a mistake that really pissed off my boss, which led to my firing. 

This position I'm interviewing for however, is a completely different division under completely different management but I'm still worried on what to say if they were to ask me why I left that last role. Usually, I say I lost my job due to a layoff but  can't they look up in their own internal files and see that I was terminated? Should I just be honest with them in the interview, own up to my mistakes, and hope they'll give it a second chance?

1cefw69,Lost and looking for direction ,"Like many I have been unsuccessfully looking for a new job and every day that passes I feel more and more deflated. I like to believe that I am somewhat smart and I am very willing to learn new things. Up until now I've always had a life plan: I got a bachelors and masters in Genetics , albeit niche areas (medical and fetal genetics) and up until 7 months ago I was working towards becoming an embryologist (what I thought was my dream job) through the NHS Scientist Training Programme. It is highly competitive and a difficult 3-year scheme and I was really proud to get on it and focused on this. However due to my poor mental health, family circumstance and just generally finding the course structure and workload intense and  finding it difficult to feel supported by my team I made the decision to leave the scheme to focus on getting better. 

I took some time to focus on getting better but I have no idea what areas to look  
at for work. Yes, I want a job but I also want to look at making a career. I  
have no idea what I can do moving forward. I enjoy writing and literature and  
tight of a career change into editorial type jobs (I have 6 months experience  
working at a scientific journal as an editorial assistant) but not much luck  
there. I have also looked at medical writing but again, no interviews and  
rejection after rejection. I’ve looked into data analysis/science but can’t  
afford the courses and I’ve been seeing that it is  extremely difficult to get a job with no experience. Don’t get me wrong I understand that the job market is crap right now and I’m absolutely aware that getting a job is more than the qualifications you have.

I don't even know what my question is, I just feel so lost and directionless. instability and the unknown are deeply uncomfortable spaces for me and can’t help but feel like at almost 27 I should have my shit together. 

I know there are so many in the same boat, I guess if anyone is facing the same  
issue what have you been doing to keep positive/ focused and for anyone who is  
in recruiting/ a work coach any advice on avenues to explore would be  
appreciated.

1ceeyux,Am I in the wrong?,"I am 33M, so long story short I recently changed careers and became a jnr developer.  I was clear in the interview process that I have never done coding in a full on corporate environment so I will need some help learning. And was then appointed under the pretence that I will be working with other developers to learn the environment and just to learn. 

So 4 month later and I've only worked alongside other developers in my department for about 2weeks. The rest of the time I am on my own, having to design new features and put in charge of some portals. And look I am struggling my ass off, not necessary with the coding part but more with the companies infrastructure and environment which is a complete mess(this was admitted by all the developers and CTO), so I am taking long to finish tasks because I constantly need to figure out which one of 20 connection strings to use,how a config file needs to be set up for this particular case and without the right credentials, and its not like I dont ask for the stuff. I get ""shower"" how something looks that i need to work on but half the time it goes like ""not to sure where this points to or if this credentials will work but just check it out"" and then get left. 

None of this would really have bothered me but recently i noticed my senior dev and and another dev made inside jokes about me, specifically that i struggle and that I am not smart. So not sure how to approach the situation,  I take responsibility that maybe I need to ask more questions but when every question gets an I dont know response, or I need to struggle,or I need to struggle and then only do they assist only to realise they gave me wrong credentials, then i am not feeling comfortable in the team to ask questions or for guidance.  Because thats basically the problem there is no guidance what so ever. I need to remond seniors about pull reuquest I sent them. I Need to remind them that something needs to get rolled out, and then the next they they ask me why its not rolled out yet.  

So am I in the wrong? Do i maybe have a wrong mindset? And how do I handle thai. Because after getting made felt stupid and like the department idiot I have no confidence in continuing this career.

I’ve decided that I don’t really love living here (don’t necessarily despise it) nor do I feel like I fit in the culture. The first few months were rough emotionally but it eventually got better. My routine of living here now just feels mundane but I’m past the point of trying to or feeling motivated to even want to make connections friendships or romantic because truth be told I don't really want to settle here.  
  
For months now I’ve been thinking of moving somewhere else for work. My job (RN) is very flexible and I can travel for work. That would mean I would break my hospital’s 2 year contract (not a massive deal for me, people do it all the time & most employees in a hospital are expendable.)   
I need to make up my mind SOON as I’ve been thinking on this for so long and I need to tell my apt. about whether or not I will extend my lease another year. I think I know what I want to do (travel nurse) but I’m afraid of the risk and unknown. Mind you I have moved on my own before a couple times now.  
  
The risks of what If I don’t like it, what if the job is more stressful or what if I’m more unhappy, though keep in mind there is flexibility because contracts run about 3 months at a time so I can go select a new place afterwards or even extend if I do like it there. I’m already not that happy where I’m currently living & can’t say I love or hate where I work. My life here is mundane but there is also a sense of security with knowing my good home/ living situation, my route to work, the people I work with, etc. The thing is, at the same time I do like change in my routine and new environments and I like to travel.   
  
I’m a single gal and no kids. I’m also at an age where it would be nice to be married or engaged by now but I’m not and I might as well go explore other cities and perhaps just maybe I’ll meet my husband because I don’t feel like I’ll find him in this city. I also want to move mainly for me. I think it can be fun, adventurous and help me grow as a person and career wise.   
  
I’m afraid as heck though and I cannot make up my mind! The idea of staying makes me tearful and so does the idea of moving lol. Moving makes me feel scared, anxious, and excited. I just don’t want to make the “wrong” decision. But I feel like I need and want to live life more fully. I don’t really want to spend another year getting older in this city. I’d rather travel but it is just a major move & it scares me (though I have moved by myself before). I’m basically at a stand still in my decision and it is probably causing more stress and headache than just making a decision lol. At the end of the day I know I have to make my own decision and no one can make it for me.

I'm reaching out for some guidance and advice. I'm currently working as a generalist in an early-stage startup, juggling various roles and responsibilities. While I have ambitions to eventually build something of my own and make a significant impact, I've come to realize a concerning pattern in my life.  
  
Throughout my journey, I've dabbled in many different areas and achieved some recognition for being multitalented. However, this versatility seems to have hindered rather than helped me in the long run. I lack consistency, often finding myself burning bright one day and fizzling out the next. Even though I've been recognized for my abilities in the past, I struggle with maintaining a steady level of energy and focus.  
  
Recently, I've encountered challenges in the workplace that have highlighted these issues. I become easily emotional when faced with criticism or perceived disrespect, and I find it difficult to maintain motivation when I see others receiving recognition or rewards that I believe I deserve.  
  
At just 22, I'm determined to change this pattern and cultivate the discipline and consistency needed to excel in my endeavors. I want to be among the top 5% in my field(strategy-but this is a topic for another post), but I recognize that I need to develop a stronger work ethic and mindset to get there.  
  
I'm seeking advice on how to foster consistency in my daily routine, overcome emotional reactions, and navigate office politics. Additionally, I'm eager to discover resources—whether they be books, podcasts, videos, or other tools—that can help me on this journey of personal and professional growth.",GMN-18,1,1.0,0,1714211083,2024-04-27 09:44:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ceapp1/how_to_become_consistent_in_career_and_get_into/,4,2024
1ceae7u,Should I leave my well paying job to get an AI Masters Degree?,"I am from a small developing country and it has been my dream since I was a child to go live in Netherlands/Germany. But now that I have the opportunity I am questioning if this is a good idea.

I got a bachelor's degree in Computer Science a couple of years ago and my plan was to immediately apply to an University in Netherlands/Germany for an AI Masters Degree. However, the company I did my Internship on (a very well known multinational) offered me a job with a very good salary (~$4000 which is a lot in my country considering the average salary is ~$2000) so I decided to stay 2-3yrs to save up some money and then apply for the Masters.

Well, the time has come now, and I am having doubts if I would be making a mistake quitting this job and leaving. I did some research and the salaries in Netherlands/Germany are not that different from the one I currently have, which is probably even less over there considering the cost of living is way higher, also I may not even be able to find a good job that fast because I would be a foreigner. I have heard so many people say how good of a company the one I'm in is, and that is perfect for a long term career, it also provides stability, has awesome benefits, etc. And I probably make more money now than anyone else in my family, which is kind of shocking to me because I grew up with very little resources.

It's my life long dream to go live in Europe, everything I've done so far was with that goal in mind. Admittedly I don't live in a terrible country, its pretty decent all things considered, but I am tired of not being able to calmly walk to the bus station because someone might kill me over my wallet, and the absurd inflation, and seeing how every day my city withers away due to terrible politics and lack of money.

If I stay, I would be throwing my dreams down the trash but I could have a pretty good and comfortable life here. If I leave, I would achieve my dreams, but maybe things wouldn't turn out as I hoped and maybe I'll regret it.

At the end of the day I know is up to me to make a decision, but I just want to hear if anyone has any good advice.",socks_11235,0,0.5,8,1714209760,2024-04-27 09:22:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ceae7u/should_i_leave_my_well_paying_job_to_get_an_ai/,4,2024

1ce9if9,At 23 can I start again?,"I completed high school at 18 .
I'm a very timid person who fears a lot of things that never happens. 
And fear trauma everything just makes choices difficult to the point I have come at 5 years to now .

At 20 I enrolled at a university in physics,zoology,  chemistry and French. 
I don't hate science as in studying but I was never a diligent student so I just learned enough to pass .
On last year I got held back on 5 subjects out of 9 .
I did not go for practicals cause I don't know what I am even studying.  So here I'm at 2024 still with no degree .

To why I enrolled on it . I didn't wanted to but a lot happened I was in a rejection state mentally.  I was afraid of going out , of tomorrow, of people .
But I don't show it I cover it with my smile .
And I was told I should enroll in it as everything is same as high school syllabus and I'll pass as always . So I did . And failed again. 

I hate myself when I smile or laugh or act like nothing bothers me and that hating myself and hiding my emotions . I feel dirty of myself . That having everything and knowing everything I still am worse than people my age .

I was always good at a subject. But at 21 when I was starting to drop out I suggested to change my major to it .
But at that time I was told it has no future and studying anything in science is better. 
Now this year I'm being told I should have choose that because I'm good at it and it's a bright career. 

This happened before to when I was 19 . I was selected in full scholarship for pharmacy . I was told its not good and now I hear it was wrong of me to leave it . And that everything was ruined from that day .
2 years back at 21 I also got selected for a agricultural college I submitted my id's and next day cancelled my admission.  Why ? Cause I didn't want that I don't know what I want .

Why am I even doing this I have no memory of anything good that might have happened to me in last 5 years . 
It's all blank my memory of myself  .
 


NOW I can't bear it.  Suggestions Regrets .
It's like I'm holding for a reputation of being someone's nothing .
Being asked why I left this or that . Why no degree at this age . I don't understand nor do i want to live in these past 5 years anymore. 

So I haven't said it to anyone but I'm going to drop out of this course and enrolled in the one I want . I'll graduate at 27 and at good grades and better mind condition. And I earn a good wage doing part time .it's enough for house and savings. But lately with this age slipping with time and regrets are messing my head.

I hate it that I wanted to show people what they wanted of me to become and myself for thinking I could do it. 
Some children just can't even though I'm your child I'm not as brilliant as you . I have my fears that I never revealed and stings I cover with my apathetic self.

I don't know I don't understand why I want something or why I never hear for myself. 
What if I had not walked on this path 5 years ago just because I thought I had to protect someone's smile or live up their words.

Why did I never had a dream . I don't understand what I did in the last five years or what will happen in a minute but I want to disappear sometimes so that I can just forget everything.

1ce829w,"Masters or DIY Tech Journey? Supportive Parents, But This Biotech Grad Needs Help Picking Her Tech Path!","I'm a 22(F) who just graduated with a Bachelor's in Biotechnology. Here's the thing: biotech isn't really my passion. I realized this around sophomore year, but didn't want to switch gears back then.Now, I'm super interested in the tech field!  However, I'm not too keen on spending another 4 years on a bachelor's degree, especially since my high school grades weren't the best (which might affect admissions anyway). Plus, many Master's programs require a Computer Science background and are typically 4 years, which is a long haul.

**So, here's my situation:**

* I'm currently enrolled in a programming diploma program at a good university. It's a good start, but I feel it might not be enough to fully develop my skills.
* I also applied for a Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) entrance exam (bonus points for only requiring math/stats!). Thankfully, my biostatistics course from last semester fit the bill. The downside? The syllabus seems endless!
* Here's the kicker: even if I get the MCA, it's still a 3-year program. By that time, most of my undergrad classmates will have completed their Master's and be working, which makes me feel a little insecure.

**My dilemma:**

* Should I focus on honing my technical skills for, say, a year, and then try for jobs?
* Or should I just bite the bullet and do the 2-3 year MCA program?

**Bonus:** If anyone out there would be willing to mentor me on this journey, I'd be eternally grateful!

**Here's the thing:** My parents are super supportive, but I don't want to disappoint them with any perceived indecision.

**Any advice from fellow tech-curious folks or those who've made a career switch?**

I received an inheritance after my grandmother passed away and have been getting $1,000 a month since I was 21 years old. I have only had 2 fast food jobs and the last one was when I was 18 years old. I was living with my mom until I was 28 years old trying to make this music thing work and I only started to make some kind of money from it 2 years ago. When I was living with my mom I pretty much lived off of that $1,000 a month from my inheritance. 

My aunt says that I’m making an enormous mistake by not having a job with benefits and is stressing the importance of it. I’m not “against working for the man”, but I really like working for myself and the freedom that comes with it especially since I’m doing what I love to do.

“Moreover, who will employ you in your late 30s and at what salary with no work history? How will you support yourself in your 60s and 70s?”

I'm currently working in industrial maintenance making 32/hr +$2/hr shift differential and built in overtime. After my overtime I make appox 80k a year. I got offered a new position' in our plant for facilities coordinator. With this new role I'll be in charge of the massive plants infrastructure, working with contractors and maintaining the facility itself rather than the equipment in it. In the interview they stated that this would definitely be a pay bump however after offered it was only $35 an hour with the 'promise' of overtime. I currently make around $37 an hour based off the overtime built into our schedule currently. I tried explaining this to the hiring manager and he just thinks I'll get overtime at 35 and be better off but I've seen how stingey they can be with overtime and question it. I'm also changing from working a 4 on 4 off schedule to a 5 day a week mon-friday schedule so I'm adding a day to my week and effectively cutting my time off in half. I also have advancement opportunities within maintenance that I simply do not have in facilities because there's no upwards movement from there. They KNOW that with me in that position I'll be saving them quite literally 50-100k or more a year due to my knowledge and expertise compared to the last person in that position and that will cut out alot of stuff we contract out currently...I guess my question is how do I explain this in a professional manner?

1ce11id,Giving company ideas to improve their app for free.. is it delusional of me if I could I ask for a job? ,"
So I’ve been using company XYZ app for awhile. It’s a well known app. They made another app that’s more for productivity and I was chosen along with 100 other people that used XYZ app to use the new app and give feedback. They did phone surveys, so we scheduled a time for feedback after a couple months of using the app. I get $10 for this call by the way.

When they called, I gave them feedback and honestly gave them one banging idea out of some that could probably make them millions. I’m sure they’re going to use that idea, and it will make them a top competitor with the main productivity apps, that the other apps are probably going to have to jump on board with to even compete (think of how now all social media apps have stories/reels). We were on the phone for about an hour discussing ideas + improvements.

The lady told me she loved that idea and that it was super cool and they’re going to implement it. She says that if I have any more ideas to email/text to set up a time to call but she’s not sure if she can offer me $10 for every call. I honestly have a bunch of creative ideas that could make them #1 productivity app, and realized that I could be doing a job for them that most people get compensated for.


If *they* reach out to me again, would it be crazy to ask for a job there? I have a creative enough mind to make them prosper, and also I studied the area the app revolves around (didn’t graduate though).

1ce0gez,Huge corp b2b job 90-100k vs City job Customer service rep job 62k ,"Im currently doing b2b for a large telecommunications company. 

Pros
The pay has been very nice. A lot of flexibility in my schedule. Mileage reimbursement. Free cable and Internet. Good benefits..

Cons
Lots of firing lately for sales practices that were once allowed. Out of nowhere they brought the hammer down. Quota must be met if you want to keep your job. Can be lots of driving. 


The city job is a 24/7 operation so the hours can vary big time. It'll be a call center job. 
The pay is 62k, but the range goes all the way to 93k. Not sure how long you have to be in the role to get there. 

I've always been told that the salary doesn't matter when it comes to a city job. Get your foot in the door and all sorts of doors will open for you. Is this true?

Also, I always hear the benefits and job security are great. 

If anyone ever left a big company to work for the city/state/fed please chime in. I'm open to all feedback.

1ce049f,"Underpaid, no benefits, promise for FT, more $, but mental and emotional health taking toll, should I stick it out?","I've been managing four farmers markets since last year under a government organization. The position is part time with no benefits, no sick time, no PTO, no holidays, no health insurance etc, and I found out that I have been paid significantly less than my colleagues who I supervise since I started. My boss is really nice but has a lot on her own plate and cannot offer much support by way or meetings etc but she wants me to go for the FT job - which I still have to interview for even though it's just an expansion of my current hours - and even got an increase in pay for the position. It has been 3 months since it was supposed to be posted and still no posting. It's out of her hands, and our HR department is notorious for taking a month or more to even get someone through on boarding after they are offered a job (mine took 3 weeks, someone else I know 5 months, another person two months and I heard someone took a year). So for me I believe it when I see it. 

Over the last year of this PT position, I gained weight from lack of sleep and stress from the job, where there is a lot of responsibility on my shoulders. I had put in my notice at the end of last season but I offered to stay until they found someone else. Win win since I was feeling depressed in the winter and not motivated for looking for work and was enjoying the planning and goal setting that I thought would be a good direction for the team with the winter months and the team was having difficulty with personalities that with me in the lead went away.

The new season will soon start and I have been unable to sleep well due to all the tasks on my plate and admittedly not being great at delegation of full tasks ie I have my supervisee put together an order list, I review and refine an order as needed then send forward the order, and my own expectations for myself and the work. To be fair it is just two of us PT people trying to run four markets, with over 70 vendors in different areas of the city and all the marketing, programming, admin, and onsite staffing that goes with it.

Anyways, should I stay or should I go? Ultimately I feel drained and scared of the chaos of staffing issues that come in the summer months and unhappy with the carrot that dangles but who knows when I can bite which means I'm not accumulating PTO and also not gaurrenteed the job anyways. I told my boss one of my needs to go for the job was to have another staff person to be able to be onsite at markets during the on season and that position has also not been posted yet...so...looking like a very hectic summer ahead which will add physical drain to my mental and emotional one. (Physical already happening because of insomnia with my brain being too on with job needs). 

The job market is shit but mostly I am still here because I feel bad for leaving when the season will be starting in full and when I helped plan all these goals. It would be nice to see them through but I know I something has to change or my body/mind will start breaking soon. 

I also blame myself and think I should just find a way to change and handle the stress better but not working so far...

Thoughts?

1cdzex4,"First full-time job advice, please help!!","Is this job worth it??

I just finished grad school, about to start my career and I’m in a tough situation. Last summer, I completed an internship at a company, who after the internship offered me a full time position for after I graduate (i.e. starting this June). When they offered me the position, they shared the job title, but explained that the exact responsibilities wouldn’t be finalized until closer to my start date (due to restructuring within the department). From what I understood, they were taking advantage of the restructuring to add a new position for me. Fine with me. The salary is great, benefits are great, but it requires me to relocate across several states. And while I was never super thrilled about moving or the company itself, I figured I’m young, the pay is good, they’re paying for my move (important note: if I leave within 2 years, I have to repay the relocation costs), AND I have no other jobs lined up, so I accepted.

In the months between getting offered the job and now, I threw around some job applications just to test the market. 

Now last week rolls around. I meet with my supervisor to discuss the role, where she shares my responsibilities. In the restructuring, they ended up moving someone on the team to a new position and now have me filling the position of the person they moved. The responsibilities are not what I was expecting/hoping for.

Also last week, I start interviewing for a  job that’s local. I’ve completed 3 interviews with this other company and I would really really love to work for them, but I haven’t gotten an offer, nor do I know if I’m going to even get one. 

The start date is coming up quick which means I have to start planning my move…. But now I’m not super thrilled about the position (and after doing some more reading about the company, they have a horrible public reputation). And if I go through with the move I’m basically stuck for 2 years because I don’t want to have to repay the moving costs…. 

Would it be stupid for me to back out of the job I already accepted even though I don’t have anything else lined up?

 If I got an offer from the company I’ve been interviewing with, I’d take it in a heartbeat over the current job. But again, I’m not sure if I’m even going to get an offer.

I feel like my fam would be upset because it pays well and has good benefits, and I would be leaving without anything solid lined up…. 

Any advice would be great, please!! I know this is a long post, if yall have questions, I’d be happy to clarify lol. ",Perfect_Ad7053,1,1.0,0,1714172762,2024-04-26 23:06:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cdzex4/first_fulltime_job_advice_please_help/,4,2024

1cdyhc8,"can't tell if I want to quit my job because i don't like it, or if i just can't do it","(throwaway account bc I'm mainly a lurker, never posted before, and this is personal-ish)

As the title says, I need advice to how to move forward with my job. I'm currently working in customer service, and have been for about two months now. Technically, this is my first job, since all other ""jobs"" I've had before this one have been off the books (working for family, babysitting and lawnscaping around town, and other odd jobs)

I'm a college student, and decided to take a year off to make sure I knew what I wanted to do with my future before commiting to a full 4+ years, and after a bit I felt anxiety and an obligation to get a minimum wage part-time job, feeling like I wasn't doing enough, or contributing enough to my household and family. Also, a little extra income would be nice. Now I'm starting to think that maybe getting this job wasn't the best idea.

I'm not entirely sure how to say this, but I'm starting to feel like I can't do it. That's not for lack of skill, the work is easy and I don't struggle with what's given to me during shifts. It started with that, in fact, boredom during work. After the first few days, hours dragged on, and I felt that it wasn't engaging enough for my brain (adhd). Which is a direct opposition to the fact that I put myself into a career that heavily relies on being social when I have social anxiety and a very quickly expendable social battery. Mix those two together, and I wind up going on autopilot for the majority of my shifts and just all around not feel Good.

On top of that, recently (last month or so), I started having small panic attacks before going into work. Worse, when I'm going back after having days off. They're not every time I'm scheduled to go in, but enough for me to realize the pattern. They don't last long, and it's always a fight between finding the cons and wanting to quit, and telling myself to shut up and suck it up. That side usually always wins, and I've only missed two days (I'd gotten sick) since I started. In order to get myself to work, I always have to give myself reasons to leave the house (ex: I get my check today; the schedule goes up for next week; one more day before I have a day off)

At this point I just don't know what to do. I don't enjoy my job, but I don't particularly hate it. I always feel bad going in, but then I push myself through it and when I get home I'm not great but I'm Fine. My paycheck is a motivator, compared to the odd and infrequent amount of money I'd get throughout my high school career, but I also feel like I'm sacrificing my mental health for it at the same time. Quit or stay, I'd feel guilty either way for personal reasons I'd rather not get into without necessity.

TL:DR; working is a struggle and I have to beat myself up to even go bc of my mental health. I'd feel guilty about quitting, but I'm not enjoying staying. The only thing worth it is my check every week.

1cdxzgj,Newbie photographer pay? ,"Hello! I created a burner account because I don’t want my irl name in case future employers are here.

I am a complete amateur when it comes to professional photography, however I have always loved & dabbled with it since I was a child.

I modeled for a previous job(a favor for my job during covid with some basic product/accessory photography, I’m not a model) & I got to meet and became friendly with our photographer. 

Now, I have an opportunity to get a official photography position at his company. This is unbelievable to me because my dream job as a kid was photographer, but the corporate world and college took that out of me and I’ve been working remote jobs for the last 5 years in corporate settings.

He has more than 1 studio and he wants me stationed at one of them 40 hrs a week for walk in/studio shoots and photo editing. This is where my salary question comes in.

What would be considered fair hourly pay here(in Chicago)? I would be an independent contractor so no benefits & I have no experience but did a few shoots with him recently to see & he trusts and expects me to fully take over shoots soon. He already knows me as a person and thinks I have what it takes and the customer service experience necessary. These potential shoots range from surprise engagements to family in studio to family outdoors, newborn babies, corporate events, etc. some weddings too.

So we talked over a number for an hourly range to sit in studio 40 hrs a week. It seems a Bit low to me but idk. What is a normal pay for a beginner photographer in this situation in Chicago ?

Going off that too, engagements and weddings are outside office hours typically & I saw online that photographers can make $100-$200/hr at a wedding. This is well above the pay rate we discussed for me but I understand I don’t deserve $100/hr for sitting in a studio. 
When it comes to situations like this:

1. should we set a diff hourly pay for each type of shoot? 

2. Should I have my regular hourly pay but also ask for a small percentage of some shoot fee? 

(Side note: this hourly fee is almost exactly what I was making at my last remote job & it was pretty low, but at least I wasn’t commuting- I was remote. Both that job & this photography job would have no benefits, sick days, vacation time etc) (another thing to note is doggy daycare is expensive so moving from remote to in person adds gas, doggy daycare & time to my plate and I would eventually have to buy a new car bc I don’t have my own right now)

I understand he spent time and money building all his materials & company up so I want to respect him and his craft and essentially the free training, while also respecting my need to pay my way through life and make a living. I want to explore my passion but I can’t do it if I’m living in a cardboard box lol. I’m okay not making bank doing my passion & growing it, but I also need to be able to support myself.


I know this is SO long but I need real photographers advice and insight, thank you if you made it this far!!!


In the end, my final questions are:

1. What is a fair hourly pay for an amateur photographer starting at a studio. 

2. should we set a diff hourly pay for each type of shoot? 
Or
3. Should I have my regular hourly pay but also ask for a small percentage of some shoot fee? 

4. Are there any other questions I should present to him? 

5. The Contract states the images are their intellectual property which I understand, however would I ever be able to use it for my portfolio? 


TLDR: amateur with no experience, getting hired on to a small photography studio 40hrs a week as an independent contractor to do photo shoots & walkins. Some shoots also require travel & may be events out of office hours. (Weddings, corporate, family, etc)

I try to bring a certain level of levity to  work.  Maybe I shouldn't and it's taken the wrong way.

1cdtcau,Flying out to onsite interview for a position I'm not super interested in?,"I've been unemployed for many months after mass layoffs at my former employer, and it's been difficult locating open positions relevant to my background within my home state. I've done several phone screens and Zoom interviews for local companies but no offers so far.

I decided to apply to several job openings relevant to my experience elsewhere in the country (US) just to see what happens.

Yesterday, a recruiter called me in response to one of my out of state applications, and said the hiring manager was interested in my resume. The recruiter wanted to schedule an onsite interview at the company which is 1000 miles west of here. 

The job itself sounds interesting, but the area to where I'd have to relocate is not a place I'm eager to move to. I also don't know whether I'm 100% qualified for the position. The recruiter didn't say anything about them covering travel expenses, but I assume that's what they had in mind.

I feel like I could be wasting both the company's time/money as well as my own.

If it were a Zoom interview I'd do it 100%, but I'm less enthusiastic about flying out there for the initial interview. Would it be a bad idea to fly halfway across the country to interview for a role I likely would not accept, if they were to extend an offer?

1cdt4pv,Got accepted to a job via a contractor but client rejected me at the last minute,"I started working for a client company via a contractor a few years ago remotely and resigned in the summer of last year to work at a new non-remote jobs. About half a year later around December, I decided I was not fitting in well, and decided to go back to my old remote job again. This time I went for a different contractor because they were willing to negotiate pay and my previous supervisor at my old company was eager to hire me back again. After discussing with them, it was decided that I can join the next training class in late Spring and I took the opportunity to travel overseas. Everything was set to begin this April 29, and I accepted the offer letter with the new contractor. All I had to do was wait for the equipment arrival.

This morning, just 3 days before training day, my contractor manager frantically called me saying that the client company is refusing to hire me because I was previously hired under a different contractor. Now I am out of a job that supposedly was to begin in 3 days and I have a 4 month gap in my current resume due to this miscommunication. And the other contractor does not have anything at this time in my area or remote.

Due to the fact I have no real skill, but spent lots of time with customer service I spent the afternoon sending out mass job application to retail jobs including part time but I have no other idea what else to do since I placed all my bets of this supposed guarantee of a job. I feel like my situation is reminescent to the ants from Bugs Life when they are frantically collecting food for the grasshoppers after banking everything they have on the Circus bugs.

i have no relatives in new york city so this move would be difficult for me. i was wondering if it’s really worth it to leave my life behind here to go pursue my fashion dream. fashion is the one thing i’ve really only had a passion for. however , lately i’ve been really into skincare. so i was wondering if i should stay at my current college and become a dermatologist pa because my current college is really good for pre-med. i know staying here would be considered the ‘easy’ or ‘safe’ way out but i’m wondering if i should just leave the fashion dream die if that makes sense. 

if anyone is a derm pa , what is it like ? what did you do in terms of education before becoming one ? is it worth it ? is it one of those jobs where you have to really have a passion for it to love it ?

1cdrzlg,"About to be a physics bachelors, what do I do?","Hey,

I’m about to get my BA in physics, and i honestly feel like I’ve wasted my time. I don’t want to go to grad school (at least not yet and definitely not for physics) so I need to find a job in industry but I’m pretty clueless as to what that means. I’m 21 and never had a real job before, I’ve just been doing school up until now, and have only done some volunteer stuff occasionally. 

I have a pretty low gpa which I don’t think matters that much; if I had a higher one I don’t think I’d be any more qualified. However when I say any more qualified, I don’t think I really qualify for much in the first place. My math skills aren’t as good as a math major, I don’t know how to use autoCAD like an engineering major, I know jack shit about finance, an electrical engineer could run circuits (sorry) around me in electrical stuff, and my coding skill is basically just I can write some bullshit that will do math for me sometimes. Honestly the only thing I have going for me is that I’m smart and can probably learn the skills needed any given job pretty easily, but that doesn’t help me find a job and isn’t communicable to an employer outside of them maybe being clueless and going “wow physics, just like Albert Einstein.”

I feel like I made a mistake. I felt this way a couple years ago too, but I figured I was in too deep so I’d just keep going. Now I don’t know what to do. I’m looking for jobs on LinkedIn but I feel under qualified for basically all of them, and half of them are entry level for graduate degrees, not bachelors. I’m looking basically anywhere in the U.S. and Switzerland (I have citizenship there so why not), but I’m not finding anything I feel like I could do, want to do, or would want me. Some defense contractors listed basically just “have a physics degree” explicitly in their requirements so I applied there, but they’re in some goofy states that nobody wants to live in, including me. I will if I have to though.

1cdpbn6,28 year old developer feeling lost,"Hi everyone,

  
I'm a 28 year old master in IT working as a .NET developer in Belgium.   
Throughout my teenage years and late into studying for my masters I've always created stuff. This started from websites for local bands, blogs about video games, creating actual video games for android to a full blown marketplaces for sheet music.

  
After university, I started my career as a consultant in .NET (more specifically Sitecore), I learned the ropes of corporate life and at age 26 decided that I didn't want to build more expertise in the Sitecore framework and decided to switch jobs.

  
I landed at a startup that focused on .NET and React but found most of my time spent building front-end components and extending controllers. This lead me to the decision to switch to my current job. Back into consulting, but in a more general .NET position.

  
Lately I've been feeling completely lost/drained. I feel like I've hit the limit in Belgium and that the skill set that I've gathered would allow me to solve most of the problems that clients are facing.  

  
The things that developers are ""supposed"" to learn simply don't seem appealing to me anymore, new framework x, new pattern y. I've come to the conclusion that all of these ""solutions"" have their trade-offs and that it's just a gigantic loop were doing over and over.

Don't get me wrong I spend a lot of time studying the framework and possible improvements (after hours), the problem is that there's no way for me to apply this knowledge and so, in the end, it's lost.

  
In my life I've come across singular people which try to get the best from you by pushing your limits, these are extremely rare and I've none in my current job and don't know how to find a job with such people.

  
I feel like switching to another job would not change anything and that all jobs are similar. I've never been the most social type but I always try to give 100% and people have complimented me many times on the quality of the work I do. However, lately I've been spending time on wasteful activities (during work, as I work remote) because I just can't find the energy being surrounded by people who don't seem to care deeply about what they put their hours towards.

  
In the end, can a job really ever be fulfilling for people that try their best? Should I just give up?",Potential_Business16,1,1.0,1,1714147787,2024-04-26 16:09:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cdpbn6/28_year_old_developer_feeling_lost/,4,2024

1cdoyui,Can someone help me pick a career path?,"I'm 35 and feel stuck in low-paying dead end jobs like retail and customer service. 

I've pursued filmmaking the last 10 years, but realized lack of money has always held me back, since I can't afford to invest in my projects, let alone pay my bills in the expensive cities where all the networking opportunities are.

I'm looking for a stable, high-paying ""day job"" that I can work ca 40h per week, without it becoming my whole life. I'm willing to spend all my free time after work for as long as it takes to transition into something new. Another college degree is not an option, but I can do certificates if they're a safe investment. 

I'm an English speaker but live in the EU, so there are limits to what I can pursue. 

Things I've considered:

1: IT. I know HTML/CSS well, also used JS, PHP and mySQL before. I'm proficient at Photoshop/Illustrator. I had a job as a web developer for 2 years way back. I loved it, and like the idea of getting into FE dev, but there seems to be a lot of doom and gloom nowadays after massive layoffs due to AI and so many people competing for entry level jobs. Seems like the days are gone where people study at home for 3 months and get hired and make six figures 1-2 years down the road. I think it's still a viable option since I have a knack for coding and design, but I understand the bar is set way higher nowadays. If I need 2+ years of work to become hirable, only to land a job in some startup for minimum wage , is it even worth it? I feel guilty trying to move into IT for better pay, knowing that there are people out there with CS degrees who are actually passionate about coding. For me it's just something I could see myself pursuing to escape dead end jobs. 

2: Writing. I've worked as content writer in the past, and wrote all the copy for the company where I was the web dev. For my creative projects I've improved a lot as a storyteller and written loads of screenplays. Doing something in writing would utilize my strongest skills and something I'm passionate about. It seems that for content writing, everyone goes the Fiverr/upwork route, where it's a race to the bottom, competing against all the low-cost countries undercutting the market writing articles for $5 a pop, etc. Seems like there's money in copywriting, but frankly, I hate business and sales. I think I could get good at it, if I was in a niche that didn't require too much business jargon. I'd use my writing skills for anything if I had a clear career path in mind. Scrambling for freelance clients sound stressful, especially in the EU where governments hate freelancers. 

3. UX/UI. I don't know if this is a safer choice than front end nowadays, but I've also heard people mention getting into this after months of self-studying. I do enjoy design, and also the prospect of interviewing people and learning about user experiences. I wondered if UX writing could be a good pathway? I prefer writing that educates and helps people rather than persuading them, and I wonder if being able to write engaging content could be useful in a tech environment. 

&#x200B;

Open to any suggestions - just keep in mind I'm not in the US/UK, and it's mostly startup/tech that hires in English here in the EU. I'd move to Ireland if I had a good reason (the only English-speaking EU country at the moment).",Phobetor777,1,1.0,3,1714146928,2024-04-26 15:55:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cdoyui/can_someone_help_me_pick_a_career_path/,4,2024
1cdopeg,I feel like I lost 4 years of my life studying for nothing. No job at 22 and feeling completely lost.,"Alright, I studied Japanese at university for 2 years, then reoriented in a tourism school for 2 years to become a flight attendant. Now graduated since 2023 I've realized how hard it is to get a job in this field...

  
More than 6 months after getting my flight attendant diploma I still have no job. I did a training in february in a low-cost, I passed the exam and then was refused a contract on the very last day because ""they do not have enough places"". On 25 people, they kept only 5 or 6 people. Like wtf ? They lied to us during the whole training like it is normal :/ But it is not that bad since it is not my dream airline. I just wanted to get experience and it was supposed to be a seasonal contract. 

  
The thing is that now I feel kind of stuck. I can't really get a job somewhere else because I am not qualified and because I don't know when Air France, or an other airline where I'd like to apply, will recruit. I don't know how it works outside of France but here our contracts don't allow us to leave as we want. If I get called by an airline but work somewhere else, I won't be able to quit easily and will probably lose the opportunity... I heard that some french cabin crews do small missions in hotels, hostessing between airline contracts for example, so I tried applying and but got absolutely no response... (I continue sending CVs of course)

  
Now I feel like a fool and so dumb because I realize that this was maybe not the best choice I made to get this diploma... I feel like it is going to be super hard finding a position, especially in the few airlines that I want. We don't have that much airlines in France, and some of them might refuse me because I don't speak certain languages (spanish, german etc..). 

  
I'm considering going back to school again and getting another degree in a completly different field but I'll have to wait until next year since inscriptions to schools and universities are closed in France now... :(  I think that studying something else might be a great idea and will allow me to participate in airline recruitments. In case no airlines want me, I'll have something else. 

I'm worried because I don't live with my parents anymore, I live with my boyfriend and I don't want him to pay for everything :(  I really need to do something with my life. 

  
What should I do ? Have you experienced something similar ? Is it too late to study something else ?",Logical-Mastodon5079,1,1.0,0,1714146282,2024-04-26 15:44:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cdopeg/i_feel_like_i_lost_4_years_of_my_life_studying/,4,2024

1cdmy2e,What to say when quitting without another job lined up?,"I have been working at a job for the last few years which is extremely stressful. Given that, I have been contemplating quitting for a while now, and have been applying to other jobs so far without success (I work in a professional field, but in a niche area that I have been trying to move into something broader).  
  
After a period where for a number of reasons, no one was able to receive any raises, we were told that we would finally be getting some. We did and to say they were far below what we expected is an understatement. because of the inability to give raises, I was making far below colleagues in other companies in comparable positions, and also stuck at the lowest pay for my job at this company - meaning for a couple years until now I made the same as new hires. With these new pitiful raises (pitiful for everyone, but not equal) some of the newer hires are now making more than I am.  
  
I brought this up with my manager who has said essentially it is out of her hands and while she has brought up the general unhappiness with the raises among the employees, she can't do anything about my specific pay and that I make less than newer hires. She also mentioned out of the blue that (even though I have had consistently good performance reviews) I am currently not in line for a promotion (that I understood would likely be in the next year or so.  
  
This is the tipping point for me, so I have decided I am going to resign and give my 2 weeks soon. However, I don't have another job lined up (my wife makes more than I do and we have some decent savings so we will be ok if I am out of work for a while. we've discussed this and she is on board).  
  
When I quit, my manager will inevitably ask why and where I am going to be going / what my new job is. I don't really want to tell her I am quitting without anything else - both because it doesn't sound great and because I don't want to burn bridges (with her and other people that work there, who might think I just can't take it anymore which is why I quit and therefore might not give me references they otherwise would).  
  
Part of this is I am on a somewhat large project that will culminate in July. I am one of two of my position working on the project (along with a larger team) and the other one is much more senior than I am. I do feel a little bit bad about leaving them now with that project, since they will have more work to do without me, but I really don't think I can mentally handle doing it, and really with limited pay and limited prospects of moving up its not worth it.  
  
This more senior person I am working with is not a nice person and is part of the reason I am always so stressed. I absolutely dread telling them I am quitting and won't be seeing the project to the end. Especially if she finds out I am not quitting because I got a better job, just because I don't want to do this one. I fully expect her to yell at me and bad mouth me around the office.  
  
My question is, how do I tell (1) my manager, (2) the senior coworker and (3) others around the office that I am resigning (without another job) while burning as few bridges as possible? I get that people might say the manager and senior coworker are unlikely to give me good references anyway, which is possible, but I still want to do this as tactfully as possible so they don't go telling others I work with how awful I am.",Far_Bear_5390,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1714141947,2024-04-26 14:32:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cdmy2e/what_to_say_when_quitting_without_another_job/,4,2024

1cdlyju,Counter offers - the never ending question (w/a twist),"Had a recruiter reach out to me about a new role. **It pays 2.5x what Im making now.** For perspective,  I could make MORE in this role in six months than I would in my current role for a year - and it seems to be a good opportunity. **Here's the catch:** Im currently salaried and the new position is contract-to-hire (does have benefits though). I would usually never entertain a contract job, but since I didn't have to go looking for it I decided to interview and things are going well and moving quickly. The new role is for a well known company AND it's fully remote - whereas my current job is in office. 

My current company is good in all areas, EXCEPT pay. Ive already presented that I wasn't being paid market and their response was a minimal bump despite being a top performer with a specialized skill set. Im aware of the echo chamber of 'NeVer AccEpt a cOunTer OfErr', but IMO this applies only if there's a ton of issues that no amount of money could fix - **which IS NOT the case here!**

Has anyone ever received a counter based off a contract role? Did you have to SHOW the offer?   
Has anyone ever left a FT role for a contract role and was glad they did OR wish they didn't? Please give examples.

Don't have major expenses besides living and yes I do have some savings. Current job is very secure with very little chance of layoffs. Thoughts?

I have a unlimited PTO and people are great. I’ve been there for about 11 months and before I came here I was in accounting for two years and got an mba

I’m only 24 btw

I just got a job offer to be a senior accountant  and analyst meaning I would help with the system like handling support tickets as well as doing accounting close and helping build out reports and stuff like that and when the time comes, I would help implement the software and train the employees on how to use a software. It’s an accounting job with IT essentially. They know I don’t know sap and they want to train me from the ground up 


 The total Comp for this job is at 110k per year plus 15 K bonus and 8% match

I don’t know what I should do if I should stay in my current company and continue to make about 90 K , I’m fearful that if I stay here to long I won’t have super transferable skills (sql and project management are great but not everyone uses this software - the sql skills are minimal btw too) but I know if I were to go to the new job and make 110K I will be learning a very very popular system (sap) and I would get good accounting experience (the company that’s offering it to me did 1.2b in gross revenue so it’s not a small shop).
It’s my understanding that they have a ton on spreadsheets and someone has to modernize biz process and that would be my job 

My thoughts are if I leave and I hate it at the bare minimum I can go directly back into accounting, and if I love it I can keep going end goal is to do digital transformation and strategy work. 

If I stay put and make an easy 90k, I can leave and do application management work, maybe product management, it’s just hard to tell as not many people leave bc the culture is so good.

Work started and I started enjoying it,learning new technologies was fun,but did I enjoy it?I can’t say.I was doing it for maybe it’s sake,for maybe the fear that it is a new job,karna hi hoga and frankly I started treating my job like some college degree and I had to do it like my life depends on it.It was tough consuming so much of information everyday,but yeah it happened somehow and I felt that I learnt something.Training phase got over and I was randomly assigned a project in some other domain totally,Operations,although I felt relieved that Operations will be a user centric role I may enjoy it.Work started,I started doing it,everything was so new,went over my head still learnt everything and tried giving my best and did give my best.Feedback from my TL was great.I was absorbed into the project for a longer timeframe.Work got heavy more,I have started working now for 12hours a day.I log off after client calls at 10in the night and again log in at 1030 in the morning the very next day.This has become my daily routine.Honestly I don’t have an iota of motivation left to keep continuing.Its like the same cycle is repeating every week and I am doing something I don’t like,I don’t enjoy.I just feel like sleeping and don’t have energy left in me anymore.Everyone says just look for 2-3 months more and then take a decision,but I feel confused myself too.What ahead?What should I do?How long can this continue?What will change in the next 2-3 months?
I don’t enjoy this,I drag myself to office everyday and the pressure keeps on piling.I honestly feel like I should quit and work on the things I like to do,I enjoy doing,I enjoy learning and try to make a career or something out of that.But I feel confused and scared and often delay the decision what should I actually do? and keep on repeating this cycle.I don't know honestly what's ahead.Honestly I think its about time I reach a decision and work on that.I feel I should go for something I feel I am interested in and not more waste time.I am just 22 and I feel I need a lot to achieve in life.I have certain ambitions and goals and I feel continuing like this where I don't see myself happy in my current role it is just delaying me in taking the step in the right direction.I am dead confused.",Stunning_Paper6601,1,1.0,2,1714126896,2024-04-26 10:21:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cdhtpz/confusedwhat_should_i_do_next/,4,2024

Since this project is coming to an end, and the Institute is planning on closing down, I was thinking about pursuing the project management career on my own and possibly buying out the Institute. My question is, has anyone any advice on where to start studying about project management? I have searched for EU certifications, courses, seminars, traineeships etc. but I have not found any relevant information how to start this career path. I would be more than thankful if you would share your experience and advice on how to start this career, especially if you have any information on EU project management.

1cdf73s,Branding or Marketing? ,"Fresher career

Hey, I'm 22M and I'm looking to make a career in Marketing/Branding. I have a few questions and id be grateful if someone could help me out. 

How do I get into branding? 

Are careers in Marketing different from a career in Branding? 

What are the different job profiles in Branding? 

Do I need to know how to draw and design to get into Branding? 

I have a bachelors in business administration. Should I do a masters? What course would be best suited for a career in branding? 

What other factors should I consider before getting into branding? 

I'm watching YouTube videos related to branding and I'll do courses from MOOC platforms too. What else can I do? 

Should I read books on Branding? Any book recommendations? 


Thanks for helping out, I really appreciate it

1cdey5d,Motivation in management?,"I’m part of the new management team for an organization within my college. We transition leadership midway through May. I currently hold a typical leadership role. To get into it: I’m at my breaking point. Our team has exploded in size to be over 130 members with a 12 person leadership team. With this growth, we’ve run into some internal issues. There’s been cases of mistreatment and harassment at some level. I’ve been tasked with collecting info from each party/side by myself and then presenting it to the leadership team. I knew this would be a difficult role, but I’m being torn apart. Every time I hear a new story about the atrocities happening behind the scenes, my heart breaks off another piece and I become increasingly disappointed in the people I’ve surrounded myself with. And not all of them are bad, but there’s just so many who are ignorant and do nothing to stop the problems we’re experiencing. The worst part is these idiots are smart enough not to act up in front of leadership, so until someone came forward they never got caught. And even now we don’t have names. Overall I’m just exhausted. It’s a very heavy burden to carry everyone else’s issues. And I have a few of my own to handle as well. I’m at the point where I may quit before my new term has started. I just never imagined I would become the HR department for a group before I turn 20. But I love the people and honestly enjoy my work too much. Any advice on what we should do moving forward or how I can alleviate some of this mental burden?

1cdep63,To move & travel or to stay out,"I’m feeling very undecided about making a major life/ career move. Been living in a city for a little over a year now. I’ve decided that I don’t really love living here (don’t necessarily despise it) nor do I feel like I fit in the culture. The first few months were rough emotionally but it eventually got better. My routine of living here now just feels mundane but I’m past the point of trying to or feeling motivated to even want to make connections friendships or romantic because truth be told I don't really want to settle here.

  
For months now I’ve been thinking of moving somewhere else for work. My job (RN) is very flexible and I can travel for work. That would mean I would break my hospital’s 2 year contract (not a massive deal for me, people do it all the time & most employees in a hospital are expendable.) 

I need to make up my mind SOON as I’ve been thinking on this for so long and I need to tell my apt. about whether or not I will extend my lease another year. I think I know what I want to do (travel nurse) but I’m afraid of the risk and unknown. Mind you I have moved on my own before a couple times now.

  
The risks of what If I don’t like it, what if the job is more stressful or what if I’m more unhappy, though keep in mind there is flexibility because contracts run about 3 months at a time so I can go select a new place afterwards or even extend if I do like it there. I’m already not that happy where I’m currently living & can’t say I love or hate where I work. My life here is mundane but there is also a sense of security with knowing my good home/ living situation, my route to work, the people I work with, etc. The thing is, at the same time I do like change in my routine and new environments and I like to travel. 

  
I’m a single gal and no kids. I’m also at an age where it would be nice to be married or engaged by now but I’m not and I might as well go explore other cities and perhaps just maybe I’ll meet my husband because I don’t feel like I’ll find him in this city. I also want to move mainly for me. I think it can be fun, adventurous and help me grow as a person and career wise. 

  
I’m afraid as heck though and I cannot make up my mind! The idea of staying makes me tearful and so does the idea of moving lol. Moving makes me feel scared, anxious, and excited. I just don’t want to make the “wrong” decision. But I feel like I need and want to live life more fully. I don’t really want to spend another year getting older in this city. I’d rather travel but it is just a major move & it scares me (though I have moved by myself before). I’m basically at a stand still in my decision and it is probably causing more stress and headache than just making a decision lol. At the end of the day I know I have to make my own decision and no one can make it for me.   
  
If you read all the way through, thanks.  
Advice or thoughts would be appreciated.

1cdeklv,Should I Stay or Go?,"So i currently work as a dispatcher for a hospital and have been working here for about 6 years. I currently work a 12 then 14, 14 and end with a 16hr shift (evenings to overnights). I have 2 kids at home and a wife who tend to miss me more and more as i am always tired or working. My job is getting more and more depressing and stressful with management becoming terrible, not to mention the hospital big wigs who give us nothing because they are money hungry. Anyways, this job is taking a toll on my mental health but it pays the bills since my wife is a stay at home mom. I bring in about 2000$ every 2 weeks because of the 16 hrs of OT a week. Now our goal is to move to Florida at some point in the near future but that'll take some work. My major question is should i take a job that offers 24$ an hr (i currently make 21$ an hour if i worked regular 8hr shifts 5 days a week.) this new job would be Mon-Fri 7a-4p. which would be wonders for my family life BUT i feel the pay cut would kill me but i also may be overthinking it. i currently pay 110$ a check for health, 12$ a check for vision and 36$ a check for dental then 38$ a check for FSA. Would this be a smart move or would i be fucked? Let me also add that the system we use 9CAD system) i have been using since the day we released it and i know all the ins and outs.

1cde0o2,I need help with my career laboratory medicine ,"
So to start off im not they great at writing or explaining things in detail, but im hoping I get the word across ok here. 

Basically, Im looking for advice on my life with career. Im a graduate of the Bachelor or laboratory medicine degree which sets you up as a career in medical science testing blood/urine/other bodily samples. 

I graduated in 2021 and got a job far from home in a regional lab. The job was going ok, but i ended up getting burnt out from the pressure of hospital staff and getting so exhausted from being on a 24/7 roster with on calls. This really stressed me out, especially coming in at 2am on your own, and Qcs are out and you can't get them in no matter what you've tried, and you've got a blood transfusion crossmatching to do when you can't even test the group because the serum is already clotted. 

Because of this stress I ended up resigning and got a job as receptionist in an insurance company back on my home town where my family live. My mental health has improved a lot since I've been at this job and getting to see my family again, but the problem is the job is contract and ends in 2 months because it's a maternity leave cover. 

I've been trying to apply for jobs back in a lab but they're not really pathology labs (they're like pharmacy labs/ water testing lab) but I haven't had any success. I don't know whether I should just bite the bullet and go back to the regional lab i left, but i doubt they would take me on because I was honest with them explaining the stress the job made me feel. I also don't really want to go back there but I feel I have no choice. 

Any past experience or assistance you could provide would be much appreciated. 

Thank you.

1cddqly,Need help figuring out career growth,"I'm not sure what Ican apply to and get a job that provides some level of stability. I've been stuck in seasonal/temporary positions for years now and I'm sick of panicking and having to figure out getting a new job and everything that comes with that (healthcare, finances, etc) every year or so. I also don't feel qualified for any positions that won't just hire anyone.

I have about 5 years of manual labor/installation experience. For 2 years I did an americorps program with an education non-profit. I learned a lot from the americorps program but not enough to make me competitive it seems. Some skills I talk about on my resume are leadership, microsoft/excel/canva/whatever softwares, volunteer management, project management, and data analysis. I also try to emphasize creativity and design in my resume where I can since it's something I enjoy and has been a part of my previous two jobs (one I designed set pieces, the other I designed community projects for volunteers to complete).
I have a BA in English with a Creative Writing minor and an AA in Psychology. My resume is nicely worded and formatted but ultimately feels like a mess to me because my experience and skills are so all over the place. I'm not sure how to clean it up because I'm not sure what to go for. I might try to make multiple versions soon, I just feel a little hopeless and overwhemed lately.

I've been told I should try to go for a grant writing position, but all the listings I see want someone with 3-5 years experience grant writing and seem like they want you to provide proof that your proposals were successful. I could see myself being a project manager eventually but I don't know how to get there. A lot of project manager positions want you to have experience with different technologies and I don't know how to obtain that experience. I don't know if a certification would help me out or what that certification would be. Currently I've just been applying to whatever listings seem like they'll provide training or aren't asking for a lot of experience without knowing if it'll be a good path for me.

What do you do when you have not all that much experience in a bunch of different things? What would you suggest applying to based on my skills? I just want to move up in the world a little bit, make okay money with some benefits for now and hopefully have more opportunities for growth in the future.

1cdd7al,Need some advice ,"So I (m24) work for a company I won’t say what. I have worked there for about 5 years and through college (well haven’t finished). So this company I had no real plans of sticking with as I saw it as a job that wasn’t what I wanted to do. As you move up it’s a lot of work and hours and managing people before eventually getting to the sales job you want. It is a very good company a Fortune 500 company and they have amazing benefits. So through college I worked there part time and full time depending on the academic load. But I’m just a terrible student I have been since high school. I have been attending school for about 6 years now and I am just barely a junior. After being in school for a while out of embarrassment of being in school I told all my coworkers and colleagues that I had graduated about last summer. 

After that I stepped away from the company and pursued 2 new jobs and they were fine but I found myself missing my old job. Also I hadn’t made much progress in school. During this time my mom had a terminal cancer and I cared for her and then she passed away so yeah. After my mom passed I went back to this company full time and dropped school for a minute as I don’t think I can handle both during this time of my life. I am at the point now where I want to advance in my career and at this company I work for they offer 2 different programs. 1 for people with degrees and 1 without. The only difference is the one without a degree they open less and for the the first year with the company you make less then people with degrees. So the average salary for employees without the degree is about 50k a year and with a degree is about 60k before taxes. 

So my dilemma is I am certainly qualified and I think I could succeed but I am kind of nervous because I feel that when I reveal to the company I do in fact not have a degree it’s not I will look bad to the higher ups or anything but my contacts and coworkers through out the years will see me as a liar and non trustworthy. Which is truly not me I’m not a liar I just didn’t see a future in the company and didn’t want to get into why I’m taking forever to finish. Any advice?

1cda9vu,Is this worth asking for a raise?,"I work at a 60 person nonprofit in Chicago. Our staff is mostly program staff, there’s only 9 of us in admin (HR, finance, development/fundraising). I am at a Director level over grants and quality improvement.  


I had zero direct reports for two years. I received  one coordinator eight months ago. Didn’t ask for compensation adjustment. The coordinator was huge work relief for me so I didn’t mind. 

Now, they want to move two more positions under me, the remaining two admin roles. Right now, they report to our CEO, and he isn’t able to give them the time they need. However, their roles are individual giving/communication and compliance. I don’t currently do much with either of those roles. Related, sure but not much directly. So by being their supervisor, I am going to be involved in more pockets than I currently am, and some areas I don’t even have much experience in so I’d be learning as well. 

I should add, we’re throwing a fundraiser this winter, our first big official one. It landed on my coordinator to project manage, so by default , I am now way more involved it the planning than anticipated. He got a modest but fair salary adjustment when taking on the event. I didn’t realize how much I’d also take on so in retrospect I wish I asked then. 

I will add, I enjoy my job, my salary is fair, and my CEO is a fantastic boss. But, my role has shifted so much and by supervising these additional areas, it’s going to add a lot more time and work for me. 

TLDR- Are adding new direct reports typically something that could warrant a raise? Or is my involvement in new areas of the org something that could? These areas aren’t in the job description and I think they span beyond the 5% “other duties as assigned”.

1cda4ay,How to handle coworker who “doesn’t do email”? ,"I’ll try to keep this short. I work in tech as an individual contributor. I have to work with a project manager who today, told me they “don’t do email”. 

For context, I will usually tag them in a comment within a ticket if we need their input on something. It’s rare that I even have to do this but they never respond and I end up just making a decision myself. 

Today, when they told me they “don’t do email” they said they prefer me to just DM them each time. I stand by having a paper trail in the tickets but I didn’t push back since they are above me in a way. I will comply with their request for now but I am looking for ways to improve the working relationship so I don’t have to double up my effort.  

What I really wanted to do was suggest them to create filters and labels to organize email. This is something I do because on my first day I had already received around 100 emails so I set up filters and labels for all the kinds of emails I receive, and some specific filters/labels for my team to prioritize better but I admit I am like 75% type A so I understand this may not appeal to everyone especially this project manager. I just really don’t want to have to practically babysit/micro manage this person just because they refuse to check email.

My mom has been asking me if I'm not interested in something else for a career and has outwardly told me that I should at least look into political science because she does not believe that I'll make a lot of money. (We've been middle class all our lives so if I can't make it with this I might as well do something else) She had mentioned that one of her colleagues son was working in a similar field and that couldn't make ends meet half the time. I know it's getting expensive to even breathe here but I want to know is she right?,heyhowhatdidyoudo,3,0.8100000023841858,12,1714093834,2024-04-26 01:10:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cd8gaw/can_you_guys_settle_something/,4,2024
1cd89rq,Need Guidance ,"I am at a roadblock at this point in my life and seriously need guidance from someone in the industry. 
My undergrad was in finance, when I came out of college I  landed jobs in data entry, customer support, client success work and the like. There wasn’t a straight path up until I got the opportunity to work as a Product Analyst ( which I considered to be my first big job, even after 2 years out of college.
This job entailed writing up feature requests, running automated queries in SQL, resolving identity issues, doing user testing all for the Customer Master environment. 
All was well until I got laid in November. In the meantime I obtained a Product owner certification because I really liked writing user stories and stuff like that.
Now in my 6th month of unemployment I am struggling with what to direct my job search in.
I do not possess significant SQL skills so all business analysts roles I apply to require that.
It does also seem I’m not experienced enough for a Product Owner nor Product Manager roles.
I just don’t know what to do and I am currently in my 4th month of pregnancy. It’s stressful as my husband does not make enough and I need to find something to support but it just seems like even what I have found in terms of job did not fit with what I’m looking for.

1cd7f5v,"Will the fact that I have technically not graduated, hinder me from getting jobs immediately?","Hi everyone,   
I have completed all my masters degree requirements and only the comprehensive exam portion of the degree is pending which is a capstone project submission. I will be completing the project and all other requirements in May 2024.   
Due to difficulties in my job search and my status as an international student, the college is offering to submit my exam results in December 2024, so that I don't burn the OPT clock (international students only have 90 days to find a job after graduation).   
Since I will not have any academic requirements, I am free to work full time on OPT anytime starting May 2024.   
I plan to keep applying to jobs and I am making some progress in my job search. But I was wondering if I manage to land a job before December, will it be a problem for companies to hire me since I technically will not have the degree until Dec 2024.   
If it helps, I know my college can issue me letter stating that I have completed all the requirements of the degree and have no academic requirements pending. Is this something that hiring managers would accomodate?   
Note: I am not asking about internships, I am asking about full time roles.

1cd6zzv,Two potential job offers,"I'm currently facing a career crossroads and would love to get your insights. I just finished 3rd round (of 4) interviews for two different companies and might have two job offers, and each presents unique opportunities and challenges:

1. **Job 1: Part-Time, Remote**
   - **Rate**: $70/hour for 25 hours a week
   - **Benefits**: None provided, but none needed (covered by partner)
   - **Location**: Stay in current home with a mortgage of $2600/month
   - **Role**: Niche segment within data partnership management/marketing operations

2. **Job 2: Full-Time, Requires Relocation**
   - **Salary**: $145,000 with good benefits
   - **Location**: Moving to a HCOL area, homes around $850k+ (33% increase, plus higher interest)
   - **Role**: Director title in business development and marketing

I'm trying to weigh the benefits of financial stability and remote flexibility against career growth and the impact of moving to a high-cost area. My partner works full time remotely, earning $180k, which gives us some flexibility.

Both jobs are in the industry I want to stay in.

**Questions for the community**:
- How would you evaluate these options?
- Any experiences with similar decisions?
- Insights on transitioning to a high-cost living area for a career opportunity?

1cd69dt,"Love Science, Hate the Grind.","I'm a first year in Engineering and I absolutely hate college. I was never a good ""student"" in the traditional sense. As I type, I'm failing 2 math courses. I got over 80% in the final exams of these courses. 
Why did I fail? I misread the final dates to submit the insane amount of homework. Basically, the deadline was on the next day, but at 12:59am, instead of the 11:59pm literally everything else before was. I mistakenly only saw the date and assumed it was due at 11:59pm, like everything before.
I was putting them off for a while and learning from resources like YouTube, Khan Academy, etc, since I felt that the online courses were inadequate and dated. 

I honestly hate the way things are taught at college, its all very separated out and so hard to give a damn about. Why can't it be holistic? Not to mention, being forced to take courses not relevant at all to my major. If I had to guess, it probably has to do with lining someone's pocket. 

So what should I do? I like to work on the technical design(engineering?) side of things. Customizing, Perfecting, tuning something or even making it work in the first place is what I find immense joy in. I despise having to run inside this hamster wheel of an institution to have a future.

Here's what I enjoy/am good at: 
- Cars, working on them, the tech, how they work (trains too, especially the souped up japanese ones)
- Future technologies like Solar, Nuclear Fusion, Interplanetary Rockets, Aerospace, how they work, etc.
- Computers, the mostly hardware side of it, but also a little software. 
- Basically, I like hardware. Mechanical or Electronic.

1cd5vux,How do you stop the negative feelings? ,"I graduated with a bachelor's degree in CIS, during peak covid time in 2020. During 2020-2021, I tried real hard. I applied for every job. But didn't get much satisfactory results. It really was one of the worst time for graduation. But What could  I have  done? By 2022 I kinda gave up on life. Ever since then Ive been doing one minimum wage job after another and barely getting by. After 2 years of self loathing around late 2023, I realized that everyone I know who graduated with me; they didn't give up like me. Most of them are at least making $50-60k a year. It kinda reignited the fire in me. I was ready to fight once again. But  then I realized I have so many more disadvantages now. I dont remember most things I  learned in class, I dont have much job experience in my related field, I lost touch with people from college, I dont have enough money or time (because I work full time) to go to a bootcamp, etc. I cried a little bit. Lol. But I didn't give up. I started researching on few different carrier options for me and I settled on one. I think UI/UX would the perfect field for me. Its been difficult to self learn things while working a full time job. But I am slowly getting better at  my time management. I think by july or August of this year, Ill be fully ready to apply for jobs.

1cd4x9d,"How should I ask for a raise after being with my company for 2 years, no raises or bonuses ever given?","(cross posted) 

Hey y’all! I have a huge question and don’t really have many people who are close to me that I could ask… so I’m hoping this is a good choice.

I’ve been working with a company for two years now. They’re a pretty big company with a start up vibe. I originally was hired to take care of the companies marketing. My formal title is Director of Marketing and Social Communications.

Over the two years, the company has branched off into three distinct and separate brands, all with the same needs as the “main” brand. Due to this I have created two different websites for them. I manage and create all social media across three brands. I am the go to person for issues or questions for 2 tech implementations. (This is due to my degree in Software Development) 

I create all videos in house as well as graphics. All internal communication goes through me. Any event or conferences that any of the brands do, I am responsible for all marketing. I respond to reviews across all review pages and also create and distribute press releases, in addition to also managing the PR of the companies. And I also man the support channel for the company. All communication to our clients, (which are many) are created and launched by me. This is pretty much alone. There is no one in marketing besides me. There is a contractor that the company works with that will help me when needed, but I am on my own. Obviously this is a generous expansion of my responsibilities from when I was originally hired. 

I am celebrating my work anniversary today, and throughout my tenure I have been praised for my work and how it has positively impacted the company. I have not been given a raise at all during my tenure nor any type of bonus. My pay has stayed the same since I was hired. And I have been somewhat understanding of that because my company did lay a few people off (i mean a few), just to ensure we were okay financially. At least that’s what we were told. 

Would it be completely off the mark to talk to my boss (who’s the CEO) and ask for a raise and possibly even a title change? How would I even do that? I have never been in this position before and don’t want to screw it up so I get fired or something. I like my job and the people I work with, but I really can’t get fired. I’m the only one in my family who works. 

Thank you for any input! I appreciate it! ",rozezbloom,2,1.0,2,1714084610,2024-04-25 22:36:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cd4x9d/how_should_i_ask_for_a_raise_after_being_with_my/,4,2024

I hope you are doing well.  So I am a bit in a crisis and need help.  Since high school, my dream was to go to law school and be in the courtroom.

I had very high grades in all of them, and I loved them.  APUSH a little less, but still enjoyed.  I did not like my science classes in high school.  Despite my interests, my Asian parents had my career already picked out for me- medicine.  It was very tough.  We eventually came to an agreement that I could major in psychology in undergrad, as it would work for both law and medicine, and I could then make my decision.  
I enjoyed the critical thinking aspects of my pre-medical classes.  I did not take any law classes, which I should have and I regret.  I'm pretty sure I would have enjoyed them too.  After graduation, I was again reconsidering my career path.  I found a job as a medical assistant, which I enjoyed at first.

I wanted to be a doctor, and I worked hard to do well on the MCAT.  I did.  I graduated with a 4.0 GPA as well with officer positions in 5 clubs, did research, and was a teaching assistant, along with many other activities

1cd44h1,business analysis career,"Hi, my main question is, is it worth paying a college to get certified in Data analysis?  
My background, I graduated in 2021 in Finance and minored in Business Analytics. I took several courses and learned basic skills in PowerBI, MySQL, Python, Oracle, Tableau, etc. I'm not actually the most computer-savvy guy but I really liked those courses but I would like a refresher. It's been a hot minute since taking those courses. I would say my Excel skills are intermediate-advanced.  
I have never had a job with Analytics experience- except a couple internships where we would use a lot of Excel. That's about it.  
I am currently in an MBA program, which I really enjoy but I want to make the most of my time and make sure I am lining a great job for myself upon graduation. The career I am most interested in is Data Analysis because I have some basic knowledge, enjoyed those classes, and enjoy solving puzzles. I would also love to work remotely someday, and it seems like data analytics is trending that way.  
So, should I purchase a cheap course online, or purchase actual database tools and teach myself using YouTube/free online projects/etc.  
Any advice to get my foot in the door to a business analysis job (currently working full time at my Uni's library). Any tips to make my resume stronger, which database to learn first, etc.  
TIA for all feedback.

The skillset for doing my job was very specific. However, since I got a new manager early this year, she change the duties of our team dramatically. She wanted our team to go above and beyond by cross-selling the app to more teams in the company. 

My work went from 90% technical to 80% of doing the work of a project management or a business analyst and 20% of doing technical things. Plus the overall workload skyrocketed and I'm on the verge of burnout. 

As a tech person, this is tough for me. Not only that I don't care for project mangement and business analysis, they are the career paths I have always wanted to avoid even when opportunities were handed to me in the past. I'm an introvert nerd and work that revolves around communication skill is more challanging than anything else for me. 

Now I hate my job, every minute of it. And I don't think there's an end to it. Upper managers probably don't want me to I would either excel at doing things I hate or I'll get stuck here.

Rather than going back to all I’ve known so far in my adult life which is going to school and having a part time job on the side. A big factor in going back for an associates is job security and have something solid to fall back onto (as my general studies degree isn’t something specific).

1cd2znc,"Have a Job in finance, boss told me to go do labour work, I refused.  Am I in the wrong? ","Hello everyone, 

I am a 4th year finance student looking to work in investments, (Studying for CFA). 

I recently got a job as a financial controller doing payroll, invoicing, and job costing etc. for a smallish business. 
I used to work at a bank, but left because this company offered me 20% more plus a gas card and is paying for my phone. 

Today my a manger (not my reporting manager but still one of the bosses) told me to go and load trucks at their warehouse for the rest of the day (about 4 hours). I was surprised and said “that’s not part of my job duties…. I work in finance” they just told me “we pay you to do whatever we need you to do” 

I said absolutely not and we can rediscuss this in the future, worked for the rest of the day then went home. 
Is this normal? Should I be looking elsewhere? 

I worked labour for years. I’m getting a degree to get out of it, not just be forced back into it. How do I explain this to my boss? 

(Please no recommendation to just quit, I love this job and want to make it work. Just need to know what to say) ",Remarkable_Animal_18,454,0.9300000071525574,468,1714079657,2024-04-25 21:14:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cd2znc/have_a_job_in_finance_boss_told_me_to_go_do/,4,2024
1cd2xhu,"WTF am I even Doing?!? Written Communications, Inside Sales & Customer Service…What Next?","Currently I am in a position where my job offers a lot of flexibility for a working mom, like myself, to leave early or call in if my child has an appointment, is sick, etc. They also have excellent health benefits, pay well (given my position) and I love every member of the team I work with. The downside is, although the pay is good for what my job entails, there is no room for growth within the company. The problem with this is that I live in California and I need to make more than I do (currently making $75k-ish) in order to make any meaningful changes to mine and my families lives and, since there is no advancement opportunity where I am, I am forced to confront the reality of making a change, professionally, to meet my goals. Money is not my only goal either, definitely a strong motivator, but I am not challenged in any way with what I do. I spend most of my day quoting material, entering customer orders and watching YouTube. Where do I go from here? 

I have worked at various manufacturers, even currently, for about 10years. I have also worked in retail, home care for seniors (In home Consultations, creating care plans, etc.) and have an A.S. In Psychology. My positions have  been Sales, Customer Service, Supervisor and Account Manager for a quick summary. I learn quickly, am really good at breaking down complex concepts into simple terms (once I understand them) and always quickly become the go to person for communication. This is my favorite skill set and the one I get recognized for the most at every single job almost immediately. People will vent to me and seem to value my empathetic and, usually, very diplomatic responses. I always get asked “can you please read this over and make sure it sounds good?”, “here’s my problem I need to communicate. Can you help me make it sound nice?”, “can you read this and tell me what they are talking about?” or some variation of those types of questions. The compliments on my communications skills, customer service, and the time I spend solving these types of problems are what really excite me and make my work days more enjoyable. I am convinced these skills are also the only reason I was any good at sales and am trying to find a way that I can turn those skills into a career, whether that be in consulting on the side or even an entirely new career path I have yet to consider. So…

What next? What would you do if you were me? How can I translate my skill set into a well paid, challenging and rewarding career path that carries some level of security and desirability in todays  current market? 

Thank you for taking the time read through all of that. I know it was a bit wordy but I am feeling stuck and a little lost lately so it just came out. I thought that, by my current age of 35, I would already know what I wanted to be when I grew up but here I am. I would really appreciate any and all advice that you can spare.

1cd2p82,Should he stay or move on?,"Keeping this non-specific for obvious reasons.

""Jack"" is a scientist in industry, just below executive level. He likes his work and most of the folks he works with. Pay is commensurate with his field and experience. Last year, the company was purchased by venture capitalists, who seem to be combining the company with another in their portfolio, firing ""redundant"" people and outsourcing many positions and departments. The company is changing and it's quite anxiety-provoking. 

The owners have promised Jack a bonus, but not yet. They also want to meet with him next month about an ""exciting secret,"" which he is not to discuss with anyone, especially his supervisor. Meanwhile, he hears about changes at his company from clients first rather than anyone at his company. 

Jack has options, positions doing similar work and even some executive positions. Nevertheless, he is reluctant to leave the current company because of the promised bonus and possible promotion/raise in the ""secret."" 

**What should Jack do?**

a) Get out now and accept one of these other positions

b) Accept another position, but not start until after the ""secret"" is revealed and his curiosity is satisfied

c) Stick it out at the current company, where the bonus, raise, and promotion are on the horizon

1cd0gdl,Career Advice,"   
Alright so this is going to be a long one.  
I graduated with my bachelors of biology degree in 2022, while i was doing my undergrad I was pre-pharm but later on in my undergrad I no longer wanted to do it(just because of ochem, I never shadowed or worked to get the experience: something i regret that I should've done also i was scared that what if I didnt get accepted), others recommended I do PA, but it was sort of late as I had already graduated but hadn't taken Anatomy. So I was like thats probably not an option anymore. So I decided to do a master in healthcare admin or information systems, I was informed by many people that its very hard to find a job for MHA, therefore I decided to do MIS, so currently I'm in my 2nd last semester, and I graduate next semester fall2024.  
okay so I was in class today and i randomly had a thought: what if I had just taken that risk and pushed myself for PA school or pharm schoo? I don't kno like, I really like the healthcare field but I also like the corporate world. Also I was told that pharmacy is being very saturated and all. So I feel like I had alot of negative things being said about pharm. Then coming into MIS alot of my family is in it so I don't really feel that well because then I think to myself why did I do BS in biology when i was gonna end up in MIS. Like in MIS alot of people ask me why did I change to MIS like Bio is such an hard degree and then you just ended up in MIS, which makes me even more upset, that yeah I honestly shouldn't had done this and sticked with what my parents and I had planned: Pharmacy. I honestly need to go and study but I keep getting these thoughts, which make me depressed, like I was capable of achieving something but I just didn't try. I don't know what I should do, like just now I was just looking up PA/PHARM school requirements, thinking that maybe once I finish my master then I could apply if I really wanted to but then at the same time I am just like why did you waste your 2 years in getting your master that completely different if you were gonna do something else. I could go back and do pharmacy since I have all of the prereq I would have to get all of the hours though since I don't have any at the moment. For PA I would have to go back and take the anatomy course. So i don't really know what to do. If I just do MIS I don’t know if I will be fulfilled since I'm doing something completely different than healthcare.  
Also I'm now being told that MIS degrees are not that worth it, like its a very low salary and when I was thinking about pharmacy back then I was told that MIS degree could make the same as pharmacist.  
Just to mention I did an internship with GM financial summer 2023 and now returning back as an intern for summer 2024  
Please give me some advice, also what is the typical starting salary, work life balance etc look like for MIS, pharmacy, PA.

1cd0fhu,Career advice needed?,"Hi, so I’m currently 22 and in my first year of an apprenticeship in engineering, I like my current job that I’m in but really don’t like my course and I’m not performing well, the course is only going to get harder throughout the end of this year and the next 2 years. I’ve been offered a job separate from the apprenticeship working with installations and repairs of fitness centres which involves travel and considerably more money than I am on now. I think it’s a great opportunity and I think it’s a job I would enjoy doing plus the no stress about not performing in my apprenticeship as I learn much better by doing. 

This new job is in a rapidly growing fitness centre so I think it could lead to an even better job in the long run. You’re probably wondering what the issue is.
My mother is completely against this saying that I never finish anything even though I’m just trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. She says I’m only thinking about the short term money and that I should stay where I am. She felt the same way when I started the apprenticeship but has since told me I was right for choosing this path.

In my opinion I don’t think it was even a waste of time doing this year as an apprentice because the reason I’ve been offered this new job is based of the skills and training I’ve gotten in the last year.

Do you think I’m right for leaving my apprenticeship to get a job that I’m interested in won’t be stressing out all the time about not doing well in my course or should I stay where I am?",BuffaloApart8135,1,1.0,4,1714073822,2024-04-25 19:37:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cd0fhu/career_advice_needed/,4,2024

1ccyo2b,Need advice  (very long post ahead),"After 5 years working in an interior design firm which sounds fancy but I mostly sat in front of a pc all day doing 3D modeling, with occasional visits to clients.

During the 5 years, no raise no evolution. So I quit and decided to do interior design on my own. 

And I did get work ! Clients were satisfied with my designs and made some good money (made more than my salary in 10 days) but I didn't get any more clients since then. 

So I had like a confidence spike and then it went down, but I knew that It's in fact possible and more profitable. 

 It came to my mind that it moght be better to work for another firm again to stabilize the income while building my own network. 

After some emailing and job hunting, I went to 2 interviews and they both want me in. 
 One is a firm they offered a better starting salary than what I had with (raise promesses, less 3D modeling and more infield work). Which is cool. But they promessed a lot, and seemed really pushy to get me to sign. I went and worked for them one day and guess what task they gave me : 3D modeling and worked overtime the 1 st day lol. 

The second company is one that promotes sells 3d software for architects and engineers, and they want a sales manager who has technical knowledge. They offered the same salary as the firm. With renewable contracts where you can re negotiate salary every year or so. The work is (9 to 5) about finding design/construction companies, identify their needs and convince them to buy via emailing/ phone calls and meetings. 

And I don't know if I really want to risk it with the firm, do some more 3D modeling overtime in hopes of better times, Or switch to sales which is kinda new to me.

1ccyj1l,"Lack ""curiousity"" in my job, need advice on finding the right career path.","TLDR: I'm hoping to hear some advice/feedback or maybe even just stories of people who may have found themselves in similar positions before. I feel lost and stuck after having graduated a year ago.

  
I graduated about a year ago with a finance degree and got hired into a finance rotational program. They assigned me my first role (they didn't ask me what I wanted to do or take into account my prior experience). I hate the role I've been placed in, but thankfully I'm nearing my second rotation soon. 

  
Since starting the job, I've felt a bit resentful and frustrated since the role isn't what I would like to do long term career wise and doesn't teach me many technical skills. I joined a rotational program since I thought it might help me explore what I wanted to do longer term, but being placed into a random role hasn't given me much besides learning a few things about my working style. I'm not sure if it's fair to say that your job should provide you anything more than money, but I want a job where I feel I can work towards something (like achieving a certain position or just improving at the job in general). 

I have typically been a pretty motivated and outgoing person in the past, but since I started working this job it feels like I don't know where to put my energy towards. The main motivation for people at this company seems like it's to work there way to the top, but sometimes I feel like most of them don't care what it is they are doing. I find operations dreadfully boring and my boss says I should thinking about moving away from the business side of things since I lack ""curiosity"". He's said this multiple times and it always makes me feel a bit hopeless. In all fairness, I don't dig too deep into things at my job and ask too many questions, but I feel like this has more to do with the lack of interest in the subjects that my team addresses. I'm not curious about operational procedures, regulations, etc., so I don't feel heavily motivated to dig deeper into things. However looking at the people around me, I can't tell whether they have different motivations, have more of a genuine curiosity for this stuff, or just more disciplined.

  
The times in my role where I have gotten to work on code or solve problems, I have enjoyed. My boss thinks I should lean more into coding, but I don't think I could get to the intensity level of most developers. And I do really like thinking about the business side of things. I did venture capital internships where I found it fascinating to learn and think about their business models, strategies, product development, etc.. So I feel like I would like to get more towards that side of finance, but it is pretty difficult to get into for those without an Ivy degree or connections.

  
Maybe he's right, maybe I like curiosity in this field and should consider a career shift. I chose finance in college since it was the first thing that seemed interesting and made money. Maybe I was meant for some other career and I'm just trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

In any case, I guess I'm just feeling lost and don't know how to determine what my next career move should be. Depending on the second role they offer me, I'll consider leaving. But if I do, I'm not sure what career I will find the most success and interest/passion in. Does anyone have advice on how to determine your ideal career path? Or how to make career changes?",Shoddy_Apple12,1,1.0,0,1714069540,2024-04-25 18:25:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ccyj1l/lack_curiousity_in_my_job_need_advice_on_finding/,4,2024

1ccy6o1,"I recently got a new job that I absolutely love, however, I am a temp. I want to stay long term AND switch to a different position. Read below. ","So I got hired within healthcare labeled as a “Business Operations Specialist.” However, the label does not match the job. I sit at a receptionist desk for 8 hours, staring at my empty email, and answering at max 3 calls a day. 

I’m paid to sit here. And I’m not paid well either. I get paid $16/hr. I would need at MINIMUM $19/hr to survive where I’m at. 

Now, aside from the position, I LOVE the opportunity. I’m already within healthcare, I have so much experience up my sleeve that I could bring to the Administrative table. I WANT to stay, but I’m only a temp. :( 

I drafted this email, but please, please give me advice on how to fix this email or what to say to show my dedication for working and growing within this company. 

“Hello and good afternoon____,

As you are aware, my stay here is on limited time with my departure date getting closer every day.
I would like to discuss the possibility of making my role permanent. 

Through [redacted staffing agency], I was placed here for my Business Operations Specialist position. I absolutely adore my team and my position. If possible, I would like to ask if perhaps there is another position available that I can be transferred to.

I would be requesting to stay within an admin role. The position I was doing felt more like a receptionist role, one that was too predictable, with no growth or challenges.

I would like to help support this company by being more productive and useful and would like to use the skills I already have to move up within this astounding company. 

If there are any opportunities whatsoever, please email me as soon as possible so we can set a time to discuss.

With appreciation,”

1ccxo94,Seeing my role slowly dwindle,"I work in a public sector setting. Funding is always a challenge and every few years there's a big push to cut back, freeze new hires etc. Only the very critical roles are being replaced; and even in my team a number of people have been laid off. I have thrived here for over 15 years but lately in the last 6 months or so I find myself getting less and less to do, being left out of meetings and discussions and not really approached for much at all. I am in a project role and my project is being cut back due to financial pressures. The challenge is: I am about 5 years from retirement. So while I am fully up to date and trained and routinely do professional development to stay abreast of developments in my field... I am older and I think there's a reluctance to invest much in me because well... they know I will retire. 

At this point, to be honest, all I want is to stay employed for as long as possible. Getting a job in your 60s is extremely difficult so I'm just wanting to hang on and ride it out. I'm pushing for opportunities but there are many times where I'm told ""oh, so-and-so is already doing that"" or ""oh, we already have someone lined up for that"".

1ccwv9e,Move from tiktok telemarketing to bank's call centre? (UK),"TLDR: On a graduate visa and finding it difficult to find jobs despite experience at renowned marketing agencies and master's degree, should I switch to a basic customer service job at a UK bank so that I can get a family visa and improve my chances at finding a job in the UK?

I'm currently working an average of 20 hours a week for as an analyst for a tiktok telemarketing company (I.e. I decide on which products to sell, when to stop and start broadcasts to optimise income etc), and believe I'll have the opportunity to move into a 37.5hr/week job at a bank's call centre as a customer service centre, and need some advice on whether I should take the job.

For context I have been in my current tiktok role for around 7 months but feel my growth has really started to halt. Firstly, the company is not from the UK and is quite dodgy with its contracts. I am currently on a 0 hours contract after being moved off an ""internship contract"" (whatever that means) but this rarely drops below 20 hours / week in reality. Secondly, I do a lot of the ""full time"" worker's work for them, and work out of thr hours I'm paid to work for for selecting and ordering products etc. Despite having quite a significant role in the company being the 2nd longest tenure in the tiktok telemarketing department and being heavily involved in the full time worker's work, I am not invited to client meetings and sometimes feel excluded from the conversation, so it is difficult to stay motivated when working long (some of which are unpaid) hours.

Herein lies the problem I'd really like to grow my career in the marketing space and am especially interested in advertising agencies but have acquiesced to 'take what I can get.' I already have a year of experience working in a graduate role at 2 of the ""big four"" advertising firms (I changed halfway through the year due to being offered a better position) prior to coming to the UK to do my master's. Despite my masters being from one of the better RG universities and having this experience, as well as having my CV reviewed and it being in good shape, the only job I have found in marketing is my current tiktok one. Could this be because I'm on a graduate visa (expiring early 2025)? 

My partner is british and we are married, our combined income with the new customer service job would mean we meet the requirements for a family visa, would this give me a better chance at applying for big firms?

So, should I change job to customer service to earn a higher salary, or stay in tiktok telemarketing to build up experience? I'm slightly worried my CV makes me look like a job hopper having changed graduate roles after 6 months and then going to do a master's in the UK 6 months later?",CivilFork,2,1.0,0,1714066009,2024-04-25 17:26:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ccwv9e/move_from_tiktok_telemarketing_to_banks_call/,4,2024
1ccwt7a,how to deal with a new manager that doesn't want to learn the processes?,"We got a new manager about 6 months ago so hes been just studying to understand all the basics and now i think hes almost caught up.

But for some reason, he doesn't want to learn the actual process that we do on the daily basis. It just feels like he just wants to put on the manager pants and tell people what to do

Now this is causing us more time wasted to explain the technicality behind it instead of him just learning the process

He asks so many questions regarding the processes repeatedly when it could all just be prevented if he just learned it, and there is already a written procedure but doesn't bother to look first. (which i've already mentioned numerous times where it is)

He's also asking me questions about things that he should be finding the answers on his own like the managerial aspects of it. But when I do give advises he goes on for hours, he likes to talk out loud his own thoughts, which is cutting off so much time off of my schedule to deal with other things that's more important. At the same time though he doesn't want us to work over time

How do I further my career?,"So for background I was a restaurant service manager for 8 years, left that and went to water mitigation as a technician. Did that for a year then became a Crew Chief(a supervisory role.) Left from the company that hired me as a CC to go to a different company(that my wife works at) to also be a CC, with the expectation that it would eventually turn into a Project Manager role.

Where do I go from here? I am going to ask if the company has other roles available, but I’m not sure if this will be successful.

1cctyo8,Back to a stressful role for $30k more?,"To set the stage-
I am a working mom of 2. Currently full time WFH. Was with my company for 7 years before leaving. My husband also works fully remote but has to go out during the mornings to see clients. 
My old company went through a rough patch in the area I was in, and I was over worked in my specific role. I went to another role in the company for a year, then left for my new role. 

When I left my old company I was at $122k. Usually 12% bonus. Healthcare was better (cheaper and better coverage), 401k match a few percent lower but they also dump 6% of your salary in once a year (like a defined contribution).

New company offered me $135k, 10% bonus, and the PTO shakes out about equal (ends up being a little bit less because my old company offers more holidays and leaving early). I’ve been there less than a year. 

Old company has gone through some beneficial changes, good leaders have come back, and they have openings. Funny how they can now offer me about $170k. Their bonus structure is changing to 18-20% so that, while not guaranteed to be that high (based on performance and could fall into the 10-12% range) it will be higher. Only catch is I need to be in office (45 min commute) 2-3 days a week. They’re very flexible and don’t care if I need to come late or leave early and finish the day at home. 

As much as I was looking forward to WFH- I feel like this would be a good change as personally I do better when in social settings, under high stress to deliver, etc. 
Basically, my new job is great if I just want to coast.

1cctx6o,Should I leave my consulting job without something lined up,"First of all, I want to say I know how fortunate I should feel and how much of a first world problem is. In fact, I feel bad even bringing this up to my friends and that's why I wanted to give here a try

I'm in my late 20s and am in a director position at a consulting firm. I perform well in my role and am well compensated. However, with my age, I feel like most other companies would think I'm too young for this type of role. Additionally, most other jobs in my current city will pay up to $100k less (I'm not in a hub like NYC or SF and can't move to one for 2 more years). 

But I am getting so tired of the consulting life style. I hate answering to so many people from both the client side and the consulting firm. I also dislike that I don't have control of the scope of work with the client, with project scope and Team sizes changing on a whim. My current client is also very toxic to both my team and me to the point where I am having trouble protecting them. I honestly really just want to quit and just take a break from working for a little while.

I have paid off all my student loans, my car, and about a third of my mortgage. The mortgage is also self-sufficient as I rent out my house. I have more than enough saved up to not work for a long time if I didn't want to (5-6 years). I also have enough in my 401k/ira that I probably can stop contributing and living a comfortable retirement. 

On paper, I can just leave and not think about working for a long time... However, the 1 or 2 friends I have talked to said that I should not just walk away from some a well compensated job and that it will be really tough to find another if I take too long off.

Furthermore, I'm just scared of what's to come if I quit. My parents are fine and own a house, but they were never rich and has less in savings in their early 60s than me right now... what if they get sick... I'm also not married yet and I feel like that will also be a big chuck of my savings if I don't get another job by then.

The past couple of years have been a little rough, business wise and culture wise. I am looking to get out, but have formed great relationships with my boss and close colleagues. I recently spoke with another company and they want me to join the team starting this summer. I was referred to them by a former employee of my current company.  I haven't really been in contact with this former employee except once when he asked for my permission to give them my name. This former employee had a share in the company and are still working with our current owner on finalizing a buyout plan.  The company has not been doing well the past year revenue and gross profit wise. Now I don't know the details of everything, but I hear nothing of bad things from my boss that this former employee is trying to screw over our owner by trying to get the most out of the deal even thought the company is not doing well. 

I have always had a good relationship with this former employee and appreciate him thinking of me for this up and coming position. This position would really elevate my career and get me out of a position that has very little growth. 

I don't want to burn bridges with everyone at my current company, but I feel like when I turn in my notice and tell them who I will be working for they will be upset and likely blackball me. Now I usually don't worry about what others think, but I just feel like this is a big moral dilemma knowing that everyone at my current employer dislikes this former employee for leaving at a time when the company needs improvement and has money in the company.

For example on my remote days I can travel out of state and work from whatever location.  

For the 170k offer I’m sitting on: the work environment is unknown, the commute is a lot longer(about 45 minutes to an hour) although it is also hybrid 3 days onsite, and there will be more restrictions because I will have a higher security clearance. For example I will only be able to work from an approved location when I’m offsite so I’ll have to take PTO every time I travel, I will also have to go through an approval process to travel outside the country, etc.  

All things considered, I came to my current company with this offer letter to see if we could work something out. They had me interview for a promotion, which I got an offer for, but only for $140k. I asked and am waiting for a response to try to push it to $150-$160k but I think I’m pushing my luck here. I expect them to say no, in which case I will almost certainly take the $170k offer over $140k but I am still on the fence because I do love my team and am comfortable work-wise.

1ccr31c,How useful is a business + engineering dual degree vs solely Mechanical Engineering degree?,"I'm an incoming college Freshman and I'm currently deciding between two colleges. For some background, I’m interested in both business (more consulting & management side) and engineering. However, I’m not yet sure what career I want to go into and I need to figure out in order to choose the best college for me. I can either go to Georgia Tech for Mechanical engineering or do a 5-year dual degree program with Emory University and Georgia Tech (3 years at Emory for a business degree and 2 at GT for engineering).

I’m aware of the jobs I’d get with just a mechanical engineering degree. I’m mainly looking for insight into the types of jobs I can go into with both an engineering and business dual degree. What are some engineering jobs that would value a business education and business jobs that would value an engineering degree? Could I go into these same jobs with just an engineering degree? If I decide I just want to go into purely engineering later, would having both a business and engineering degree harm me or help for technical positions? Finally if I decide I want to pursue an MBA later in life, would having both an engineering and business degree out me at an advantage over other applicants at top business schools?

Tldr: Would pursuing a dual degree in engineering and business be worth it/open more opportunities than just an engineering degree?

1ccqowk,I feel I’ve been unfairly demoted.,"I’ve been at my job for 2.5 years. About 1.5 years ago, I began working on a project with another developer and some product owners. There was no formal role of “team lead” but as certain tasks came up and nobody else stepped forward, I began taking the responsibility. Thus, I became the de facto team lead even as we added more devs to the team. I’ve tried to guide us in the direction that leads to product completion with a sensible feature set. I’ve done this in addition to my development responsibilities. I have made some mistakes, and my manager and I have discussed things as they’ve come up, but I’ve worked to pivot and redirect focus as needed.

This last weekend, we went live at a new site. This site is the first that uses the project we have developed.

I was originally slated to travel on site for the deployment, but I made it clear that I would not be available for the weekend or the evenings of Monday and Tuesday due to the Passover holiday. I offered alternatives, and eventually it was decided another dev would go in my place.

On Monday morning, I learned the rollout was challenging, but successful.

There is a Teams channel for new deployment issues. I was keeping an eye on it, but every issue was getting picked up so I didn’t see any need to step in. I was instead working on another issue for the sprint. At one point, I was called into a meeting to help resolve an issue, and I had it taken care of within a half hour, which is a pretty quick turnaround.

Wednesday, we were supposed to have a sprint retro meeting (what went well for the sprint and what didn’t). Before we got started, my manager asked how the site was going, and turned to me. Honestly, I wasn’t sure because nothing I knew of required my help. Nor was I prepared for a review on existing issues. I feel that is on me - maybe I should have been more focused on the go-live issues than in concluding the next sprint. I also feel like I was “gotcha’ed.” Eventually, we got a list of issues and did the retro. Then my manager asked me to stop by his office.

When I did, I was informed that I was not working out as a team lead, and I would be relieved of the role. Note again, a role that I defined by nobody else being assigned or claiming responsibility. The reason given was solely my lack of awareness on the state of the go-live. As he put it, a year and a half of work, and where was I?

In retrospect, I feel this assessment is unfair. I was online and checking the channel, but maybe I wasn’t as aggressive as he wanted in making sure issues were resolved as I could have been. I also feel there is data missing. My manager isn’t normally inclined to make a decision based on one data point.

In the moment, I was more concerned about having an emotional reaction, so I just said “okay,” and that was it.

My confidence has taken a big hit, and I worked hard to push that aside to get other tasks done for the day.

My paranoia is making me wonder if I’m going to be phased out of other senior dev responsibilities, and if people are displeased about me and saying things behind my back.

I wonder if there’s something more that I should do - perhaps get it in writing by email that my responsibilities have changed and why. I was thinking of writing my manager to recap our meeting for clarification and a paper trail. I feel like I need to do something more to protect myself but I also don’t want to make things worse by doing the wrong thing.

Any suggestions?",HeroSteveGo,2,0.75,5,1714048145,2024-04-25 12:29:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ccqowk/i_feel_ive_been_unfairly_demoted/,4,2024
1ccq4lu,"Should I ask for more, or would it look bad? ","Hey all, just looking for some quick advice. Would love to know what people think (my question is at the end).

I interviewed for what's basically a service/hospitality job, and it went well; they seemed really interested and trustworthy of my abilities even though I don't have service experience. I do have four years of work experience though. 

They asked my salary expectations and I said 16/hour. I picked up on the fact that they didn't love that. For context, minimum wage where I live is around 12.50/hour. In my head however I thought ""if they give me 15, or even 14, I'll be happy."" I asked for 16 because I've been working for four years and have never made lots of money, and know I'm a hard worker, and feel like that's what I'm worth. Prior to this potential job I had been making 13/hour. I think if this job offered the same, I would have accepted, though reluctantly. 

Offer came through and it's even less, about minimum wage (12.80). I thought on it for a day, and accepted the offer saltily. Some thoughts/context: 

* I need to be employed asap. Maybe they knew this.
* I was kind of excited for the position and the experience it could bring. When I saw the pay, that shifted and I concluded before accepting that I'll just see this as a temp job and look for something new in the meantime.
* It may be valuable experience.
* The business is a franchise, and will open in my city for the first time. I can see why perhaps it has to prove its success before paying it's bottom workers more (though I obviously don't agree it should).
* I was thinking if I prove myself within the first month I could then negotiate more.
* The position was kind of red flaggy - during the interview process, it felt like the job was guaranteed to be mine and like they were almost scrambling to fill positions and get ready for opening.

After sending my acceptance email, they sent a tax form to fill out. With/before sending this, I'm considering sending another professional email saying something like: 

""Once again, thanks for the opportunity. During the interview process, I asked for 16/hour, but the offer indicates the position to be 12.80 per hour. While I'm excited to be a part of the team, I consider myself to be worth more than this rate. I'd like to inquire about the possibility of higher pay before fully committing to the role. Thanks in advance and look forward to hear from you."" 

Should I trust my instinct and do this, or should I accept the position and ask for more later in hopes of not being ""exploited"" from the get-go? What do you think?

1ccnv5h,Money versus family time,"I am hoping for some thoughts from those who have been there and done that. I am a 47m married with children 5 and 9. We are comfortable  but not super rich.

I currently work in a very specific corporate job for a company located 15 mins from my home, making $180k including bonus. I have been there 13 years and the company is super flexible and accomodating. This allows me to drop my kids at school every morning, go to soccer practice twice a week and be on the school board - all of which I value. The downside is that the company due to its unique structure is disfunctional which due to my very specific role is producing incredible levels of stress on me to keep the company afloat. This is unlikely to change in the future. I would like to leave.

I have tomorrow an interview with a more conventional company where the stress levels promise to be lower. It also pays $250k including bonus. The downside? It is on the other side of my city, more that 1 hour away and I have been told by the recruiter, the flexibility I currently enjoy is not an option.

So just wait for another opening right? Except for my very specific job, openings are very rare ~4 per year in my entire country (of 5 million people) and competition is fierce. So if I turn this one down, I do not know when the next chance to leave my current company will arise.

1ccnpbf,Stable job vs dream job,"Hello all,

I am working in a good company in a good position. The job is ok but it is not something I would like to do for very long.

I recently got an offer from my dream company to do my dream job. However, this company recently laid off many people due to financial problems of the company. The recruiting manager confirmed that the offer that was sent to me still exists. However, there is no guarantee that the new company might not lay off more people in the future and that I might not get laid off soon after I join the company. Also, the offer is from another city (a bigger city in the same country) where rental apartments are expensive and they are very difficult to find.

Both my current and potential new boos are very nice. (I know my new boss very well). And I do not care about the salary difference between these two positions as it is very small.

I am in the RF engineering field (which is a very niche field in Electrical engineering). I finished my PhD one year ago where I was working on antenna arrays. I have been working as an RF engineer (only RF circuit parts no antennas) for the last year and have been looking for an antenna array job as I want to work with them in the long term. My new position is antenna array engineer position. Both positions are on the same levels as design engineer (which is higher than entry-level but lower than senior).

1ccmvbn,"Stay a banker, become a mid-size CFO or look for a treasury role in a large-cap","So, the title says it all. I'm currently a banker (4 years) and I am in serious talks with a mid-size company to become their CFO. The company is family owned, stable, mid-size, profitable. I would take responsibility for finance, IT, Admin and HR. 

  
My ultimate goal was always to become the CFO of a larger sized enterprise. Becoming the CFO of a mid-cap is probably a must before - no large-cap is going to hire a young banker with no corporate experience as the CFO right away. However, I'm not sure if that regional small-cap is a good fit (I have a very international background and also like the flair of a large corporation). On the other hand, as their CFO I would have the chance to really do the ""on the ground work"" and gain that needed experience, while still having the title on my CV. I'm also in talks with a multi-billion dollar enterprise to start working in their treasury department. 

  
Assuming I would get both jobs with roughly equal pay - what is the best next step? Go for the CFO role, gain a lot of general corporate experience, however in a mid-cap, or go for a treasury role, focusing again only on finance and banking topics, but in a large-cap with a super international exposure and reputation. The transition from mid-cap CFO to large-cap CFO might be easier (argument: I'm already a CFO, so I have a proven track record) than from treasury to CFO, but I'm not sure.

My boss can just take me off the schedule and be like, ""Sorry, no fill-in work right now"" and then hire five new fill-ins.   I've been there 10 years and worked for lots of different bosses.  My general strategy has been to keep my head down and tolerate the bad ones.  The current boss, though, is a total idiot who makes people's lives miserable.  I finally told our union rep she could mention to his boss during their regular meetings that I was having trouble with this guy.  Now this woman wants to meet with BOTH of us together.  What do I do here?  If I'm honest in front of this guy about what a dipshit he is, he may take me off the temp schedule, and I'd be out of a job (although that may not be the case.  We've already come to blows in a screaming match once and he kept hiring me). If I don't say anything, I feel like I'm letting myself and my colleagues down.  And I have a lot of pent up anger over this idiot.

1cchlvc,Your advice is needed and appreciated on my Marketing journey,"Hi all, 

I want your advice on the career roadmap I am going through right now. I am going to turn 24 in May this year, and in April, I will have 2 years of marketing experience in the corporate sector.   
  
I need your help figuring out how to get better at what I am doing right now (marketing). Two years ago I started as novice ""associate content writer"" and now I have made some progression in my career. Right now I am a marketing strategist and also managing a client as a project manager in my organization.  
  
I believe there's a lot to learn and consume on the internet right now and sometimes I felt like its an content overload. Can you recommend some roadmap or a journey guide through which I can understand that I am on the right path and peacefully focus on learning and growing.   
  
I hope I will learn from your experience. Thank you!",Hamxaaz,1,1.0,0,1714014648,2024-04-25 03:10:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cchlvc/your_advice_is_needed_and_appreciated_on_my/,4,2024
1cch0yr,Am I a misclassified employee?,"I (24F) started working for a small construction company in Florida (like 8 office employees) as the controller’s assistant. At the time, they gave me a 1099 which was fine imo bc I wanted flexibility and I was working less than 20 hours and had another part time job. Over time, my responsibilities grew. I stopped working at my other job because this one required me to be available at certain times so I could not go to the other office. I started submitting the certified payroll on Fridays which is considered a deadline and my boss told me to submit it earlier in the day. I also started assisting with accounts receivable. I do a million other things because my boss is the HR, accounting, and administrative person and then I work with the PM for invoicing.  

At first it was flexible and I was able to do things the way I wanted them to and when I wanted them to but in the past few months it has gotten horrible. They wanted me to work more, then a few weeks later said I couldn’t work more than 20 hours. Then they said I could, but I had to write everything I did which was extremely time consuming. Then they asked me if I could work 40 hrs to do the invoicing for ALL projects (I do around 70% of them) and I said no I can only do 33 (because the point of this job was to have income while I was looking for other jobs and they never mentioned anything about switching me to W2). 

I was told to tell my boss if I’m going to be late, which is fine. I’ve been reamed for not printing and putting a contract in a project binder even though I knew that was never my job. There was a week my boss was out of town, and while she was out I was able to get several pending items resolved since I didn’t have her asking me for a million things. I was excited to tell her abt the issues that were finally resolved and well she ended up bitching at me because I hadn’t updated the birthday calendar bc either I forgot or I needed to ask her something about it. She said “what do you get done in a day? Because I get a lot done and it seems like you don’t do anything”. I had a huge breakdown after that phone call because she was practically yelling at me and I thought I had gotten a lot done and no one has ever spoken to me the way she did other than my mom. 

One time, she was on a call with someone and randomly gave me the phone and told me to answer their questions. This required me having to go through a contract and look for things that I had never been trained on. It was in front of my coworkers and I had no idea what they were talking about so it was quite humiliating and she ended up saying “it’s so I can learn”. How do I learn contract language from that??? 

This past Thursday, I was leaving the office at 5:30 and I told the PM that I would send an invoice to him, later that night, so they could revise it in the morning, and in the morning, I would submit a different invoice I needed to do, since that one doesn’t need revising. My boss overheard and said I have to submit it before 11. I ended up just doing both things that night so I wouldn’t have to do it in the morning. The next morning, my boss calls me at 9:30 AM, even though I start at 10, saying that the PM sent the feedback for the invoice I had sent the night before, at 8:30 AM and that she had told me I need to be available at 9 to make revisions to the invoice. I know she did not say that because i had even sent a voicenote to my boyfriend right after work detailing the convo. She called me again later that day, talking to me with so much attitude, saying the invoices are top priority, and we went back and forth. She said “you’re a 24 year old woman, a grown adult, I do not need to be telling you to answer emails and to do your job. I am very flexible with you and let you start at 10, etc…”. I told her that from what I understood, the only thing that was asked was for me to submit the invoice before 11 but she just denied it and insulted me and also said I should’ve stayed later at the office the day before to do it even though I left at 5:30 and worked for two more hours when I got home and got the job done… it made no sense. 

On Monday, she requested early in the morning to send her an update on the pending invoice payments. Usually she needs this by 2 or 3, so it gives me time to contact people to get the latest update. I started at 10 and was working on an invoice that I wanted to send before noon. At 11:30, she texts me saying she sent me an email and that she needs it by 12. I responded saying I will send it to her. 
5 minutes later, I get an email from her saying “you are supposed to be connected by 10:00 am, checking your email and getting pending tasks done. I shouldn’t have to be texting you to reminding you or alert you that I sent an email. You need to work on this, thank you.”
I responded saying “I had seen your email, and I should have let you know I read it. I was unaware that this was needed by noon until your message at 11:30 so I was working on the invoice as it has been communicated that that is priority.” 
She responded saying that this is the same level priority (everything is priority apparently which makes it very hard to prioritize), emails that are sent to me need to be responded to as I’m reading them, and that my shift is from 10-6pm. FYI I don’t work all those hours, those are just the hours I need to be available. I also never told her I can work until 6. 

Today, I tried to leave 10 minutes before 5 because I completed my tasks, and she was like “wait where are you going? I thought you worked until 6?” I told her usually I’m fine working past 5 if I’m finishing something but I never said I work until 6 and that today I had to go visit my grandma in the hospital. I asked to see the paper where she wrote I work till 6 and she said “oh it’s just what you had told me verbally” and never showed it to me. 

Additionally, the owner has literally said in front of me that they need to exploit me more, in a “joking” way. She apparently needs to talk to me about my vacation because it might be too much for them. One time I asked if it was necessary for me to go to the office because my mom got into a really bad car accident and our car was totaled and she immediately was upset asking if I wasn’t going to come in. I said yes i just will have to Uber. I’ve had to go return things or go to the post office before or after the times I said I could work. I did say I could but it was because she says “please do this” so I feel like I have to say yes. Also, she disagrees with my political views so i don’t make any comments or engage in conversation unless they directly ask me, so I basically sit there quietly doing my work. They, mostly her, frequently speak about some communities in a very degrading way. 

Im being incredibly micromanaged to the point where I can’t work efficiently. She frequently gets mad me for things I know she didn’t tell me to do. The blame is put on me for everything even when I do a good job. I know a lot of this isn’t directly tied to whether I’m a misclassified employee but it was to give the gist of the work environment I’m in. I feel like I’ve been manipulated into thinking this is allowed while they do not pay half my taxes and I do not receive any employee benefits",jujuonthatbit,1,1.0,4,1714012860,2024-04-25 02:41:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cch0yr/am_i_a_misclassified_employee/,4,2024
1ccgn4m,Is one more year of CS worth it or should I completely change my career path to medicine? Really need solid advice!,"I am currently a computer science major at Georgia Tech. I've had two internships in the past and another one lined up for this summer. I am graduating undergrad this semester and will be doing masters after my internship.

I have also always considered the medical field and find biology interesting, am not super passionate about med or CS though but definitely want to do one of them.

**I have been having some serious doubts about CS recently:** I am not sure I am cut out for this since I am not super strong technically and not good at learning vague things very quickly, I don't know if it would be super boring coding all week, and this market just seems awful.

**I have been accepted to a premed postbacc, but if I go this route I would have to give up my summer internship and masters since it starts in summer.**

**Should I do this? Or should I give myself another summer of experience to be potentially more sound in my decision and then complete the masters as well? And if I still don't like it or feel unsure then do postbacc?**

**My issue with the latter option is I would be 23 by the time I graduate masters, and then I'd do a postbacc and finish that at 24, and then wouldn't start med school till 25 (26 latest).**

1ccg3ee,I don’t know what to do,"
Hi everyone, I’m a 31F single, with two kids aged 6 & 7. I graduated high school and attended a little bit of college but never finished. Honestly I never really knew what I wanted to do. I started traditional college, dropped out. Moved to another state. Then I tried going the community college route and couldn’t ever get past my pre reqs before dropping out. I have an extremely hard time focusing and staying motivated. I was recently diagnosed with ADD and am in talks with my psychiatrist regarding medication for it. 

As far as my work history I started out working in restaurants, then when I got pregnant moved to a call center environment. I then got hired as an auto insurance adjuster but struggled with my mental health at the time and ended up quitting after a year and a promotion at the request of my then significant other. This is one of my biggest regrets. After not working for 5 months I went back to the call center I previously worked for but transferred to a new dept as a dispatcher. After a year I ended up moving to a new company to dispatch for which is where I’m currently at. 

I’ve never been able to get past $23/hour for my pay. I’m currently single, renting an apartment and struggling. However, due to my divorce me and my ex husband sold our house we had together and I’m going to get a decent chunk of change back in equity. I really want to take this opportunity to invest in myself and begin a career path that I can support myself and my kid’s comfortably moving forward. This is not something that I can do at my current pay rate. 

I’ve been looking into either becoming a Notary or also looking at stenography/court reporting. Are there any other career paths/trades that you would recommend for someone in my position? If you are a notary or a stenographer I would love to hear your opinion on it being a financially stable career.

1ccfuru,Do women in tech get promoted faster despite not meeting qualifications?,"Partially a rant post but I'll make this short. We both work in a massive massive company.

New engineer I helped trained. No special degree or rare skill. Super hungry for advancement. Lacks tons of experience in many areas and work is very unpolished and lacks context for many task. Hard as hell worker and will put in the time though and more but it doesnt make up for the experience or skill gap or sloppy (good for a newb but sloppy for a mid level) work.

7 months in gets a offer from competitor for a position requiring 5 years. Brings offer to current company and current company offers a promotion a lead position and ability to work fully remote. Again, nothing special, many areas still lacking. Talked to a super senior level buddy of mine who is super close to upper management and explains that as much sweat she puts in, she checks off a certain box. I move on. Now she's my level and i got over 4 years ahead of her and experience in different areas and more skillsets.

Fast forward today. Company lost a major contract and massive layoffs are coming. She applies to a job that requires 9 years and 3 more levels up for her 1 and 8 months experience and require experience in areas she has no experience in. She gets an interviewed scheduled. I applied to several positions that fit my 5 year experience level and get turned down without an interview. Like what the hell?

1ccfslc,Should I go to HR over my office manager?,"At my job this is the way our structure works. We have the office manager, those who report directly to her and then 2 partners who while they work in the office they have separate bosses. I am one of the partners and my boss lives in a different city.

We recently got a new system at work and the office manger wants those in the office under her to use the new system but my boss wants me to continue using the old one. A situation occurred where the office manager wanted me to use the new system for a project and I informed her that my boss still wants me to continue to use the old system so that's what I'm going to use. The office manager then told her boss and said that it's insubordination that I refused an order from her and that if it happens again she will be going to employee relations and HR on me because she might not be my manager she still is a manger. I informed her that respectfully I couldn't care less what system I use but since my direct manager told me to use the old one, that's the one I will use. She then goes on a rant about how she feels that I'm disrespectful towards her and I always give push back, I tell her that I don't feel like I have ever disrespected her and that any ""push back"" I give her doesn't come from me, it's because my boss wants it done a certain way than how she wants her team to do things. I then  said I don't appreciate her threatening to report me just for listening to my boss, I suggested that me, her, her boss and my boss have a talk. She agreed but said that her boss will agree the new system is the way to go.

We had the call and my boss told them that she is not budging, she doesn't want me to use the new system and then the office manager's boss did a complete 180 and said he agrees I should also use the old system, which is the exact opposite of what he said when not in from of my boss.

This call was about 3 weeks ago and I thought things were getting better. I had 4 separate employees pull me to the side and say that the office manager has something against me for some reason. Whenever we are done with a project we are supposed to email the office manager, one of my coworkers was in the middle of a project with a client and got interrupted and wanted to know if I could answer 1 last question the client had. I agreed but once I was finished the office manager asked me why I didn't send her an email, I told her it wasn't my client and that I was just answering a question. She told me that she's frustrated with me and it doesn't matter, an email should've been sent from me and that she's going to tell my manager I'm not doing my job. 

My boss covers 2 states and she said that this rule about emailing the office manager once a project is done is unknown to her as it only happens in my city. My boss is flying into town tomorrow for a meeting and I plan on talking to her in depth about this. I am planning to go to HR as since she has threatened to go to them about me before, who's to say she hasn't already.

Do you think I should retract and re-apply? 

This is in the summary of qualifications, second bullet item:

>Experience creating content and managing publicity for various audiences, as well as distributing press releases, coordinating social media outreach, managing websites and publicity.

Basically publicity is redundant and I need to remove the second instance of it.

This is for an academic setting that uses an internal portal, not Indeed or something like that. I can't re-upload without ""withdrawing"", so the manager might be notified.

1ccfoyb,advice please. promotion v. leaving,"throw away account so I don't get fired. there's a bit to unpack here.

I have a job I really like. Great benefits. Flexible work environment. Supportive of personal time/commitments as long as the work is getting done. Great colleagues for the most part.  Challenging work I'm good at. It's an Admin secretary role at a university in a very specialized department. I have typical admin tasks and a lot of very specialized tasks that require technical knowledge which I have a lot of experience with. When I was hired, the next higher up position wasn't filled because of the skills I came in with (learned that detail later) but there was still talk of filling it. I figured I cold move into that role. The tasks of my job often depend on tasks of that job being completed. In self defense took on most of those tasks b/c otherwise I couldn't do most of my actual job. I've been there last than a year. 

Leadership changed pretty much upon my hiring. I have been talking to new leadership (VP and then AVP as the reorg happened) about making the shift into a higher position since October. The staffing decisions made by new leadership is logical and good for the dept but it's not necessarily the best for me. They're not going to fill the job whose tasks I took on but will put all those duties officially into my job description and give me a ""promotion"" (title change - one step up in the admin category). They are also creating another needed position that will do other things I'm not qualified for not interested in along with something I wanted to take on but haven't yet b/c of time. (I've learned how, though.) My ""promotion"" has the same salary range as my current title, but I will be paid at the top of the salary range which is a good 20% more than I'm making now. However, being at the top of the range means I won't get raises beyond the usual 1-2% a year. 

As part of the staffing changes, my direct supervisor would also change from the Director of the dept to the business administrator. Director understands what I do but the business admin has no freaking clue and just doesn't understand what's involved that makes it so specialized. I've tried to explain; they don't get it and frankly I don't think that person cares. They honestly think it's just data entry. They also question my ability to do basic admin tasks.  questions like: ""do you know how to do this? are you sure? you need to learn how..."" wrt to basic admin tasks I've done multiple times without issues or only had a quick question to make sure a detail is right because it's better to ask a question than do it wrong and have to go back and fix things. 

I've been interviewing at other universities. They have all said ""you're doing two or three jobs"" and their salaries start at the top of what I'm being offered or are higher so there's room to grow if I move. (benefits are not as good) Current job doesn't know I'm looking. 

Director understands my concerns re: salary growth and is investigating what to do. Director does not know my concerns re: supervision. I don't like throwing someone under the bus but I have serious concerns and I'm not quite sure how to bring it to Director's attention without harming the business admin. They are: 

1. They don't understand what I do and constantly misinterpret explanations of that work to fit their own preconceptions. 

2. They also assume I don't know how to do the typical admin tasks that are part of my core duties. 

3. (and this is the really big one) I'm not sure they can maintain confidentiality.  After asking me yesterday for details about my meeting with Director which I refused to divulge, they blurted out today ""congratulations"" in front of another staffer in the department. I asked ""what for"" in a tone and facial expression that would have made it clear that they needed to drop it (looking over my glasses rims, arms crossed, scowling a little, surprised and not friendly tone of voice).  ""the promotion to coordinator."" I told ""ummm... them that's not settled"" and ""how do you know about it?"" Apparently their boss (not the same as the director but takes direction from director) was asking for my tasks and such to update the job description for the promotion with HR. The other day, this same business admin blurted out to the other admin sec ""She (referring to me) has to know how to do this when you're gone.""  There has been no official talk to that person about not having their position extended. Like wtf? This is going to be my supervisor? what if I have sensitive information I need to discuss with them? is it going to be blurted out at some inappropriate moment? 

Compensation issue is being worked on but I don't expect them budge much. I'll need to give them data which means revealing Ive been looking.  I'm not sure how I feel about that.

What to do about the supervision issue? I don't want to throw this person under the bus (b/c I do like this person on a human level) but I think Director needs to know my concerns. This person needs serious coaching if they're going to be a direct report - confidentiality, micromanaging, understanding the job I do, how to coach/advise for professional growth... those kinds of things. I'm thinking about suggesting that another person I also work closely with on the specialized tasks be a more appropriate direct report - or that supervisor duties/eval is split between the admin tasks v. the specialized tasks.

1ccdrqy,Can I get a translation to what this means?,"I don't speak HR nonsense. All I want is a straight answer. Yes I got it or No I did not. 

I had 3 interviews. I was told I had positive feedback back from all 3. At this point I am doubting that. 

From the first to the second interview it was a 3 week wait. 

From the second to the 3rd it was a 5 week wait. 

I sent the thank you letter to the recruiter and I got this response:

""Thank you for your kind note.  I'm glad you enjoyed meeting N and C.  Once we are in a place to move forward, I will reach out to introduce you to VP.""

Keep in mind my first interview was with VP. 

I asked for a timeframe. I got this: 

""It will be a few weeks still"" 


My question is ... Do they want me or not? Are they jerking me around just to reject me or do they actually see my value?

I was eager to work at 16-17 but then …lockdown. No one hiring minors with no experience. Depressed at 18 so didn’t look for work, went to university for a year at 19 where everyone said wait until 2nd year to get a job, university sucked and I was doing a degree which I wasn’t sure about + I wasn’t mentally ready so dropped out during summer at 20. Been looking for jobs since September 2023 and applied to well over 100 places and NOTHING. 

Literally applied to everything from cashier jobs, shelf stocker in supermarkets, cinema jobs, trainee barista, waitress, food runner, restaurant host, bar back helper, receptionist, hotel cleaner, bakery jobs, burger flipper, sales jobs, museums workers and just general customer server assistant jobs………literally nothing. Applied to places where no experienced was required to places where experience was preferred and nothing. I got a few interviews that seemed to go well and then after a month they’d say I didn’t get the job. 

It’s pissing me off so much and I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t know where else to go.

1cccndi,21y/o - What should I pursue a Masters in?,"

TLDR : Should I pursue a Masters in Supply Chain,Business Analytics or Data Science.




I'm currently a junior about to enter my senior year of College. My current Majors are Business Analytics and Business Systems and Processes.

I have a couple options that I'm weighing out in regards to what area of study I should pursue my Masters degree in. Here are the options I'm considering 


Supply Chain - my university offers an accelerated program where I'd be able to take 3 Master level classes that count towards both my BA and MA.

Business Analytics - I think this is the most flexible option the only thing that's throwing me off is that I would need to play alot of catch up in order to qualify for most programs. I would need to take Calc 1 over the summer, Calc 2 next semester, and linear algebramy final semester as these are required courses to be admitted to a master program(generally)


Data science - Would require me to take all of the afro mentioned math courses as well, not as flexible as Business Analytics but I still have a passion for Data Science. This is also a rapidly growing field.


4th option..? - Complete the accelerated program while also taking the math classes and eventually obtain a MA in supply chain and Business Analytics. Would this be redundant? I don't want to be pigeon holed with supply chain because I'm not sure that's what I want to do, but it is by far the most convenient/fastest  and chreapest route present to me atm.


Any tips or insights would be greatly appreciated.",Kronovice,0,0.5,1,1714000437,2024-04-24 23:13:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cccndi/21yo_what_should_i_pursue_a_masters_in/,4,2024

1ccbsyp,Work is asking me to create my new role?,"I work in at a relative large management firm and have been in my current role for a little over 3 years. I’m definitely excelling and with that they’ve added little things onto my job without updating my role description or my salary besides my regular scheduled raises once a year, despite taking on extra projects. 

My boss asked me to fill a gap they had in some staffing as it was pretty much already the direction I was moving. Except, he asked me to create the role myself? So I listed everything I do and everything that role may need based on a job description for a different department in the firm. However since then I’ve not actually seen my new job description or new salary range. 

He also keeps adding things to my “new” role (no official change yet!) and assigning more responsibility to the task, not necessarily new tasks themselves but ownership/ an increased responsibility to the task. Ex. Completing the risk assessment is usually his job, and then I’d log it, but now he wants me to complete the risk assessment myself, then log it. I have understanding of the assessment itself but not the decision making assigned to it. I don’t feel qualified to do these responsibilities and take ownership of the associated risk, and I am definitely not paid enough to take that risk on. 

Should I stand up to my boss that I need a clear job description going forward, clearly defined salary for my new role and divisions of who is responsible for these things? 
Side note, he probably wouldn’t take this very well based on his personality, he doesn’t like people who “aren’t a team player” and would definitely see this as me being defiant. I mentioned to him that something was his responsibility because he “has to own it” and he quipped back “well I’ll just add it to your job description then you will.” I was floored.

Tldr: boss asked me to “create my new role” but is now assigning responsibilities outside of my experience level and not providing salary range for new role.

1cc9l1e,I need help choosing between accounting and nursing.,"About me: I'm a 29 year old male from the USA.  Bachelors in social work, masters in higher ed admin, 6 YOE as an academic advisor.  I got into higher ed because I knew I'd eventually want to do something else, and I have my tuition benefit to make it free - or almost free.  It's time.

**Accounting:**

**Sounds great** because I am very good with numbers and remembering rules.  I appreciate the organization required for accounting.  I also appreciate how high an accountant can go with their career, especially with their CPA.  

**Don't love accounting** because I don't think I'm made to work at a desk all day.  I took two semesters of college accounting, it was a struggle to pass and it was so terribly dry.  I know I'll need my CPA to make real money (or for a better chance of it, at least) and I'm concerned I won't be able to get through it.  I'm excited about accounting until I'm in class or working on homework.  I will also need more credits beyond a BS in accounting to qualify for CPA, which will cost me money and time.

**Nursing:**

**Sounds great** because I can get my RN when I finish my ADN and pass the NCLEX - I'll pass the licensing exam right out the gate.  The local hospitals post jobs, and they say they'll pay for ADNs to earn their BSN and then MSN - so I could get more schooling and earn more money, free.  Speaking of money, I'll earn more earlier in my career as a nurse.  I am very good with people, nursing would capitalize on that.  I am very interested in healthcare and fitness/wellness.  I took a nurse aide cert and I loved working with the patients - the gross parts.  There are jobs everywhere, so many specialty areas.  I really feel I'm meant for a job up on my feet and using my hands, plus nursing skills are so valuable to have.

**Don't love** that I may have to work with combative patients or lift heavy patients, as a man.  

I know that all jobs have their good and bad parts.  Nursing honestly seems much more fulfilling.  I also would be able to use PSLF to take care of my student debt as a nurse (or just pay them with my salary!)  

As an adult, it's become important to me to feel that the work I'm doing makes a positive impact on the world.  I want to contribute something.

Now that I write things out, I may be learning the nursing direction.  I can always go back and do something else later.  I just really liked the idea of going for accounting, but those classes were so grueling, and it'll only get worse.  Staying at a desk looking at a screen all day feels just terrible.

I'd appreciate advice. ",Strict-Tree7927,1,1.0,0,1713992645,2024-04-24 21:04:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cc9l1e/i_need_help_choosing_between_accounting_and/,4,2024

Now I’m in my 40’s I realized I needed to do something that pays above minimum wage so I was getting ideas from people and I was suggested becoming a mri tech as it’s pretty repetitive and not to hard (I have memory issues).  So I thought that could be good and it will allow me to put even more money in the stock market as I would be making more.
So I went to mri school and never really enjoyed it but I figured I will be making good money at least. 
Now I started clinicals and I totally hate it. I dread going into clinicals and although I know there is a learning curve I can’t imagine doing doing this for another 2 years let alone 20+.
On top of this I heard the average pay in CA is around $45/per hour which I was happy with. 
Now I have been asking questions and I find out people are starting on $25/hour. 
I’m thinking I make with tips $27/hour in the restaurant. Of course I will get more hours and benefits working in a hospital but the overall pay does not seem that great. 
Along with this I took on student loans so I need to pay them back.
I also felt super motivated to make and save /invest money when I was working in the restaurant so I can get out of it eventually but if I’m working 8-12 hour shifts I feel I’m going to be to exhausted to work on my self when I get home ( I live with my girlfriend and I know she will want attention too in my free time)
I really want to have my own business and live on my own terms but I’m worried this career is 1. Going to drain all my energy on me and 2. Not give me enough money after bills to invest and save for retirement. 
I know working in the restaurant was a dead end job but when I look at the pay for MRI techs I don’t feel like this is such a big step up either. 
The fact im still in school looking at business ideas so I don’t have to do this is a bad sign in my opinion.

1cc7rv5,"I am an ""intern"" but I feel that my company is treating me like a full-time, field expert. How do I explain that to my manager?","My background: I was pre-med in undergrad and then decided not to go that route. I ended up getting my Master's in a design and engineering. My work experience was in healthcare, so I applied to 100s of jobs before getting my current role as an intern. I accepted the idea of being an intern in this current job market and with pivoting my career.

My problem: I am the only official designer at a biotech company company, working half-time. They all refer to me as the ""design expert"". There was a lot of pre-existing material that they shared access to me and that were some not shared access to me but assumed were. There was also a lot of inconsistencies between previous design files making it confusing which one to follow and feel like I would follow what they told me to but then get in trouble for it being wrong. 

I also struggle with my design critiques with specific people in my company. Often, I will be asked to design something that they will send the materials of the language/text but then either don't send them or don't in a timely matter. Then when it comes to meeting and I present a really rough draft of language and hierarchy of information (which prior to meetings is expected to be rough draft), they nitpick every small visual detail and every language. It makes me not want to share drafts until they are polished entirely.

Sometimes, I feel that certain people think I am only doing projects for them (and am free whenever) but I have a variety of people I help out in the company and am expected to stay within a part-time hour range. This guy finally gave me material/feedback around 6pm and then our meeting the next day at 9am, was surprise I didn't have it updated. I was available all day to work, if I was full-time employee sure I would work at night but as a part-time, I should not be expected to wait around and then work whenever. In addition, the science is complex so sometimes it takes me awhile to just learn the science and that occupies my ""pre-design"" time but that work doesn't have ""physical evidence"".

Note: There are some co-workers that give me good feedback or share appreciation for my work. ",CreativePlant7,58,0.9200000166893005,54,1713988322,2024-04-24 19:52:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cc7rv5/i_am_an_intern_but_i_feel_that_my_company_is/,4,2024

I did not intend to go back to school, it was sort of my best option at the time

Prior to my masters I worked for a company for 11 months. One day, I had a bad relapse in my symptoms that cause me to leave work one day and never come back

At that time I had received an offer to join another company, which I ended up taking

I stayed at that company for about a month before submitting my two weeks. I said it was because I wanted to pursue my graduate degree, even though the semester didn’t start for another 6 months.

I’m at a crossroads now when it comes to applying for work. I know that I am a liability and that I could potentially (most likely) have bad recommendations from my previous employers 

For any hiring managers that are reading this, should I disclose my history with mental illness and be honest about my decisions over the last 3 years? Or am I better off creating a cover story and hoping my success in school along with my personal projects speak enough for my capabilities.

I've noticed that lately, whenever they bring up something like they need a certain task done asap or that they're looking at getting an assistant for me, I feel threatened. It's been complicated by the fact that I've had some health issues in the last few months. The team and supervisors have been very understanding, but I keep getting paranoid that I don't really know what they're thinking. Is there any way to figure out what they're *really* thinking, besides just asking directly? Is there anything I can work on in *myself* to reduce this feeling of paranoia?

Some background if needed: They've said repeatedly (for more than the first year and a half) that they're happy with my work. It's helped bring in a lot of money. I've done some major tasks to build up the team and the organization in general, a lot of which involved pulling back-to-back 10-to-12-hour days, commuting for long distances, doing everything to save money, and definitely doing much more than just the job description.

1cc52cx,How to decide which career to go with ,"So I’m 31f in the uk. Please don’t post elsewhere. 

I’ve worked in a legal position for a number of years and I lost my job due to Covid. At that time I decided to throw caution to the wind and decided to retrain as a teacher as this was the other job I wanted to do at uni if I hadn’t done law. 

I qualified as a teacher and then had a baby. But I had my baby before I finished my 2 ECT years. 

When I went back to work (teaching) after maternity leave and due to health issues with my little one I had to leave. 

My husband asked me not to go back into teaching and to be a stay at home mum. 

I never wanted to be a stay at home so I decided to become a stay at home part time working mum back in my old legal career. 

That’s what I do to this day. However I miss teaching a lot. 

I’m trying to decide what the best thing to do is. 

Do I stay as I am where I have part time hours that suit me, I can work when I want within reason, there’s loads of flexibility, my firm is going to fully qualify me at no cost to myself, I work for a friend so I have good job stability and I can spend as much time with my child as possible before they go to school. I can also once they go to school attend all plays, sports days etc and support my child as much as I can. 

Or do I go back to teaching. A job I adore. Which has a higher wage to start with, gives me 12 weeks leave so I can have full holidays with my kids, but I’ll have much less flexibility, will have to work evenings and weekends, holidays are more expensive and I’ll miss all my child’s school activities. 

Writing this out it seems clear what the answer should be but I just can’t stop thinking about teaching.

On the one hand it might be an amazing opportunity to get experience but on the other hand I know it wouldn't be fair for the agency and possibly rob the opportunity for someone else that will be a better fit. ,TangeloLess6305,1,1.0,0,1713977923,2024-04-24 16:58:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cc3dsa/advice_for_potential_job/,4,2024

1cc2u8e,Low paying niche job I love?,"Love my job so much, but very niche and low paying

My job is awesome, and I wake up thrilled to go to work every day, but I make about 45k a year, and there’s really not room for growth, and if I were to get fired, there’s not really another place I could go that would be interested in that experience (any place that would would be lower paying, as well)

I don’t necessarily live in a HCOL area, but I’m struggling to see how I would afford a house, or save a ton of money. Currently my expenses leave me with a few hundred extra a month, after contributing 8% to a 401k and putting $50/week into a Roth.

I have 90% of a degree that doesn’t really serve a purpose (health science bachelors), it’s really a degree geared towards going to grad school, but a series of events led me to not finishing it or being interested n grad school. 

I’m only 23, and for my age, I feel very lucky to have a job I love that pays my bills, but I worry for the future. Should I finish a degree that does nothing for me? Should I leave a job I love to pursue long term growth? Is 8% + 50/week an adequate retirement savings? I know this sub is full of 6/7 figure earners and I’m not necessarily chasing that, I just want to buy a house one day lol

My biggest fear is that I would get let go and then I wouldn’t know what to do. There are plenty of jobs that offer the same pay range, but I would be miserable doing - then I’m broke and sad lol.

1cc1n9l,Another Mid life crisis,"Hi All, first time posting here. 35M this year, married 3 years back with a 4 month old baby girl and just gotten our keys to our BTO 2 year back. With these responsibilities I feel guilty even thinking of giving up on my current career.

So here are some context. I don't think I am the talented type, more like the type who work twice as hard to barely catch up.. Can say I didn't took the normal route compared to others. Due to financial issues, dived straight to work after polytechnic and NS. Explored different fields while saving up to repay my diploma fees. Took another few years to save up for my bachelor's degree. Was still playful during my teens so my diploma GPA was bad therefore private degree was the only option. Only graduated 4 years back and by sheer luck I was given the chance to work in a renowned bank as a software engineer. Worked hard and put in the hours for 4 good years. Never turned down any assignment or said no to any task handed to me even if I have to work through the night to complete them. There are times where I work through the weekends or even till 4 or 5am and continued working the next day. To force myself to learn faster to catch up, I would grind and understand the codes after work. But to be fair, I stay really near my office and my dad would send me to work before he heads to work in the morning. So I have more time for rest.

Here comes the roller coaster part. During the yearly review I was told by my manager that I did well and he was impressed by my performance. Actually I was told the same thing time to time throughout the year. Colleagues were all supportive and glad when I shared it. They were also affirmative that I will get my promotion on track this year. However when the actual day comes, I was given a fair rating for my yearly performance review and did not get my promotion. I was told that it was because I have yet to meet the minimum years in the company therefore I wasn't promoted. However recently I just found out that my batch mates who started off in this company the same time as me were all promoted which is the opposite of what I was told. 

It's hard to explain but from a few events I deduced that the higher ups (the ones above my manager) are kind of biased against me. Was even told indirectly that the team does not have the culture of laying off but to force the staff to resign by different means. Am leaving that to the readers imagination, can't reveal too much or my ass is in even more trouble. At first I didn't thought much about it, but recently I'm thinking if that was kind of an indirect message to me.

In a fit of anger (or actually weeks), I applied and went for a few interviews. So far I got an offer but compared to my current compensation and the benefits (which is really good), it is far off. And with the responsibilities I have, I feel that the right thing to do is to tough it out but the working environment has become so bad I feel stress and anxious a every second I am at work.

Would really appreciate some advise guys. 😔

Backstory- I’ve been unemployed since mid February after getting laid off. 

Had a great job interview where I went for a cook position and was offered Director of Food & Beverage.  I took a couple days to think about it since it’s a much more demanding schedule. 

I spoke with the manager again 2 days later and discussed few things. A couple points she had to check with the hotel owners on specifics, and said she’d be in touch. This was Friday. 

Monday she texted me and said that the owners would love to meet me, and asked availability.  I told her I was available that afternoon, after 12pm on Tuesday and I had a vet appointment on wed at 2, but could be free before or after it. 

No response. 

I texted her Tuesday afternoon saying I was fully free Thursday and Friday if those dates worked better. She instantly responded, “great! Thanks for letting me know” 

And still no response. 

Should I be worried that I may not be getting this job now, or is my anxiety just playing tricks on my brain and it’s just taking some time to coordinate with the hotel owners?

1cc0gee,32 years old and wanting a career change... Though I have no idea what. (UK),"32 years old and wanting a career change... Though I have no idea what. 

I currently work for the same company I have done for 6 years. In that time I've gone from admin to data to a developer as part of a project management team (automation). 

I've never really given a damn about any of it. I don't care for the company at all and was meant to just be stopping off here when in need of a job. They've also just been bought by a gigantic company and it's becoming increasingly insufferable and everyone is fleeing. 

So, here I am at 32, wanting a career change with absolutely no idea what to do other than 'something more useful and fulfilling'. Additionally, I of course would like a better salary than what I'm on now (35k, which is far below the average for what I do). 

Tricky one, right? 

So, TLDR: 

How on earth do I find a more fulfilling career at 32? I feel like I've been scrolling endlessly though job ads and I'm losing the will to live. 

I've also looked at government/NHS work but I don't think I'm qualified enough for what they're looking for.

the schneider electric job is rotational (2 years) of a consulting job that is more aligned with what I want to do long term. location not prefereable but could save $$$$

the EY job is consulting as well - and a bit riskier (got the schneider job because scared of being pushed back with this one). not aligned with what I want to do long term. this is in my top location choice (where I have dreamed of going for a while). 

regardless of money and location, would be interested to hear about what people think of the brand recognition/future opportunities with these two offers.

alternatively, if you think location is the most important factor, i'd be intersted to hear it/why.

I have STRONG ADHD which I've since realized may be a factor as to why I have had so many jobs. It isn't even that I get fired, I just get bored or do not see the end light and start thinking. I've been a mechanic, I've been a manager in fast food, manager in retail, I've worked in a warehouse and then I've done car sales for the past 3 years, manager and salesman. I'm now in flooring sales. 

I did research into the PMP Certification, and got excited about being a project manager... until I realized it's a glorified sales position. But what I realized is that I was ACTUALLY excited about a career, and it's been consistent for awhile of this image of a job. I just don't know what the position is. 

I was raised with my dad in a higher position in a company where he was home all the time (after 10 years of working to that point of course) making 6 figures and he still has random trips he has to make to go to a job to make sure things are still good and his people under him are doing good. When I think of my job, I imagine that being a part, but I mainly think about things like actually bidding on jobs and managing what's needed and the jobs I've or job period. I imagine myself being in one of the warehouse freedom positions of not working from my home office.

I like the setups of non corporate big companies where the higher ups have that chill office and that actually gets me EXCITED. I have always wanted my own company as well and I mainly struggle to figure out what product or service I actually want to sell. 

What job am I thinking of? And what would be the pathway to achieve it?

I’ve thought about starting my own program, but I need some further training which I am actively pursuing… my issue is I’m a bit of a freak in the horse world lol (I like to think perhaps this gives me a marketable skill lol) 

Horseback riding is a very conservative sport unfortunately… I am a vegan positive reinforcement animal trainer/ behaviorist. I used to do equine therapy as in the type of therapy with someone riding but in my experience, it wasn’t a human viable option for the horses. What ends up happening is that in general, older unfit horses are selected for their temperament and they’re not physically fit for the job this combined with the added burden of a rider who isn’t able to carry their weight normally ends up adding undo stress and wear and tear on the horses .. the horses were getting burnt out, mentally exhausted .. the facilities would lease these horses for short times and a lot of times they didn’t meet the kindest of ends 

Now there’s a type of therapy involving psych therapy with horses but I’d need to get EAGALA certified … I could qualify as the horse trainer. 

Other career avenues I’m interested in….

I’m a writer … I have several blog ideas, including an equine blog, a craft blog / organizing one 

I’ve considered going back to school for a master in social work 

I’ve considered getting a certification in social media /  digital design/ web design (however I question how saturated these markets jobs are)

Another opportunity I’m considering more heavily is I love to bake … I’ve considered starting some sort of healthy bread business … 

I have the opportunity to potently do a paid culinary trading program in June im considering… the problem being it’s an hour from my home … and I question if it will just make my resume look more random and take me away from my goal of getting into the professional world 

I’m a 36 year old single parent  I just wanna make a better life for my child 

I also have had the idea of starting organizing business .. I had seen a post of someone who had done well for themselves who had basically advertised their services for a sort of high end organizing service in upscale neighborhoods and done very well but that seems like it would be hit or miss 

I wish I could find a marketing internship at my age ",PoniesandDOOM,1,1.0,1,1713966515,2024-04-24 13:48:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbyni3/dont_wanna_live_this_way_anymore_need_advice/,4,2024
1cbym31,Looking for advice on potential opportunity with prior boss & coworkers at a new company. ,"A few weeks ago I reconnected with an old boss who is now a CEO of a company, we will call him Joe. It was great catching up & during the conversation an opportunity was discussed for a potential opening. 

About a week later, Joe reached back out saying he was going to have a Manager who we will call Mike, call me, this was great since I already know Mike, we also use to work together in different departments a few years back & got along really well. 

Mike called me right away, had a positive conversation & said he definitely wants to make a spot for me, the opportunity being discussed hasn’t actually been created yet but it was on the board to get it moving. The role is exactly what I’ve been doing so it sounded positive when Mike said I would be a great fit & they would love to have me join them. Mike asked for me to send him my resume right away & he would be back in touch, saying it could be 2 weeks, 2 months, etc. Of course I sent my resume immediately but haven’t heard back from Joe or Mike. 

Two weeks later I’m out to dinner &  I ran into another old coworker who now works with Joe & Mike, we will call him Ed. Ed knew all about my conversations with Joe & Mike, I never brought it up to him but said he was excited for everything to work out & knew they were working on things. He kept talking like I should hear something soon. I took it with a grain of salt & responded that I hope so & it would be great to start in time for the annual retreat. We exchanged numbers & today Ed calls asking if I have heard anything yet & if I have any interest in another department.

 Threw me off a bit I guess & I started thinking should I follow back up with Joe & Mike? I also revamped my resume since (actually had another job offer during this but turned it down) & should I provide a copy of the revised resume? I was thinking it’s been about a month but they had said it could be 2 weeks which we are past, 2 months, etc. Really wasn’t thinking too much into it but now I am. I’m not interested in the other department Ed brought up. Maybe I’m overthinking this but I also wondered if they backed off possibly hearing about that other offer somehow, our industry is small & word gets around. Help out, what would you do?

Hi all, I find myself in a pickle and I'd like some advice.  
  
I currently work at Big Boring Company, where I have a comfy job as a Director, working very flexibly and making close to 200k. Good life, but boring. I have been in my role for 4 years and there won't be opportunities for lateral or vertical moves in the next year at a minimum. I am very well-liked here and I am considered a leadership talent, so they are investing in leadership training and stretch assignments for me, but again no proper role moves on the horizon.  
  
I am interviewing for a role at Big But Very Exciting Company, a cool brand that many people want to work for. The role is exactly what I currently do, but with a team three times bigger (leading 80 people vs currently 30) and a bigger scope of responsibility. I haven't received an offer yet but things look promising.  
  
The catch is the compensation. I believe they won't be able to stretch beyond 160-170k which is a significant cut from my current situation. I am aware that both salaries are very generous, but again the job is very senior.  
  
What is your advice in a situation like this one? What would you do?

1cbx946,Non Profit Work and Changing Jobs?,"(40yr M) I'm currently working for a non-profit, which I stumbled into after moving to a new area and starting over. Previously, I've mainly done physical labor to make ends meet, but my body can't handle it anymore. Now, I assist people of all ages with career planning. While I enjoy the work, it's monitored by a government agency, and the pay is capped with no performance-based raises.

Should I take the job for the experience despite the lower pay, or should I negotiate for higher upfront compensation?

MY (29M) an introvert, currently about to go through a career change, as I'm pretty much done with my current job. When it comes to choosing a career path in life, I'm absolutely lost and don't know which direction to go for, here's a summary of what I've done throughout my 20s, and yes I do feel like a failure. 

18YO-21YO - Serving my nation as a Police force, as it's compulsory.

21-22YO - My first full time job, as a retail sales for cameras. 

22-24YO - Decided to take diploma, and went ahead to take IT programming for 2 years, whilst doing part time of customer service & F&B outlet waiter. (C.S was offered by my big brother, he's working there as a manager in charge for one of the project)

24-26YO - Decided to go full time as there's an opportunity for startup project for the customer service job. Wasn't doing this, because I loved the job, it's because I don't got directions my life yet. 

26-27.5YO - Decided that customer service isn't going to cut it, and went for my passion, culinary arts in western cuisine studies. Again, did not like it and got lost again.

27.5-29YO - Went back to customer service again, in another company for income, feeling rather depressed that ever. My first year into the job was fantastic. As time went on, I went into a auto pilot mode for a day-day basis, without any further career advancement at work as it's a dead-end job. So I decided to just quit, as I'm serving notice as of now..


I need some serious advice, as I'm so unsure about what path to take in life. All I ever did was customer service and I take that job itself as a cushion to fall back on, whenever I felt lost.

1cbwawx,Terrible interviews process for a big famous IT company,"I really need your advice on this.

Recently moved to a new country, I left my previous job, however, I was optimistic since the country I moved in has another big branch, I applied to it in December, and the manager already knew me, and he sent me an email saying he’s excited that I applied for this job. 

I’ve done the technical interview and the hiring manager interview, and got a great feedback from the recruiter and she told me that she is waiting for the position to be approved, after like 3 weeks, she called me and mentioned that the position is on hold/canceled, and they didn’t want to keep me waiting, but she will contact me once another position opens.

After few weeks, she contacted me for another position for the same field, and they asked me to do another technical / hiring manager interview, which I did, and it was actually perfect, since I have 3 years of experience with the company’s platform and products.

After two weeks, the recruiter told me that I was amazing, but they decided to consider an internal candidate…

I got really mad, like they wasted my time, it was my dream job, and they didn’t put the status as Rejected, they just want to take the cheaper choice.. 

Do you think the story ends? NO.


Yesterday, someone from the company called me, and told me that they have another position, I told her ok but I will not go through a technical interview, since both teams are literally the same, she told me at least you will have an interview with the hiring manager, I said ok.

Today, I receive an email with the interview link, and two technical leaders are hosting it, so she lied to me. 

I feel so bad, and I am really considering withdrawing from the position. Since I already did 3 rounds of interview for the same field, and they all had GREAT feedback, then why another technical interview? 

What do you think I should do?

Apologies for any typos or bad grammar but i am mad.

1cbvqrl,What could be some well-paid corporate career options for a biology PhD?,"Hello Reddit,

I am a biology PhD holder from one of the prominent research institutes in Germany (finished in 2022). I learned by the end of my PhD that research is not for me, and I would like to enter the corporate world.

I did an internship at a life science consulting startup for 3 months and then joined my current role in a boutique pharma consulting company (<1 year ago). I was a bit doubtful in the beginning as this is my first corporate experience, but I am really enjoying the work and I recently got promoted.

Getting into consulting was a chance event as I got to know about it from my network and tried it and liked it. Now I am trying to explore what other career options I have before I delve too deep into pharma consulting and close off other avenues.

1. I would like to learn from other people's experiences about what other options I can pursue. From a mixture of my academic and corporate experience, I have learned that I enjoy and am good at the thinking, strategizing, and communicating parts of things. I also like it when I get the chance to work in teams (unlike the lonely PhD times). Importantly, I would like to consider options that pay well. I am open to geographies where English is acceptable for work and visa sponsorship can be provided.
2. From stalking numerous profiles on LinkedIn, I see many PhDs who directly entered fields like management consulting or equity research. Could you suggest some resources I can read to upskill myself and maybe go into those areas? I was going to start by learning the basics of finance and accounting.
3. If any of you are in these fields and would like to connect on LinkedIn, I would love to learn about your career trajectory, your day-to-day work, and any advice you might have for me.

1cbubfq,"I am unable to choose between diplomacy and ""academia""","I don't know what to do. I am 21 and through my mistakes and situations I entered the wrong career path of a Pharamacy student. I have been miserable for the past 2 years. Graduation is coming up and I was trying a couple different things giving exams and all and I found out that I have a good chance of getting into career diplomacy or joining the best math program in the country. Luckily they had their internal tests/screens and do not care about my performance in my graduation course. And that is important because I had done poorly.

Now these are just so different than anything I ever imagined. I always thought that I'd become an engineer or go into science, but that didn't work out. I still need to clear their final tests but I don't know if I should focus on one or try for both. And I really need this because all Masters programs are damn expensive and I am not sure I would get a good job to pay back the loans after pursuing my niche interest.

For mathematics, since it is the best, it will be extremely tough. Moreover it would be an undergraduate program. So my previous Pharamcy degree would sort of be a waste. Yet it could be something I immensely enjoy, and it is completely free if I maintain my grades and many alumni have gone on to pursue Masters in top tier colleges like Oxford or Massachusetts which has been a sort of a life-long dream.

For diplomat career,I never saw myself as an extrovert, but despite that I do have good social skills. Its just that I get so tierd of conversing people quickly. And I dont know if I will be satisfied with the work. But who is? I will definately enjoy it more than any private sector job, and I feel like I will have a knack for that very generalist sort of work. I will just have to maintain a good work-life balance, and I won't have to worry about job security. And that is important bit because I am very much on my own.

I feels like diplomacy is the safer choice in the long term, but I cant really get that Math thing out of my head.

1cbtmf6,Whole career is being sabotaged. What action can I take to fix this?,"I am in a tricky situation and would really appreciate some guidance. Apologies if this is long but I feel like the details really matter and I really want to know what recourse I could possibly have.

  
About a year ago, I was the hiring manager for a very senior role in my company. It was an admittedly involved interview process where we asked candidates to do a bit or work prior to the interview day to demonstrate some key skills, did three interviews on the day with three different groups of stakeholders, had them do an involved task, and asked them to give a presentation. The candidates spent 6 hours on site on the interview day plus whatever time they spent on the task. We really needed to get this hire right so spent load of time and resource in the vetting process.   
One of the candidates who interviewed was very good and worked for a local competitor and did a great job.

He was the preferred candidate of a good number of the interviewers and used AI in a clever way to achieve the task that really impressed some of the interviewers (I personally am not that impressed with that stuff). He likely could have done the job very well but in my opinion needed 5-10 years more experience. We ended up hiring someone in a similar role to them but had done it for 10 years longer. He is for sure a rising star in our industry but was maybe looking to rise a little too fast.

  
After the interview all the unsuccessful candidates were notified and offered feedback and he and one other person said they would like some. This is where I admit I screwed up. It was a very busy time for me, and I had loads of spinning plates. I genuinely meant to offer the candidates feedback but I just lost sight of it. HR did remind me a couple of times that I still needed to provide the feedback and it was policy to do so but eventually it all went quiet and I assumed we all moved on. Apparently, that was not the case.

  
Cut to a couple months ago and there is a very senior role in the competitor where this guy works. We are in a niche industry, and this is a “last job” kind of role, really the top of the mountain in terms of seniority and pay that if you are in my position you need to apply for as they basically only come up when people retire. There are maybe 2 or 3 such positions in 50 mile radius of me and they only come up maybe once every 10 years or so. I apply and get an interview and it all goes well until we get to the “stakeholder panel” portion of the interview. The guy who interviewed with me in on the panel. We make some slightly awkward eye contact, but I think that is all that will come of this.

  
At the end of the day, I am very pleased with my performance on the day and come out feeling like I am likely to get this job. There really could not have been more than 4-5 people locally who could possibly interview for this role. I was devastated when I was unsuccessful. I really thought I had the role. I reached out to the hiring manager for feedback and this is where my potential legal issues begin. 

  
A lot of the feedback I don’t necessarily agree with, but I can kind of understand. General stuff about answers to specific questions and experience with certain things. However, they dropped a bombshell at the end. They said that one of the stakeholder panel members had a bad professional experience with me during a hiring process. That they are committed to support and development in a way that made them question if I was a good “cultural fit” and that more importantly a big part of this role was manage a very large team and attract and retain talent from the sector which they questioned if I could do effectively based on this feedback.

  
What…….the…….fuck.  I am 100% convinced this was THE underlying reason I didn’t get this role. That this guy was petty enough and shameless enough to go to the hiring manager and tell him that when he was trying to jump ship a year ago, he interviewed with me and I didn’t give him feedback and hurt his feelings. This guy basically sabotaged my entire career progression plan and hugely impacted my life because he feels like he was entitled to my feedback. Feedback that I was simply too busy to give. Surely this is not on right? It never said in the job spec that past experiences with the interview panel was a criterion for getting the job. Can I request to know exactly what was said about me to determine if it was defamatory? Is there a possible GDPR issue as I never gave consent to my conduct in that portion of my role to be discussed in that way. Is there a possible case to be made here?  
Any help is greatly appreciated. I really do not feel as though the punishment is fitting the crime here and there must be a mechanism in the legal system to protect against stuff like this. I overlooked an email a year ago and now it will have serious implications for the rest of my career and really on the rest of my life.

2. Scope of finance jobs in the country?
3. Best uni among these
4. Part time job opportunities 
5. Living cost
6. Also a big doubt is that all these unis of NZ don't have a great semester exchange partner in India as well as abroad not that bad too but ya not the best like IIMs in India and Ivy leagues in UK,US etc so is that a bad sign or does it reflect the reputation of the university as I heard it could be due to many other reasons and on the contradictory part the ranking of all these unis are like within top 350 acc to QS with Auckland being at 69th in the world(subject wise rankings).

Accountant here. As the title says. I had a truly awful performance review. They started by telling me I'm extremely capable, but, they don't think I understand how to do my job. That I'd be better in something more people facing and which is more step by step.

I can't help but take that to mean "" this isn't personal but you are just too thick""

I asked a coworker I worked on some projects with if they agree looking for a shred of hope and they went a step further to tell me I'm below average in all tasks.

I'm embarrassed and exhausted and it's an effort every morning to put on a brave face.

1cbrzki,"Blatantly lied about what company I was going to, having second thoughts?","Last year I quit a job that I left in pretty bad terms because I was the only one with expertise in pretty outdated systems. I feared the worst. I also knew the upper mgmt to be very petty. I may have overestimated their reach but also feel they do have contacts that could have derailed my hiring at new place.

When one of the managers called me and asked it felt like a quick way out to lie. Worst part is this manager knew someone at the new company and again I overestimated their reach as now I know the contact wouldn’t have that much power.

Also felt like the new job was the job of my dreams, so felt it was a good risk to burn bridges. My salary was pretty much doubling.

Next day, some ppl already knew where I was supposedly headed. I had not expected so much attention, but given that most people wanted out, I guess it struck a chord with people. Next HR also asked me and again I lied and told them the same to keep the lie consistent. In the next few days - everybody knew from word of mouth without me telling them except these 2 ppl. Even upper mgmt started trying to confirm by asking me like the area of our city I would be commuting to and so. That made me very suspicious as to why these ppl way up cared about what little guy did.

Fast forward - new job turned out terrible in every way possible and with no job security at all. I had to update my LinkedIn profile with the real job just so that I can find a new one and of course everyone from my old company is there. I feel exposed as a liar. I wouldn’t care so much if this new job had turned out what I thought it was. Now obviously I can’t even go back to any of these ppl for references as my reputation is probably down the drain as a liar.

I feel bad but I feel given the information I had at the moment it was a reasonable fear and it was ok to lie?

Do a lot of ppl lie? I just saw the profile of a coworker of many years back who said they were starting a restaurant business and seems all that was a lie because they’ve now updated their profile and they never did that but actually got a job in the same field which they said they were retiring from.

With this said, I guess the question is, is my reputation ruined or do ppl lie often about this and is it viewed as normal?",Cloudflare334,1,1.0,0,1713942575,2024-04-24 07:09:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbrzki/blatantly_lied_about_what_company_i_was_going_to/,4,2024
1cbrpes,How to step up and accept responsibility to be a Country Manager,"I have worked as an engineer in a big engineering company for 6 years before I've had it with 9-5 jobs and went for a less demanding non engineering job. When I'm not happy with something on the job I resigned again, find another job again and this continues for about 3 years. Eventually I quit everything and I do tutoring to kindy/highschool kids, sell healthy lunch box delivery, do sports that I love more regularly. I just want to 'live' a happy life without traffic/answering to clients etc etc.

Fast forward 2 years later, while I'm happy with doing mediocre job, tutoring kids, play sports, eat healthy and what not, I realize I need to get back on the 9-5 job to sustain a comfortable life.

It is now has been 5 years since I work in that big company and I'm now in my 30s. I thankfully got an offer to work in this oversea company (also engineering) that wants to open a branch in my country. We have about 5 people, all not more than 40 years old.  We direct with the boss in HQ, I was offered a Sales Position but in actuality I helped the company in every expect of starting a new business entity in my country, finding sales, finding staffs etc. 

I love the job. 

To be honest, I love what I do in that 6 years in big company as well, its just I cant stand have to punch in at 8am sharp, face the traffic from and to work, and have to deal with office drama/politics. 

In this job, since its a new company, we set our own office hour and since I have to do a lot of things, my hours doesn't have to be 8-5 anymore. I am happy.

So recently (after almost 2 yrs of working hhere) my Chairman offers me the opportunity to be the Country Manager. Even though I am not the oldest, but I am the one who knows about the company product and services (based on my past 6 years engineering exp) and I'm in sales position now. 

The problem is, since I do a lot of things, I haven't managed to secure any sales business for my country, other than business from the HQ that I'm supporting. 

And since the last time I was 'actually' working, I was still in my 20s, and somehow when I started this job, I still feels like I'm a 20 something staff who need guidance from experienced seniors. Never once I thought or dreamed to be in a managerial position.

Problem is now, I AM in my 30s and I have no other seniors except my Chairman and my other non-engineering, non-sales colleague. And I was expected to guide people and give solutions to my 20 something colleagues.

Sometimes I feel overwhelmed, can't focus and sometimes I don't feel I'm professional enough to be a Country Manager, but I DO want to. As my Chairman said, I'm at the right age to be taking this responsibility. And he wanted to promote from within, he don't want to find a Country Manager from outside. 

But I don't feel that I'm ready, I'm not sure about  a lot of things, I have so many questions. 

I want to be ready, I want to take up the responsibility but I'm not sure how. 

Should I take a Managerial Course? Learn how to behave like a 30 something yo professional? Learn about finances? Learn about Sales?

I really don't want to disappoint my boss, but could really use some advice on how to make myself ready and worthy for the position.

1cbries,Burnt out hippie needs to settle down,"Hey all. Sorry first time posting in here and a little close to the chest. 

I’ve spent the majority of my life playing music in a touring band and working in record stores. From the time I was 16 to now (31) I worked in record stores to get cash and then would use said cash to travel the continental United States to play shows…

The thing about record stores and touring is (at least in my experience) you make shit money and I have no benefits to speak of.

I have lived an incredible life and I have no complaints about the path I chose besides pay, I’m very fulfilled have a beautiful wife who I love very much, I genuinely enjoy my work and have a ton of stories. 

However my 30’s are hitting me like a freight train…im an only child (so is my wife) and our parents are reaching an age where they will need help before too long and we are basically white trash with neat hobbies.

Should I just bite the bullet and work at some factory? I really have enjoyed my life and am a damn fine sales person. Every record store that I have worked at has had greatly profited off of me, I’ve implemented a lot of things that help drive sales, have great management experience and I get a profound sense of purpose helping my community and staff grow.

Idk maybe I’m rambling but I feel lost and figured some strangers on the internet might be able to steer me in the right direction.

1cbrczi,"Should I return to the company that laid me off, or take a new less volatile position for less pay?","The company I previously worked for had been struggling financially for about a year and did two rounds of layoffs, the second of which impacted me. 



I’ve been job hunting for a bit and just received a formal offer from a company that pays a little less than my old position, with no benefits offered but the work might be more interesting than what I was doing prior. They are a smaller company and can’t pay what I was making but have been very accommodating and are stretching their budget for the role because they like my work and think I’ll be a good fit. 



Just today, I received an email from my old employer, who are scrambling to hire for my old role due to a recent surge in work and a significantly reduced staff. Many of the people who I worked with prior have moved to new positions in the past few months, and it sounds that while the company is in a decent financial position for the time being, they have not addressed many of the issues that put them in an unstable position in the first place. Many people have had their hours reduced significantly, some people have been changed from salaried roles to hourly roles and immediately back to salaried roles as the financial situation has shown signs of improving. This has happened in the past couple of months. Managerial type roles have been mostly unaffected, while people in revenue generating roles have been the ones most affected by these decisions. 



I’ve been made a pretty enticing offer at my old company, but I’m a little mistrustful of them now and I worry that they’re hiring out of desperation in response to the uptick in work. I do like the team who remains however, and there would be opportunities to work with some very impressive clients. However, if their new financial uptick doesn’t last and they’re back to lean times, I’m not confident that I wouldn’t be let go again. The smaller company’s offer is more modest, and I’m unsure of the company culture and workflow, but it seems to be much more stable. 


Is it worth it to return to a company who previously let me go, and who may still be in dire straits, for a decent pay bump and a chance to work with some impressive clientele? Or does it make sense to accept a lower offer somewhere new that may be more stable?",PanicAtTheDiscGolf,3,1.0,1,1713940042,2024-04-24 06:27:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbrczi/should_i_return_to_the_company_that_laid_me_off/,4,2024

1cbo1kv,Passed over for a promotion 3 times in 7 months. Is it time to move on?,"TLDR: Title pretty much says it all. Read on for more detail.

So I where I work is a retail environment where we make commission. It is a job where I have been working hard to do what I could to prepare for the role of assistant manager. An opportunity for the position came up back in September 2023. I applied and interviewed. After the 4 people who applied were interviewed and my manager (who did the interviews) told me I did not get it, he told me it was a tough choice between me and the person who they went with. I was told it simply came down to tenure, which I was fine with and even though disappointed, get that that happens. I asked what I could improve on and I was told I did perfect and that all my answers were great. So good in fact he told me to apply for the same position in another location (that I could not do due to not being able to move and the drive was way too far). So fast forward 4 months later, another spot for the assistant manager comes up (due to some people needing emergency FMLA). This time they do not have interviews and just tell someone (different manager) to just pick someone because they need to make changes fast to cover spots. This time, they pick someone with almost the exact same tenure as me and someone who didn't even apply or show interest in the spot when it first opened up. No applications, no interviews, no going through a list of possible people even. I was told by the manager who made the decision that they were told they had to make that decision and give it within 10 minutes. Again, I was told it was either myself or the other guy who they were deciding between. Fast forward to now in April 2024. Once again, the assistant manager spot opens up for a temporary acting due to someone being out for paternity leave. The person doing the interviews come to me personally and told me to apply (even though I already planned on it). I apply and interview (whit another new manager). For a THIRD TIME, I am told it comes down to me and one other person, and it was chosen simply because his March performance in sales was better than mine. That's it. Nothing else I had done in all the extra things I had done in  the lead up, all the mentoring and learning from other managers didn't seem to matter. Again, I was told I had a perfect interview. The last thing I was told by all three managers was to ""keep doing what you are doing and I am sure you will get your opportunity next time"". I really feel like I am being dangled a carrot and once I go to grab it, it's yanked away.

1cbmt1i,Making too much to convince myself to start a business.,"I'm an unskilled laborer. I work in security. I make very good pay for my industry. At the moment I am making 130k+ while working lots of overtime. My wife works as well. She makes more than me. And has offered to support me if I quit and try to start a business. But I would feel pretty lame if I fail. And the position I currently have is sought after. It wont be there in a years time for me to go back to.

I really hate my job. I hate interacting with coworkers in my field. Lots of testosterone junkies. Lots of flat-earthers. And on top of that I am very underwhelmed by the doing nothing constantly.

I have no degrees. But I'm good with sales and good with money. I have been for years romanticizing the possibility of opening a resale shop. I'm pretty good at finding rare things especially in hyper-inflated markets. I used to do that as a side-hustle and did quite well.

But now I make so much money at the day job that I cant convince myself to quit and go try a business.

I've considered vending machines, laundromat, car wash as a side. But haven't pursued that either. My 100+ hours a fortnight leaves me with no motivation.

1cbmmg8,Putting in my two weeks notice but my boss offers more pay to try to get me to stay,"For context- I want to mention that I am not leaving because of my boss. I am however leaving because of my direct lead/supervisor. I work in vetmed and have dealt with consistent problems with my direct lead. Micromanaging issues, talks/instructs around the team like she’s a dictator, doesn’t communicate with the team causing clientele problems, and the biggest is the power control issue she has. The practice manager is amazing and I have no issues with her whatsoever. 

Some history- the lead (we will call her Mary) and I had become extremely close over the last 2 years, but a shift in our work relationship turned 180 the moment she got promoted to a lead position. We got into it about a month or two into her promotion because of this so we sat down and had a full in depth discussion. We hashed it out seemingly. 

The ONLY behavior that actually improved was that she stopped blasting me over our hospital radio everytime she forgot I told her I was in the bathroom. She just dismissed it as a “memory problem”. But everything else somehow got worse. This is also someone who’s admitted outright that she has severe anger issues and has had to go to anger management in the past to the point she bites her hand as a form of coping when she’s pissed off at work. 

Fast forward to present day- Mary has had multiple situations where she couldn’t handle the stress of the job and was lashing out by accusing team members of not doing their job or doing it wrong when she was the one in fact who didn’t look into the account thoroughly. And when she was called out on it- she was extremely dismissive. She began inserting herself into client situations that didn’t need her involving herself causing an escalated situation that she created. I had attempted to confront her about the fact she was flagging emails/assignments that I had already completed. I definitely told her that we didn’t need to discuss anything further at the time because this has already been discussed previously and clearly her behavior didn’t change. 

She ended up blocking me on Facebook later that day. This is despite me being extremely cordial and neutral with her after having expressed my frustrations with our boss. I naively assumed that she would eventually be coached and maybe she’d apologize for her toxicity. But, instead it was a double down of not only ending our friendship, but also slamming the door on the possibility of us reconciling. 

So I’ve accepted a position at a new clinic but they’re going to be paying me 50c less. their benefits and discounts are way better than my current one tho.  So overall, long term it is better as I do have 4 dogs and a cat. (Vet care is expensive!) 

My boss does not want me to leave at all. She’s stated she will be stripping Mary of the ability to assign members tasks and that she won’t be allowed to give me feedback. When discussing the overall buildup to this current moment- she eventually tried to offer me more pay. She did not specify how much and only said if I could truly reconsider- we could discuss how much more. 

My mental health has been in the gutter since Mary has been lead. I will say working with her specifically her as a lead has been absolutely dreadful.

What would you guys do? TIA!",Consistent_Monk4675,2,0.6700000166893005,4,1713924101,2024-04-24 02:01:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbmmg8/putting_in_my_two_weeks_notice_but_my_boss_offers/,4,2024

1cblgfv,"I asked for a raise, then went on vacation and was fired the day I got back. Is this legal, ethical?","This was at a smaller architecture firm. Afterwards, i was told it was for performance reasons and documented as such on my exit letter, marked ""Confidential"". This also being the first time hearing about such reasons enough to be fired without warning (mostly inflated and/or fabricated in my opinion to justify using the P word).

Apparently, according to some advice I'd received it's also illegal in some states to fire based on performance without any real evidence, even contradicting evidence? I am in Washington State and unsure if that applies. In fact, I was excelling in the office if you were to ask my fellow staff, or my engineers or my clients. And, I busted my ass and the bosses knew it. I'd even produced the evidence around End of Year reviews. I received great reviews. I'd seemingly gotten along great with everyone - can pushing for a raise really be the catalyst to get fired? Plus teaching someone making the same salary basic stuff while I am licensed and they are not, it was a fair ask.

There have been grumblings about the office finances and I wonder since I was also newer and in an awkward position structurally.

1cbkuys,Should I leave this job just after joining?,"I recently left a job (beginning of this month) as a junior-level data scientist/consultant I'd been in for around a year-and-a-half, I really enjoyed it but the contract for the project was essentially coming to an end so they didn't really have a new role available to keep me - but they really liked me and were like keep in contact etc. The pay wasn't amazing (but around £28k up North) but it was a nice work environment - fair level of work, good friends with the people I worked with, nice people even at the clients, understanding manager, blah blah. I think I was pretty good at it, and even successfully managed a whole portion of a digital transformation project by myself. I got really good client testimonials according to the HR lady and a really nice reference. What is worse is that, after I accepted the next job I will come onto, the previous company above actually ended up with a new project and were going to offer me around a £10k pay bump and management of a couple people - I essentially turned it down saying ""sorry I would, but I'd already accepted somewhere else"" kind of out a weird loyalty to the offer with my current place (regret).  
I'd applied to some other positions as I knew that one was ending - I can't go into much detail for privacy reasons but I got an offer for a reasonably long internship in London for a completely different industry role as a kind of experimental career change (technically not DS although 'researchy' in theory). It pays around the same as I was on in my last job (but that was up North). The problem is the place is totally toxic (maybe because I've come down to London - but people are so rude and talk behind each others backs) and disfunctional (people have worked weekends and unpaid overtime pretty regularly from what I've seen). The internship itself has so many 'bitty' tedious tasks (which I can't elaborate on, but imagine 'admin/writing/meeting minutes/receptiony-stuff') which take a while (some specific tasks which would be too identifying are actually quite 'complex' in the procedure but not intellectually difficult), are kind of pointless as some of the mails probably immediately get deleted by everyone as spam, and worse they are really nitpicky about how they are done (every external email, post, and so on has to be checked by the director with a 'writing style document'). This is my second week and I have already been piled-on with secretarial 'stuff', despite barely knowing how anything here is structured, and it is going to become more because the current person doing it is leaving. I am also slightly on the spectrum so while for some people this kind of thing would be really easy, for me it is actually quite difficult because I can't always work out specifically what notes people want taken down ad-hoc like that. Someone snapped at me in the first time I ever did it for not taking something down or because I couldn't immediately find a file they wanted opening to discuss, and kept whining about how I set up the room (the screen was flashing black now-and-again because the HDMI is just loose). I am not totally incompetent but I know I'm not particularly good at that kind of stuff either - I wouldn't search for a secretary job as I know that isn't my skillset. I am pretty sure I overheard someone call me the ""autistic intern"" at some point, although I might have imagined that (the thing is, the fact it is even a question in my mind I think is a problem, it wouldn't have crossed my mind in the old place).  
The above is just one part of the job - which I kind of knew was part of the job description but not to the extent it is in reality - the main point of the internship was meant to be supporting on 'research' (the part I wanted to do the internship for). On top of that, because they know I worked in DS, they are adding on ad-hoc data stuff ""oh can you just do this and this for me"", but have no idea about how long that stuff can take and in some cases are totally naive about how difficult tasks are (I was essentially asked to build a decision-engine based on totally uncleaned text data which even had troll responses within it by end-of-day, which obviously I said was impossible after much whining of 'see what you can do'). After all the admin and meeting stuff, I barely have any time to do this on top.  
Then, someone today - who I am pretty sure changed their approach because they knew I was joining (they can barely code and have a poor knowledge of statistics but were talking about using clustering algorithms) arranged a meeting in which they treated me like a moron and recommended 'data camp' because I said I wasn't sure how to do some task on the data they had - even though I was technically saying this isn't the right approach because it is 'black box' rather than the difficulty programming it in principal (although it would be an outrageous task to request on my salary too amongst the other things I have to do, IMO). The agency that gave them the data also told essentially verbatim what I had said in a meeting I was in after that, but they are still pressing on with it anyway. I am pretty sure they might use 'the intern' as the fall person who ""couldn't do what I asked"" when this all goes up in flames, they aren't a very nice person (verified by what some other people have said). This person already threw their toys out the pram when I asked to shift a deadline a couple of days for some work they set me in my first week (because I had loads of intro kind of meetings plus various other things to do for different people) - they literally wrote to my line manager to talk to me about 'time management' in my first week and when I explained even he agreed (although I didn't feel very supported, and ended up staying late unpaid to finish that thing). This same person (who isn't even my manager) asked me if I had finished some plots (for someone else) today - I said I had and I was pretty pleased with how I got them to look as a kind of conversational thing - they essentially said ""oh right"" before walking off.  
I don't think it helps that I've basically gone backwards in hierarchy, because I've gone from being trusted to run my own thing from start to finish to just basically being the ad-hoc person. Nobody really wants to me my friend or talk to me, as I am the only intern - and who wants to talk to the intern? I am kind of treated like a skivvy. But I also feel I am being a bit exploited, although I am interested what you guys think from the outside.  
I have (I think) only a 2-week notice period. Should I just ask to leave? Would I need to even put down I worked here (kind of worried about impressions leaving so fast) if I just leave and start looking for new work? I could stick it out for a little longer maybe, but at the moment I hate it and am not sure if things are going to get worse. I am just not sure what the consequences would be if I put in a notice for leaving? Should I just stick it out for the length of the internship (over half a year but the contacts and 'brand' theoretically valuable at this place)? I know I wouldn't accept a return offer as things are. I have a 1-to-1 meeting coming up this week where I could easily give notice, but I don't even know how to approach that as it isn't something I've had to deal with before.

Things have not gone any better and in fact have deteriorated. I'm usually quite resilient but this is something I've never come across before.

* Interesting and high profile work will only get assigned to the boss' favourite staff
* If you refuse to be micromanaged you will be accused of not being a team player
* Goals and processes are not well defined but if you don't follow the non existent processes and the goals don't look like what they thought it would look like (which was never communicated) you will be told that is your fault and to change it. It's their way or the highway
* Management is inconsistent. Some days are better than others but when it's bad it's bad. It can be very unpredictable, you feel like any minute you could get a message or meeting reprimanding you for something
* You will be assigned tasks that your boss thinks is good for what they think your development needs to be, not what your career aspirations are
* Feedback either doesn't get acted on at all or is acted on in an inappropriate manner

The above has been happening more frequently and becoming more obvious this year, and I am starting to feel hopeless and burnt out. I'm finding it hard to keep up and could only find the energy to focus on one project at a time but the interruptions (requests and expectations to look after other non core work related stuff) are endless and tiring and I just don't think I can go on anymore.

1cbgdzd,Are there any paths to a career change based on these skills / exp?,"Hello! 

I've been looking around to change careers, I'm early 30s and my whole life I've been involved in sales / marketing  through design/marketing roles (with some exceptions). I'd really love to find a job that pays well enough (\~50k-60k, with room to grow and make more as time goes on and skills develop), but I'm not on the hook for when sales are down.   
  
I'm burnt out from my current role, and would like to pursue creative things in my spare time as opposed to work. I had to supplement my income last year and ended up taking a fulfillment role for pickup / delivery orders for construction (lumber, mulch, concrete etc) - really enjoyed the work, worked hard, and was offered a promotion after \~3 months. I didn't take it because I was offered a FT job doing design / marketing for quite a bit more, but am now burnt out. 

**skills / hobbies**

* I have a Bachelors in Graphic design, and a lot of experience from concept to production (not exactly helpful for the change but it's there)
*  I know a bit about front end coding (HTML/CSS)
* I have roughly 1.5 years working for a small studio doing freelance work for video game concept art (this is where I'd be spending my time off work hours - improving and trying to get side work / start my own thing, but that takes time an I'm aware enough to know I'm not ready yet)
* I am handy at carpentry, a bit of electrical, and a very small amount of plumbing
* I have always built my own computers and am good at problem solving when something goes wrong with them / resourceful
* I've never worked as a dedicated project manager but inherent in all my roles and responsibilities is a ton keeping track of logistics and deadlines.
* Might be weird to say but am a good listener, I've seen this be a soft skill that's absent enough that I think it's worth listing.

Ideally I'd like to find something that has some physical activity and problem solving involved, but I think I may be too old to start a trade, especially one that is very physically intensive. Not afraid to get my hands dirty (have worked side gigs and helped friends demoing / insulation / drywall)

**Fields I've considered**  
IT, Machinery maintenance (not even sure where I'd start here, but seems up my alley), Another fulfillment role? (drove a forklift at my fulfillment gig, but worry about it covering bills), Logistics / record keeping.  
  
If any of these skills lend themselves to any fields you may know of but I'm not considering I'm all ears, ideally I just want to put my head down, do the work well, solve problems, and go home and not think about work and enjoy my life with my girlfriend and our dog.",General-Apricot-304,2,1.0,2,1713907387,2024-04-23 21:23:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbgdzd/are_there_any_paths_to_a_career_change_based_on/,4,2024

1cbg1r7,Saying that it was an internship when it wasn't?,"
I recently graduated from university, and this year I managed to get a position related to what I studied. Unfortunately, my company lost a very large project just around the time I joined, so they made layoffs, including me. 

At this moment I am looking for a job again, but I don't know whether to include that position on my resume. I don't have any other experience, and I really gained skills during that short period. 

 I was also thinking of saying that it was a internship, but I'm afraid they'll call the company or something. I worked there 2 months btw. 

Is it bad to put it as an internship? Technically I'm not lying about having worked there. 

English is not my first language, I apologize for any mistakes.


 Help, please.

1cbftw2,"[INDIA] Need some advice on my first job situation, I feel stuck now, how can I do this?","First, Hi there, sorry for consuming your time but your advice would be appreciated and thank you!!!

I joined this start-up company as a fresher in 2023 and I agreed to all the terms and even they made me sign a bond of 2 years which is sus because the title I was hired for and the title i signed are completely different, that was biased n with help of my PO i understood I have not to worry about that bond, although It felt a bit sus, we agreed to have training period of 6 months and then probation and FTE, I started working since the first day, like actual work and KT session would be for 1 hour rest is working n It's 9am to 8pm every day it was a bit suprise to me but I still accepted the work culture coz I'm interested in the work field working as (Hr) but after 48 days such that 1 month 18 and took 1 month leave for my final semester exams, things started to get personal and ethical issues, my mentor abscond the company meanwhile and i didn't even get proper training on other topics now I solely have to handle his tasks and my manager told me to come office in between my exam date n I still went n he said only to take care of recruitment but later was giving more n more tasks but I clearly told I have exam n I'm currently on leave...I didn't even graduate at that time it was during my final semester I joined, all was toxic and it was very overwhelming to me, I sent in a resignation letter in June of 2023, but company refused to accept n I said what ever my concerns were in a proper resignation email with that we ended on very bad terms, now in 2024 after not currently able to afford mba so i decided to find another job, they are asking for reliving letter, So i reached out to my previous company I apologised for lack of understanding but still they did me wrong saying that they marked me as an abscondee and asked if I had exit clearance, if so then they will give me a reliving letter. Now, i clearly understand we are still on bad terms, so as per my knowledge I will be converted to FTE after 6 months but I left after working 48 days and other month is leave.
Now it's been 10 months I left job and been unemployed, gave my shot to do mba, but nothing works so i finally made up my mind to get a job in a new company and give my best.
So,
1. I don't have any of PF account created or have any UAN. I got paid in bank account only 2 times because I worked for about that time, that's all!!!
Question is: will my old company intentionally create the pf account, can they do that without my knowledge??? 
2. Is all first job experience this way?, I joined a unprofessional company and did my resignation in unprofessional way, it's just affected me mentally.
3. How to explain this situation to future employers, is it necessary to bring up the old company or I want to know?
4. I want to start as a fresher, I can do that but few companies are asking for reliving letter, how to answer them?

I live with my fiance, who is in college, work about 4 days a week, for a few hours. I make decent living, and I'm grateful for what I have. One of the things I wanted to achieve in life was to strike a nice balance between free time and income. Right now it seems that I'm severly depressed, I've been attending sessions with a psychiatrist, and am on my way to some tests. I have social anxiety and I'm having trouble with interactions with people so I really want to avoid working in a call center again. I'm getting help for the first time in my life and my psychiatrist thinks that I should try to use my creativity, since it's about the only skill I really have - being creative. I tried to make my own comic, or a game, since I really don't know what could fulfill me as a person and I thought I could give it a try (without having any decent artistic skills). I feel like I tried to keep my inner child alive too long and have a big reality check coming. It's hard for me to do about anything but I really think that if I could find a job in which I could use my creativity from my apartment and not interact much with people, I could actually thrive. I don't really have money to invest or self-publish, so I kinda gave up on a comic I was working on, since I didn't think It would get me enough cash to support my fiance without much trouble anyway.

1cbegd5,Pregnancy - Effect on Performance Reviews,"Hello, 

At my work, salary progression is based on performance rankings. If you get ""meets expectation"" your salary can progress by 4% up to a cap. If you get ""exceeds expectations"" your salary can progress by a higher percentage and if you get ""exceeds"" two years in a row you can progress beyond the salary cap. Only certain amount of the people in the company are able to receive an exceeds ranking in a given year, so they can only be given out to a few people per department. 

In 2021, my performance review noted that I had exceeded in all areas. My final ranking however was ""met expectations"". In discussions with my manager he said that I would not receive a final exceeds expectation ranking because ""I would not be there in 2022 to receive it"". I would not be there because I was pregnant and due to give birth in 2022.

In 2022 I gave birth and I was on maternity leave. I was not able to receive any performance review as I was on leave for part of the year and I was automatically given ""meets"" for that year.

In 2023, I returned in July. Shortly after I returned, I took on all of my old job responsibilities and I also took on an entirely new area on top of that because there were new significant projects at work. I was told that I would do both jobs until it would become unsustainable and then they would try to hire someone else. I requested that because I was near the salary cap, because I was taking on this volume of work and because without ""exceeds"" for two years in a row I would not be able to move beyond the cap for at least two years, I would like to receive an exceeds ranking for 2023. My manager said he would try to get me an exceeds ranking for both 2022 and 2023. 

  
I just received my performance review for 2023 however and I was noted as having exceeded in all areas but my final ranking was ""meets expectations"" without explanation.

Does anyone have any advice from an objective perspective. Is there any way I can challenge this without seeming disgruntled. I feel like my salary has been impacted for 3 calendar years by my pregnancy and I am frustrated.

1cbe4r3,I think I'm starting to hate my job/career....feel trapped and don't know what to do,"For a long time in my 20's, I was one of life's screw ups. I loved the party life too much since I turned 17, ended up with average A-levels, went to a crappy uni to study an even crappier media degree and came out with a 2:2 that wasn't worth the paper it was printed on, never mind the tuition fees.

Spent most of my early 20's following uni in telesales jobs, in debt, single, struggling to get by and a massive cannabis addiction. Bit by bit I managed to turn things around and I'm now in my late 30's, happily married and we purchased our first property in 2022.

I was lucky that a business owner took a punt on me and I became operations manager for a facilities company in my late 20's. Worked with him for a couple of years and then in 2017 I took a job working for an events company as a project manager. Conferences, weddings, product launches, that sort of thing.

Flash forward to now and I should be happy — I earn just over £50k, my wife earns the same and we're on the property ladder. But I'm burned out and not even a break/rest seems to help matters — when work begins to pick back up I'm constantly frustrated, irritable and get anxious when I think about work. This has gone on for a few months now so I'm starting to believe this isn't a temporarily blip and I'm seriously considering if this industry is for me. It can be an amazing job and most on the outside looking in would be envious. But the long hours (I've worked 20 hours straight before, had 3 hours sleep and then gone back on site for another stint), never being able to switch off, irregular schedule to name a few are starting to make me doubt if this is a viable career in the long term.

The saddest thing is for the first time in a while, I seem to be very good at this job. I work for a small company and we're going at a rapid rate and I know I'm a big part of that — but if this industry isn't for me then I need to act soon as time is running out for me to change careers again (I've just turned 36). Couple with a depressing UK job market and my more-than-decent wage I literally feel stuck in this job and I don't know what to do.

I guess I'm venting at this point but I don't have any one to speak to about this — my wife is supportive but can't offer me advice and none of my friends can relate to how I'm feeling.

If anyone has any advice for me I'd very much appreciate it as I've never felt this lost before — it's like a constantly feeling that I know I should be happier but I feel far from it.",midlifecrisis316,2,1.0,1,1713902035,2024-04-23 19:53:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbe4r3/i_think_im_starting_to_hate_my_jobcareerfeel/,4,2024
1cbdzs2,How do I get past the fact that I am now seen as a 'job hopper' and perhaps too old to be an ideal hire?,"I am now in my 5th job since 2019, although I have a perfectly reasonable excuse for each;

In 2019 I pivoted into a new field, held a job from October 2019 - May 2021. - I left the job because I emigrated from Ireland to Canada.

My first job in Canada was a contract role that lasted 4 months, from July 2021 - October 2021

I moved into a permanent role in November 2021, then in August 2022 the company had a re-org and I got laid off (not for cause) The company no longer exists, so that shows the direction they were going at the time.

Started a new role in August 2022, which I held until September 2023 -corporate re-org following a buyout, laid off, (not for cause) The company now hires 3 people to do the role that I was doing as one person.

After 6 months of unemployment, I've recently taken a survival job that's not in my field, It's also a contract role, so I am still actively looking for something else.

My field is recruitment, when \*I\* review resumes, job hopping like this is not a factor for me, because I am aware of how many layoffs have taken place in the last few years since COVID, but it is becoming more and more apparent to me that many hiring managers and recruiters do not view things the same way.

In addition, I just turned 39, my studies (completed in 2008) age me on my resume, but I don't list any work experience prior to 2013. I don't consider myself old, but a few things I have read online recently lead me to believe that many people look at someone my age and see potential bad habits and resilience to change, which is not me at all.

&#x200B;

When I get to an interview, I can explain all of this, and usually the interviewer seems pretty receptive to it, but I feel like it's really starting to hurt my chances of getting an interview, and I think it is playing into decision making when I DO get the interview.

As a result, I made the choice to return to India to seek treatment, where I spent almost two and a half years focusing on my recovery and simultaneously helped father in business. Now, feeling much better, I've returned to Canada with a renewed sense of purpose and a desire to kickstart my career here.

1cbdid5,I’m completely lost!?,"So sum it all up: 

I graduated with a bachelors in computer science two years ago. I haven’t gotten a single job offer, and as the months pass I’m getting less and less interviews, even during the peak seasons of hiring (which is understandable to prefer fresh graduates)

I’m not sure if I should keep trying and applying? (I’ve had my resume looked at by professionals, and seems pretty solid) I’m not picky at all for the job title, I’ll take anything I can get.

Or should I go back to school to complete prerequisites to get a masters in anesthesia assistant? But then I’d have 200,000+ of loans to pay off 

Note I’m 25 years old, I currently work in sales (which pays 13$ an hours plus a very small commission)

1cbd0c0,Leaving a job that I was bad at and feeling guilty,"I had a strictly office job for the last three years and recently took a hybrid job for a more flexible work schedule, better pay, career growth potential, and better leadership. However, in my weeks leading up to leaving, I keep finding more and more mistakes that I've made over the years. The job that I'm leaving has been a dangerous combination of tedious and hard-to-master. My supervisor is the opposite of a micromanager and is very reluctant to jump in and help when we get busy. My coworker constantly asked for my help with his work to the point that I would have to put my own work on hold to help him. The result was me not being able to focus on my own work nearly enough, but I'm also to blame, because I reached a point where I was burnt out and had given up. Not really an excuse to make that many mistakes, but even with all that, I still feel incredibly guilty about leaving these mistakes. I don't want to leave on bad terms, but there's a chance these mistakes could get discovered eventually.

1cbcpfr,Administrative Professionals “Appreciation” week,"I need to vent about this. 

The company I work for is doing a bunch of activities this week for Administrative Professionals Day, and I have to say, all of the things they’re doing to show us “appreciation” are actually massively annoying inconveniences that are really frustrating me. 

Everyone in our office has a hybrid work-from-home schedule; 1-3 set remote days a week. I’m lucky that my position only requires me to be in office 2 days a week. 

They’re hosting a luncheon tomorrow, so I’m required to go into the office for a half day on one of my usual remote days. I’m then not allowed to commute home after the luncheon while still on the clock, so I’m required to use my 1 hr lunch break for the commute, rather than actually getting a relaxing break from work after mandatory socializing (I’m an introvert, so I’m usually pretty drained after these). 

Last week, I asked if we had the option to stay all day on Wednesday and work remotely on one of our usual in-office days (this is an option if you’re sick, but can still work from home) and was told no. I was mostly fine with that answer, until this morning when I clocked in and the first thing I see is a message from the same manager, posting that they’re working remotely today because they have to be in office for tomorrow’s luncheon!!!! “Rules for thee but not for me,” really great for office morale.

Is there any way to bring up my frustrations to management without sounding petty/whiny/entitled/etc, or do I need to just let this one go?",mojozojo42,1,1.0,0,1713898633,2024-04-23 18:57:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cbcpfr/administrative_professionals_appreciation_week/,4,2024
1cbbujh,Is my work environment toxic? Is it worth leaving and losing some autonomy? ,"I'm a senior data scientist for a large company. My team is pretty large and ok in terms of people but my manager is causing me to feel burnt out and causing me to want to leave. I feel like I'm being strung along and told to ""be grateful"" when i get the bare minimum and often substantially less than I'm promised. For example, for my bonus this year I got about 20% less than I was expecting given my performance. And I was told next year to be grateful if I get 20% even less than that despite exceeding expectations. Importantly, this is not based on company performance or personal performance. I was also told I would receive X% in stocks last year and I received half of that. This year I received 3k less than I was promised. It's a lot of little things and the being told to be grateful when I'm being paid below market rate, lied to about compensation - compensation that was a part of my offer and is put in WRITING every year, working after hours on ""high priority"" projects that never make it to production on time when I worked my ass off to deliver on time because of product manager screw ups and given that I currently hate the work that I'm doing I really just think that I need to leave. We had 3 people leave our team a month ago and my manager said the weirdest thing that she ""was not happy that they decided to leave but she decided to allow them to leave"" like they are her slaves and need her permission to resign. I also feel like the bar to promotion keeps getting moved. My only feedback is that I need to ""be more aggressive"" I meet and exceed every deadline. I pull late nights if necessary to do so. I build out products that have large positive company impacts and I always voice my concerns. I've been getting more and more frustrated and so I've been getting snippy and more aggressive in meetings and pushing back on things more than normal and I'm still being told I need to ""be more aggressive"" and to be clear they're talking about my communication. If I communicated any more aggressively I feel like it would be borderline unprofessional. I have had multiple recruiters reach out to me for staff level roles. The only downside is that they would require me to move, so I would lose that flexibility of living where I like. Am I overreacting about how I'm being treated at my current company or is leaving the right choice?

1cbay5x,"29f, disabled, stuck. ","I am so incredibly lost. I am a 29 year old female living in a large city in Canada, I suffer multiple chronic conditions but am not receiving any aid of beneficial support. I have severe osteochondral ankle lesions that I need surgery for, but I do not hold stable work or housing to be able to commit to the operation as it is 50% chance it could leave me unable to walk ever again. I additionally suffer IBS, stomache ulcers, severe migraines, psoriatic arthritis and CRPS. I have tried to work with mental health professionals and therapists to assist in feelings of BPD/adhd and suicidal/self harming issues, but have seen little but a revolving door of a system that assumes and tries to assure me I am nothing but a happy and level headed young woman. 

I am a child of abuse and difficult upbringing, which never lead me to stay in school. I was always a creative, and have seen accomplishment in a photography business, a large passion of mine, it is no longer accessible due to my inability to walk. I hold no high school education above ENG10, I have managed bars, and retail stores, worked in promotions and done some print shop work which was enjoyable but physically debilitating. I’ve been an online streamer, I’ve found good money there but it’s exhausting to be in a public eye. I enjoy working with my hands and making things, but do not have the physical ability to go into trades. I do sell vintage clothing online, but it is not sustainable in my condition or in the long run either. 

I’ve been stuck in under the table work for years, I have a decent resume and have general success in landing job interviews. The problem being there’s nothing I can physically do anymore, and government aid isn’t an option due to housing and financial requirements. I really want to do a job I can be useful in, that’s on paper, that earns me a pension, benefits, a trade or the health field would be great if I was in any place to navigate them, but I don’t think I am. I don’t drive, I have no license, I suffer bad vertigo that makes it a risk. I’ve tried being a food courier, I can’t bike anymore even. My home is very loud and does not seem feasible for most online entry level customer service jobs in which I’m mostly only eligible for. I have little experience outside of ms word or even in excel really. I’m passionate about criminology and the psychiatric field and have considered schooling for it but don’t know if it is right for me long term, and I need something that can allow me to have the security to get surgery before I am 40. I don’t have the time or the money or physical ability to go to school for a career in such. 

I wish I could just be a carpenter or something, I just am so lost and don’t know what to do, frankly haven’t listed half of the things I’ve tried or issues I’m facing in my life or housing environment but just thought I’d shot in the dark vent about it here. 

**TLDR; If you were a disabled 29 year old female with little to no experience outside of the service and retail industry, and you couldn’t walk, or drive, but still needed to pay rent and feel useful and leave the house once awhile… what would you do?**

Sigh, thanks to anyone who even took the time here. I know it’s a lot, I don’t mean to sound such a pessimist either, but things just keep knocking me down. Don’t know how to get work without getting better, don’t know how to get better without having work. What a silly chicken and egg situation, a snake eating its own tail. The Canadian health system really isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, and only helps a tiny bit *if* you fall under strict eligibility requirements. 

Appreciate yall.

Now that my gf is gone, have relative few if any friends in this entire state now too so feelin pretty isolated. Guess the only plus here is that I have about 20k in savings and will get this grad degree debt free....

1cba4u7,How do I get over constant regret for leaving my old job?,"M in the UK. I have a first class Marketing degree and 5 years of transactional finance experience (Banking/Treasury).

After being in my last Treasury job for 3.5 years, I finally left into my first Assistant Management Accountant job. The main reason why I left is because in the past 1 year, a horrible new colleague and manager joined my team. My colleague found every possible way to mess everything on the system up for 8 straight months, every single day. I found myself fixing everything not only for them, but also for the various finance department (as I was the only one who knew how to sort specific things). The problem is my new manager was also very unsupportive and refused to help or step in to help with the problematic colleague.

I had no pay rise for my whole stay at the company, despite always going above and beyond and being respected by a lot of people within the business. In the end, I was feeling miserable and decided to look elsewhere. I applied for 2 jobs (another Banking job and the AMA job) and to my shock, I got an offer for both of them, within the span of 10 mins. I went with the AMA job as it's the natural way for me to progress from Treasury and learn new things. The recruiter said that interview the business had with me (2 stages) was the best one they've had in years. I couldn't believe it as I was feeling very downgraded in my old job and was also doubting my self-worth.

The thing is, the new job has a lot of Excel and some things are very difficult to me. I've been a month in and still learning, but can also do a lot of small things on my own without messing up. But the difficult Excel stuff worries me. I feel like I oversold myself on the interview and now have quite a huge upskill to do at the new job. They use a different accounting system and a lot of processes are not as simplified as they were in my previous position.

I heavily miss my old company as I knew the people the system and what I was doing. It was also very easy compared to the new job (I only used Excel for 1 report during the month and that was it). At the same time, it had become a very toxic environment and I was feeling miserable every day. I realise I wasn't really learning anything or developing myself. I was spending more time to fix people's mistakes than doing my day-to-day tasks or finding new ways to automate/push forward things.

I am very afraid of getting fired from the AMA job if they don't like me or if I don't get the hang of the Excel stuff and not sure if it was the right choice. I don't know anyone within the business either. At the same time however, my new team is much more supportive and nicer and I can see I can get the help I need to push myself forward. The new role is also a tremendous jump in experience due to the varied nature of things I am doing.

Me and my partner are now on the mortgage ladder and I have to make sure we have financial stability. Because of that, I've made sure to save money for nearly 3 years ahead, as I am very worried what will happen if I don't pass my probation and have to look for another job.

My partner says I will find something easy if it comes to that (she used the recent 2 offers as an example) due to my degree, experience and also the upskill in my new job, but I am always worried and overthinking things. What if I am left unemployed? Everywhere I read, people are saying the UK job market is really bad.

Did I make the right move moving from my previous job or was it a risk that I shouldn't have taken? I basically left security and comfort because of a toxic team and jumped into the unknown.

1cb8k7t,Feeling Overlooked: Should I Continue Extra Work Without Pay?,"
I work as a pharmacist at a multinational insurance company, specifically in the medical claims department. Over the past 11 months, I’ve not only fulfilled my role as a medical claims officer but also taken on an unofficial title: “The Excel guy.” Let me explain.

In our 100+ people department, I’ve been supporting my colleagues with Excel-related queries, even though it’s entirely outside the scope of my job description. The recognition I’ve received for this has been quite significant, even though it hasn’t come with any financial benefits. But that’s okay; I genuinely enjoyed helping others and contributing to our team’s efficiency.

One of the teams I’ve been supporting is the claims analytics team, which interestingly consists of just one employee. I’ve helped automate many of their daily tasks and taught them some advanced Excel techniques. My hope was that this would position me well for any future openings within that team.

Recently, there was a senior analytics team opening, and I applied. I made it to the final interview phase, feeling confident about my qualifications. However, to my disappointment, a candidate from a different department was chosen over me. The reason? Seniority. The other person had been with the company longer.

Today, our analytics team lead sat me down and shared some encouraging words. She assured me that I was the best candidate in our entire department, emphasizing my expertise and contributions. She believes that if another opening arises, I’ll be chosen without an interview due to my track record.

I’ve been with the company for less than a year, just a month shy of completing my first year. Despite my efforts, I’ve received only a small fraction of the annual increase that everyone else got. Meanwhile, I’m living in a country with a struggling economy and currency devaluation.

I can’t shake the feeling that I’m being manipulated. I am being irrational? Should I just continue doing extra work based solely on a promise?  I’m torn, and I’d appreciate any insights or advice you might have.

1cb85bl,Should I Invest More Time into a Job Opportunity That Keeps Getting Delayed?,"I was recently approached by a company I had worked for fresh out of college, and did well for. There wasn't much growth in my position during my first stint, so 5 years ago I left. There's been some change in leadership in that time, and the new Operations Manager reached out to me and said they were looking to build their operations team, and my name had come up in the conversations frequently. Perfect, I thought, the growth I was looking for has been brought about by new management.   
  
I go in for an interview and the team was very receptive, and said they'd reach out soon. 2 weeks go by and the Ops Manager reaches out and say the Board denied their request for create the position they were hiring me for. They said they were definitely still interested, and would try again after Q1. April rolls around and they reach out again for another meeting. Perfect, I thought again, this will surely be an offer.   
  
I go to the meeting and it's just the Ops Manager, and she says the request was denied again (could've been a phone call IMO). She's very candid and says she is getting frustrated with the whole process, but asks for 1 more month as she will be going to the board to pitch the position personally.

I’m a super outdoorsy person and I prefer working with my hands so I’ve been looking at farming / Aggie jobs. I had an interview for a job at a farm that deals with rescue animals. It’s a great fit, a pay decrease but I’m okay with that and can still afford to live. 

My only problem is that it’s 1099. After looking into that it makes me a bit nervous having to deal with my own taxes. I’ve only worked W2 jobs. Im not sure if this is the right move for me though. I gain a lot of flexibility and get to do more meaningful work and I get to expense a lot of things like clothes, gas, phone, etc but I’ve heard people say 1099 will financially ruin you lol.

1cb7hfu,I'm doing my manager's job for them: how do I make sure I get the recognition?,"I have a new manager who joined my company a few months ago. He still doesn't seem to feel comfortable making decisions and still delegates them to me. I log on in the morning and there are frequently 3-4 emails in my inbox that are my manager asking me what they should do in certain scenarios.

I have been doing a lot of tasks that fall under my manager's role, including making important decisions. I have been documenting this to bring it up during my next review. However, I am aware that my manager probably won't communicate to his boss (who will decide if I get promoted) that I have been doing all this extra work, since it will make my manager look like they don't know what they're doing.
 My question is: how do I ensure that my extra work is acknowledged without it looking like I'm trying to make my manager look bad?",yxhbinovtxezrfibin,1,1.0,2,1713886131,2024-04-23 15:28:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cb7hfu/im_doing_my_managers_job_for_them_how_do_i_make/,4,2024

I've been applying for client /customer success management roles because I think it is something I can do and fits well IMO based on my experience. Am I right, or way off, based on my experience below?

1cb7aw3,How to write a promotion then demotion on a resume?,"Backstory: I was promoted to a supervisor position in late December 2023. I worked in the role for 3 months when in early April 2024 I was essentially told by the CEO to step down back into the regular position (luckily while keeping my salary). He said the role wasn't working out and it was basically being eliminated while they figured out the responsibilities of the role, to which it may open in the future. What really happened was I took the fall for my bosses failure, in which she received a write-up I later learned. I digress.

Now, I'm left with my resume looking like 
Base position: 1 month-current
Supervisor position: 3 months
Base position: 8 months


How would I format this? Do I leave out the supervisor position completely? If I do keep it, is the story I tell that the position was eliminated?

I have equity (options and grants) in this company which could pay me out decently IF the company ever gets acquired or goes public. 

Management didn't IPO or do anything to capitalize on the pandemic market. Now, things are contracting and an IPO or selling is nowhere on the horizon (according to them). 

I'm fairly early in my career (mid level) so it's not like the equity will be my retirement, but it would be a nice chunk of change. But the company just isn't thriving like it was. It's not doing terribly, but I feel like I'm clinging to this hope and should be looking for another job instead. Management just isn't going to IPO any time soon.

1cb67u5,Struggling at my current job,"I'm in a terrible headspace and need your wisdom.. perspective.. Ex-Big 4, left as a M2 and recently joined the federal government and am working at one of the financial regulators now. I think I hate my job (job itself? Working for the federal government? Not sure exactly). Am I overreacting? I think I made another career mistake.

I left Big 4 for many reasons. I was miserable and clearly things were bad enough for me that I needed a change. My health was declining (my blood work was all out of whack and I couldn't get my blood pressure under control) and I wasn't able to manage the sleep deprivation/constant stress effectively anymore. I waited and waited for this fed offer and I wanted it so bad, it felt like an eternity. (Well... It was an eternity actually because they took 10 months to finalize everything)

Now that I'm here, I just get so angry every morning, knowing I have to show up for this job. My commute is currently 1.5 hours each way. This is kinda temporary as I need to do this at least 50% of the time while I'm on ""probation."" Sounded very doable, but I was mostly remote other than AC/board meetings at my clients at my previous job and my pregnant belly is struggling and getting in the way of the 3 hour drive. So uncomfortable. There is nothing glamorous about the fed job (is there a requirement that fed buildings have to be at least 30 years old and dingy???). Maybe I've been sipping Big 4 kool aid too long, but the work environment is just... depressing. Everything is so stuffy and rigid. Show up at a certain time, your lunch is 30 minutes, report when you're in the office or gone for more than 10 minutes, report your ""leave"" when you're gone for doctor's appointment instead of working extra to make up time.. I appreciate logging off at 4:30, but I lost the ""flexibility"" I had for the stable hours. Maybe I'm just acting like one of those entitled b who feel like they deserve everything. Maybe what I needed wasn't a fed job, but a job in a smaller PA firm? Everyone here I talked to, loves their job and seems happy and I'm just puzzled. What am I missing. They're ""making good money and able to be there for their kids."" Money is ok, but take home pay is tiny. My kids are important to me and I've already done a few things that I wasn't able to do while at Big 4 - like pick them up from school, take them to swim lesson, spend weekend just laying on the couch, etc. But I just can't help but wonder, where is that new job honeymoon phase? Why am I feeling like this 3 months in?  Is this a huge red flag?",Negative-Oil2814,1,1.0,2,1713882912,2024-04-23 14:35:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cb67u5/struggling_at_my_current_job/,4,2024
1cb64as,What shall I do about my current job leave or report to HR?,"I'm autistic and I have been at my current job since 2021, and I wished I'd left sooner, but I'm also reluctant to leave because where I work there is a supermarket and its handy for me to go there after work and buy my essentials.  I don't drive or anything but I'm hoping to take my driving lessons sometime next year. I get the bus to work, I am 26 years old, I'm quite a quiet person and I have had a lot of issues with my job I have been bullied, made fun of, spoken about and not giving me any opportunities to move forward and progress with my current role. I'm a kitchen assistant, I got help finding a job and I was hopeful at the time that I would take bigger steps to move forward and work round the front to do some prep or cooking and help with desserts, my boss didn't help me and I said over and over that I would like to progress and try out different things and learn new things that I haven't tried yet, I gave wondered why I'm being treated like this and it seems that they don't want me to learn or are refusing and stopping me to learn. I may have autism but my disability won't stop me from achieving but bo one at my job seems to care or have any faith in me to do different things on my role. I remember prepping the lettuce and chopping up the bread and the chef was criticising and interfering saying that someone else should do it and it's part of my job role to do these things. They just think I'm not capable of doing my job properly when I am. I said to them I am perfectly capable of doing my job, I just want to be left alone. I feel like they have a problem with my disability I'm always left out of meetings, I got told by one of the chefs to go back to school because I was in charge of sorting a dessert out for a guest and I was unsure what ingredients to use, I asked the chef to help me with the dessert and he did it and as soon as he finished, he went round the front of the kitchen and told someone else that I should go back to school because I was unsure how a dessert was made. I get laughed at when something goes wrong and we all make mistakes we're all human, I really don't understand why I'm being bashed so much is it discrimination? Which I'm starting to think it is, is it that I'm being pushed out of my job? so that st some point I end up finding another job. I don't want them to win, because if I left they got what they wanted. Is it that I'm being secretly fired? I don't know what it is but I'm thinking of taking all this to HR I have plenty of evidence. I want to fight it because I know I'm a good person with alot of potential I know I can do an amazing job but none of the chefs where I work seem uninterested with me moving forward.  And yet they got all these other people applying for jobs in the kitchen and thr chefs let them move forward,  they treat them way better than me. I'm always and have always been treated like dirt since I first worked there. I deserve respect as well, I just don't get why people to be such jerks to me all the time. This isn't my first job I have been in another job in hospitality where I was treated like dirt at times I was constantly blamed fir stuff I didn't do I got blamed for recycling the wrong item when it wasn't me that did it I remember being upset about it, and still get flashbacks about it even though it was back in 2019. When something happens it just stays in my head, my mom reminds me that work is work and you are going to get idiots regardless, I do agree with her. I just think people can be so cruel especially to people with a disability and I really don't deserve it. I'm stuck on what to do move on and find another job? Or take it to HR? Some days I feel completely useless and not good enough because I never get any positive feedback about my work I never get you did a great job. They are always picking on me and making me seem like I'm the problem for everything.  I feel like giving up and wished I didn't work I feel like people are against me. I am a good person  I may be quiet but there's nothing wrong with me being quiet if I want to be quiet I can. They seem to have a problem with me being quiet at my work and instead of trying to get me to communicate with them they swear and take the mick out of me to try and get me to respond back. Well don't blame me for being quiet, I just think they are all immature and they should know better.

1cb5x95,Supply Chain Career Advice at an Aerospace enterprise,"questions will be: should i leave and find something else? should i do supply chain related certs? more below 

Bit of a story here. I’m 28, went to school a bit later than usual. I was a sever for about 8 years before this career. Got my bachelors in Business Admin with a focus on Operations and Supply Chain Management in December. I did an internship at a very large and well known aerospace company in LA last year and then got offered to start working for them this year in January. Got brought on as an Associate Supply Chain Planning Specialist. Been here since mid January and a lot has happened (and not happened):

- I have been given no statement of work in the almost 5 months of being here. I will sit at my desk for 9 hours and go on my phone. i’m not kidding. I will do the occasional odd job here and there but it’s mainly admin/clerical stuff (i’ve even will move boxes for people). i’ve never said no to anything i’ve been asked to do, but won’t get a straight answer about my SOW only that “it’s coming”. 

- i’m giving them the benefit of the doubt since we just went through layoffs and i was the only new hire that dodged them. 

- i don’t have any other experience than serving and my degree and whatever i picked up here. 

- i’m not learning anything i can transfer over to a another job. i’ve barely used SAP. Just looked up QN’s and PO’s that’s it. 

So what should i do? Am i being unfair? I really enjoy this company, but i feel like i’m being pushed aside. I get there’s a lot going on here because of what causes the layoffs which is a big deal. They’re all very nice and the W/L balance is next level. I do live an hour away tho so coming home is almost 2 hours. $72,500 starting pay. 

Should i try to look for something else? Should i try to get SixSigma certified as well as CSCP? Should i try another industry? i’m the only one in my family that didn’t do a blue collar career choice (along with the only one who went to college) so idk who to ask.  thank you.

1cb5gui,drinking at work,"Drinking with coworkers while being underage 

I am a long term intern at the company I work for and I work on a super small team of recent college grads. I’m 20. Anyways recently I got invited to a happy hour with my coworkers independent of company affiliation. These were people all within 4 years of my age and my manager. But I might’ve fucked up because it was slightly encouraged for me to order drinks. I ended up having 4 over the course of 4 hours and was a little tipsy (as were my coworkers) but definitely not anywhere near blackout drunk. I don’t think any of them pay a lot of mind to the fact that i’m not actually 21 bc I seem close in age. I was being a little too fun though and it’s possible my work personality went away a little too much. They were also all drunk but now i’m concerned about potentially being in trouble. I will also say it’s worth noting that my higher up boss had previously been pouring me drinks at a company dime office party. That time I drank just enough to save face but was pretty much dead sober. I think the recent happy hour was just different because it felt a little more like these people were my friends and they were also drinking somewhat heavily. No upper management was present. I know this was stupid and I’ll never do it again but the main issue is i’m embarrassed and I don’t know if I should dwell on it or just go back to pretending it didn’t happen. It’s been about a few work days since the incident and I haven’t heard anything regarding my behavior but this is a complete nightmare for my social anxiety.

I have been working at this company now (part time) since november 2023, getting on well but they were being very slow about hiring me full time (we'll call this **Job A**). As they were being too slow I decided to look else where and I got to the final interview stages of a similiar job (**Job B**). The interview went really well and i expected to hear back within a week (it's now been 3 weeks). A few days after the final interview for Job B, Job A decided to finally send me an offer and after a day or two of negotiations on salary etc I've been offered the job. Here's the annoying bit; I would much rather Job B due to various reasons but they have not got back to me for 3 weeks now. I told Job A i'd let them know after a week of them offering me their job, then i let them know I did a final interview for Job B before they offered me their job. So I've sent Job B two emails, two weeks apart asking for an update but nothing in reply.

Should I just accept Job A? and if Job B comes back to me just ditch Job A or what??? I don't know what to do

1cb4ewl,How I Used My Job Security to Score a High-Paying Job!,"Let's be honest, salary negotiations can feel like a one-sided wrestling match. You put in the hard work, deliver results, then...crickets. Asking for a raise can be nerve-wracking, and frankly, it often leads to disappointment.  
  
Been there, done that. Spent years feeling undervalued in my previous role. Every raise discussion felt like pulling teeth.  
  
But then it hit me: there HAD to be a better way. A way to get the financial recognition I deserved without the stress and uncertainty of unemployment.  
  
Here's the game-changer: I realized the strongest negotiation position isn't from a place of desperation, it's from a place of security. Being employed gives you incredible leverage.

now I'm planning on doing BBA from one business school, or bachelor's in IT management from another one.

my parents think that BBA is useless. so the second degree would keep me in the industry. i can work at my dad's firm or even do something on my own.

1cb3o7h,Seeking Advice on Next Steps - Mid-career TA to SDR? Lateral move for less pay? (24M),"Hi all,

I'm currently searching for roles after being given 2.5 months to find a new position. For reference, I've been a biopharma TA specialist for a little over 3 years at my current employer. I was promoted from an intern straight into a TA specialist III. I had remote flexibility and made great money ($77,000/annually) with good PTO/benefits. The problem came really in the last year when my colleague was promoted to be my boss. Long story short, my former reporting structure was to someone overseas, and I had a much greater connection with them than my current boss. She made me a lot of promises to develop me quickly, give me exposure to international roles, and let me work on global projects with her team. After she left, I started to report to my colleague in the U.S. who was promoted to a lead. She would frequently tell me I was too junior in my career and continued to give me recruitments for the same hourly positions I had filled hundreds of the same profiles over the last two years. I expressed my discontent over time, at first through asking for new roles, then, through my actions (i.e. showing up late, not monitoring Teams anymore, stopped following routine recruitment procedures). 

I felt unmotivated and unchallenged; plus, what started as a remote role became hybrid, working onsite with colleagues in supply chain or finance who had nothing to do with my recruitments or career interests. I'll be honest, I started to get pretty frustrated. Despite what I felt were honest communications about my desire to shadow different areas or work with colleagues overseas, I was given the feedback that my performance was poor and that our req loads were too light. I was given a 1% raise in our review cycle and  then was given the ""boot"" around a month later. 

I admit, I was naive to think I would find something to replace this situation easily, but I want something challenging to replace this role and have only found lateral moves in the TA field that pay way less. I've had tremendous success getting SDR interviews at local companies but they are all at such a large fraction of the pay, it's hard to justify. I have some analytics background, but not enough to get a role as an HR/TA analyst. My experience is also just light enough that I get rejected by most Sr. TA roles. I'm stuck in a weird place - I've applied to jobs like crazy and am feeling equal parts lost and stressed.

I just turned 24 a few weeks ago so I'm ""young"" by career standards, which is part of the reason for my exploration. Does anyone have advice on how to approach my dilemma with a realistic lens and look for ways forward?",Ok_Preference6441,1,1.0,0,1713876255,2024-04-23 12:44:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cb3o7h/seeking_advice_on_next_steps_midcareer_ta_to_sdr/,4,2024
1cb3ke8,Does contacting skip level manager helps? ,"I am seeking guidance on navigating my current role as a Team Lead with 10 years of experience.

I had a strong working relationship with my manager, who was consistently supportive of my work. However, since my promotion to Team Lead from Senior PM two quarters ago, things have changed significantly icantly.

While I lead a team of a few project managers, they still report directly to my manager rather than to me. This shift has caused a blurring of our roles, as my manager continues to handle the responsibilities that should fall under the Team Lead's scope. Initially, we agreed that he would focus on strategic planning and securing new projects, while I would manage the day-to-day tasks of implementing those projects with the PMs. However, this arrangement hasn't been effective. I communicated my concerns with him, requesting that he step back from lead activities to allow me to fulfill my role more effectively.

Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated. My manager's meticulous approach has led him to micromanage every aspect of projects, including monitoring Jira tickets, evaluating test cases, and providing feedback to the PMs on minute details.

I've noticed that he has actively excluded me from critical updates on PMs' projects by not involving me in email threads or meetings with stakeholders. As a result, I have no direct engagement with stakeholders, as my manager attends these meetings without including me.

This has restricted my responsibilities to reviewing Jira tickets, documents, and PMs' emails, leaving me with limited visibility and impact in my role. Previously, I managed my own projects, which kept me occupied, but now, as Team Lead without projects of my own, I'm struggling to navigate this situation. This has effectively sidelined me from my intended leadership responsibilities and restricted my role to reviewing PMs' work without any direct impact on project outcomes.

I feel this lack of clarity in our roles and my limited involvement in projects has led to a diminished sense of purpose and job satisfaction. Additionally, my concern is that the team may be overstaffed, which could jeopardize my position.

Would it be advisable to approach my skip-level manager about the possibility of joining another team? Given the strong relationship between my manager and the skip-level manager, I'm uncertain about the level of assistance I might receive. I'm also concerned that raising issues about not feeling valued or my manager overstepping his role could result in my position being made redundant.


I'm seeking advice on the best way to approach this situation and resolve these challenges.

1cb2hk5,What are my options for the future?,"Hello,  
  
I'm a mid 20's guy who has ran a relatively succesful tech startup within the gaming sector for 3+ years now with around 10 employees and 1 million € in investments and hundreds of thousands of users. However due to the economic downturn and climate for many startups, I'm unsure if I will eventually have to close shop (everything looks good now, but you never know in this day and age).  
  
Before starting my company I worked in coporate finance at an investment bank. My daily tasks have been extremely varied, and I've done everything from forecasting, capital raises, sales, designing, marketing, accounting etc (everything that happens in a tech startup except for the actual programming). I'm a university drop-out since we got our first investors whilst I was studying.  
  
Since I'm fairly young and I've run my company for a big chunk of my adult life I'm unsure what jobs would suit me in the future.  
  
I'm looking for any advice on what the future might hold for me, or what types of positions I could expect if I were to become an employee instead of an employeer. I would preferably work in the startup, big tech or finance industries.

1cb232f,Bad news then bad interview - what to do? Or do nothing?,"I had a final interview for a role I'm really keen on yesterday. It was a remote panel interview, and the final in a series plus test.

About half an hour before the interview I got some bad news about a family member and it really threw me. It was too late to cancel, so I went ahead, and I didn't perform as I would have wanted at all, and had a couple of absolute mind blanks. I followed up with a thank you for your time email and clarified one of my mind blanks with the examples that of course I remembered as soon as I hung up.

Should I message the hiring manager and apologise and say I had some bad news and didn't perform as I normally would? I'm so torn. It sounds horribly dog ate my homework, but I'd hope that the difference between this interview and the previous one I had with her might be obvious.

I'm also worried it would make me sound desperate when really it's just that I think this role is a really good fit and the team seem great.

What would you do? I'm busy beating myself up about it - I'm normally pretty stoic and not easily thrown, but I guess there are some things you just can't prepare for.

1cb1xmc,"No raise at my 90-day evaluation, but promotion?","So, I started at a small office (<10 employees) 90 days ago. I had 7 years experience in a very similar role when I started, and there had been two employees in this role before me. One got fired to low performance, one quit. In my offer letter, it says my hourly rate of pay would be re-visited after 90 days to evaluate my performance.

Three DAYS after I started, a coworker quit so their work was split between me and another coworker. Eventually, my other coworker got a promotion/rate increase and I got the other half of the job duties that were originally split, so I am doing my job plus the job of the person who quit three days after I started- all within my first month or two of being there. I know now that it was “performance punishment.” I held off on asking for a raise with my new tasks because I was new, nervous and thought I would get a better raise at my 90-day eval. 

My boss had a private meeting with me and said nothing about my 90-day eval. They just said “I think you’ve done amazing so I will pay for you to get your insurance license and if you pass you will get a huge increase and a new title, if you’re open to it.” This promotion would be to replace the person that quit 3 days after I started, and my boss would hire someone new to replace my current role. BUT my issue is, I still want my 90-day evaluation increase since I took on so many extra tasks in my first 1-2 months of working here. Because if I don’t pass the licensing exam, I don’t get the promotion and I would still be where I am now. 

I asked my boss about the 90-day eval pay increase for my performance and they said “I agree that your performance has been great, that’s why I offered you the promotion.” Which to me sounds like I’m being offered this promotion INSTEAD of my 90-day eval raise. Am I wrong for wanting to still get a small (at least $1) increase in my hourly rate now, just in case I do not pass the licensing exam to get the promotion with the big rate increase and new title?",yeehawmeemaw,1,1.0,1,1713870866,2024-04-23 11:14:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cb1xmc/no_raise_at_my_90day_evaluation_but_promotion/,4,2024

I want to shift my career from support since i do not like the role very much and do not want to climb the ladder in the support trajectory.

1cazvfs,Road to become Process Engineer from Field Service Engineer in the Semiconductor Industry?,"Hi guys,  
  
I am working for almost 1.5 years a Field Service Engineer for Physical Vapor Deposition ( PVD ) tools in Germany. I have a bachelor's degree in engineering and also did master's in applied math where I did my master thesis on PVD tools. This thesis somehow matched with the FSE job and I quickly grabbed this job because I had no other options at that time.  
  
However, I now feel this job is more of a technician type of job which requires minimal thinking. We mostly just follow procedures and manuals and I feel the brainlessness would surely hurt my career in future. Also, this job is physically demanding ( often involves straight 10-11 hours work in the fab ) and I honestly do not want to see myself doing this for the rest of my life.  
  
However, the semiconductor industry is now booming and will continue to do so. This is an exciting field and I really want to stick in this industry. I see a lot of process engineers who work with us on the same tools and their jobs seem much more relaxed and creative. I am wondering, is it possible to successfully transfer myself as a full-time process engineer with my FSE background?  
  
What skills do I need? What tools should I learn? I looked at the job descriptions and found SPC, Yield management etc are almost always wanted and I can surely learn those. But in the FSE job I am not using these tools. How can I convince the employer that I have those skills if I do not have real experience?

Now, i clearly understand we are still on bad terms, so as per my knowledge I will be converted to FTE after 6 months but I left after working 48 days and other month is leave.
Now it's been 10 months I left job and been unemployed, gave my shot to do mba, but nothing works so i finally made up my mind to get a job in a new company and give my best.
So,
1. I don't have any of PF account created or have any UAN. I got paid in bank account only 2 times because I worked for about that time, that's all!!!
Question is: will my old company intentionally create the pf account, can they do that without my knowledge??? 
2. Is all first job experience this way?, I joined a unprofessional company and did my resignation in unprofessional way, it's just affected me mentally.
3. How to explain this situation to future employers, is it necessary to bring up the old company or I want to know?
4. I want to start as a fresher, I can do that but few companies are asking for reliving letter, how to answer them?

Backstory: I am waiting on someone to review a project I am working on, but they are taking much longer than expected to review. This person has a bit of a track record for being difficult, so I’ve been working hard to build a good relationship. 

My boss told me to email them and essentially threaten I will be sending it to the reviewer’s boss next week so they need to hurry up. I did send the email, but when the person apologized and asked for more time we compromised on one additional week. The person will be at a conference all week, so reviewing next week will be very difficult. 

Today my boss asked me about the status of this project and if I’m sending for a final review today. For some reason I panicked and lied and said the current reviewer called me and asked for more time and to extend an olive branch since they called me I told them that was fine. 

But they never really called, it was all over email. I don’t know why I did other than I don’t agree with my boss’s way of handling this and them calling sounded like a better reason to extend.

I am conflicted on whether I should go get a masters degree in Computer Science or get an MBA or try to job hop in the teaching industry for a better salary. 

A few things I like about teaching is you get a lot of vacations and breaks. Cons are low salary, monotonous routines and boredom of teaching same thing.

1caxrb8,Do you think any of these ways my coworker acts is better than the way I act? I'm asking because I truly don't know?,"It doesn't bother me if someone says a certain way my coworker acts is truly better. I just truly don't know if these ways she acts is better:

1. I would say she expresses a lot more enthusiasm at work than me in general. For example, when I walk by people I know I'll usually just look at the ground in front of me or just say ""hey (their name)"". But she'll enthusiastically say hello and say things like ""how are you"" or ""good morning"". It's not that I'm negative either. It's just that I find it difficult to find a lot of enthusiasm in my work environment.

2. I would say pretty much every time she wants to talk to someone she'll either choose to call them or walk up to them face to face. What I do is ill text people over Skype unless the person is near me or what I'm trying to say involves a lot of communication. For example, if someone is a 5+ minute walk from me and what I say involves less than 10 sentences I'll pretty much always opt for sending texts.

3. I would say she more so tends to be a perfectionist at work and my view is that if something works and there's no history of issues related to what I'm doing then there's no need to check it 5+ times. 

4. I feel like she'll often delegate tasks/responsibilities to other people. However, I never do that unless someone tells me they want to learn what I'm doing. For example, I'll never tell a coworker to clean up a lab area if it seems messed up.  I'll just do it myself even if I wasn't the person who messed it up.

1cawsul,Hoping someone has advice for my ridiculous problem that’s holding me back. ,"I’ll cut to the chase (29F). It’s not even embarrassing to me anymore because I have lived with it for so long now. 

5 years ago I was sitting in an onboarding session for a company I use to work at, and a thought crossed my mind which has gone on to impact my professional and personal life detrimentally. 

The thought after a tummy rumble was “wouldn’t it be so embarrassing if you farted right now” and with that, I have been OCD obsessed with the fear of passing wind in a meeting or quiet room with another person or a big group of people. 

I have never accidentally farted in a meeting or group so I don’t know why I am obsessed with it as it’s not based on it. 

I have tried to not let it stop me, and I always sit in on meetings at my current job but it causes me to be suppressing a full blown panic attack the entire meeting so I’m not really *present* and contributing. 

At the time when this fear formed, in hindsight I was extremely unhappy and stressed. But now? I am totally fine and am actually quite happy and stoked on life with very minimal anxieties yet still this weird as fuck phobia persists. 

It causes me at times to have to get up and leave the meeting for a breather or to go to the bathroom. 

I don’t want to have this fear anymore, it’s impacting my career growth and potential jobs because I gauge my suitability for new roles based on whether or not I will have to have regular meetings. 

Without this issue, meetings would be a blast for me. I am a confident public speaker, I enjoy sharing ideas and collaborating. 

It’s obviously not something I can easily share with new employers or colleagues and I usually brush it off as “claustrophobia”.

I have propranolol and benzos sometimes to calm me but they don’t always help and I try not to lean on them too much for obvious reasons. And I also have tried hypnotherapy which was relaxing and lovely and I enjoyed the therapist but that didn’t work. 

I’m at a loss and would appreciate any kind words or any advice you can think of to try and quash this absolutely absurd issue I have.

1cavwlf,Switching career fields,"(I assume cross-posting is fine?)

Welp, I thought working in my passion industry would make the dismal pay worth it and. . . it doesn't. Trying to figure out my Plan B and would appreciate any advice. 25, based in Brooklyn, USA.

For context, I have a BA in English and I've been working in publishing production for the past couple of years. I think my best bet is getting a Masters in a different field but I haven't ruled out getting a project management certification or learning a trade. Salary-wise I'd like to break 100k at some point in my life and make \~75k after getting retrained.

In a perfect world, my new job would let me keep working remotely without much human interaction (zoom calls are the bane of my existence) and maintaining a healthy work/life balance (eg 40 hrs/wk or less, OT every now and then is okay).

Won't do: teaching, technical writing, sales or anything else overly extroverted, sex work, anything military related; would like to stay away from government work in general

Some masters degrees I've been looking at (I've confirmed that I can do these with an unrelated Bachelors, I just may need to take some catch-up courses): computer science, cybersecurity, data science, human centered design, information systems, information technology, software development and engineering, data analytics, actuarial risk management, quantitative methods and modeling, accountancy

I've always been good at school - English has always been my strongest suit but math/science were never a struggle for me, plus I've been learning a little about coding via working on ebooks - so I feel confident about studying a new field.

My main questions are:

1. Does having a BA in English and then attending a community college for my Masters hurt my job prospects? Or does the specific school not matter so much?
2. Would having, say, a Computer Science Masters but an unrelated Bachelors make hiring managers consider me as basically having just a Bachelors in CS?
3. How much immigration potential is there in these fields? Thinking about leaving the USA for somewhere with universal healthcare.
4. Any personal experiences of people who have left the English job fields for (literally) greener pastures are greatly appreciated. . .
5. . . . as are general thoughts on the areas I listed above.
6. Any recommendations on where to find reputable salary statistics? I keep getting wildly different answers for the same job.

1cavsd1,"Fresh Computer Engineering Grad, Feeling Lost ","I recently graduated with my degree in computer engineering and I’m projected to start my new job in IT soon. I’m a little worried because my academic experience in college was tough. I am not naturally “left brained” and math and science never came easy for me. I’m graduating with a 2.6 GPA and I’ve never been more ashamed. I feel like I’m not fit enough for the job even though I was offered it. The only reason why I got offered the job was because I did an internship with them last summer which was really easy. My manager was super busy so he didn’t assign us too many difficult tasks. Most of the time was literally showing up to work, lounging around and doing some work on excel. We did do a few good projects though. I am thankful for the return offer, but I’m intimidated because this is now a full time job and I feel like they’re going to expect me to be very polished with my academic background. 

To sum up, I hated data structures and algorithms and barely remember anything from calculus and engineering courses. For the most part I did very average to below average in these courses. I also took more advantage of online resources that I should have (chatGPT, Chegg, Google, etc.) in order to get good grades on some assignments. I’m afraid that they’re going to think I’m a fraud or something and tell me “didn’t you already learn this in college?”

For anyone out there, how important is remembering stuff from your courses you took in college to apply to your actual job? Is there room for learning and making mistakes and hopefully catching on once I get experience? 

(All professional advice is welcome, STEM majors are ++)

Current job
Pro:
1. Good team and manager. No micromanagement 
2. Flexible on work hours, okay on appointments, etc.
Con:
1. Don’t see what I do change over next few years if I stay within the same company.
2. Don’t see any other promotion path except senior title. 

New position
1. Everything would be new, and require a bit more learning. I am excited to learn new stuff. 
2. It would tie to the construction industry in Canada. More work if there is new subdivision , etc. Not sure about the long term outlook if there is a downturn. Of course I understand everything would be affected by macroeconomic condition.
3. They have RRSP matching which i don’t  have currently.

I'm a 23M who graduated with a biotechnology degree last year. I come from an immigrant family that moved to the US 10 years ago, throughout my life, my dad always forced the idea of me going to college and I always believed that going to college would solve all my problems. I majored in biotech because I thought it was something cool to study, but didn't give it a thought at all. After I graduated I really wasn't happy with my degree to a point where I didn't attend my graduation because I was so disappointed with the idea of not finding any jobs before my graduation date. I finally landed a job in a few laboratories and all of them had a horrible experience to them. From that day I never wanted to work in a laboratory ever again. 5 months ago I finally found a job after a long time of applying to jobs and I landed a job as a regulatory affairs associate in a cosmetics company. Yet again I'm not happy with what I'm doing. I feel like every decision in my life that I'm taking is a forced decision, I never wanted to study biotech but I did and I never wanted to work in regulartory affairs but I did due to desperately wanting a job. I want to get out of RA but I don't know what to do next. I really love to learn and try new things but I'm extremely scared of the idea of getting a master's, have student loan, and also not land a job. Some days I like become a sales person, other days I like to work as a data analyst and so on. I don't know where I'm going in life. I'm not sure what I want to do, but I'm sure that I'd like a job where I can work from home and a job where I feel like I'm being productive and have an impact in my life. I'm still living with my parents and I feel like I'm still young and I can start all over again. I just wanted to get this out of my chest and I hope can learn from people who have been in the same situation and how they over came this problem.

1cau144,Director told me he thinks I’m here for my CV,"
I(25f) this finance role last year and have received good feedback from everyone about my performance and pro active nature. I sense the new director wants me out.

This director joined a few months ago, and I had a coffee chat with him. He asked how I’m finding the role, I said I’m enjoying it and get to improve on my excel skills. He asked if I had used excel before and I said yes, at university. We actually went to the same uni and did a similar course. 

Last week my Manager told me he is concerned about my performance and is questioning whether I can improve in a few weeks.I had a meeting with him today to get feedback on what I can do to improve, set performance objectives and so on. This was his feedback: 


Thinks I’m only here for the experience on my CV, I have one years experience now which is good.

Questions my commitment as I mentioned I was interested in a path to do with my career.

During the meeting he asked if I can see this as a career, I said I have only been here a year, I am interested a job related to my degree because I enjoyed my degree but haven’t had any practical experience.

He was quite rude. He put me off a big project because the last one didn’t go so well. It was my first big project and the other director ( he didn’t get the job of this new director) was supposed to be supporting me but he didn’t, everyone knows he’s slacking and waiting for a redundancy pay. 

He has only seen my work on this project and has made so many judgements about me. My other projects went so well, he hasn’t even asked other people for feedback on my work which has been great. He’s also judging my other colleague on his work too.


He said I mentioned I needed to improve on excels, to which I said 

He thinks I’m working slow. I was told by senior management that I would need to work over the bank holidays to get work done, he questioned as to why I needed to work over the weekend for simple tasks. I was told to do so, so I did.
 


Pay is terrible 33k for a finance role, overworked and stressful. I honestly just want to leave now..


It has been so stressful over the past few weeks as to get this feedback is disheartening. Maybe I shouldn’t have told him my other interests but my manager said there’s always possibility to move around, two of my other colleagues moved to different departments and she would always let me know when new opportunities came out. She even wanted to move to a different dept early on but couldn’t.


I’m searching for jobs aswell.

1catzsl,Running out of options with my university course,"I am a final year student in my local University doing a business degree. However I have grown disinterested and frustrated at my course, I feel like I am learning nothing while failing a lot of units in my last semester. I am diagnosed with persistent depression disorder and sometimes I just couldn't sleep while being socially anxious all the time. I lost contact with all my friends as I feel ashamed and hopeless at my current situation.

For context, I need just two more semesters to graduate but due to my academic failures my University is forcing me to do an intermission while possibly underloading for the rest of my time there. I wanted to do an international exchange to another campus so that I can a fresh start at a new environment but due to my sub-par CGPA/WAM it is not possible. I want to do an internal credit transfer or course transfer to a course that I might actually enjoy but that is not possible for the same reason.

Am I just stuck in this hole now? If I persist and graduate, most companies won't accept me as my academics are bad. If I want to do a new course, it's just going be so many years of me studying while most of my peers are working and starting their own businesses.

1catoej,Am I being used by Corporate at my gas station job? Is it legal???,"I work at a gas station in Connecticut at a branded Sunoco (like express mart but not that) and I’ve been here for seven years. There is a chain of them on the east coast. Just a little over a year and a half ago, I was promoted to Assistant Manager. My title in Paylocity changed, and so did my pay. 

Cut to 7 months later, the manager at our store quit. I saw my opportunity for a promotion, and took it. I reached out to the DM and asked if I could be the manager. 

They said they’d have to let me know, and they left it at that. Then, in December of last year, I get a call from the DM telling me I basically have the position, but they want to wait until after the new year to make it official. It’s now April, and I am still Assistant Manager, being payed assistant manager wage, and being forced to take on literally every single responsibility of a manager. 

And whenever I ask (I ask frequently) they say “oh I’m not too sure” or “the situation is weird right now” 

Nobody trained me, our last manager was an idiot and the DM knew that, and she knew I had little to no experience. And now every week I’m forced to do all of these really important things, like Payroll and the paperwork, without knowing what I’m doing or if I’m even doing it right. If I screw up, I risk screwing up BIG - ESPECIALLY when it comes to payroll. 

I guess my question is: is this legal?",kevelda,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1713840113,2024-04-23 02:41:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1catoej/am_i_being_used_by_corporate_at_my_gas_station/,4,2024
1catnvs,Casual job interview/meet the boss tomorrow. How honest should I be about why I'm leaving my current role?,"I've been contacted by a role I applied for and had a phone chat. We're meeting in person tomorrow for a chat, coffee, etc about the role and to get to know each other. The boss is a franchise owner, (let's call it Franchise A) I would be managing their location. I've worked for Franchise A in the past (different location) and since switched to a competitor, Franchise B. I'm leaving Franchise B to go back to Franchise A. 

The reason I'm leaving my current job is for a couple of reasons. Firstly, having worked at both, I now know that the values/processes etc of Franchise A are more in line with my own values. I find my work more rewarding there, the product works better, etc. 

Secondly, and most importantly, my current role has been plagued with workplace bullying and harassment by a small group of members/customers and my coworker who encourages it. These exact issues existed before I took on the role, in fact that's what made the previous manager leave. Unfortunately I didn't know this and have had abusive messages sent to my personal phone, false information about me spread around like gossip, and so forth.

The franchise owner is aware and knew about it with the previous manager too, but incredibly passive, as he has a lot of other investment projects to look after. 

**With all that said - my question is**... do I express this reason to seek other employment with the new potential employer, or just stick with the first reason? I am obviously very keen to exit this situation and don't want to accidentally mess up this great opportunity. I'm leaning towards keep it quiet, but I feel like having a coffee and chit chat it might pop up.

1catkhs,Career advancement at same comp,"Hi Reddit,

I currently work at a large healthcare payer and have been a bit bored in my analyst role for awhile. I’m almost at 3 1/2 years and have gained a lot of experience and influence in my org, but they won’t entertain a promotion based on “funding” restriction in the department. 

Recently, I applied and was offered a manager role (with 4 directs) at a smaller health plan/payer roughly around the same compensation package I receive now.

I’m just wondering if anyone has ever made the leap to a smaller company just to get managerial experience, but taken on that risk of higher workloads for similar pay. This new company has more equity up front in the form of salary, while my current role is more bonus heavy.

Looking for a bit of insight or personal experience. I’m also worried that if I leave for a smaller company and try to break back into other larger health plans it will be much more difficult when you at looking for manger/director level roles.

$6.5k more than internal, putting me right at $100k base salary

Industry leader, with a new product that is extremely profitable. Lots of projects coming up soon, with plenty of opportunities to grow.

Better bonus %, better relocation package (pays literally for everything + rental car + temporary housing)

In a major city in the Midwest, but isolated from the rest of my industry. Relatively low COL.

5 days on site. Commute from downtown would be ~15 mins each way.


Internal:

Slightly underpaid compared to my skills/exp (would expect like $95k in this area, instead of just over $93k)

Worse bonus %, and so-so relocation package

Hybrid: 3 days on, 2 days off

Location where I got hired is kind of a mess

Projects have slowed down, and we just went through a reorganization + realized my org went overbudget by... a lot

10 more vacation days

Located in an industry hub, where it would be easier to get employed at a different company in the same industry 

COL is slightly higher than the better paid company

1casrch,Should I move for more money and career growth?,"I (M28) am currently an Associate Manager and am making about 80k a year. I am engaged (F27) and we have a 5 year old daughter. She is currently a stay at home mother and my daughter starts school later this year. I currently oversee 11 employees in an IT related field and I am really good at what I do. I pay $1550 in rent and it goes up yearly. 

I am from a small town originally and lived their a majority of my life before moving to where I live currently. The town I live in now is very touristy and is severely overpopulated. My fiance enjoys the area, but we have both came to terms that we will never be able to own a home here. 

I've gotten word that a position with the same company I'm at is opening up in a larger city near where I am from originally. The pay is 102k a year and I would be overseeing an entire state, rather then just a single city. 

If I got the job, id have to relocate to an area that is not as pretty, has a lot less to do, and crime is higher then where we are now. I am unsure on schooling options currently. 

 Because of that though, cost of living is better and I feel as though this would be great experience for a resume. I have no degree, so I want to capitalize on the opportunities that I can. 

My fiance is a little hesitant to move back to my home state because it's much smaller and frankly boring compared to where we are now. We are going to check out the area in the next few weeks to get an idea if it's something we want to do. Also, we wouldn't be living there forever.

1casrah,What to do if new workplace doesn't appear to want to provide me (a new hire) with login credentials?,"Hi again, All! I'm following up with an update on my last post (btw, thanks to everyone who shared advice with me): [prev post](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/Wt7xp3LSwa) . I had the call with the remote company on Saturday, but have yet to hear back on whether or not I'm moving forward in their hiring process. 

Today I went in for my first day of work at a small local business. It went really well I think, as I learned a lot and had pleasant interactions with my colleagues. The office was also super chill, which I liked.

However, I have an odd feeling, and maybe I'm being too paranoid, but I can't help but think about it...

I learned of the circumstances of why my position opened up. The previous worker before me had to suddenly take leave due to an ailing family member, and it appears they haven't quit the job. As of now, their leave time and return date are indeterminate. 

During training, I was directed to use their credentials/accounts to access email and other programs. I then inquired when I'd receive my own, as I usually received my own login info and email address within one to three days at my previous jobs. One of my trainers, a longtime employee, replied that I'll get my own 'if I stay a long time.' Additionally, I'll be using the previous employee's desk area instead of having my own set up (there are other unoccupied desks in the office area available).

That reply has left me stumped, as they didn't provide a timeframe. I don't see this as a normal response, but please let me know if I'm wrong. It makes me feel like my role is only a temporary placeholder until the other employee returns, and then I'll be let go. I'm fairly certain it's standard to give all employees their own login info quickly as it's bad cybersecurity practice to let employees access others' accounts. 

I want to give this new job a chance, but I'm feeling like I should keep on job hunting too. I really can't help but feel uneasy, and I'm not in the right headspace to be let go again so soon. I don't know if the remote opportunity will reach out again, and if this job I secured turns out to be insecure, I'd honestly be in a slump. 

Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

1caslzm,Meeting with the CCO; should I go against my manager to advocate for myself?,"

I work at a large company. I was hired about a year ago into a new specialized role at the company. My pilot role has been a success and it’s looking like they want to create more of me across the company. 

I have a meeting tomorrow with our chief commercial officer who wants to ask me questions about why the role has been successful.

My manager has created a list of 5 bullet points she would like me to convey about what it takes for a person to be successful in this role and has instructed me that I need to convey these to the CCO. The list reflects her opinions and her agenda and there are aspects I disagree with. 

One of which is that she feels the role needs to report to the regional VP (her). I personally don’t agree with this. 

I’ve expressed to her that if this role were to expand, I would like to help lead that growth and step into a a management role. What I find frustrating is that in so many words she has said she doesn’t want to see me lead that supposed team bc it would mean I had less time for her region (we are in sales so that would result in less revenue for her and I currently directly contribute to 20 million in revenue so that would be a big loss for her but  a gain for the company if I can have a wider reach). 

The crux of my question is whether to follow her list or to advocate for myself? And if there later, how to do that tactfully? This will be my first time meeting our CCO, so I don’t have a rapport with him to know if I can trust confidentiality if I were to tell him my managers agenda. 

Lots more details I could add, but trying to keep this brief bc I know how annoying a huge wall of text is.

1caqgf2,How do I become a university registrar?,"How do I become a university registrar?

Hi. I’ve been working since I was 17 years old in various areas; I started off working as a retail cashier at my local pharmacy, and then when I finished my bachelors degree in psychology, I worked a few contract positions in public colleges in Ontario within the career services sector. 

I’d been working as a career counsellor for seven years before I left the field last year to pursue more administrative roles within higher education. 

I currently work as an administrator for a financial planning designation organization. 

I really enjoy the role and I’m quite good at it and it’s opened up my interest in becoming a registrar. My goal is to work within a public academic institution as a registrar or associate registrar. 

After reviewing many job postings, I do see that a lot of my current tasks in my role align very well with those of an assistant registrar. The only problem is that these job postings also ask for a bachelors degree in education or something similar, and between 6 to 8 years of experience. 

I am willing to earn more credentials to be qualified enough to apply for these positions , but I don’t quite know where to start and I also don’t wanna go back to university for an entirely new degree. 

Wondering if any Coursera courses would suffice in this case? I don’t have the time or money to go back for a degree but I do have time and the resources to complete the courses I need through Coursera (my work gives us a membership/subscription to the platform). 

I know it’s a bit ironic for someone who’s been a career counsellor for seven years to be posting something about this, but I find that it’s easier to help others than to help myself and I’m just looking for some guidance or a sense of direction. I’ve done as much research as I could, and it looks like I have to go back to school.

1caozww,Career change,"Hi.
I've been thinking about quitting my job for a few months now, and it's been weighing heavily on my mind lately. It's a tough call because I work at a startup that's growing, which has brought plenty of opportunities for career growth. But the fast-paced work, outdated processes, company culture clashes, and conflicts with other departments have been wearing me down. Plus, the leadership is a bit unclear. Being one of the longest-serving employees, I'm always the go-to person in my department, which gets exhausting. Training new hires is a lot of work. 

I was planning to resign in early May, but then my boss suddenly told me I'd be training new people indefinitely, without any warning, and they couldn't push back the training either. With our team short-staffed, problems keep cropping up, and I'm already feeling the burnout creeping in. Sometimes I feel like I don't even go looking for trouble, but it finds me anyway.

A while ago, I was offered a leadership position in my department because of my good work, but I turned it down. I know how things operate here, and the stress of the role, along with the tiny pay increase and lack of interest in the role, made it a no-go. It's not uncommon to hear my boss joking about needing meds to cope with work and I definitely don't want to end up in that situation. 

I guess that's why I'm all about quiet ambition now. Basically, I just want a chill life and I don't see myself getting that with this job. I just want something that pays the bills without taking over my personal life.

I've got a backup plan in mind. I've always been into art, so I'm trying to reconnect with that and maybe start my own business.

It's sad to admit that this job isn't the right fit for me, despite the growth opportunities. I wouldn't feel fulfilled in a leadership role, but the people I work with are great. It's frustrating, but I think it's time to move on.

Has anyone else been through something like this?",StarlightSeraph76,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1713827061,2024-04-22 23:04:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1caozww/career_change/,4,2024
1caos10,Best next step for my career?,"


Hi all. I’m a 28M from California with a Bachelor’s in Psych and an MBA. 

Graduated in 2020 and started my career in Paid Social Marketing at an agency. At the time, as an entry position, I was happy with the pay but it hasn’t grown as much as I wanted and there isn’t much growth opportunity there. 

I’m looking to pivot or stay in the same field but hit 85-100k positions. I’ve been applying for similar roles with more responsibility, I’ve gotten a handful of interviews but no offers. 

I’ve also started a PMP course as I think it will be a helpful certification across a bunch of industries. 

Do you have any advice for me, any questions, or an idea of what similar/adjacent roles I can excel in given my experience and education. I know I can truly devote myself to a career if I just get the chance.

I currently earn 70k a year. I recently found out that someone in a junior role and less industry experience is earning 5k more than me a year (75k). I confronted my boss, gave the reasons as to why I felt I wanted my pay to increase. The main reasons for this were:  


1. I wanted my pay to reflect the value that I bring to my current Employer. (Been with them for just over 2 years and had countless good feedback from clients and peers).
2. I wanted the pay to accurately reflect my role (Being a Senior).

&#x200B;

My Manager took this away I found out today that I would not be getting the raise I requested (85k) which, while it's their right to do so, has left me annoyed. This I feel has left me with two options, and I want to make sure I'm not making an ego-inflated decision.

i guess my main concerns/questions are

1. if i ask, and boss says no, would they see me as a flight risk to look for another job now that they know I want something they can provide?

2. i did quite literally start today - on one hand, id like to bring it up as soon as possible in case we want to do it at the end of the year, but on the other, I'm not sure if id be seen as high maintenance if i ask to move three time zones away in my first month. would you wait a while to pitch it or should i get it done asap?

3. the job listing was fully remote, and on my first call, the recruiter mentioned that, though they were open to anywhere in the US, they did prefer someone in eastern time. if that's the case, is it even worth it to try and ask? i know she mentioned it was open to anywhere, but again, worried about being seen as a flight risk

1can2t9,I am graduating college and have no idea what to do ,"Hi, I am a 22F and am graduating college next month and have no idea what to do. I am studying Economics and have acquired some experience so far (an investment banking and markets internship at some pretty reputable banks). I hated investment banking (mostly due to the hours). 

I have tutored part time throughout my degree and really get satisfaction from helping students. I also like that it pays decently / hour and ensures a work life balance. My ideal scenario would be too continue teaching, perhaps open up my own tutoring agency. 

I have a job lined up to start in September - teaching English as a foreign language abroad. It pays decently well - only working 16 hours a week, and am thinking that it may give me the time to be able to start up such tutoring agency, and save up some money. I also have never moved out of home, so maybe it will also give me some general life experience of living abroad etc. 

However, have been dreaming of going travelling - I want to book a one way ticket to south america and backpack till i get tired of it. I have been wanting to do this for quite some time, and have become fluent in Spanish too. 

I also have an internship in Finance from June - September. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I am excited about teaching abroad, but also don’t know whether to go travelling now instead. i am also considering doing the teaching for 1 year (it is a contract from sep - june 2025) and then going travelling after. 

But at the same time i am thinking maybe my chance is now. I am single, have no commitments, and maybe that will change in a year. 

That would mean taking essentially 2 gap years, since if tutoring doesn’t work out then I would have to wait again before starting a finance grad role. 

Another concern is also if i go travelling,and whilst abroad do get more tutoring clients, what will i then do - will my work trying to get up a small business go back to square 0? 

Apologies for what a brain dump this post is! 

If anyone has any insight or advice would be much appreciated - i am so lost of what to do as you can tell!

1calqva,Any Advice on handling an awkward situation? ,"Hey all,

First time poster here so please excuse any formatting errors. I need some help with a pretty awkward situation that I find myself in and figured I’d turn to some internet strangers for help lol.

Basically, about a month ago I accepted an offer with a firm that I was very excited about, for a position starting on 4/30. I put in my notice at my old job but as I was doing so my VP told me that if I wanted to work in the interim then there was a project that I could take on that coincidentally was for my new employer. I happily agreed since the pay was very good but told him that this was on condition that I would get 2 weeks off prior to starting full time at my new firm and he said that wouldn’t be a problem.

I again confirmed this time off with him on an email that I sent on 4/9 and I was given no indication that this would be a problem.

Fast forward to this weekend - I was told that I would have no time off before starting the new job. My supervisor actually reached out to me and said I had to cancel my already paid for vacation because they can’t handle the workload without me. On top of that, I also found out that I’d be doing the same work that I’m doing for them now, except for half the pay.

I’m incredibly disgruntled at this point and have no motivation to do any of the work anymore. Everyone I’ve spoken to has told me to email them declining the offer and the only reason I haven’t done so is because I don’t want to burn any bridges as you never know what might happen in the future.

Can anyone help me navigate this situation? Thanks in advance.",khaledalt,0,0.5,0,1713819503,2024-04-22 20:58:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1calqva/any_advice_on_handling_an_awkward_situation/,4,2024
1calcyp,Temporarily Switching Career Path. Need Advice!,"I went to university to study graphic design. I graduated debt-free & have been working part-time & full-time roles as a Graphic Designer since 2021.

1caksie,Boss that laughs at me,"For about 6 weeks, I’ve (30 M) been the sole employee of a real estate agent (30 M). I’m on a training wage working full-time and with this person 9 hours a day.

They have never had employees before, so they consistently micromanage and move the targets I’m working towards, creating stress in an attempt to seem like a proactive boss it seems.

They will stand behind me when I’m taking the photos, laugh or snicker multiple times if I make mistakes. They will extremely short and dismissive of me if I make a mistake and I must be with this person all day in their car which becomes VERY uncomfortable.

I am learning from them and they have a large superiority complex attributed to that. But I think I have learnt enough and have enough contacts to start looking at going out on my own.

Basically, my question is - am I being a little sook or overly sensitive and should put up with this, or is this something I shouldn’t accept as treatment of myself?

1cakn7t,When is it appropriate to send a resignation letter?,"I'm in a small business practice, ran by the husband (the dr.) And wife (works from home on email/phone).
I'm a coordinator for clinical studies our practice is involved in, and it's only myself coordinating everything. The trials last about 2-4 years. I've been doing this for 1 year, I was kind of brought into it because they didn't have anyone else to do it, and they had not started enrolling patients yet. 

I'm thinking of giving atleast a 1-1.5months notice to see if they will hire someone else to take this roll on. The thing that holds me back is the owners take offense very easily and are VERY difficult to work with (mainly the wife due to mental health issues).

I have 2 resignation letters written already. 1 is effective immediately because some days I can't deal with the degrading from the wife.

1cakacg,Would you take a lowerpaying job in this case?,"Hi everyone, just looking for a second opinion on what I’m currently going through. 

I currently work PT remotely in education  having gotten a job right out of uni, now I’m wanting to try something else but surprise surprise jobs are pretty competitive these days, so there have been a few rejections and a few of me not applying because I’m not qualified at all (even though I know I should still at least try, I know). But I think I’ve been luckier than most because I’ve been passively sending applications since December (maybe 3 applications a month or so) and have gotten 4 interviews up to this point. I had to back out of 3 of those (1 because I was stupid to turn it down, and the other 2 because they refused to tell me the salary). So right now I have an interview lined up at my old high school as a career coach, but I’m hesitant about going through with it. 

Pros of this job: doesn’t seem too stressful (but I could be wrong), has to deal with something I already currently do sort of (career development/guidance for students), I get to go back to my old high school which I love, gives me professional experience in certain areas that potentially make me more employable (public speaking, Microsoft Office, administration stuff)

Cons: quite low pay (I make about $7 more than what they are offering), it’s PT so no benefits at all, long commute (30-40 min drive), having to deal with students and parents, I often find career coaches to be unhelpful so I don’t think I would be any help either

In this case I don’t know if the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa. The way I see things working out is that this job could potentially raise my chances of becoming an academic advisor at a local university later on, even though that’s not really my dream job, but it is A permanent and somewhat stable job that doesn’t pay in peanuts (not here at least). Technically speaking I could do both this job and the job I have currently but I really would like a permanent FT job with benefits (who doesn’t). Maybe I can’t be too picky though. 

Not to be self-defeating either but I don’t know if I would even be a reliable career coach. I mean go figure, I don’t know what I’m doing, how could I possibly give valuable advice to students. The most I can do is give them pointers on their resumes and cover letters, but anything beyond that is something that I have no experience/understanding of.

I’m young so I’m still figuring out what my options are. I know I have many. There are lots of other things I’d like to be too. Just trying to figure out the plan for right now. 

Any advice or general thoughts would be much appreciated. ",thr_0w_a_way,3,1.0,0,1713815276,2024-04-22 19:47:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cakacg/would_you_take_a_lowerpaying_job_in_this_case/,4,2024
1cak7cy,Is a Raise Justified?,"Hi all.

I work with 5 other people under a govt. grant. Grants are 5 year terms. The last grant began in 2019, so we are writing the grant for the next 5 year period. The grant is very secure— we will get it because we are the poorest region in our state and that’s what it is based on. At the start of the last grant we were making $19.70. No we’re making 21.10. Our supervisor said there were cost of living raises built into the last grant, which we received each October. However, we still all feel we are not making enough due to inflation. We really want her to write in for more. She resists because she’s afraid it will be denied— which is silly because they will just make us revise it if it is.

Can we justify a raise by pointing out that 19.70 in 2019 is worth more like $24 today? Is that sound reasoning?

1cahkse,Did I mess up by telling my boss about my coworker? ,"Found out today that one of my coworkers has been sending screenshots of our team’s Slack conversations to a client. His role is kind of a liaison between team and client. Instead of typing an email out to ask or explain a question, he has been sending screenshots of our informal discussions. Multiple lines of chat messages, unfiltered. 

While nothing in these chats was rude or insulting, I definitely had immediate concerns about professionalism and how this reflects on our team. We don’t interact in these chats in the same way we would in a client-facing circumstances. In one of the screenshots, you can see our team clearly discussing how we don’t have the capacity to take on a rush deadline, etc. Just things that should never make it to a client. 

I also felt pretty violated that a chat we felt was just for our department was being shared OUTSIDE of the company. I recognize that there’s no privacy with work chats, but I do think there’s an expectation that internal Slack conversations won’t make it to the client. 

Anyway, in one of the screenshots, you can clearly see me telling my coworkers that I am confused about information that is missing from a project. The coworker in question took a screenshot of this and sent it to the client with a “can you help her?” I felt like this reflected on me poorly. I would never speak to a client so informally and our company is SERIOUS about professional communication. 

Once I discovered the screenshots (cc’d on a email that contained them), I politely brought it to the attention of our boss and asked if there’s any way we can avoid sending chat screenshots to clients in the future. I explained that I don’t think coworker had any bad intentions, but I had concerns about something potentially being misinterpreted. In the moment, I felt like I needed to protect myself in case the client said something.

My boss had no idea this was happening and now it has blown up. My partner told me today that he thinks I should have spoken with the coworker directly and now I look “like a snitch”. Now I’m starting to think that I overstepped.  This is the first time in my career that I’ve ever brought something like this up to a superior. Have I ruined my reputation?

1cahj3s,My Job feels meaningless,"Sup reader, so I'm 27M and as the title says, my job feels meaningless. This post may come off as venting but you're free to give your two cents or whatever. Kinda just want to get my feelings out there.

TL;DR: Artist is being a little bitch that he has to work a real job lol idk

So to give some context I'm working for this BPO company. I'm a video editor that mainly edits real estate videos for people in the States, (I'm from Asia). I've worked here for a little over a year, I'm actually nearing my second year around November. A little about me, I'm an artist, an illustrator, comic book creator, animator and that's what I've always been passionate about. To me, art gives me meaning in my life.

Now how did I end up in this job? So last 2020 I was a full time freelance artist and I got lucky and met a client that essentially supported me for a little over a year and a half singlehandedly. Time passed and shit went down and we kinda agreed that we couldn't work with each other anymore. The problem was, even though I was a freelance artist I only had him as my client and never bothered to look for other clients, and the reason for that was because I wanted to prove to my client that I was serious with working with him. But that didn't work out so yeah, I needed to get a job to support me and my wife.

Fast forward I ended up in my current job cuz pickings for clients were slim and we needed to earn money somehow. So yeah, to open up the work situation, I'm in the night shift as to accommodate the time for people in the US. Now, my workmates are great and I would consider myself lucky that the people I work with vibe with me and vice versa. My first few months leading up to a year here was great. I learned a lot since this is my first actual office job, and the company's work culture was lax, especially at night shift. I eventually got promoted, was given some bigger responsibilities which I didn't really mind because I liked the challenge. Won some awards on our anniversary so they recognized my value etc. Pay is kinda mediocre but I understand that since this was my very first time in an office job and this was and entry point for me. My wife even got a job working from home and she earns way more than I do, around like, 4-5 times more and I couldn't be more happier for her. Everything looked like it was going great right?

Moving to last December of 2023. It was Christmas vacation for me from December 24-January 2 since I saved up my leaves throughout the year. It was the first time in a LONG time being able to sleep at night consistently, just having time to myself and reflect on this year of 2023. And I realized that I have not drawn as much. It's as if my flame for art was dwindling and every time I tried to draw, I was reminded of my shitty experience towards the end with my last client as a freelance artist. But art is who I am, I kind of started to get... I don't know, an existential crisis? For the year of 2023 I was focused on my job that did help my wife and I get back on our feet, which, fyi 2022 was the shittiest year of my life thus far. We were broke as hell and it really really tested my wife and I's tenacity.

Anyway, February 2024 rolls around and I noticed that the company was starting to get a bit more stricter with their policies which I don't mind, it's a company ofc they can do that. But they haven't hired new people for over 6 months since. Work was starting to pile on, and basically shit was starting to change around me. It's as if, my time reflecting during my holiday break lifted the rose tinted filter I saw within the company. Editing videos were starting to become monotonous. The clients I was editing for felt like a pain in the ass. It felt like it was the same shit but different day, you know what I mean? And then March comes in and a shitton of people from the dayshift starts to resign. So the clients from that shift was starting to get thrown at us, but the team is very low on manpower to edit all these videos. And another interesting thing started happening.

My fire for art and drawing returned. I suddenly found myself drawing like crazy at work. It came to a point where when I stopped because I had to edit real estate videos I started to experience ennui. My performance was dipping but I was still doing decent. It's not like management came to me and complained but I could tell that I wasn't as efficient as when I first got in this company. The more time at home I spent drawing the more I felt like my work editing real estate videos felt pointless. As in, I wasn't feeling growth as a person there anymore. And the pay didn't really increase as much, it felt miniscule even with my promotion.

My wife is currently doing great with her job but I want to match what she's earning because I don't want to have to keep asking money from her because of how little I get paid at work. I don't mind her earning more than me but I just want to match it so there's more money for the both of us you know? I've relayed how I've felt with my job and pretty much everything I've felt in this long ass story (Which I'm so sorry for the long read btw) to her and she's very supportive with my thoughts of resigning to become a freelance artist again. But here's the kicker. My wife and I have been planning to have our wedding next March, since we only had a civil wedding and I fear that if I leave, I won't be able to find enough clients to save enough money till then. She's very confident we can both pull it off but I don't know.

So that leads us to the whole point of why I'm here on reddit, I think I'm developing depression because I don't find meaning with what I do with most of my days anymore. It's monday as I'm writing this and I don't know, I guess I felt this looming dread over my head that I'm going off to work to do menial tasks where instead I could continue to pursue my art career and with what I'm good at and passionate about. It feels like I'm wasting time at my current job. There are conventions happening this year and I haven't felt this passionate in a long time making art, I intend to attend more cons this year and just try to fall in love with art again, and yes I have been earning money from my art but I feel like I could earn so much more if I resign freeing up my time.

Now again, I'm not sure what I'm experiencing is depression or maybe I'm being a little bitch because I do recognize how lucky I am, I have great coworkers, the management; although is kinda strict we can still afford to goof off, the actual work is at worst boring af, and we do get all the government benefits etc blah blah blah, all your corporate stuff. Others are way worse off dealing with wage theft, shitty coworkers, terrible work conditions and hours, etc. And I get it, life is unfair and you can't get everything that you want. You gotta find a way to pay the bills and put food on the table, I understand that. Really the main thing that really sucks here is the pay especially since I've stuck around for over a year, been promoted and, at least in my eyes, I feel like my performance have been spot on. Maybe that's not enough to get a substantial pay raise? I wouldn't know, this is my first office job after all.

But I did some reflecting and the main reason why I had to take a ""real job"" and ditch my freelance life was because we really needed stable income that time, but now we're back on our feet financially and theoretically my wife could support the both of us even if I'm still going to look for clients for myself as a freelance artist again, it's made me consider on resigning. Hell if I got clients to draw for, I could earn way more than what I'm earning at my current job but again, since it's freelance, it has that essence of the unknown and inconsistency as opposed to having a consistent wage every month. It's come to a point where if they every give me another promotion I wouldn't want to accept it because I don't want more responsibilities in this company.

But I guess what I'm saying is that, I feel like I could do so much more with my life, and that fire of creating art is burning brighter and brighter everyday, and my job feels like it's hindering me from doing, what I feel like, what I'm meant to do. And that makes me depressed. It makes me feel hopeless and directionless in life.

Am I actually depressed? I'm not sure. But I sure as hell feel discontent with my current position in life.",Throway1234321234321,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1713808852,2024-04-22 18:00:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cahj3s/my_job_feels_meaningless/,4,2024
1cahao9,Leave a salaried role for a contract?,"I wasn’t looking for a new role but was approached by a headhunter and am open to new opportunities, primarily because I am being underpaid for the work I do. I returned from maternity leave last year to a big change in my workload that is now functioning as a senior role with a lot of additional responsibilities/demands. I got a 5% raise based on performance since, but they have not considered compensating me for the job description change.  I’m now making a little under 75k plus 5% RRSP matching, pension, annual bonus and stock. Still averages out less than 90k annually. 

The role being offered is a 14 month maternity leave coverage contract- offered 110k (seems to be room for negotiation- I’d like to get 120) and is through a contracting company so there are some basic benefits and basic insurance coverage. This new role is focused on one element of my current job- where with my current employer I am running the program alone as an “analyst” and this new role is a “senior advisor” as a part of a team for this program. 

Any advice?

1cahalp,How to deal with being ignored by HR? ,"I graduated from a relatively presigious design / liberal arts school with two bachelors degrees in 2022. A former colleague referred me to my current company. It’s a very well known company and has honestly, always been a dream company for me since I was a teen. 

At my previous job, I worked in retail and in less than year I moved up into the corporate office with a recommendation from my boss, while still working in college. It was still a customer service job, but hey - an office job within walking distance to school was not bad.

The job I accepted in May 2022 (and still work) is a low level corporate job - essentially customer service / online operations job (processing returns from online orders, etc), because I thought it would be a good opportunity to get into the company (keep in mind, this is a dream company for many people - think Apple or Google). **The role is part time with no health insurance. I get a 401k match and PTO. Last month, I had to move back home from NYC in with my parents secretly because I couldn’t afford living costs with my wage and didn't want to quit my job (I work remotely).**

**When I tell people I work for XXX, people are impressed and give me way more credit than I deserve because of the name recognition and say “how did you get a job there?”**

I know two colleagues who have worked the same position as me who were promoted to significantly higher positions (one of them now manages social media for the company with over 10 million followers on IG and they sent him to another country to help launch overseas). 

As I am still the most recently hired person on my team of 5, **I have been treading lightly and trying to gauge interest** from my other colleagues in terms of moving up in the company. Since this job is very low effort and flexible, **none of the people on my team have any ambitions to move up in the company. This is not just an assumption,** they have all expressed multiple times that they will ‘never quit this job unless they get fired'. 

Last summer, I was volunteering with the company (**nobody in the entire company showed up except HR**) and have networked through happy hours, etc. The head of HR even told my boss’ supervisor I showed up to volunteer. Unfortunately, the head of HR left the end of last year and they’re still looking to replace her. When she hired me, she asked me where my interests and experience lays and alluded to upward mobility at the company.

**My training lies in graphic design, digital media, web, and UX design. I have a BFA, BA, and a certificate.** 

I constantly check the HR portal to see if there are any job openings at the company, as the company relies on internal referrals. I saw several jobs that were literally perfect for me - perfect amount of experience, perfect qualifications, everything. I immediately emailed HR, specifically the talent recruiter, and it took her legitimately weeks to get back to me. I followed up, and once she got back to me, she would either say the roles were ‘no longer available’ and that ‘new jobs were on the horizon’ even though the listing had just been posted.

Several weeks later, I get a from HR email welcoming multiple new hires for the positions (who went to the same college as me) I expressed interest in, while my application says ‘in progress’. 

We have a general company email where we are encouraged to send questions, so I sent an email asking how I can be informed about ‘specific job openings’ because whenever I do so to HR, I don’t receive a timely response and the job is already closed. It’s coming up on 2 weeks, without a response. **Should I follow up?**

1. When I asked my boss about going full time last year, she said it wasn’t up to her, it was up to her boss. I’m starting to get so frustrated and like this is a dead end job and I have gained zero skills. 

I am **constantly** trying to interact with higher ups in other departments to make my name heard, giving feedback and pointing out errors with our products, often without credit.

This company is kind of notorious for being a conflict of interest - i.e. my boss hired one of her best friends who doesn’t do jack shit (still works full time with benefits) and I am usually the one fixing the errors.

**How do I move forward with this? Any ideas to escalate?** I really hate being this type of person but it’s starting to feel personal, and getting hired at another company without a referral feels impossible. 

Grateful for any advice. Sorry for any lack of coherence, I am angrily writing this on my lunch break.

TLDR; Working for mine and many peoples 'dream company' and am getting ignored by HR despite following all of the 'right steps'...",SuccessMechanism,1,1.0,3,1713808292,2024-04-22 17:51:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cahalp/how_to_deal_with_being_ignored_by_hr/,4,2024
1cah8qq,Should I be worried about a downturn in productivity?,"I (24) am an unpaid intern working in my career field for almost a year up to this point. More recently, I have started looking for paying jobs in the field which I am excited for, but it’s distracting me from work at the internship. It would be my first full and professional job that I would have, so I am taking it very seriously and putting as much work into that as possible. That and the fact that I work 4 days a week as an unpaid intern (1 hour+ commute) and 2 days at my other job to earn a few bucks on the side, leaving me with one day to recover before I do it all again. 

I’m not trying to create a sob story for myself or anything close to that, I just am at my mental capacity, and it is leading to a downturn in my productivity in my internship space, something I’ve been noticing for the past week. My boss told me so this morning via phone call as well. They are very nice and offered me time off to catch my breath. Maybe I am overreacting (as I’m prone to do), but the last thing I want to show them is that I am an unproductive or unprofessional worker. My bosses are really great connections to have in the field so the last thing I want to do is burn any bridges. Part of this is definitely my fault as I’ve metaphorically bit off more than I can chew by trying more than I’m capable of. 

My question is if I should apologize for this downturn in productivity or just leave it and increase my work and attention to detail. I’m very new to all of this, so it’s a bit of a culture shock. My internship ends in a month.

1cagv0t,Should I follow up? ,"An HR person (allegedly in a senior role) from a company reached out to me last Monday to tell me they’re interested in my application and ask for days/times that I’d be available for a phone screening over the next few days. I responded about an hour later with my availability last week.  When I didn’t hear anything by Thursday, I wrote again to ensure she’d received my availability. 

On Friday she responded that she’d been traveling FOR work to the corporate office and asked if I had availability on Monday (today). Puzzling because I assume she almost certainly knew she’d be traveling, but I told her yes I’d be available mid day today and we set a time. 

Well, that time has come and gone and I never heard a word. Her original email indicated she would call me and I was given no phone number to contact her. 

Would you follow up in an email or just let it go? Unfortunately I am interested in this position. It is not in HR and I’d likely not work with her at all if hired.

1cagtkr,Am I making the right decisions with the future in mind?  ,"Ive decided to turn to Reddit after asking everyone I know for advice and reaching the edge of annoying my spouse.

I’ve been in the online space of work (remote work) since 2018. During that time I did also go to college and get a bachelors in business admin. 

So besides a few internships I’ve only really been self- employed

It’s served me well, allowed me to travel and made me decent money.

(It’s in the SEO space to be less broad about it - not social media. I’m not even on social media so it’s not influencer crap lol 
I’d have a heart attack if I was in that space. )

I’m a very risk-averse person by nature and struggle with anxiety. A lot of people see me as lucky but I wake up with anxiety most days (already seeing a therapist for anxiety).

So I have no idea how I chanced into this. 

My all- consuming worry for months now has been “what if this income stream dies?” And “everyone is advancing in their careers (for example I know a lot of cops and nurses) and does my career even have growth opportunities even if it lasts”

I’ve decided to go back to school this fall for a second degree. It puts my mind at ease having a backup plan but I’m STILL worried.

It’s affecting my work, life, and relationship.

Im doing everything in my power to deal with it (therapy, research, medication for the anxiety) but it’s still so consuming that I’m on here.

Is this in my head?
Am I more stable than I’m giving myself credit for? 

I’m just finding it really hard to make decisions for my future.

For context I’m 24 now. ",perpetuallyworried78,1,1.0,2,1713807152,2024-04-22 17:32:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1cagtkr/am_i_making_the_right_decisions_with_the_future/,4,2024

1cagegj,Is it a terrible idea to leave a job after 3 months for Masters?,"Hi all,

I'm currently finishing up my degree, and I've been offered a junior role as a data analyst. I was hoping to do a masters in statistics in September. 

I'm just a little bit concerned - obviously working for the summer in a data driven role would be worthwhile, but since it's not just a summer role (it's a permanent role that I would just leave after three months), would this end up looking awful to future employers if I'd be applying to roles after doing the masters? Furthermore, if I work for somewhere for 3 months and can't really use them as a reference, is that even more damaging? I'm sort of pre-empting that they may be fairly upset with me (though they might not be, I just want to be prepared). 

It would definitely be my preference to do the masters this September, as it opens up other doors to me that wouldn't be available if I did it later, and I'm entitled to certain funding that I wouldn't be if I left it for the year. I'm also very much leaning towards doing a PhD afterwards, which again makes it more preferrable to do this September. I would have to do the Masters first though, as I wouldn't qualify for a PhD at the minute.

1cafsy0,Employees are quitting unexpectedly and without warning and I'm not sure why. Any advice? Has this happened to anyone else?,"Hi everyone, I work as a Sales Manager overseeing a handful of Sales Executives in a fairly niche industry, for privacy reasons I'll keep it vague. We've been seeing a trend of our salespeople quitting unexpectedly, without notice, and we're never able to get in contact with them again.

To be clear, we are a start-up, the job is work from home, make your own schedule and these sales positions are fully commission based, so I understand that turnover would be an issue for us right now, but a few of them come in, sign an agreement, are openly very excited to get started, and then go AWOL before training (through Zoom) has even been completed, so it's not like they even tried it before giving up. This was also an issue for my colleague, who hired on sales staff before me, he hired people on, and they ghosted before training even concluded, some made it through then completely ghosted us after working with us for months on end. They initially were very passionate about our field of work, and never expressed any issues with the job, yet none of them ever announced they were quitting prior to doing so and then suddenly we could never get back in contact with them. I'd also like to add that we do have a number of sales staff who have stayed on long term and done well in the position.

I know it might be vague, but is their any advice on what we could possibly do better to stop this from happening in the future? Has this happened to anyone else who's hired on people?

My perspective advisor is giant in the field who I admired for many years. Despite various immediate ""real-life"" concerns including family and kids, I muster the courage to take the ""red pill"" and took the post-doc role, burned bridges to do this.

However, my mentor just decided to retire from the university and fully devote to her startup---this is apparently a decision after an unexpected success with raising funds. Just had a call with her and she told me she can arrange another professor at the university to be my ""official advisor"", but since the professor is semi-retired and has no interest in taking students, I will actually work independently on the proposed topic we have been discussing or anything else I wish to work on (on my own post-doc funding). She said I'm welcome to talk to people in the department or contact her past students. She herself will not be able to collaborate or supervise me even in name due to her transition. Joining her startup is also not possible at the moment. I know nothing about this before and she dropped these bombs after everything is finalized and I will start 2 months later.

It really sucked and the industry job would be a perfect exist, which I was only able to get it after a lot of trouble and luck. The decision to study with my perspective advisor hinges on (i) my strong interest in her work; (ii) her approach in working closely with her students and strong mentorship style; (iii) the fact that her reputation in academia and the industry will open lots of doors for me.

1cabjd6,Should I do this extreme career/lifestyle change?,"Hello,

I have no idea who else to talk to about this potential career change so I thought I’d ask strangers on Reddit.

I currently work in construction/trades and live in a major city. Due to the high rental and mortgage prices here I live at home with family (Whereas I wish I lived alone).

Things are OK. My job pays well, my bosses are (mostly) cool. Although due to ‘reasons’ I’ll probably have to leave this company and look for another construction company in the future.

It was never my dream to end up here, and sometimes the work/lifestyle is aggravating.

I recently got the opportunity for a career change. To work for the government, and build up what has seemed like a really awesome career to me.

The thing is, it’s in the opposite end of the country and in an extreme post (4 hours drive to the nearest city) and surrounded by bears and wilderness.

Very few people there (just other government workers and their families). 

I like the outdoors, so I don’t mind too much. But it really feels like a wild decision. I’d have my own place to live, no more traffic or waking up super early, and I can apply to work at other stations across the country.

It’s just a hard choice, leaving family and friends behind and moving into the middle of nowhere. 

I’m an introvert with a lot of hobbies that take up my free time so I feel I could endure it, but my family thinks otherwise.

There’s a pay increase, but to me it’s mostly about getting out of dirty and sweaty construction attire and doing something more clean and in an office.

1cab7ej,I don't know what jobs to apply to. A gap on my resume seems to prevent me from getting any good-paying jobs.,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone could offer some career advice. My background is primarily in office management and admin work, but a gap on my resume seems to impact my ability to get hired. The gap exists as I took some time off for a few years due to some health-related issues. 

I am now at a point where I want to move out of my parent's home, but I just can't seem to find anything that pays high enough to get me there. Ideally, I would like to work in claims or admin work in a remote setting, but those types of jobs are so competitive.

That said, I just want to earn enough to move out, so any in-person jobs that pay enough I would do. I am not ruling (almost) anything out. The only thing I really wouldn't like to do is a call center job. To also add a bit more information, I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. I have been delivering food for Uber Eats in the meantime, but it just doesn't pay enough.

1caat2c,"Did I choose the right career path? did I ""sellout"" or made a safer decision? ","^(I am a 31m in IT and graduated later in my 20s due to time ""wasted"" pursuing music.  I dont really play anymore and I am happy with that. I just have different hobbies now.)

However sometimes I wonder if there was something else out there for me. 

For instance we(my fiancée and I) passed a recording studio yesterday and I mentioned that would be a fun job. I went on and on about it. How even though I no longer dream of being a professional musician, being able to help people get what is in their head onto a recording would be awesome. Then I thought about A/V tech stuff and how fun that would be. 

Then I thought about a couple other alternative careers I considered. Of course I dream of working for the local park and recreation department.  Low voltage Cable tech type stuff interest me as well. 

The truth is any career change would be a financial set back. And as much as I can fantasize about a job. the hard work to get there and the daily grind of it is the reality of it. Being a audio engineer is incredibly hard and A/V work has more irrelgular hours and often less pay then IT. 

Plus sometimes making something a career takes the fun completely out of it. For instance I like photography, but relying on it for a paycheck sounds awful. I like photographer, becuase I do what I want with it. 

So back to wondeirng if maybe I did choose the right thing for myself, or maybe I am lacking passion for my work. IT is just work.. but to change things up, like go for A/V would hurt me financially and I'd end up making less money. 

Im currently in the office 9-5 as a tier 2 IT tech with my CCNA on puase until my wedding. After that the goal was to get the CCNA and get a job in networking. 

the most realistic thing I have thought of is A/V, hands on networking, low voltage, type stuff. However an office job will pay better and I need to be saving for a home and planning to have kids in a couple years.

1caaaj9,How important are good internships?,"I know title sounds stupid, but it's a bit nuanced. I have an offer from an American and a British university, both of which are somewhat comparable in prestige (the British is more, but I think not enough to determine my choice). Due to their location they nave (almost) completely different industrial opportunities (I am foreign to both countries). However, the quality of their courses is also very different.

The British university has a very great course theory-wise, and I feel I would enjoy it more than the American curriculum (e.g. I don't have to take American constitution classes!). Nevertheless, its industrial contacts are a bit poor and not very exciting technologically speaking (think Dyson for example).

The American has a not so great curriculum (vs British), as there are way too many general education courses which British education just assumes you already know - or don't matter at all. However, its industrial contacts are amazing, specially for internships (think NVidia and Apple).

Are internships at great companies like those offered by the American university much better for my career development and etc. than those offered by the British? I don't know if, although the company name difference maybe huge, the work done is equally uninspiring. Or if it doesn't matter the company, as long as I do any internship. What are your thoughts? Keep in mind I would be an international student at both.

1caa1zg,From Idea to Startup: Unpacking the Role of an MBA in Entrepreneurship,"At the heart of the entrepreneurs' realm, there is a processive path from the seed of an idea into a solid plan and from the dream to the realization. This can be the most fascinating but also the most challenging part. An entrepreneur who wishes to be a successful competitor must not only be able to see the result but also have determination, strategic thinking, business management ability, and multiple other skills. In this field, an MBA in entrepreneurship makes a sharp difference. In this article, we will embark on the journey of someone who has an idea and wants to pursue it but needs to know exactly where to start. An Online MBA in Entrepreneurship may be just the thing they need!

**Among all stages of strategic planning, the first role was the most important.**

Each startup starts with the idea that it can change the world, with the mission to trigger a revolution, solve problems, or meet unmet needs. Notwithstanding this nice concept, converting it into a business that will not only be profitable but also popular requires people to do their homework scientifically, jump into the market properly, and carefully plan it.

**Ideation and Validation**

In the early stages of entrepreneurship, the two popular concepts of idea generation and value-adding vetting take center stage and help create a rough blueprint of the overarching business concept. The finance MBA program for prospective entrepreneurs includes the necessary resources and learnings to assess the feasibility of their ideas, perform market research, and develop the value proposition of their products and services. Among all the courses, such as Innovation Management, Design Thinking, and Market Analysis, students will get the opportunity to use them in real life to determine market opportunities, evaluate the competitive landscapes, and rework their ideas according to the feedback they get from the customers.

**Business Planning and Strategy**

When the idea is proven valid, the next step forward has to be drafting a detailed business plan and a blueprint to be followed. The MBA Entrepreneurship program opens the door for students by providing them with theoretical and practical knowledge, enabling them to create a customer base, define their business plan, and choose the direction of their company's development. The courses offered in financial management for Entrepreneurship, strategic management and making economic projections, risk assessment and developing sustainable business models to enlarge a firm's growth and profitability are tailored to equip students with such skills.

**Building the Foundation** 

Having the right blueprint is a task that aspiring business owners must take seriously to confidently chase their startup dream, from getting funds to recruiting and structuring the business. An online masters in entrepreneurship pledges students that they will inherently get all the intellectual resources, social networks, and mentorship opportunities useful in the imaginary business. Entrepreneurship incubators, pitch competitions, and networking platforms give students the chance to interact with investors, mentors, and startup enthusiasts to gain knowledge, leadership, finance, and financial aid to propel their startups.

**Execution and Growth**

As the startup goes through the startup process, an [online MBA in Entrepreneurship](https://www.mzuonline.in/mba_entrepreneurship.html) assists the founder in the migration phase, making the idea come true and developing it further. Courses in entrepreneurship management, operations, and the like teach students the appropriate management skills of resources, the building of competent organization structures, and the tools for successfully growing and scaling a venture. In addition, through faculty knowledge, industry partners' collaboration, and extra-curricular activities, students can link theory with practical business. Furthermore, they acquire the know-how of an entrepreneur.

**Conclusion** 

From idea to startup, the journey of entrepreneurship is one of creativity, resilience, and innovation. By fostering a culture of innovation, providing mentorship and support, and equipping students with the tools to navigate the problems of entrepreneurship, MBA programs play a vital role in shaping the future of entrepreneurship and driving economic growth and innovation. Whether you're a budding entrepreneur with a bold idea or an established professional looking to launch your next venture, an MBA in Entrepreneurship is your chance to live your dreams.

1ca9msq,I was FIRED by previous employer and HIRED by new employer in the same Day. I now want to rub it in. Help!,"I am 25 (F) who was working at a gym as a personal trainer. The job was originally for extra pocket change while in school for I.T. I worked there for 8 months. I had issues with a 50 year women who hated that I stood up to her. She was one of those women who was not my boss but kissed enough of the boss’s butt to have some authority. She was very unprofessional, rude, and would run back to the boss if anyone didn’t immediately listen to her. She constantly undermined her fellow employees with hopes that shed one day become manager. She is the ultimate reason I was fired. 
One day when my boss was out of the gym he had her (50 F) run the shift. We had a disagreement this day. Afterwards She told me that I could leave early because all of my tasks were done. After I left she emails my boss and tells him that I abandoned my shift. This is AFTER she gave me the direction to leave. Because of this I was fired and was emailed a termination letter. I was extremely upset bc I had been set up. The SAME day not even 8 hours later I was offered my dream I.T job that is literally double my salary with benefits and a pension so the day turned into a great one! Now i want to rub it back in the same ladies face because she plotted my downfall and failed! I wouldn’t be rude but I really want to send an email in response to the termination letter “thanking” the gym for the opportunity to have worked there and then adding something like “i was offered a great new position the same day as my termination so I gladly accept this letter of termination “ Would this harm me ? I dont think so because ive already been hired elsewhere. I never told anyone there where i was going either. I was innocently fired by a mean woman and was treated like crap at the gym. I hate that they fired me when I did nothing wrong. Should I sent a thank you and slightly bragging email as long as it’s professional? I do not want this woman to have the last laugh and get away with what she did to me. I already reached to HR and they did nothing.

1ca74zo,Thinking of switching paths. Need help,"
Hello everyone,
Hope everyone is doing great. I am currently studying Bachelors in Business administration and will probably be done by next year. The thing is that the job market is really bad where I live for this degree. A friend I know recently took a few courses on coursera on data analytics and even got a job right after he was done with the course. He advised me a while back that I do the same as this will be a good backup to my current degree. So I started my research on this field and I do find it fascinating but the problem is I don’t like maths. Many people that I came across had different opinions some say only basic maths/statistics is needed while some say maths is a must and one must be good at it to succeed in this field. This has left me a bit confused. So after a few weeks of research I found another course of digital marketing that also interested me.
The only issue is I am really confused on which one I should pursue.
Which will be best for me in terms of getting a job, pay and benefits.
I would love any advice I can get

1ca6lbc,Make sure you’re switching career fields for a valid reason.,"      I am noticing a lot of posts about people completely wanting to up and change their careers. I think that changing from one industry to another is an extremely wise move if it means that you will be changing from a low paying field with no upward mobility to a career option where you can have a higher salary and growth, but if you already have a very lucrative career path , please rethink changing industries just because “ the vibes are off “ , which is basically what I am seeing a lot of.

    Too many people in this sub are throwing years of college and work experience down the drain because of things like not getting along with co-workers, feeling bored in their positions or  “ unfulfilled “ at work, or just feeling like jumping industries would be a quick solution to making more immediately. While these are still in part valid reasons for wanting to change careers, it becomes ridiculous when you’re in a well paying career field and you want to switch to different career but still have no idea what that even is yet.


     My point is regardless of what you switch to, there is no get rich quick scheme, there is no industry where you won’t experience ( at some level ) interpersonal turmoil , or where you won’t encounter boredom or at some point feel like something is missing. Even if you do something you love. A job , just like any relationship will not make you happy 24/7, you have to do that yourself. So make sure your need to uproot the career you have, instead of working to perfect it, is not rooted in this need for a dopamine fix that we all seem to have now because of social media and comparing your lives to those of others. Because you might see the good parts of someone In a career field different from yours online but you have no idea what that person had to work through to get there.

Should I be worried? I’ve always wondered how a former employer finds out you went to a competitor. I’d hate to lose this opportunity, solely over the NC when I was small fish, I know nothing and have no malice towards them that should race any concern

The “what ifs” have dampened my excitement a bit but at the same time is it even smart to pro actively bring this to their attention when they may never find out or feel inclined to take action unless confronted with it by me?

1ca2lzb,What career path should I do?,"Pros and cons of the following careers I'm interested in?


Construction, drywall, bricklaying, foreman, house framing, heavy machinery. If I made good money, I would be content doing these things.

Law (I know pretty much nothing about this, I've just been told to be a lawyer a few times because I have solid morals and beliefs, and I'm really argumentative.)


Culinary. I've been cooking since I was a small kid and honestly I kinda like doing it too when I have freedom in what I'm cooking and how. I would hate owning a restaurant though. 


Storytelling. If I had millions of dollars I would have produced humanity altering sagas by now but sadly, I am a broke lil white boy. Maybe I'll do something with my stories when ai gets advanced enough to help me illustrate them.


Psychology. I've watched like probably 60+ hours of psychology related things on YouTube, including two full courses from a professor who also taught at Harvard. I really really enjoy learning about psychology. Without getting into details, it's to the point I took honors psychology as a senior in highschool and it was all review lol. 


Theology philosophy and religion. These are pretty much the areas I excell at the most in my opinion.

Agricultural economics  
Resource economics  
Ecology  
Soil Science  
Plant Science  
Horticulture  
Environmental Health  
Surveying (Building or Land) MRICS

  
I have BSc 2.1 in Biology from Manchester University 2019. Since then a kaleidoscope of industries including property management, fashion ecommerce entry level role, music production assistant, health-tech 3 month marketing internship (paid),

  
{For context, I went from being very repressed OCD science student to having a creative explosion during three broken bones, covid, moving cities and tumultuous mental health thanks to the aforementioned and my family. Of course I wouldn't tell this to a recruiter or employer, but just for you kind folk in case you are puzzled by my choices.}

  
What do I care about. Beauty - beautiful environment and/or having enough money to afford beautiful things and experiences. Health and fulfilment - of myself and that this is underpinning the purpose of my career (essentially that I am not harming society with my career). Working in a dynamic way - cannot be purely a desk job, must have human interaction (relationship building) to some extent and the potential for a change in environment (client premises would be good) but again, having relationships with colleagues or stakeholders would be great.

  
I am very interested in plants for their beauty and science, international trade and distribution of commodities, human nutrition, supply chain and ethics, potential to travel in my career, (I do NOT btw want to surrender myself to the sticks, I want to be able to work in a big city, ideally with some nature access, or when I'm in my 30s move to the country, but I love dancing and my friends are in London.)  
I don't want to study something purely theoretical. The degree and career must have a level of technical skill - field based analysis or GIS software or economic rigour, to give me a skill that not everyone can learn quickly.

  
I know this sounds fussy and I am not looking for the perfect role because not one thing will give me all of this at once, but some of these routes will be better than others. So if you may, esp if you have knowledge in these areas, which masters course may lead me towards a fruitful career, in the most simple sense, which may earn me the most money: (I think anything involving economics if I enter a corporate route, but I'm not convinced)

Oh and I've also considered the Navy; Environmental Health and Meteorology, but the bastards want masters degrees in these precise subjects, Biology isn't good enough for them.

  
And I am considering getting a trade, most likely carpentry. I prefer to work with my hands but maybe am too delicate to do it full time (I'm 26, female FYI).

1ca1eas,Struggling to Keep My Dream Alive: Need Advice and Encouragement (23M),"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm feeling lost and overwhelmed, and I could really use some advice and support right now.  
  
Ever since I can remember, I've had this dream of going to Japan. It's been my ultimate goal, my beacon of hope. But things haven't been going according to plan. I'm from Sri Lanka, and I enrolled in a university with the hope of getting a diploma that would pave the way for me to study in Japan. However, due to various challenges, including the pandemic and personal struggles with depression, I've faced setbacks along the way.  
  
Recently, my academic journey took an unexpected turn when the academic head advised me to change my course, citing that I wasn't cut out for the program. I took his advice, but now I feel like I've deviated from my path, and my dream of studying in Japan seems farther away than ever.  
  
To make matters worse, many of my friends and classmates have already made it to Japan, while I'm still here in Sri Lanka, watching from the sidelines. It's like they've all achieved what I've been striving for, and now I'm left feeling like I've been left behind.  
  
Currently, I'm juggling an internship, coursework, and preparations for the JLPT N3 exam, all while dealing with financial pressures and the impending departure of my girlfriend, who's also leaving for Japan soon. The recent news from my university about changes in scheduling and limited course options has only added to my stress and uncertainty.  
  
I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of emotions, and I don't know if I can keep going. But deep down, I still hold onto the hope that maybe, just maybe, there's a way for me to make my dream a reality.  
  
So, I'm reaching out to this community for advice, encouragement, or even just a listening ear. If anyone has been through similar struggles or has overcome obstacles to achieve their dreams, I would greatly appreciate any insights or words of wisdom you can offer.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I'm grateful for any support you can provide.",Valuable_Arrival_505,1,1.0,1,1713758697,2024-04-22 04:04:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ca1eas/struggling_to_keep_my_dream_alive_need_advice_and/,4,2024
1ca0wip,Having trouble deciding on the right career/college degree. Help?,"I'm currently in the latter half of my second year in middle school, and naturally, as a seventh grader, the topic of college/university/future careers has begun weaving its way into much of my academic life. As I've gone about answering questions regarding my current passions, future career goals, and the like, I've come upon some issues, and I would like some advice from those who have faced similar dilemmas. For clarity, I have organized this post into sections detailing my passions, talents/abilities, career goals, and financial aspirations. 

**PASSIONS/INTERESTS** 
I am interested in a variety of fields, which I have listed below. 
1) I'm passionate about reading/writing.
2) I love creating art. 
3) I enjoy photography and filmmaking. 
4) I'm quite interested in animation. 
5) I have a budding interest in social work and mental health. I am diagnosed with both high-functioning ASD and ADHD. Both diagnoses have resulted in relatively severe interference in my life, resulting in my being institutionalized in a partial hospitalization program for 5 months. I recently graduated from the program, and I realized I care deeply about children's mental health and social work in the process. 

**SKILLS/ABILITIES** 
I have performed excellently in school since I was very young. I have been in several Gifted and Talented programs, and am currently taking several classes alongside the 9th graders at my school. Here are some of my skills, which, ideally, a prospective career should make good use of: 
1) I perform very well when it comes to language arts. I received a perfect score of 850 on my most recent state assessment in language arts. According to said state assessment, I am at the twelfth grade level in language arts. 
2) I am a good artist. 
3) I am a good problem solver, and I can come up with creative ideas with relative ease. 
4) I'm good at math. I'm at the 10th grade level in mathematics, but I don't enjoy it too much. Math makes me nervous. 
5) I am a good leader. I'm good at planning, assigning tasks to others, and making sure the whole team is on the same page. 
6) I can code a little in C++ and JavaScript, and, additionally, I have dabbled in Scratch here and there. 
7) I'm fluent in Spanish and Italian.

**GOALS** 
1) I want to change the world in a significant way. 
2) I want to help people. 
3) I would enjoy helping/working with children and those in need. 
4) Ideally, I want to do something creative. 
5) I want to make decent money. Ideally, at least $60,000 a year? I would like the freedom to travel, have a car, and be financially stable enough to go out and do fun things. 

**WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO** 
To help narrow down prospective career choices, I have also listed some things I would not enjoy doing. 
1) I am not interested in a career related to business, sales, or marketing. 
2) I do not want to do anything that involves loud sounds or bright lights. This rules out a career in construction, specifically. 
3) I don't want to work alone. I would like to have regular social interactions with at least a small group of people. 
4) Any office jobs. 
5) Editing or proofreading somebody else's work. 

**SOME IDEAS** 
I really wanted to be a writer or journalist. I love the idea of sharing meaningful stories through current events, poetry, and creative writing. But I have heard that these fields are low-paying and often unstable, which is a shame. 

I would enjoy creating art through various means. Painting, drawing, and photography come to mind. Sadly, to my knowledge, these careers are similarly unstable and often low-paying. 

I might like animation or filmmaking, but I'm not sure these fields would provide the sense of purpose or self-expression I'm looking for. 

I would love to be a teacher, particularly for younger children, kids with special needs, and perhaps those in correctional facilities. I love the idea of helping children improve their lives and grow beyond the circumstances they were born into. But these jobs can be loud, stressful, and perhaps don't make the best use of my skills. 

Engineering is something I was looking into as well. I enjoy solving problems and creating things; additionally, there could be some use for my other skills in technical drawing/writing. I'm good at math, too, but like I've said, math makes me nervous. I'm also not sure that engineering would allow me to make a meaningful impact on people's lives.  

I was also considering becoming an art therapist or counselor, but, to put it quite bluntly, I don't want to hear about other people's problems all the time. 

I'm kind of stuck, as you can see. 

_ _ _ _

Essentially, I want to do something creative and expressive, with good pay, and plentiful opportunities to meaningfully improve life for other people. 

I hope that I have painted a clear enough picture of my skills, interests, and aspirations, in that the few people who read this post (thank you, low karma) can best advise me in potential career paths (and also, a degree I should look into). 

TL;DR. Girl in seventh grade and considering potential career paths. Skills, interests, goals, and financial aspirations in this post. Based on information provided, what would be a good college/university degree to think about? A career? Please consider leaving a helpful comment, thank you!

1ca0vro,Advice on what to do if I already have a job offer but I'm still waiting for another company to get back to me?,"TL;DR I want to ask if anyone has some insights on what I should do if I get a job offer from a big company here in SEA while I'm still waiting for the results of my interview from a bigger MNC?

I am a working student right now, independently supporting myself and graduating soon. I'm currently applying for different jobs. I don't have any problems with my current company, just trying to weigh my options on whether I would get a better deal with other companies or if I should stay.

Surprisingly and fortunately enough, I got some interviews for interesting roles at 2 MNCs -- I interviewed for 2 roles at a company popular here in SEA (Company A) and 1 role at a much bigger international company (think FAANG level, which I'll call company B). I passed almost all interviews already for both roles in Company A. I just have to get through one last interview, which they say are just for formalities. I already have my eyes set on one role in company A. I just applied to 2 roles there to have a backup.

However, my dilemma right now is that I'm still waiting for the recruiter from Company B to get back to me for my 2nd interview. He said he'll set it this week, and possibly the 3rd interview will be next week. If I got in, I'd definitely choose company B since their development track for my career would be better suited for me and honestly, their timeline aligns with my graduation date (August). For Company A, they want me to start within one month after the JO acceptance, which I guess is not a huge problem because I'll be done with my classes next month. The only issue is I'll have to move out asap to the city they are located in. If I go with Company B, I'll have ample time to prepare for moving out. I really have no specific problems with Company A itself-- I'd love to work for them, too, and I loved the tech team when I met with them. Relatively, company B is just better.

How do I handle the situation with Company A if I'm still waiting to hear back from Company B? Do I wait for Company B and risk Company A? Is it possible to ask a company to extend my deadline if they already send me a JO? Would also love some insights or tips from others who have been in similar situations!

I know it sounds kind of a trivial problem since it's quite a huge blessing for me to get any kind opportunities to begin with, especially in this job market. I am really really grateful for it. But since it'll be the stepping stone for my career as a fresh grad, I just don't want to make a mistake. Now I'm experiencing decision paralysis.

1ca0djl,Career Confusion,"Hello folks,

So to put it short. I’m in my mid-late 20’s. I spent 10* years in a service related industry, worked my ass off to learn in multiple countries and loved life. However, I obtained an injury that prevented me from doing my job ‘well’ without harming myself or other people. It’s a minimal risk but a risk I don’t want to take + the toll on my already damaged body. 

Anyways. 

I have 0 hobbies, I don’t know what interests me because the industry killed my social life. 

I LOVE my current job, it’s basically sales, business development. Helping the business grow. However, I feel I’m making nowhere near what other people make at my age. 

I’m making around 36k CAD after taxes .

I have 0 debt. 

I’m very good at saving/investing/budgeting.

I’ve found in my area it was VERY hard for me to find a job because I’m not in the manual trades. I don’t have plans to go back to school mostly due to already doing a degree for business management alongside college also. 

Any clues on how I can improve my yearly wage?

1ca08w4,Returning to the workforce after unemployment,"Recently, I applied for a role with a decently sized global studio founded in China with offices across Asia and the US. I have worked previously as a writer in various capacities, from marketing copy, technical direction, and I've helped edit books for publication.. also worked as a freelance journalist for a few years.

The closest experience I have to traditional screenwriting would probably be writing for several major online influencers (think Youtubers who write scripted news content, and shortform scripts w/ editing notes for visual editors), and my journalism background in which I researched a lot about cultural issues and was on Weibo constantly.  

I know that I am capable of writing screenplays, and have experience writing to the specifics of a brand, but I am unsure of how a hiring manager might see my less than typical path.

Interviewed this Wednesday for a job and got an offer the next day on Thursday. While on the phone with the HR recruiter, she asked me when I could start and I made the mistake of saying this upcoming Monday (April 29th).

1c9zcox,Advice needed: Want to quit my job after unrelated burnout from life?,"Been thinking about quitting my job for a while now due to burnout from life(?) and could use some advice.  
I lost my parents in high school and life felt like struggles after struggles ever since. All I had in mind was to work hard & be stronger to not feel scared. Was in a mental survival mode for a very long time: despite dealing with legal matters after my parents passed, I pushed and pushed myself to graduate from a top university, finish my masters and got an amazing job now.  
Been working at my current job for a while, and its the first time that things have calmed down in my life. I guess it's when I gradually moved away from the survival mode that I realized how unbearably exhausting the grind was. I started to feel all the extreme burnout and exhaustion from being on high alert all these years and it's starting to take a toll on me.  
I started to have all the symptoms of extreme burnout: I sit at work all day but get less work done than I used to in one hour. I work nights to try to catch up but that just made it worse. I just simply cannot focus or concentrate no matter how hard I try - it's like my brain just can't function and be sharp at the moment now. I feel completely wiped out and everyday I think about quitting and taking a break. I can afford a break financially speaking. But I'm so scared to quit, after working so hard to get to where I am and only being at the job for a couple months. I feel so much pain and stress everyday going to work. I did everything I could to make the burnout better but at this point I think nothing will help me except a long break of healing myself. What should I do?

1c9y5fe,Seeking Advice: Feeling Lost and Unsure About Future Education and Career Path," 

Hey everyone,

I'm a 20-year-old female from India, and I've been feeling stuck in a rut for the past 4-5 years. During this time, I've been battling against my sexual assault offender, and unfortunately, I didn't succeed. This situation consumed me to the point where I couldn't think about my future. But now, I want to change that. I want to start college or pursue higher education studies.

The problem is, I'm not sure which path to take or which degree to pursue. What's more, I was so caught up in this battle that I feel like I have no strengths, weaknesses, likings, or dislikings. I want a career that offers job security, a good education, and respect. I'm willing to put in the hard work, but I'm terrified of starting college. All my cousins and friends are either doctors or engineers, and I feel like I'm lagging behind. To make matters worse, I don't have any parental support.

I feel lost and overwhelmed, and I could really use some advice and guidance. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

1c9xusy,Not sure what to do for career change (tech),"Tldr: no experienced, scared to fail girlie looking to know how to be sure if she should go into software development or I.t.

I (25f) hate my job, I'm ready for a change and for that I mean go back to school. I'm looking to go for either I.t. or software developing. While I would say I'm pretty tech savvy for the avg user I have no experience. A small part of my current job I basically make rules in a program to make sure the right thing does or doesn't print when customizations are selected, and I'm pretty damn good at it too. I do enjoy that part, the company, pay, work environment and recent changes in duties not so much. So doing well and enjoying it I figured why not a career in tech. 

But I didn't end up working in the field I originally went to school for and I don't want a repeat. And since I've never been one to know what they wanted to be. I don't wanna rush into going back to school in something I know nothing about and be stuck doing another dead end job. So how do you know if you are right for a job in i.t. or software developing or just tech in general?

Software developing seems more fun but the more I look into it it seems like a very hard job especially seeing people saying they studied questions for interviews. Im not great at normal interviews (granted it's been 5 years and I've matured since).  I.t. Isn't as appealing but I think I'm more confident that I'd do better in it.

1c9xaia,Help! I’m 21 and don’t know what to do with my life/career.,"Ok so this might be long and loaded but I need advice, help, guidance, words of wisdom, options, someone who relates, anything. Even just a comment telling me you feel the same way would help. I’m a 21 year old girl in the US. I just turned 21 about a month ago, I have a lovely boyfriend but we are both kinda in the same boat. We both work full time jobs right now that we tolerate for an income. We live at home with our parents still to save money. I graduated high school in 2021 and did community college for a bit for aviation I wanted to be a pilot-but ultimately decided I couldn’t focus on school, didn’t wanna stop smoking weed, and really just didn’t want to live my life in the air when I want to have a family someday. I don’t want to work a 9-5. The problem is everyone around me says “welcome to the real world of an adult” or some cliche bullshit. I got into real estate but it’s pretty slow for me and again, I can’t find myself committing to the work or focusing for long enough to actually put in the work. Everything feels like a chore to me. I’m trying to find what I truly love but I don’t even have many hobbies really. I want to do something that doesn’t feel like work, but I feel like I’m meant for something special. Not to sound selfish or cocky, personally I just feel like I’m made for something MORE than just work, especially a 9-5 or just some average job or a big job like a doctor or dentist. The biggest thing I worry about is feeling free- real estate is great for that but again so slow for me and I’m not good at self discipline. I want to be my own boss, so I’d love to be an entrepreneur, but I don’t know what business of mine I would want to start or where to even begin. I just don’t believe my life is meant to be centered around work and I’m so hard headed that I won’t accept anything else as an answer. Not a “that’s what adults do” or “that’s what life is” because I don’t believe my life should have to be that way. Now I know the comments will be “well do you want food on your table and a roof over your head?” Obviously I do. That’s not what I’m looking for. I’m not lazy or unmotivated, I am actually the opposite and I’m so frustrated and fed up that I haven’t found that’s meant for me yet. I spent awhile doing a customer service retail job which was horrible. I just can’t work under corporate America and I refuse to accept my life as that at 21. I need to figure out a way to soul search and find what I like and enjoy to do; but I don’t even know how to do that much because I’m so exhausted from overthinking this for years. Any advice or others who can relate?

1c9uj54,How can I transition from b2b fintech marketing to a more fulfilling career?,"Hey everyone,

I’m \[32M\] feeling a bit stuck in my current role and seeking some guidance on potential career transitions. My background includes sales, advertising, and marketing, with a current focus on content marketing within the B2B fintech space. However, I've come to realize that certain aspects of my current role don't quite align with my passions and strengths.

Here's a breakdown of what I've observed:

**Dislikes:**

* **B2B Marketing**: While I've gained valuable experience, the B2B landscape doesn't quite spark my interest like B2C does. I thrive on understanding consumer behavior, drawing from my background in sociology.
* **Desk-bound Work**: Spending all day in front of a computer has become draining. I'm seeking opportunities that allow for more dynamic interaction and engagement.
* **Hands-on Execution**: I'm a visionary at heart, preferring to focus on strategic planning rather than the nitty-gritty of project management and tactical execution.
* **Finance Focus**: My interest in finance-related roles has decreased over time.

**Likes**:

* **People**: Social interaction energizes me. Whether it's networking, selling, or collaborating with others, I thrive in environments that lead to interpersonal connections and enable me to meet new people.
* **Exciting Projects**: I'm drawn to projects that involve high-profile figures like celebrities, influencers, and athletes. The glamour and excitement fuel my passion.
* **Passions Outside Work**: I have a strong interest in exotic/classic cars, golf, and basketball, which could potentially tie into future career endeavors.

I'm reaching out to the Reddit community for fresh perspectives and career suggestions. While I would prefer not to take a pay cut (I currently make $130k), I'd be willing to do so if it meant finding a fulfilling profession with ample opportunities for growth and advancement.

In summary, I'm seeking a career change that aligns with my strengths, interests, and values. Any insights or nuanced ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your input!

1c9pmxy,What's a sustainable life for an autistic guy who feels like he can't handle adult life?,"I've posted a version of this on r/findapath but after discovering this sub I wanted to post here as well

I'm 29 (M) and still live at my mom's house. I was diagnosed with ASD my senior year of high school (this was in 2012 so ""Aspergers"" was still the term used casually for how I am), though I always struggled socially before then. I probably have ADHD or something similar as well but that isn't diagnosed. I currently make less than $20K a year substitute teaching and coaching track, so I can't afford to move out or really progress my life in any meaningful way in my current situation

In college I ended up majoring in accounting and finance because I always did well in math classes growing up. I did well in those classes so I just kept taking them and next thing I knew I was majoring in it, but I had no passion for that career path and the jobs my professors described in class all sounded so overwhelming. I only know how to be a student and could never make that step into becoming a worker. I ended up graduating with no network, no job shadowing, no internships, and no direction with what to do next.

My job experience is pretty minimal. I never had a job in high school. I was very anxious about working in general and didn't apply to many places, and the places I did all wouldn't take me, not even McDonald's. I've never gotten a job I had to interview for. My first job was the summer after graduating high school working at a warehouse (or assembly line? idk but I had to unbox books and put them in totes at one station and sort them at the other) that my then-stepdad worked at. I hated it. The days were long (7:15-3:45 M-F with my only breaks being a half-hour lunch and two 10-minute breaks) and overwhelming and I couldn't handle being so physically and mentally exhausted each day. I was still running cross country and track in college, but my running ability tanked when I got to college because working all summer each year made me never want to go run because of how tired I was all the time. In college I had an on-campus job working in the dining services. The shifts were all 2-4 hours with no breaks, and I had to personally limit myself to only about 6 hours a week because having any less free time was too hard to handle and my mental health in college was especially bad

I feel like I can't handle living outside of a school setting. After graduating college I became a substitute teacher in my home town because it didn't matter what my bachelor's degree was in, and I've held on to that one job for 6.5 years. I also coach high school track, but I'm only an assistant because I can't handle the responsibilities of a head coach. I keep saying that I'm saving up to eventually go back to school to become a full-time teacher, but I don't even know if I can handle that. I took a long-term sub job last year teaching math, and while I felt fine actually teaching the material I found everything else about the job (meetings, conferences, discipline, etc.) to be overwhelming and now I'm scared I'm going to flame out quickly if I become a full-time teacher. It also really burned me out where I could have long-term subbed for the entire school year but I had to ask if I could go back to regular subbing at the end of the first semester because by that point I was desperate for more days off

I've never had a true dream job or career I really want. I really enjoy coaching, and that's pretty much the reason I chose to also work at a school so that the working hours would align. But that's just a stipend and I can't make a career out of it. I don't have to be a teacher to coach at a school. but basically anything requiring me to work later than 3pm would force me to quit coaching

I'm not really super passionate about many things anymore. I'm chronically online when I'm home just browsing YouTube and Reddit and researching my special interests without feeling like I can make an income out of anything I'm interested in. I feel like all I'm good at is learning about how good other people are at doing things

I know I need to make more money, but I feel incapable of being a productive enough member of society to ever earn a living wage. Work is so overwhelming for me to where my mental health suffers because of how easily over-stressed I get, but I'm also not creative enough for a creative job. The only job I truly love is my coaching job because it's an application of numbers and stats that I'm actually comfortable doing. At the same time I'm considered ""normal enough"" to where I'm always going to be expected to just figure all this out on my own without any direct assistance even though I badly need it to get off the ground. I feel like a failure in life and really lost, and that I'm already at the peak of what I can handle, and I don't know how I can realistically change that without collapsing under the stress

1c9mh7w,Offered a Dream Job at an NYC Think Tank: Should I Negotiate Salary?,"Hello r/careerguidance,

I’ve recently received an offer from a New York City-based think tank, a place I’ve applied to and admired for the past two years. I even spoke to their president in a final interview because I believe they were impressed by my tenacity/connections through a college professor.

They’ve offered me $80,000 (the salary range was $75,000 to $90,000) to start. The role requires relocating closer to Manhattan and commuting by train three times a week. Given these additional costs, I’m contemplating asking for $85,000—a 6.25% increase—when I respond to their offer. The benefits package is comprehensive and exactly what I need, so I’m only looking to negotiate the salary.

A bit about me: I’m 26 and this would be the highest salary I’ve ever had. I don’t have a master’s degree but bring substantial government experience to the table, which is relevant for this role.

I’m unsure about the best way to approach this negotiation. Should I even attempt it? If so, how should I phrase my request to maximize my chances without coming off as demanding? I plan to back off and take the first offer if they don’t seem open to it

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be greatly appreciated!

1c9ldfr,Am I making the right decision taking this job?,"Am I taking the right step in taking this job offer?

I just received a job offer. I ticked every line in the job posting for the job, and I would be responsible for building the team and being the expert in the area. However I am worried about the increased stress and workload involved. My goal was to try to coast as much as possible now but taking on this new job would mean more responsibilities. 

Current job: $116K but could be $120Kish with increase, fully remote

New job: $127K, fully remote

My priorities (not in any order):

1. Good WLB. Put in 35-40 hours and call it done every week. Maybe the current job would be a bit better but unsure. Current job stresses me out but who knows about my new job

2. Not feel useless, work on interesting things. New job is what I wanted to do.

3. Flexible work schedules. Both are tied.



*My current job Pros*

-Good, supportive coworkers, get along with most of them. 

-Good manager who is supportive and wants to help me manage my heavy workload so I am spending less hours

-Good flexibility, no micro-managing

*My current job Cons*

-Company did layoffs recently, letting go of staff I worked with. My project areas were all impacted. My direct report was cut.

-VP of my portfolio area and her right hand Operations Director give me a lot of stress. I do not like working with them. VP does not really acknowledge me in anyway and has told my boss I need to work on building her trust. Because of the Operation director, the culture is frustrating to deal with.

-I am in finance and our processes has been changed every year because there have always been issues. Our systems are terrible. Our software is terrible, ineffective, and inefficient 

-Leadership management has been awful especially during the whole layoff process. There is no communication at all. There are always issues. They got us in the layoff nightmare.

-Staff are starting to leave, triggered by layoff announcements, projects are winding down, morale is really down.

1c9ktac,"Wanting to advance in my 'dream' field, but struggling to land the next opportunity.","For the past four, going on five, years I've been a freelance content writer outside of my day job. I've mainly been producing content within the esports space, but have worked closely with a known org within that space the entire time. I've produced content ranging from regular staff interviews (roster changes, coaching moves, things of that nature), to 'educational' piece concerning their focus titles (guides, how-tos, tips & tricks), to even collaborative projects with larger reaching orgs that don't concern esports and have more promotional or community/equality focused spins on them. My pieces for them are featured not only on their primary site, but also spread through various other outlets as a part of their content plans. 

The next step up, I always assumed, was an editor role. Which, I've inquired about, and was told that I'm the next man up in that spot. But, the two ahead of me have had the position on lock for some time. It doesn't seem like they'll be moving on any time soon, so I've been on an off-on again searching for opportunities since.

Beyond my above experience and portfolio, I've got a BA in English, have what would be considered a stable work history in both team & supervisory roles, and I'm willing to relocate/travel if necessary.

1c9jotp,Should I back off and doing something wrong ,"
Are we able to be friends or should I back off?

One of the managers at my job I think has a crush and is attracted to me so he keeps me at arms length so to speak. He is not my boss or in the same department as me but sometimes we do work together and since we’re in the same building we see each other several times a day 

We used to text daily and talked about hanging out but I always talked about being friends. Then sometimes I would talk about hanging out with other guys. He would say things about keeping personal and private life separate-but I know of other coworkers that he is close to and friends with so the difference is with me. He once told me in a conversation about things I was awesome and kind individual and absolutely beautiful inside and out. 

Every once in awhile I feel him maybe look at me from a distance, and a few times like he was checking me out but maybe it was just me misreading. Sometimes I reach out to him and talk about how much I enjoy his company and like and respect him but he doesn’t say anything in response or his feelings back. He always tries to keep things mostly work and professional now. I just enjoy talking to him and would be his friend but it often feel like he has boundaries/keeps me at a distance so I don’t see how it would work ",Appropriate_Help_217,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1713710946,2024-04-21 14:49:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c9jotp/should_i_back_off_and_doing_something_wrong/,4,2024
1c9jamu,Job Recommendations and Options,"Hi everyone. Recently finished my Masters in physics at Cambridge, deciding not to pursue a PhD as originally planned (became disillusioned about academia). As a result, I feel miles behind my friends in the job market. I am constantly baffled when I hear about salaries and expectations and have no idea what to apply for as a result. 

I know that fields like IB and consulting are pretty standard for aspiring high earners out of my degree. But every consulting salary I see advertised is \~£30k, while I have friends working ""low paying fields"" like school teachers on £50k because they apply for the right academy at the right time. More importantly though, because I came to this decision late I only have internships in data analysis which is a mess of a market for grads atm.

My parents are intent on not ""influencing my decision"" so won't give me any concrete guidance, and my Dad is out of touch from working in start-ups and thinks every job offer I bring up is underpaid, killing my motivation/confidence. As a result, I'm struggling to understand what is out there of how to find things.

Important to add it's not all doom and gloom. I have a strong 1st in a respected degree and have been told I am smart, social, and competent. I just lack direction and options so any/all help is appreciated. I am currently focused on data analysis gigs and some consulting roles, but only because this feels like all I can get with my background.

1c9j3n6,Applying for Internal Position at 11 Weeks Pregnant,"I applied for an internal position within my company because it’s way closer to home and a better schedule (currently I work every other weekend and drive 40 minutes each way, and this new position would mean a 2 minute drive and no weekends plus being off an hour earlier every day) the new position also has a lot more room for growth as it’s with a different division of the company.

I interviewed last week and it went really well and I think I’ll get it, but I did not mention that I’m 11 weeks pregnant. My current manager is aware and my coworkers know, we’ve already shared on social media, etc. But I didn’t point blank disclose it in the interview process. I’m now second guessing if I should have told them?

My companies policy is that you have to work for 7 consecutive months to qualify for mat leave with them. I’m in Manitoba, Canada so it’s not that they can really tell me I can’t take a leave anyways but that’s the policy in the handbook. I need to confirm that the transfer would mean the last year and a bit would still be considered consecutive once I switch positions so that I would still qualify. Is it okay to ask HR this once they give me the written offer? Like they can’t retract the offer if I do ask and confirm this information? 

I feel guilty and don’t want to start off on the wrong foot. I’m from a small community and everyone knows everyone so I just don’t want it to seem like I was lying or keeping a secret from them until it was beneficial to me. I understand from a hiring point of view how it could be a pain in the butt to take someone on and then have to rehire for mat leave 6 months later.

1c9g1tl,How do I consider another job while already accepting an offer? New-grad,"Hi everyone! I finished my undergrad degree today (feels crazy saying that) and I’ve found myself in a bit of a job dilemma. I was in a co-op program and so I did multiple internships during my degree. I had really enjoyed my last placement (Company A) and was very close with my team so I knew that I wanted to work there post-grad if possible. I reached out to Company A earlier this year and they didn’t have anything permanent available at the moment but of course promised to let me know if something changed. And so I continued my job search but had no luck. Eventually, Company A reached out and offered me an 8 month contract position (no benefits) where they would essentially hire me instead of an intern this year and would like to keep me permanently afterwords if something changes (ie. someone else quits) but no promises of course. I accepted the offer because I figured it would give me the opportunity to make some money at a job i know i like while still looking and applying to permanent jobs. However, this past week Company B, a company I had interviewed with during my job search, prior to receiving the offer from Company A, reached out to me and let me know that they had another position available that they think would be a good fit for me and would like to interview me. I have accepted the interview for many reasons: I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity, it’s a permanent position, the pay is better, and there are great benefits.

Here is my dilemma:
1. If I were to receive the offer from Company B after my interview there is a pretty good chance I will want to accept it because of the stability it offers me. How do I tell company A? I should also mention that my position at company A starts 2 weeks from now and I guess I just feel bad to disappoint them so close to the start date. I’m also worried that the interview process may be lengthy at Company B and that I won’t know if I’ve been offered the position until right before my start with Company A. Company A & B are also major competitors. 
2. Do I tell Company B about the other offer at all during the interview ? That I’ve received one or accepted it? How do I go about that if so? I don’t want it to come off the wrong way as I am very interested in this job. 

I know that this is a good position to be in but the thought of this all happening so close to the start date of the job I already accepted and potentially burning my bridges at Company A gives me anxiety. I am also an extreme people pleaser and sometimes find it hard to make the best decision for myself because of how it affects others. Also was it wrong of me to accept the interview after already accepting an offer?

1c9g1ds,My boss is confusing ,"I am a developer at avery small company. I start a new programming project like every weekend, but most of them never see the day of light. A few of them get done and go into my portfolio. A few months back, everyone at my company got an email titled ""reg: Freelancing while working full-time"". Basically, they didn't want the full-time employees to freelance even outside of company hours because it's ""unfair to the company"". But I didn't care because I didn't have any plans to freelance. I was making plenty for the amount of work I did anyways.

A few weeks later, some of my coworkers got caught for doing some outside work and it triggered an investigation into all the employees. They found some projects I've made (always has been public). The CEO sent me an email saying how I had betrayed the company. I tried telling him it's nothing. But he wouldn't listen. Only then I noticed the previously mentioned email had a line stating ""All hobby projects must be disclosed to the management"". 

They postponed my performance review by 6 months as a punishment. (I had done a lot of work in the last year and was confident I will get a raise). After these things happened, the CEO, started a new company and made someone else the CEO here. Well, technically, he's not the CEO, but he had all the power.

A few more weeks later, I was called to work for the new company for just one week because their development flow was stalled. They didn't have proper systems in place. I made a few fixes to the system including giving the devs proper tasks instead of just the product requirements. Then everything started moving smoothly. 

The same week, I get an email saying he is impressed with my ability to get the work moving and if I will be open to joining the new company full time. I thought, I'm not getting a raise here anyone soon. And if I'm going to the new company, I'll probably be going as the lead dev. So I can ask for a raise. Besides the new product did sound interesting, and I get to work on it from scratch. No more tinkering old codebases. So I said yes. 

Now things start getting interesting. My current manager is a weird personality. He has been with almost all the important people in the company. And no devs like him. We used to be friends so I'm a little biased. I'm like the only person who is able to put up with his shit. He doesn't even know development. He asks me before merging PRs, making tech decisions etc. And he hates everyone else and has an ego so he won't ask for help from anyone else. Honestly, I liked the influence I had over decisions, so I kept helping him.

Now, I want to go to the new company. But this manager is trying to convince both CEOs that my current company would practically fall apart if I leave. Which is definitely not true. I have a meeting tomorrow with the new CEO about my transition. He wants me to provide proper replacements for all the work I do here before he can let me go. 

I'm very confused about this constant love-hate thing they do at my company. One day, I've betrayed everyone and I'm a very bad person. Another day, I'm the literal cornerstone of the entire company. I know it's toxic and I should probably just leave both companies. But they pay me atleast 30% over market rate. I've tried, but I can't find another company that would pay me this much. Most companies say they like my skills and then never call back after they hear my current salary.

1c9fioy,Best degree for me in sr leadership,"I am currently 40 and a c-suite exec at a fortune 500 in charge of corporate strategy and innovation.

Almost my entire career has been in corporate innovation, and I'd like it to stay that way.

I have an MS in Business Management (not an MBA), and a BS is engineering.

I would like to stay in roles like the one I have for the rest of my career. Honestly, I have no further ambition except to make myself further solidified in what I do, and to be highly marketable for this role at other companies if I need to pursue other options.

To preface, education is not my only lever to increase my knowledge, credibility and security in my field (I have those plans in motion), but this is what I need some advice on.

Two options:

1) Masters in Innovation from a Tier 1 business school.

2) MBA from a well ranked state flagship university.


My initial assessment.

Re: #1:

Good: Potentially solidifies me as an expert in my field, I would enjoy the study area more. And, I'd have a tier 1 university on my resume. Today, my best academic institution is a well ranked state flagship.

Bad: I already have an MS, so this wouldn't be up-credentialing, if you will. Meanwhile, I still wouldn't have an MBA -- could this be detrimental when looking to maintain my spot in the c-suite over the next 20 years of my career?

Re: #2:

Good: Same amount of time/work as #1, as I'm able to leverage my current masters towards the MBA. You could argue I'm elevating my credentials more due to the credit hours typically attributed to an MBA vs an MS. Also, I'm getting on equal terms with an MBA to my peers -- all of whom have MBAs.

Bad: An MBA is a general business degree and that will generally help, but it doesn't specifically build my credibility in my field of expertise vs another MBA guy of which there are many -- I'll continue to rely upon my other qualifications to set me apart.


Side note: I really do feel I must choose. I'd like to do both in an ideal world, but I just can't justify the time/energy in doing both at my age and career status.",East-Atmosphere9112,0,0.5,7,1713698549,2024-04-21 11:22:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c9fioy/best_degree_for_me_in_sr_leadership/,4,2024
1c9evqm,Unreasonable to want to be kept in the loop? ,"Hi all,
Just need some advice. My team is relatively young - manager is mid thirties, and there are two ‘senior’ team members who have one year more engineering experience than me. I’m also about to move into a senior position - it will make three of us. 
However, last week my manager brought the two seniors into a meeting to have a confidential discussion with them (I have no idea what it was about). There have been a few occasions of late where I’ve felt like I was last to know (or finding out things at the same time as the rest of the more junior members of the team) and it’s made me feel really awful as I feel I contribute almost an equal amount to the team and out of everyone I’m one of the most committed. 

Being that these two colleagues are one year in front of me, and hence ‘seniors’ in title, they have kind of assumed the positions of ‘second in charge’ leaders of the team. As a result, I feel like I’m then lumped with the rest of the team who are younger, less invested and play less of a pivotal role in the team. I also feel like my manager plays favourites, and I’m not always (or often) the favourite. I think my ambition has always rubbed my manager the wrong way, and I think I can unintentionally make him feel stupid at times. 

I was thinking about bringing up to my manager that I feel really out of the loop - because to be honest it’s kind of insulting that I’m lumped in with the junior staff considering I’m about to move into a senior position and I play a pivotal part in the success of the team. 
But is this just a privileged way of thinking? Do I just suck it up because I don’t happen to have the year’s more experience? Do I have the right to be upset? Or is it worth raising?

1c9ebw9,Doubled Workload for No Reward,"Hello,

I'm in need of some advice on how to navigate a tricky situation at work. I've been working as an assistant quantity surveyor on a mid-sized construction project valued at around £10 million. Unfortunately, last week, the senior quantity surveyor I've been working alongside was let go due to not fulfilling his duties and absenteeism.

Now, the management has informed me that they won't be hiring a replacement for him and that I'm expected to pick up all of his workload. I've expressed my concerns about this, as it essentially means I'll be doing the work of two people without any additional recognition or promotion.

What's more frustrating is that I've been told I can't be promoted because it would set a precedent for the other assistants. This leaves me feeling undervalued, especially considering I have more responsibilities than almost all the other quantity surveyors, including senior staff in my division.

I have a one-on-one meeting with my manager tomorrow, and I'm contemplating giving him an ultimatum: either promote me or risk losing me, as my workload has significantly increased without any rewards or acknowledgment.

However, despite this issue, I genuinely enjoy working where I am, and I believe this project could greatly benefit my career trajectory. I'm torn about how to proceed and would appreciate any advice or insights on how to handle this situation effectively.

I choose this career because i have a particular passion for biomaterials, and between medicine and engineering, due to my lack of inclination towards memorization, I chose the latter.  
Also i loved the flexibility of changing sectors (for instance, my secod favourite one is the space sector).

However, currently, I'm becoming ""terrified"" by the idea of going through all this just to do a completely unrelated jobs...  
expecially in italy is full of horror stories of engeneers making minimum wage as ""basic employees"" in just tangentially related topics  
 I'm even considering switching to the former (medicine).

1c9cq30,Urgent advice needed - much appreciated,"So Im in the UK and I need to make a final decision on what career path I am going to go on very soon, I really need some advice.

Here are my options for the industries:

- Law (probably become Lawyer or Solicitor)
- Medicine (probably become a GP or Dentist/Orthodontist)
- Computer Science (probably become a software engineer)
- Aerospace Engineering (this is one of the options, because I love aviation and it was the best option for me in the aviation industry)


So here are my requirements for my career:
- Doesn't make me travel without my family

- Starting salary should be minimum around £25K - £30K, around 5 years into my career my salary should be around £50-£70K and a salary over £100K when I am nearing 10 years into my career

- Not sitting down too much idle in front of a computer

- Gives me many days off of work in a year for me to go on holidays (minimum 28 days a year and 2-4 abroad holidays a year, maybe even more holidays later on because I want to travel the world)

- Allows me to spend time with my family a lot

- Not too expensive to get the whole training process done

- Preferably allows me to start my own business in this career (at a cheap price potentially)

- Nothing to do with finance




Now here are some of the cons of my options that may go against my requirements:

- For Law it was actually something I didn't mention but I'm not really that interested in Law, it seems kinda boring but hey you never know what could happen I may come to like it

- For Medicine I'm just afraid the process will be too long as I'll finish become a full fledged GP or Dentis/Orthodontist by the time I am age 27-29, but at least I'll be getting payed quite a bit while im training

- For CS, there's the sitting down all day on a computer idle which I don't really like..I may come around to it but probably not.

- Finally for Aerospace Engineering, I love aviation and creating things. Only thing is job opportunities are not that wide in engineering in general in the UK. Plus salaries are not as good in the UK compared to the other careers I mentioned.. like in the US the salaries for Aerospace Engineers is crazy high. unless I do a startup after getting some years of experience..idk.",arm_313_,0,0.5,1,1713687242,2024-04-21 08:14:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c9cq30/urgent_advice_needed_much_appreciated/,4,2024

1c9btxq,Resigning from toxic workplace early in my career,"For context, I (22F) graduated with honors in December. I had been working for my company for around a year as a part-time employee, remotely working. I was offered a full-time position after graduation, but I was already working and doing full-time duties without full-time benefits (still hourly). During this period, my ability to work remote was taken away, which was okay in the beginning but hard as it made my day-to-day far more manageable. Signing my full-time offer wad more of a formality than anything. They immediately start laying on various departments as it's a rather small company, and everyone wears various hats. I took up the SEO campaign, social media advertising, they attempted to put me in B2B marketing (stopped that with a hard no), billing, audit related activities, technical writing/policy writing, and other various odd jobs that came up. (This has all gone down within the last 4 months) I saw several red flags and shady practices prior to this, but I was always told and convinced myself ""it's just business"" (shady practices as editing documents on dates, no real HR, abrasive boss, etc).

Fast forward to now, the last months has really gotten bad. My abrasive boss is like no other I've met, constantly demanding and demeaning. He says things he KNOWS wouldn't fly in a typical office, but it's okay since everyone at my company is related or family friends. He's one of the executives, before I was able to fly more under the radar, but I saw how he was towards my supervisor and was alarmed by his behavior. 

Over the last month, the boss has expanded our business (we barley have the manpower to do what we're doing now) to a passion project of his, but we are also drowning because WE LOST OUR HEALTH INSURANCE due to a conflict with our admin/payroll company. They've had issues since we signed with them, but the health insurance was my last straw. Over the last two weeks, my boss has ridden my ass daily, barking orders, complaining about others in the office, blaming his incompetence on me (telling me he wasn't prepared while holding the packet I made, but didn't hear me the three times I said use the paperclipped copies, etc), and blowing up my phone after hours. Additionally, I've been put in situations without training or certification (we work in healthcare) and didn't respond for 20 when someone mentioned they were feeling like harming themselves

I have more examples of this behavior if anyone needs clarification, but TLDR I'm done. I can't do it after being berated over something that has documented proof of it not being my fault (a name was wrong in a system, but the person signed their name the way I had it several times) 

I've started to put out my resume as much as I can this week, but I've come to realize I can't do this much longer, especially without health insurance. He's demanded extra of my time, piled on responsibilities, dismissed any of my concerns and without any additional compensation. My plan is to submit a resignation letter this week, give them two weeks, and grind the job hunt as best as I can. I simply don't think I could keep working while looking and waiting until I have another position lined up, my mental stability and happiness just won't hold out. I've called family and friends this week in tears and basically yelling (which was alarming for them as I typically never let work get to me) and honestly am surprised I didn't quit on the spot at some point this week. 

I need advice? Or validation? Or anything really as this is my first ""adult"" job that's gone down in flames quickly due to systematic dysfunction. My contract says they require a months notice of leave (I live in TX, no real consequences except references, which I won't be getting either way), but I am just lost and scared.

1c97wos,Should I make the switch from full-time employment to W2 contractor?!,"Hi everyone! First time posting here and apologies for the long post, but I am seeking some advice regarding an offer that has come my way. I have been working full-time for a company (call it “Company A”) for over 8 years, and within the last year I have felt like my growth and learning within my role has been pretty stagnant. I am also not 100% confident in the direction the company is heading. Because of this, a few months ago, I started putting my resume out there and I received a very interesting offer.

The position I have been offered is a 9 month contract with a Fortune 100 company (call it “Company B”). I would be classified as a W2 employee since it’s through a large staffing agency, and I am told there is great potential for either a contract extension or full-time (but not guaranteed). The role seems challenging but interesting, and I believe it could be a great learning experience within my field (data analysis). The hiring manager and I also had some fantastic discussions during the interview process, and he hand selected me for the role. On top of this, the role is a 40% increase in base pay, and DOES offer some benefits and PTO (albeit limited). I am in my early 30s, single, with no kids, so I am thinking now could be a good time to take a risk.

Based on all of my research, here is how I am currently weighing the pros and cons of potentially switching from full-time to the contractor role:

Potential pros of switching from full-time to contractor position:

- +40% base pay increase
- Great potential to network and learn new skills at a large organization (should look good on resume too)
- Seems like a great manager who said he values work/life balance
- Seems like good potential for full-time given everything I have heard (I tread carefully here knowing the various sales tactics of staffing agency)
- Benefits (medical, vision, and dental) and PTO/sick (albeit limited), which seems rare in most contractor positions
- Will not be taxed as self-employed
- 401k contribution after a certain time period but no match
- Honestly some of the best, most transparent recruiters I’ve worked with who said they would help place me again if something doesn’t work out with this role

Cons of switching from full-time role to contractor:
- Less stability and no guarantee for contract extension or full-time
- Current job is not really too challenging and I have an amazing work/life balance
- Expensive benefits that are slightly limited
- Less PTO/sick days
- No 401k match

All in all, this seems like a good deal and could be worth the risk given where I am at in my career and personal life. However, I am wondering if anyone has any experience with W2 contractor positions? Or has anyone ever switched from full-time to contractor? This was never something I considered before this offer came along, so any insights or perspectives are welcome! Thanks!

1c965nk,Former Boss Is Falsely Telling People I Was Fired,"A few months ago, I resigned from a very toxic job that I had only been at for 8 months. For context, I resigned of my own volition and was never confronted or reprimanded for any performance related issues during my employment. At the time of my resignation, in spite of the toxic environment, everyone appeared to part ways on good terms, and my boss even offered to write me a future reference.

Flash forward two months and I’m happily employed at a new job. However, I recently heard from two old coworkers (one who just this week was abruptly fired without notice) that my former boss has been falsely telling people that I was terminated for “performance issues”. This came as a huge surprise given the fact that I never was given any negative feedback about my performance during my time there, nor was I fired. 

Im in a tight knit industry in a relatively small city. Is this something I should worry about? Is there anything I can do to protect my reputation?

1c94oy9,How to re-enter the workforce?,"I need advice on re-entering the workforce. I had a temp job and then a full time job at the same company, different departments last year, altogether I was there for like 4 months (2 months temp, 2 months full time). I left the full time job as it was not a good fit at all. Looking back I know it was not a wise decision to leave. Before that, I did student teaching and got my Bachelor’s degree nearly 1 year and 1/2 ago.

I have been looking into getting back into the workforce ever since but i’m afraid I might have effectively put a stain on myself by not sticking it out in my last position. I have put my positions on my resume and LinkedIn. It may have also not been a good decision to post them but I wanted to be honest since I know background checks may be able to dig out my work history anyway. (I could be mistaken but those were my thoughts at the time)

1c91e2r,CS to medicine,"Hi everyone,  
I'm a senior in university with a computer science major, but instead of pursuing SWE, I want to move towards medicine and pursue medicine. The main reason I want to do this is because I want to directly contribute and help my community. I want to be able to go home after a day of work and know that I was able to help someone and make a difference in their lives. The reason I say this is because of my experience from my past internships. The companies I worked at were driven by profit (I am aware that this can't be escaped in healthcare either with management, but despite that, knowing that I helped someone is going to be a lot more motivating) and I was giving meaningless projects to fill the time. I also have experience with customer service, so I know that working with the general public isn't all rainbows and sunshine. Lastly, I don't particular enjoy programming. It was something I chose because online communities and sources recommended it (job security and salary) when I was applying to college (lesson learned -- don't blindly follow advice found online).  
In particular, I want to pursue something youth related since I believe providing care for the children in our community is important to making the future a better place. I was thinking child adolescent psychiatry since I enjoy talking and working with patients and getting to know them. Plus, I think mental health affects us in our daily lives and to be able to address and combat that with patients who are suffering brings a sense of purpose to my being.  
However, I am not confident in pursuing this. The first is my chance to get into medical school. I don't have the best GPA (3.2 cumulative and 2.98 science) and because this is something I decided recently, I also don't have any of the prereqs done. I am interested in applying to my state university but they're a research university (AMCAS reports that 91 percent of the 2023 class had research experience vs 78 percent of clinical experience). Therefore, I would most likely take a gap year or two to take those prereqs after I graduate and study for the MCAT. Second, I come from a low-income household, so in addition to medical school, I still have to pay back my undergraduate loans (\~7k all federal) so not finding a job isn't ideal in the next few years if I do take a gap year.  
I have reached out to physicians in my area that I found online to see if I could shadow them via email (waiting for responses) and will start volunteering this summer at a local hospital, but with my low GPA (3.2 cumulative and 2.98 science) I can't imagine any medical schools to look at my profile as favorable (also considering the stats from AAMC, it doesn't seem like my state school values clinical work as much as research).  
Am I making a mistake? If someone could provide their two cents, that would be greatly appreciated.",Illustrious-Soup-576,2,0.75,0,1713649468,2024-04-20 21:44:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c91e2r/cs_to_medicine/,4,2024

1c8z9bx,Should I err on the side of caution? Scared to take the plunge,"TLDR: Planning an MSc in Marketing from a great college in the UK. Have 2 years of FTE + 3 years of internship experience, a resume full of high-value skills, and a mountain of potential student debt. Considering the tough job market, is this jump worth it?  


I come from a content creation background and want to shift to a more mid-level marketing role. While this is possible through yearly job switches over the next 5-6 years, a Master's in Marketing can get me there faster. But on the downside with a lot of student debt.

Most roles that I want to pursue after graduation - brand manager, marketing manager, senior content marketing, etc. have a base pay starting at £30,000 per annum. Jobs are less, yes. But I do not know if that will be the case by 2025. If I do get a job in the UK in this salary bracket and above, not only will I be able to pay off my student debt in less than 5 years but also be in a much better financial standing.

While yes, the living cost in the UK is high, the savings that I would be able to make along with my income are nearly 5x of what I'm currently making. So, the risk-to-reward ratio is also larger.

The worst case scenario is that I don't find a job in the UK and am forced to return home. My salary bracket here will get a decent boost, no doubt. 2X at the minimum. But then, the financial strain would be higher and the time taken to repay my debt would increase by a lot. 

The reason I'm in a dilemma is that a lot of people say that despite the tough job market if you have the right skills and experience, you can get through it. And then there's the other lot that says, ""doesn't matter what's on your CV, you're fucked. Inflation is at an all-time high. Companies are laying folks off. It's not a job searcher's market."" Makes it very hard to decide.

Shy people can still be friendly. I feel that not being 100% confident might be part of the reason why I always have a difficult time finding & keeping a job. 

It’s unfair. Yesterday I was told by a recruiter this: When the client calls you for a phone interview, be confident & sound professional. I didn’t think that I sounded that bad until she mentioned that. 

I was embarrassed. I didn’t say anything to her. She had the nerve to giggle before ending the call. How rude & unprofessional. 

Each rejection & criticsm makes me feel less confident about myself. How can I be less anxious & more confident?

I have social unfortunatly & I’ve always been shy & introverted too.

I can’t change my personality. I’m a nice person who just wants to work & be respected by other people.

1c8tteu,[Need your opinions] I am creating something to help job searches and applications easier,"**TLDR:**  What do you think is/was the most challenging or frustrating part of your job search and what you wish existed to make it easier?

I am building something to help you here and I promise to show you guys when ready so it can help with your job search and help you land interviews and jobs.

**Details:**

So I was laid off once, made a career change that resulted in me being without a full time job for almost a year. Every job application was full of opportunities but navigating the entire job search process was difficult and anxiety-laden for me.

I had to prepare and update my resume and juggle different applications and interviews, if I ever got any. Honestly, this was quite stressful and time consuming so I decided to build something to make it easier and less overwhelming.

At first, I built for my own use but my friends think it may also help others so I decided to polish it up and put it out there. My goal for now is to help people put their best foot forward in their job applications and to maximize their interview response rates (which is something many people is struggling with in this market).

While I have some ideas of my own, I am also curious to hear what you think is/was the most challenging or frustrating part of your job search and what you wish existed to make it easier. This will really help me in deciding what to build and improve on.

So far I have been working nights and weekends to build this and I will be ready with something in just a few more weeks.",SparklingKey,3,1.0,4,1713629855,2024-04-20 16:17:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c8tteu/need_your_opinions_i_am_creating_something_to/,4,2024
1c8trji,Teacher needs advice on changing schools,"Teacher advice on changing schools

Been teaching at a rural school for last nine years. I got an offer from a school about 4 miles closer (didn’t apply, I know some board member and I went to school there as a kid) and they just called me out of the blue 

Not sure if I should make the move. I don’t hate the school I am currently at, however I don’t love it either like I did up until 3-4 years ago. I will give some pros and cons of each and would like some advice since I can’t make decisions…

Old school -

Pros- 

Small class sizes (10-15) teaching 6 science classes and one stem (plus a study hall)

Teach what I want and not bothered by admin. I do in class (I have good class management and never have any issues)

I know what to expect and have my routine (which I need)

I like my coworkers 

Cons-

75% if kids don’t care to learn at the school and put little effort into anything)

Pay is $44,500 insurance is high $940 a month after board pays a portion (this is for family)

Admin soft on discipline and afraid of confrontation with parents. No dangerous situation, just poor behavior by 9-10 kids in the jr high that never gets addressed.


New school

Pro - 

Teach what I want. 

Higher pay 48,500  but insurance is more $1225 per month for family. 

Student could possible be better and care about learning something. 


Con -

Larger class size, instead of 2 sections with 10-12 in it like my current school I would teach all 6th grade together, all 7th grade together and 8th grade together. Then a stem class and elementary stem class + a study hall.

Their schedule isn’t 100% worked out yet. So not sure about it.

1c8t9ra,"Endless training, no organization, stress","I've just gotten my first job and I'm overwhelmed with the amount of training courses I'm doing online. I have about 90 courses to do, and I've only gotten through 14 of them in the first week. They consist of hour long videos, 75 page slide shows and tons and tons of notes with quizzes at the end.  
I recently graduated college. (I didn't want to finish college because I was drained from the note taking and endless videos of instruction) and now I'm doing it again but x3 in my job. I wanted to be in the field finally. I'm not complaining about having a job, I'm not being lazy or not wanting to work. I just didn't think the training would only consist of endless book work.  
My supervisor's have no plan for me. I haven't gotten a schedule or haven't been given an in person instruction. I am just at home for hours doing book work. My supervisor has said that I am supposed to be training with a group, a mentor and attending in person training together but she's not my real supervisor. My real one is too busy so she's helping out.  
It feels like they aren't taking me seriously and are just dumping me off with book work, not giving me a directive, not responding or getting my training actually started. It's a bad sign from a job.  
Has anyone ever experienced something so disorganized? How do you deal with the brain rot and fatigue you feel after work? and is 90 courses of hour long videos and 75 page slide shows with a deadline of 15 weeks normal for training in a job?  
I was also wondering how do you make time for people and yourself after work? This is my first job and people have so many expectations and get upset with me for not being as attentive. I have a relationship, a dad and brother that wants to talk a lot, trying to tend to my animal, answer random calls from my supervisor (that end up lasting for hours), have my hobbies (watching anime), and chores.  
Waking up is the worse feeling and I have headaches, fatigue, stress for the day because I know I have many obligations to tend to. ",k_loves-,0,0.5,3,1713628441,2024-04-20 15:54:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c8t9ra/endless_training_no_organization_stress/,4,2024
1c8svtt,Lost @ 26,"Hi all,

I am a 26 (f) year old feeling a little lost in life, as I’m sure most people do at this age.

I am extremely career motivated and am really working my way in a global company I work in. It’s a completely new sector and I’ve been there just over a year, in this time I’ve worked to make myself known in my company by introducing new processes, initiatives and networking. One of my key networks in the company is the CIO (Chief Information Officer) which I am super proud of. She is a great mentor, I just need to find more ways to get the best out of this relationship. 

Aside from my day to day career, I would love to have my own business. I grew up pretty poor with a single mum who was unemployed her whole life, so I had no career/life guidance really and a lot of this I’ve built through my own trial and error. The poverty mindset followed me through to ages 25 I’d say, and only just now I’ve been able to break out of it. The Included blowing my whole paycheck, never saving etc so I have little to show for being 26. 

My issue is, I am motivated and love business but have found it hard to stick to a set business idea. I seem to think of ideas, force myself to take action by setting up social media accounts/emails, creating logos and developing business proposals BUT after the motivation goes so does the idea. I often never go back to it. I have tried a beauty business and setting up my own CV writing service for extra cash. I am more passionate about writing CV’s for some extra cash. The question is: why do I never finish things? I don’t know if it’s my own confidence in not thinking I am good enough so I stop or not having enough knowledge or just discipline? I am sick of being poor and climbing the corporate ladder can take a while- what would you advise?

1c8plok,Taking a job because it’s fully remote,"
Hi there

A job opportunity has come up at a smallish company building regulatory tech. The job offering js for a Compliance Officer - a newly created role which is there to ensure compliance with GDPR and to help get the business ISO27001 and after this, to drive continual improvements. I currently have a job as a senior manager in the uk civil service working on compliance with data protection and other information rights laws, in a very niche, public and health sector context. It’s ok, but I can’t work remotely abroad, only in the uk. I have a great pension and a long leash in my current role but feel under resourced and uninspired. Had an interview with the manager for the new role and he admitted he didn’t really know what the newly created role would be doing. He insinuated I’d be creating a compliance function from the ground up, and skimmed over/conflated topics like corporate and data governance. I knew more about ISO27001 than him, and I am only vaguely familiar with how it all works.
Part of me wants to take it because it will be a chance to grow my experience into a highly lucrative area (information security systems management and auditing) but the other part of me is weary of how it might be a case of the blind leading the blind, albeit in a high growth company. This latter point is very important since I will potentially be able to progress quite quickly, something much trickier to do in the slow-moving, cash-strapped public sector. I also like the idea of travelling and working whilst abroad could be a good way to sustain this, but I’m conscious of high the workload might be.. 
Oh and my brother in law would be my boss’s boss at this new company. Possible red flag there.

I've been actively applying for roles recently and have a question about how recruiters view submitted resumes. Specifically, I'm curious about whether recruiters have access to past versions of resumes that applicants may have submitted for previous roles at the same company.

I tend to tweak my resume quite a bit, adjusting job titles and responsibilities to better align with each job description. However, I'm wondering if these changes are visible to recruiters when they review my application for a new position within the same company.

Do recruiters typically only see the version of the resume that was submitted for the specific role they are currently hiring for? Or do they have access to historical versions as well?

1c8mcu0,Trial work on tourist visa,"Hello everyone I am writing as I need advice on how to deal with a situation.

I had landed a great job via a legit recruitment agency, a once in a lifetime job I would say, in the private sector in Saudi Arabia. As a part of the hiring process, there was a trial period of 10 days where I was supposed to go there on a tourist visa and meet my employers and work unofficially for 10 days. After my trial period there would of been me returning home and they would have  applied for a work visa to make my employment right. they basically wanted to meet me in person before doing work visa which in part is also understandable. The people I was working with seemed also very polite, welcoming and generally very and nice which was exactly what i was looking for, and a breath of fresh air after years of working with 'bullies'....

I said yes however right away i felt very anxious about doing work on a tourist visa as I know they are very strict there. Also, I had never been there and didnt know what questions to expect at the passport control.

The employer booked my flights and hotel, but already in the morning when i had to catch a flight I felt terribly uneasy and worried about the immigration and passport control once I would have arrived in Saudi.

The first leg of my flight was TERRIBLE, I have never felt so anxious in my life (and I have travelled for work extensively for all of my working life) never felt like that!

I wasn't feeling comfortable at all telling the authorities I was there for holiday when in fact i was there for work. Seeing me so anxious, they simply would have understood something wasnt right and god knows what would of happened over there! probably a huge fine, deportation...I have never felt so uncomfortable like that in my entire life!

At the end I panicked extremely and ended up not taking the second flight that would have brought me to the destination country. I told my future employers and my agency about this and they said 'everyone does it', 'how else can they see you are a good fit, if they dont meet you first?' well maybe everyone does it but I don't feel comfortable doing it! They could have arranged a meeting and a trial also in another country, making things more transparent.....

Althought i don't regret my decision at that time, I feel terrible for having missed out such a great job opportunity. Now the agency thinks I wasn't serious about the position and made them waste time, althought I have explained to them that the only issue was entering as a tourist. 

I know i should have let them know right away, before booking flights and hotels...but i was genuinely excited about the idea and I TRULY WANTED THE JOB. But i don't really like doing things that are not transparent at the airport!! I am not someone that likes to lie and have always travelled for work with regular work visas.

I know many people do trial periods while on work visa, but we all know that saudi arabia is a strict country and i got so worried!

I told them I am available to send a refund for all the expenses they went through and that it was really a great opportunity.But I now feel like a complete loser that missed out on something great!

What would you have done in my shoes? ",Lucky_Street2926,0,0.5,0,1713607360,2024-04-20 10:02:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c8mcu0/trial_work_on_tourist_visa/,4,2024
1c8l7jg,I (20 F) am having a really hard time finding a job,"I’m (20 F) struggling so hard to find a job. I graduated high school almost two years ago and I want to work (my first job) by summer or by the fall at the latest, and I just started searching recently, but I’m already losing hope. I’ve spent so many hours today and yesterday trying to find things I think I’ll like in terms of jobs on Indeed, but I can’t find anything. Even the jobs I thought I’d like that require more previous experience and/or relocating have at least one other thing I don’t like about them. By things I don’t like, I mean things that would also be too much for me to handle due to my current mental state, and for other reasons too. There are so many things I can’t do and don’t want to do and that’s one of the things that’s making this so hard. Those things that I’m unable to do in terms of working include cooking, baking, standing and/or walking/moving for long periods of time, driving, lifting heavy things, being outside, being very outgoing, being overly professional like maintaining a physically professional appearance for example, doing dangerous things, using a lot of specific computer programs like Microsoft (I only have very little knowledge on Google and Microsoft programs), typing fast, operating phones/phone systems (I can type in a phone number, press call/hang up/mute/speaker and that’s it), babysitting/taking care of kids, working fast-paced/under pressure/in a highly stressful environment (especially since I literally needed iep accommodations to help prevent me from doing school work in those conditions), being a cashier, anything requiring me to be highly intelligent/pretty skilled in math/writing/science/common school subjects like that, and anything that would require me to have some kind of college/university/etc degree/certificate. So… I’m pretty limited in terms of what I can do (and I don’t mind sharing this since I’m pretty anonymous on here, so I’m ok with sharing that I live in Bothell in WA State). In terms of what my other struggles are, I have severe depression (have had depression since June 2020), passive suicidal thoughts, severe ocd (my most agonizing mental illness), possibly cptsd, possibly gad, social anxiety, possibly bpd (struggles with abandonment fears, paranoia, emotional instability, impulsivity, self harm, and feelings of emptiness), no friends (and don’t think I want any for many reasons that mainly relate to my mental illnesses, heartbreak of some sort (I’d rather not get into detail on what exactly that is for me), grief in general, narcissistic parents and siblings (especially my parents who are also verbally abusive, mostly/mainly my mom), periods of long-term isolation due to my struggles (especially my in-house family-related ones), symptoms of anorexia/eating disorder behaviors (and it’s definitely something that causes me to be more physically weak but I don’t like too much physical work for other reasons anyway). I’ve thought about trying other websites to search for jobs, and idk if that’ll work but however I am willing to try possibly reliable recommendations. If that doesn’t work, then idk what I’ll do. I also can’t afford therapy or anything like that and I think there’s (possibly, I’d rather not ask them about it for many reasons) absolutely no way my parents would help me pay for that. I’m not sure if applying for disability will ever work for me if that’s something I might need to do in order to get money, and what especially sucks is that I want to move out away from my family asap because I hate it here so much (where I live, aka with them). But I don’t have the money and/or friends for that, and might not ever have those things. Also, I’ve wanted work to help distract me from my issues and keep me away from home. I might not be able to get that though. I feel so screwed and feel so stressed and suicidal everyday for many reasons. Maybe I’ll just have to find a way to end my life someday, idk. What the fuck can I do? Is there any hope for me (I don’t think so)? This is random but sometimes I just wish I could be in a trusted persons care forever and/or have good/trusted friends… but that’s impossible for me for many reasons and I have bad trust issues too. Any advice appreciated on all this that I’m dealing with (I fully trust literally no one but maybe asking for advice might help me in some way and I’m sorry if this sounds rude, I’m just really struggling a lot and also needed to vent somewhere).",frackfuckfrick,0,0.5,17,1713602772,2024-04-20 08:46:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c8l7jg/i_20_f_am_having_a_really_hard_time_finding_a_job/,4,2024

The time has come for me to put in the hours and relearn CS...I just don't know where to start. I'm a jack of all trades but a master of none. I know some networking, some coding, some database... But nothing well enough to actually work. I'm willing to do programming tutorials, courses, whatever it takes so I can get back on track with my career but I need some advice on where to start... The world of coding has changed so much and I feel a bit overwhelmed. My organization focuses heavily on .NET with a lot of front end and back end dev... Should I go that route perhaps? Are there any hot tickets in the world of software development I should try to go for?

Hello everyone,
Hope everyone is doing great. I am currently studying Bachelors in Business administration and will probably be done by next year. The thing is that the job market is really bad where I live for this degree. A friend I know recently took a few courses on coursera on data analytics and even got a job right after he was done with the course. He advised me a while back that I do the same as this will be a good backup to my current degree. So I started my research on this field and I do find it fascinating but the problem is I don’t like maths. Many people that I came across had different opinions some say only basic maths/statistics is needed while some say maths is a must and one must be good at it to succeed in this field. This has left me a bit confused. So after a few weeks of research I found another course of digital marketing that also interested me.
The only issue is I am really confused on which one I should pursue.
Which will be best for me in terms of getting a job, pay and benefits.
I would love any advice I can get

Hi everybody,

So, i am 35 and i work for 7 years at the headquarters of a medium size (120M/annum approx. 800 employees globally) family owned global company located in mediterranean area. The last 2 and half years i have a position of a global sales director (before i was a sales manager for 5 years at the same company), i manage 7 teams in total, 3 x sales teams, 3 x operations teams, 1 x marketing team. The most of my team members are with me at the hq offices, while i have some team members in US, Asia and different countries of Europe. 
I have started the collaboration from scratch with many and different very big customers bringing multimillion agreements, in many different countries of the world in which i travel 6-8 weeks per year. The results of my activities is company overall growth, which is providing me the respect of the company employees and ceo/owner. My current income is quite under paid since i am getting approx. 45k per annum, a lot of them are under the table so i am taking approx. 35k net income, while there is no bonus scheme, at this point it is good to say that at my country 45k are considered approx. 2x - 3x more than the basic salary, so i am underpaid for the role not for the country. I enjoy the status of my work since i am dealing with decision makers highly reputated at their sector at a global scale, also i really enjoy the daily routine of my work, the team that i have built all this years is better than ever so working hours are great, tough ( a lot of work) but at the same time great.

Overall is ok, but i dislike the idea that my boss is underpaying me and he is making millions from my effort (i don’t mind if he is making a lot but it is fair to bring some money of them at my home as well), so while i am not actively looking for a change, i am receiving every now and then several proposals most of them for a triple (or more) amount from bigger companies but for lower in hierarchy positions which till the moment i have refused.

Few days ago a very good friend of mine who is working at the same sector at a much bigger company located in Canada, called and he told me that they are looking for a business development manager to be located in my country and they want to be me. The are offering 120k gross plus bonus.  I will be by myself, working from home, without any global portfolio and with less daily responsibilities, (easy job in comparison with my current days), i know it might sound stupid but i am the guy who loves having big teams, responsibilities, etc, so a lower position with lower responsibilities and so on was never my choice, but i am thinking of it now…

Of course i have spoken to my current boss and i have also let him know all the proposals that i have gotten in the past, since i ve used them as an increase salary leverage, (thats how i ‘ve become a director, i used to be a sales manager running almost the same tasks without the title and with even smaller salary), but he is not willing to adjust his salaries with the global for the role trend, he prefers to have a global guy but pay him with high for the local market standards.

So this is more a life advise that i ask than a decision for the case advise, since i have dropped off a lot of similar proposals in the past due to the fact that i like my current role, also so far despite the fact that my cv is considered good, i ve never received proposal for equivalent with my current role, i would definitely say yes to a similar job responsibilities for a higher salary.

So should i drop off responsibilities, team and status, do a step back at a role just to go for more money also chasing a new carrier path? Obviously i am not forgetting the fact that i might get again in the future a similar role with better money, but i prefer to think my real options than having imaginary thoughts. Is such a move eventually make me to be less happy than i am chasing money or i have to remember that everything is business and we work to bring food on the table?

Money is not everything but with 45k gross i will never buy a house or having a good pension, etc, also i am not having a child till now but it will happen within the next 1-2 years so i am thinking that money will be more useful then than now but will be more difficult for me to make a change.

Sorry if my post is too big but i tried to cover all the spectrum of my concern and i am really looking for an advise.

1c8eyd5,Finding Niche or Unique Jobs,"So as I’ve gotten older it seems that if you can fill an economic niche or have specialized training, you’ll be in high demand and the pay will reflect that. 

Somethings that come to mind is a story a teacher told me about his buddy who was 1 of 5 people in the country who could go adjust military satellite dishes (or something along those lines) in Alaska. Did it a few times a year and made a boatload.

Or there was a guy that I personally saw who got flown up from Texas to install a virtual reality golf simulator at the apartment complex currently we’re building. 

Anyone know of any good jobs/careers along the lines of being unique and therefore would have demand and pay well? How do you find these niches? How would one get started in xyz field, or where should I start looking? What kind of training is required? Etc etc 

M20 has house painting experience, carpentry experience, some welding/ auto repair experience from high school(though no certs) and my CDL. Enjoy working with my hands and the outdoors.

1c8ep6k,I wasn't invited to my company's leadership training.,"TLDR at the bottom. For some background information, I work as a structural engineer at a relatively new firm. I'm 4 years in and the firm opened about 6 months before I joined. There were around 10 employees at that point and we are currently up to around 200. I started fresh out of college and aside from roughly 30% of our staff consisting of senior engineers and the HR/accounting/etc. most everyone started fresh from college or a year or two into their careers. This firm is all I've known as far as my career is concerned but I like it here and everyone I talk to who has come over from a different firm raves about how much better our company is to work for.  
  
I found out earlier this week that my company is holding an ""emerging leaders"" training program. The program, designed to help young professionals hone their leadership skills, will take place on 4 different training days throughout the year, with people from different branches traveling to our HQ for the program. An email was sent out to all those invited and asked participants to be discrete as not everyone received an invitation. The participants were all BCC'd so no one knew who else was in it. One of the staff that I manage mentioned it to me a couple of days ago, assuming I was attending. I played it off like I was aware but not attending. I looked at our company schedule and was able to see many people were marked as ""occupied"" on the same two days next week. Typically our schedule would show what specific projects were being worked on so it is clear to me all these individuals are attending the training. Several people I manage are attending as well as most of my peers who I would describe as being in a similar role to myself.  
  
I've been trying to brush it off and keep telling myself different reasons why I wasn't invited. ""my workload is too full right now"" or ""They're reserving my training budget for an important technical training later this year"". Truth be told it's eating me alive. I put my all into my work and always go above and beyond what is asked both in the technical side of my job as well as in the project management aspects. All of my performance reviews have been positive. Do they not see me as being important to our company's success? Do they not see me in a leadership role?  
  
Additionally, last month we held a training on a technical topic that is new to our company. My boss wanted me to be a part of it and assured me I'd have a spot. A couple of weeks went by after that conversation and I hadn't heard anything else about the training. I reached back out to my boss and he was surprised my manager hadn't sent me any info on it but assured me I would be involved. Next thing I knew the training had occurred without me. I mentioned it to my boss and he brushed it off saying that my manager likely ""just wanted to make sure you got your report in on time"" which has never been a problem for me before. This same manager would have had to recommend me for leadership training.  
  
This really has me questioning my position in the company. To compound matters, I'm supposed to be transferred to a different branch halfway across the country in a few weeks and I need to sign my new lease agreement by the end of next week. If they don't see me in a leadership role in the long term I don't know if this is a company I want to uproot my life for.

How can I get answers to these questions without seeming entitled? What's a healthy way to have this conversation?  
  
TLDR: My company did not include me in a training program and now I'm questioning my standing. How should I proceed?",BornSalamander8,1,1.0,4,1713579393,2024-04-20 02:16:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c8ep6k/i_wasnt_invited_to_my_companys_leadership_training/,4,2024

1c8cnbs,Should I leave my current job that I love for a higher paying job?,"Should I leave my current role that I love for a higher paying job?

Hi guys 

I’ve been offered a role which is £4k more than what I’m currently earning, the commute is the same length but it’s easier as it’s one train (currently driving to train station, taking a train then two tubes and walking to work for 10 mins) new commute would be driving to train station, taking one train and then walking to office for 8 mins). The pay difference works out to be around £200-£300 difference per month which in my eyes is quite a lot but not sure worth taking if I love my current job so much? 

What I enjoy about my role is I love my team and my manager and the positive work culture, I’ve only been here just over 3 months but have gotten really comfortable. My manager is extremely approachable and supportive, probably because we are the same age (late 20s). But the new job offers a higher pay for similar work I’m doing, private healthcare, easier/cheaper commute which I’ve factored in the extra money I’ll be making/saving. I’m not really in a financial struggle but the few extra hundred will help in renovating our home.

I’m not sure what to do! I’ve let the other company know I will get back to them on Monday but I can’t make a decision. I’m very worried I will regret leaving my current role!

1c8c47h,feeling burnt out working in treatment,"28 / male / western USA. 30 credits short of a Bachelor’s in English. 

Been working in addiction/mental health treatment for 5 years now. After getting sober myself over 6 years ago, I jumped into adventure therapy because of my love for the mountains and my desire to serve. It was (and sometimes still is) very fun and rewarding. I’ve learned a lot of skills I thought I’d never have and it’s made me learn how to hold firm boundaries and be a better leader. I have some great memories spending time with my coworkers and clients in the backcountry. And I’ve built a career off of it. I moved up the ranks quite a bit and have developed a lot of trust and a good reputation. I have good relationships with all the executive level people in my company and I would be surprised if I couldn’t continue climbing up the totem pole. 

But lately I’m just feeling so burnt out on it. I never go climbing or skiing in my free time anymore because it just reminds me of work. I do my best to be the “laidback staff” so that I don’t have to deal with a ton of conflict but sometimes shit happens, I hold a boundary, and I’m getting screamed at by a rich, entitled 22 year old asshole and I can’t remember why I’m even doing this shit. And anyone who’s ever worked in treatment knows that sometimes your coworkers are worse than the clients. There are communication breakdowns, people sandbag you regularly, and there’s a culture of withholding information from the people on the frontlines. Even if I stay on the fast track, I know it is inevitably going to be like pulling teeth to get even the slightest bit more money. 

I’m feeling stuck. I have a good schedule and a lot of autonomy, I like a lot of my coworkers and my boss. But I still feel shitty about it. I dread going in to work more than ever. Should I finish my degree? Should I find another job? Are my skills even gonna translate to other shit? If anyone has any similar experience working in treatment I would love your advice. I’m passionate about other things (making music, being creative, video games, writing, etc) and could see myself enjoying other stuff, but I fear the idea of starting over.

Hers the dilemma:

I feel that it would not really be worth it for them to hire me, as we are automating a lot of things right now, and seems like we are setting up the senior analyst to where he can do a all of the work himself. Because of this, I do not think that they will be able to justify keeping me after I graduate and need to be paid more.

I am making $13/hr, and I simply am struggling financially. I have cut out all unnecessary spending, and am still struggling pretty hard. So if I am to stay much longer I think I will need an increase in pay before I graduate.

Lastly, if they do not plan on hiring me then I think it would be best for me to get a different internship in which they do plan on hiring me. 

So, the senior analyst is genuinely one of my best friends, and has been for a while. But he has no control over hiring/firing/pay etc. 

What does a conversation to discuss things like this look like? And should I talk to my friend to see what he has to say about it before I talk to the owners? 

Thankfully, the owners are very kind people and will likely be understanding whatever happens. I just dont really know if this conversation would be appropriate to have all at once or more a piecemeal type of thing.

1c8b8px,LCSW VS LMFT or LPC for flexibility with travel interstate practice OR flexibility in employment opportunities?,"For the last couple of years, I've been wanting to pursue a career in mental health, particularly in social work. However, I also desire the flexibility to travel and work remotely. I live in LA but I don't like the culture and often get homesick. Being able to hop between places would be IDEAL. OR even being able to go travel abroad and still work with clients. Do people do this? 

I understand that interstate practice in social work is limited, but I'm hopeful about the potential passage of the LCSW Compact, which could enhance mobility for licensed clinical social workers. My experience with gig jobs and a non-traditional work schedule has led me to seek a profession that offers stability and consistent hours. 

Despite enjoying my work as a crisis chat specialist, I found it challenging due to the intensity of the high need population. With my license, I envision leading DBT groups and providing one-on-one counseling in a private or group practice setting. While counseling or psychology might be more commonly recommended paths, I just feel drawn to social work for its code of ethics and perceived variety of employment options.

 My desire to travel and work with clients remotely makes me wonder about the feasibility of practicing in different geographical locations. I'm exploring options of potentially obtaining licensure in counseling in one state and providing telehealth services to clients in another state, as suggested by my therapist. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone felt similarly or if they feel SW is a better avenue (like I so want it to be)? I just don't want to pigeon hole myself and end up super frustrated by the parameters of only being able to practice in one state because I'd imagine the LCSW Compact will take quite a number of years to pass in other states.",glowingworm2022,1,1.0,0,1713569226,2024-04-19 23:27:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c8b8px/lcsw_vs_lmft_or_lpc_for_flexibility_with_travel/,4,2024

1c8ajj2,Should I quit my job?,"I (M32) work a 9-5 corporate job, in the finance sector. This will be 10th year at the company. 

I say it’s 9-5, but it’s basically get the work done, which requires me to often work late.

On top of this, I’m expected to progress through professional qualifications, which are (around) an extra 300-400hrs a year of studying (we get 1 day/week in the run up to exams to take as a study day). But basically you find yourself working 60+ hour weeks regularly as a result of the study and additional office hours. 

In 2019, the stress of the job resulted in me having a mental breakdown. It wasn’t just the ‘standard’ job at that point. Unforeseen circumstances basically resulted in me doing 3 people’s jobs, a junior colleague, and a senior colleague. My health slowly spiralled over the year, until I crashed and I ended up seeking medical help. (The doctor asked me I had thought about quitting the job at the time).

I did look for other work at the time, but it wasn’t financially viable (job offers I got required additional travel to another city, which on top of the time commitment, also meant less money month-month due to the additional travel costs).

Then Covid happened. Work improved due to better work life balance due to WFH etc, and more people conscious of MH etc.

Work has now started to return to old ways and I feel completely overwhelmed with my workload. 

My colleagues are a mixed bag. Some are great. However, being a corporate company, you get the odd high flyer, who (for a lack of better words) are toxic and prejudice. I have met numerous over the 10 years, who have contributed to MH issues. I won’t go into details as I’ll be all day, but the punch line is they are very triggering for anxiety and you can never do enough for them, whilst they consistently make you feel like you are not good enough. 

Needless to say. I’m at that crossroads again, with a colleague who is toxic and a workload that is unmanageable. Just today, they tried to gaslight me about a project, and I feel very uncomfortable working with them (i think I’m going to speak to my manager about it next week). 

I want to quit, and I know that. However, the pay is decent (c40k UK). I have a mortgage, and life events that need saving for, so I cannot afford to drop too much. And given the current economic climate, it would not be wise Imo to take a paycut. 

I don’t know if the career choice is something I want to do anymore. And I don’t know if that’s because of the company I work for. And I don’t know if the grass is necessarily greener on the other side. 

Should I just quit, and take a paycut just to get out, or should I stick it out and continue to play the corporate game until my personal circumstances improve.

1c8a0ac,Advice about starting my own photography business?,"Hello - I’ve been using photography as a hobby for over 10 years. Since I was a teen.  I’ve always received compliments on my photos but I’ve never pursued anything out of my own leisure.

 Recently, I’ve been toying with the idea of starting up my own business. Offering some free or highly discounted prices to build up a portfolio of portrait photography and go from there. Issue is there are SO MANY in my area. Keep in mind I don’t live in a big city. I mean, maybe 30k people. Not small but nothing like a metro area.

 I want to invest in a new camera and some equipment, a website, updating editing software etc but I’m just so nervous given the competition. A girl I know somewhat well is a photographer and I get paranoid I’d be seen as ripping her off? Idk. I would only focus on outdoor portraits, weddings, in home etc as I don’t have a studio yet. I guess I just need some practical advice and words of encouragement as my anxiety gets the best of me.

1c88zl9,Help! Which field has the best satisfaction rate and work life balance?,"Help! Careers decisions

I’m currently trying to decide what field to get into, I have so many different interests. 
Whatever career I do go into however, I would love to have a good work life balance. I have always loved the medical field, being exposed to it because a lot of my family is in the field but because of how demanding and stressful it can be, I’m second guessing it. I dabbled in business in high school and I was good at it but never thought too much about it since I was so set on the medical field. I’m good at writing and literature and I LOVE reading, so I thought law might have been a field to consider, I don’t know much about the field so any advice on the field would be greatly appreciated. People say I have a flair for design, I love designing and critiquing interior and fashion design in my free time but there isn’t many opportunities where I’m from so I vetoed it. And together with my love for medicine and the human body, I do have an interest in wellness, I spend a lot of time keeping an active lifestyle and curating my meals, so I thought maybe I can look at something there. Maybe I’m just too confused. I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts and advice in any of the different fields! 

Out of these careers below , which do you think has the best life and job satisfaction and also work life balance? 

Doctor of medicine, Dentist, Pharmacist, Lawyer, business ( maybe finance or marketing) , Interior Design, Elementary teaching, Nutritionist and biomedical engineering.

1c88dca,Should I Leave My Job Or Am I Just Being Lazy? (19 M) ,"Long story but here we go, get your popcorn ready: 

I got this job around a year and a half ago through a friend of mine. I was basically working in a call center doing cold calls for the companies services. I desperately needed some experience but I was kind of duped into taking the job. My pay structure was 0.0025% of the total amount a customer was given (I work in a loan providing service) so if I got a customer a $1,000,000 loan I would make $2,500. Initially, if I could get 4 deals a month at $1,000,000 I could make $10,000 a month. Amazing money right? Well, this is what happened. I knew it was a commission only role when I took the position. I immediately should have saw that as a red flag as I had no sales experience before and it was an entry level. 

We basically had no warm leads at all, for the first few months were on a dialer just playing the numbers as my manager (who was 20 at the time) and the owner of the company (now 43 said. I worked my ass off because I was a college student with nothing better to do. I was working 9-10 hours a day just calling and I went in with barely any training, no idea on the product and o

However due to my work ethic, I was able to outperform the entire floor, despite not getting a lot of sales. In fact, most people did not get any sales. I knew some people who worked there for 4-5 months and made no money. I made 2 sales during my second semester of college which was around what everyone else did combined. By the way I got to the job by any means necessary, I didn’t have a car so I took my bike and biked 9 miles a day. The owner was kind enough to buy me a bike after the one I bought was stolen for $400.00

During the summer, when I went back home (I live 1000 mi away) apparently the entire team I worked with did some crazy things. They had destroyed the owner’s golf cart which cost $20,000, they tried to bring a known financial criminal into the office bc they probably thought it was a joke. In addition to that one of the guys I worked for, his best friend fucked his girlfriend and the guy I worked for also cheated on his girlfriend many times previously. After this happened I was promoted to “Vice President” as my boss really liked me and wanted me to stick around. My boss was helpful to me in the beginning and cared about me as a person. Due to this I decided to stick with him and be loyal as I felt I would be a snake if I didn’t. However, then some bad things happened. I was working from home, didn’t really have much direction and I was continuing the calling, then all of the sudden the owner disappears. Can’t reach him, can’t contact him, etc. 

I ask his fiancé (who was also involved in the business) what was going on. His mother died (which is true) and he had to go back up to his state to deal with the estate as his family was kind of messed up and hid his mom’s death from him. That’s what she explained to me. However, I still couldn’t reach him after quite some time, this happened in July and I couldn’t reach him through September. Note during the summer I wasn’t able to close any deals due to lack of guidance but I gained a lot of experience and figured out the service I was offering on my own. 

I came back and he still wasn’t there, then I started to get worried. I kept asking where he was and I started to get suspicious. A client had reached out to our business and I was pre-qualifying him and seeing how we could help, I asked him “how do you know the owner?” He told me, “He was in jail with me”. Immediately that sent alarm bells ringing, he was in jail? I called my boss’s fiancé right away and I expressed what I had just heard. She explained to me that he got into a bar fight in July and that he had alcohol problems. She said once he got out of DAF (Drug Abuse Foundation) he would’ve told me on his own terms. When my mom spoke with him on the phone in May she suspected he had some type of drug and alcohol problems. I didn’t believe her but I realized she was right after finding out about this. 

At this time I hired someone a year younger than me. He had an entrepreneurial mindset and I thought he could possibly be a good fit to our company. I made a big mistake and I wasn’t ready to lead yet. I was mean, hard on him, and not a good leader. He left within 2 months and he didn’t close a single sale (my fault, I didn’t train him well and I shouldn’t have hired him to begin with). Then my boss came back and I thought he was better than ever. He seemed good but I noticed changes in him 2 months after he came back from DAF. I noticed that he was basically winging a lot of things. For example, he would randomly bring people in our office for “meetings” who I didn’t know. Then he would expect me to pull up everything about the company. Our LOI’s with previous borrowers, our CRM system, all on the fly to show and present to these people. On one occasion he wanted me to show a form that we were provided from our bank. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a blank form and I showed one of a client they happened to know. My boss was upset but I knew I made a mistake. There were other things that occurred during this time. When I was a calling a customer and they were possibly interested in our services, I had the phone on speaker, whenever this happens he constantly hounds over me and basically tells me what to say in the background). I already know what to say and have an advanced knowledge of the lending product we offer. He did this to “help me” and that “we’re all on the same team” but I felt I was being micromanaged. I expressed my discomfort and he said to “Not deny help”. I didn’t need any help and I was handling the customer well. Note that that customer never got back to us. 

Eventually though things got better, and business was picking up. Hell, I even helped close a $3,300,000 transaction! I closed 3-4 deals that I was working on for months. He gave me money on some deals that I had a minor help on. He gave me around $4,200 for two deals. Note that at this point I had only made around $1,900 in one year with the company. Not a lot of money but I gained a lot of experience. 

So things were going good from Jan-Feb and then things have gotten really bad. I knew about his past a bit but then my friends uncovered some more information. They had found out about his arrest in July and I had to tell them what happened. After this, I decided to look more into his court records (in my state it’s public information). I found some things, that were, somewhat disturbing. 

In 2017 I knew he had a bad bar incident. I confronted him about this as there’s an article about it online. He said horrible things such as he was going to kill the officers who arrested him when he was being arrested. He was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. He told me he was drugged at his table and because of this he was pissed and went crazy. However, I pulled up the police report and what happened may or may not have been truthful. He got very mad at his table according to the report and started yelling and causing a commotion at the place, banging on windows and yelling. When he was apprehended by police he told them to fuck off and called them scumbags. He was arrested and began resisting arrest and was yelling at the officers. From the report he was dragged into the holding cell and he pissed in the sink. I knew his arrest was bad but I didn’t realize it was this bad. 

Then I found a couple of incidents that had happened between 2018-2021. In 2018 he almost foreclosed on a property that he had a balloon mortgage on. I assume he took the balloon mortgage because he couldn’t get a normal one due to his existing legal issues. He had some problems paying this balloon mortgage. Note that the person who lent the money helped him start the business in the first place. However, he eventually got money from another man at a more reasonable term and he was able to settle with the original creditor. However, in the court docs it said, “Cannot have contact with XYZ family.” This was the reason why I presume they exited the business. He always told me that the father (who he started it with) died (which is true) and the sons didn’t want part of it anymore. He left before he died. That was the first incident. 

The 2nd incident occurred where he got a DUI in 2016-2017. He apologized for it but this was concerning and it happened right before the bar incident in 2017. 

Then in 2021, when he got the money to pay off the balloon mortgage, he didn’t make any payments at all to pay back the person who lent him money according to court records. This was disturbing. When the owner came to seize the apartment, which he was authorized to do so, my boss apparently had scaled the building, climbed in through the sliding glass window, and assaulted the man (who was over 70) and caused him injuries. I had no idea this happened and I couldn’t look at him the same. 

The most recent incident happened this summer as I mentioned earlier. My boss I found out has had an on and off drinking problem that he seems to have improved at. After his mother died he went to the bar to drink. According to him he was “jumped” by 10 guys in a bar brawl. The 10 man bar fight was true, however, court records said that he was the one who instigated the fight and fought them. He got arrested and he started screaming at the officers and once again got dragged into the holding cell. He did the same thing and pissed in the sink, along with smearing his blood all over the walls. 

Also, I had seen a tiny snapshot of his rap sheet from 2006-2008. He had been arrested for possession of Marijuana, driving without a valid license 3 times, and disorderly conduct. 

The thing is though he has truly helped me out a lot. He basically gave me his Porsche SUV, taught me how to pull data, conduct sales, and he has helped me grow my business acumen quite a bit. Problem I also damaged the SUV slightly (backed into a pole, stupid me) and I’m afraid if I leave he’ll have me pay the full bill. He told me he thinks the repair is going to be 20K. I only have around $20,000 in savings. He wanted me to build a team with college interns this summer which I’ve started doing. I want to get the management experience and then leave once they’re done. We should have around 5-10 people. 

My problems with the company is that he has hired people who were desperate for jobs and were in bad positions financially. I’ve seen plenty of people come and go. Most people don’t last a year or even 6 months from my experience. Most a few weeks or a month. Out of 15 people, 2 have stayed over a year (me and one other guy). Our turnover is extremely high and no one sticks around. 

He also has hired people with questionable experience, for instance, he hired a guy from DAF who was a little off (full tattoos, weird hairdo, whole shebang) I think he relapsed on crack while working for us and he was let go. He hired another kid who was my age who was working 2 other jobs and was in a rough place financially as he didn’t have any parents. He had met him at a foster kid events. He was having them do cold calls with barely and training, he just told them, “Follow the Script” and have myself (I mean I) handle the rest. He’ll also bring in these people randomly without my consent and tell me to train them tomorrow. He basically picks them up off the street sometimes. I try my best but these people are set up to fail. For my deals that all closed in March, I am still waiting to be paid. The amount due is around $9,200. I haven’t asked him yet as my payments are supposed to be on the 15th and 30th of each month. This is a huge red flag and I’m about to ask for my check. 

He also sometimes fabricates about what the company does. He says we “just helped this company” even though we financed them last year. Or he’ll say, “We’re packaging $40,000,000 in loans a month”. By the way, we’re not as far as I’m concerned. Maybe he was at one point but today he’s not as I see everything that goes through. He’s also out of the office a lot and I sometimes get lost on what I need to do and don’t have a schedule everyday. He tells me to “get creative” and “get new business”. Okay great, but by what means? How? When I ask he gets slightly agitated. 

I put a lot of sweat and resources into this company and I feel like if I leave I’ll have betrayed my boss as he put a lot of time into developing me. I’m also worried about having to pay for the damage I caused to the car. However People of Reddit, do you think I was lazy and squandered this opportunity? Or did I get into a scam with a criminal?

1c87l03,"[UK] I am disliked at work for my constant positivity: Be honest, should I change?","I work in a very stressful high-pressure role in finance (insurance.) It is more so our particular role and department where it is like this, but still it is pretty grim across the board in my particular sub-industry within in insurance.

Used to be all office based, but changed to mainly WFH in the last 2 years. 

Anyway, I always try to be positive about the situation. I don't like to complain and rarely challenge change from management, new processes etc. (Unless I know my input will actually affect a decision rather than general ranting.) 

I tend to rub my colleagues (who I like and even get on with sometimes outside of work) the wrong way sometimes. I am the senior and technical on the team currently, but not classed as a manager and I am the same grade/level as them.

The main problems stems from lack of challenging management about issues that are likely to be wrong, invoke more work or include significant changes. They haven't said anything directly to me, but I can just tell they don't like my attitude sometimes and have hinted in the past I should stand up more.

----

I don't tend to do it because I just don't want the drama. I am also an introvert. My employer has treated me well and I like to reward that with being versatile. I am very VERY grateful for the job and career they have given me, but my colleagues might just see it as another job. I also used to be very pessimistic, but I got called out for it by management in front of about 30 people (in a previous job/unrelated career about 10 years prior). - That stuck with me as the manager was right, I now intentionally try to be more positive in all areas of my life.

**Be honest, would this piss you off if you had someone like me on your team based on the above?** 

As you move up the food chain into even more technical non-managerial positions, would being positive all the time be a bad trait to have? I could be really critical, cold and opinionated if I wanted to, but only if it would benefit my career.

1c86hth,I’ve been put on a PIP but I don’t think I have had the correct support. ,"

I am 37 and had a successful first career (sports) gained a couple of degrees and had some work experience/exposure to real life. At the time of my career change, I would have described myself as having soft and hard skills/capabilities, desire to learn and work hard but little sector or management knowledge and zero experience. 

Almost 2 years ago I started my second career, hired as a manager and we discussed that there would be a  steep learning curve at the time - but nothing I thought was insurmountable.

Since  starting I have worked on and delivered multiple client engagements and had good testimonials for the work from clients. I have also been a line manager in the team and had a direct report. 

In January I was put on a PIP. I was not meeting the expectations of a manager that had been in role for 18 months. 

I am aware that I continue to lack context/knowledge of my sector and how to effective manage engagements, but when I bring this up with my line manager - his argument is that there is no where to learn this other than time on task and learning from seeing others do best practice. 

I currently feel down on this whole experience and I feel between a rock and a hard place because 

My performance is being challenged for a lack of knowledge and at the same time being told the only way to learn is by experiencing and learning from best practice however since I started I have been the most senior (or only) delivering the engagements  I have worked on end-to-end since I arrived with little oversight. 

Do I have a right to feel let down/failed by my employer/boss or has my previous job in high performance sport clouded my view on what teams and management does? 

I.e. tailoring learning/support to get the most out of  the team and allowing them to play to their strengths?

1c86d45,Advice needed after job offer acceptance ,"Hi All, if this is not the correct place to post this, please direct me to the correct subreddit. In addition, I reside in an at-will US state.

To start off, I was let go by my former employer  months ago, and my previous role was as a remote software developer. The job hunt between then and now was grueling, and I was hoping to secure another remote job. I applied for many remote jobs without luck, so decided to try my hand at local businesses. In addition to living in an at-will state, I live in a poorer area of the US, so benefits and pay aren't the best, but I made sure the in-person roles I applied for at the very least had health insurance and paid time off.

Yesterday, I had an interview with a local small business, and only a hours after the interview, they called to inform me that they wanted to hire me. Plus, they told me that I would also be getting a higher pay than what they were originally going to give me. I expressed enthusiasm and requested an offer letter, and they were happy to oblige. I also mentioned a two week trip I secured in July of this year, and we agreed to have it approved as unpaid time off.

This morning, I received the letter, and everything looked as expected given how things are around here. Some things mentioned in the letter were: I would have a week of PTO after a year, I'd be eligible for 55% coverage of employee insurance, and I'd receive the salary agreed verbally over the phone. After carefully looking it over, I agreed to start this upcoming Monday.

Here's where things get a little more complicated...later today, I got an unexpected email from a representative from a remote based company I applied for (and I ensured it was legitimate before applying). They asked me if I could have a quick call tomorrow, and I confirmed that I would be happy to have the call. This other company has more to offer in benefits (like 401K) compared to the local business, and I want to still consider my options.

Despite wanting to consider my options, I'm feeling confused on how to navigate this situation. If the call tomorrow goes great and the open role still appears attractive, I'm wondering if I should keep in contact with the rep from the remote company in the case things go well. If the remote company rep decides to keep moving forward with me, and I somehow end up getting an offer from them, would it be illegal (or at best tarnish my work history) for me to step away from the local company to take on the remote position? 

I want to be as professional as possible and not burn bridges and leave bad impressions, as the local company has been accommodating so much already. However, I recognize that they don't have a stellar benefits package, and I'm afraid of getting myself in a bad position if I leave so soon (if the remote role decides to give me an offer). I know the remote role hasn't given me anything substantial yet, but I want to be prepared if they decide to put a good offer on the table.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and thanks in advance!

1c85uk8,Advice for Aspiring Talent Agent,"Hey everyone, I (23 M) would appreciate some advice on what you would do in my shoes. I think I could get a good range of opinions here. Sorry in advance for the length.  
  
I've been interviewing for agent trainee positions since graduating last June and ended up making it to the final round for two companies: one was a big 3 agency and the other is a smaller but still big agency. Unfortunately, I did not get the job at the big agency but I believe I left a good impression, connected with several in the company on LinkedIn, and heard the agency appreciates continued interest (this was actually my second time applying, both times without a referral). Had I gotten the offer I would've definitely taken it, and I plan on applying again down the road. I also made it past the first round of the NBC Universal Page program, so that's something I'd consider reapplying to as well.  
  
In a couple of weeks, I'll be interviewing for the smaller agency and the pay is not great. Obviously I knew this when I applied but the interview was postponed for months because of the writers' strike and I spent a lot of that time unemployed. As a result, I moved back home to Sacramento (rent-free) and just started a decent paying job with benefits and PTO as an Administrative Assistant before the smaller agency finally got back to me to schedule the panel interview. If I got the position, I would be taking a sizable pay cut and would obviously have to start paying rent in LA, with little savings. For more context, I'm the son of immigrants and my only industry connections are the people I went to college with and alumni from my scholarship network. My parents are about to retire so for all intents and purposes, I don't have much of a financial safety net and I have a small amount of debt to deal with ($3K). Obviously if I want it ""bad enough"" I would take any position I could get but unfortunately, life sometimes forces you to be realistic and with how the entertainment industry is right now, I don't know how stable the position would be anyway.  
  
Entry level entertainment jobs are hard to get so I also feel I shouldn't take this opportunity for granted. If you were in my shoes, would you take the position knowing you'd be living paycheck to paycheck for the foreseeable future with no guarantee of becoming a talent agent in the future or keep working my 9-5 for the rest of the year while building my savings so I can move to LA later just to search for similar positions. If I had more money saved it'd be a no brainer but the timing right now is not good. There's not a ton of entertainment opportunities if I stayed in Sacramento but there's a pretty big music/touring scene in the area that I could get involved in and I would at least be building my experience in an assistant position. I could also try to find a remote assistant position in entertainment, though that doesn't sound super easy. Man...  
  
Obviously this depends on if I even get the job but I do feel good about my chances and the recruiter said the turnaround from receiving an offer to starting would be around 2 weeks so I need to start thinking about it now. I'm also using this as a time to get general career and life advice so I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts and experiences anyway. The film and entertainment industry is tricky to explain so I've gotten varying opinions from my family. I know I want to work in entertainment but I also have matured a lot since graduating and realize that life isn't just about work. I also don't want to give up on my dreams before giving myself an honest shot at it.

1c84gub,How do I get out os CS roles?,"I feel like the new job I got was a step down and I’m having a hard time accepting it. But, because I’m also afraid to take a long unemployment I took it.
I am an immigrant and started my first work here in retail. Move up and got a job in a small company, and I started making $18/hr. I stayed there for 4yrs and my salary went up to $28/hr. This is a senior CS job, that includes a little bit of sales.
I decided to leave, then I got employed to a new job that offered me $30.77 per hour, stayed there for 2yrs and 4mos. ended up at $39.93 per hour. This is also a CS job (biotech), no phones, more on operations and sales support. There was a change in management and lots of bullying in the team happened that’s why I decided to leave.

Now, I got this new job, it’s the same industry (biotech) and it’s similar to what I do in my previous job. But they offered me $34/hr and I have to answer phone calls, and take orders over the phone.  Function like a CS in a contact center.

1c83n33,Coworker is driving me nuts with his behavior.,"I work as full stack dev , I was into testing for quite sometime but I was always learning coding behind the scenes and wanted to move to software development.
I moved to different country and secured a new job, although my interview was in automation testing I did fairly well in coding. Soon after joining I got an opportunity to move to a team that has dev work.
My team had this coworker who was also from testing but he barely knows coding. However he could get on due to strong hold on business. He did teach me some business nuances but mostly it was what was required to be passed to team.

Now my entire team got merged to a new team that has even more critical software dev, and our company can go into potential merger. Everyone's skill level is evaluated. Also I will go on maternity leave soon so I have to prove myself asap before I come back when there can be potential merger. 


He recently started to ask me he will tag along with me in every coding story I pick,  I did allow him initially but even if everything was basically done by me he would say in stand-up he contributed to stories. He was just following what I was doing in pretext of learning from me. He was appreciated for working on multiple stories although he did nothing to contribute to my stories.

I told him point blank that I will work on my own stories,  he started to get shady. I mean he was making me feel guilty for what I did by saying things like I only wanted to learn buy upto you if you don't want to whare any knowledge. 

Then recently he asked for my help in two of his stories,  I basically coded 80% of solutions , however in stand up he declared he did everything on his own. He was appreciated again, by the time I could say something it was already late. I resolved to not help him again.

But he asked me again yesterday and I dodged it saying I am busy with work. He pings again and again and I don't know what to do. He is very cunning and I don't want to be on his wrong side,  at the same time I don't want to keep covering his lack of coding skill set when there is a merger and I will go on maternity leave and has less time to prove myself.

1c81hyd,No training at new job,"I’m a relatively experienced professional for my age.
I started a new job in a new, but adjacent,  industry a few months ago- they reached out to me, I quit my job and joined.

As far as technical skills, I’m golden- this job is much less complex than my last one with respect to coding and automation.

However, I was a subject matter expert at my old job, and the new one is a very niche industry where nothing is intuitive. As in, most people don’t even know that this industry exists. 

My boss told me point blank that nobody has time to train me, but is frustrated that I don’t know how to do certain things.

So, I’ve been winging it and asking questions as I go. I study on my own. I review old project files and have made friends with people in other departments & try to use them as resources. However, my questions seem to be an annoyance to my team because they’re a distraction.

It’s a catch-22. They hired me because they’re busy, but they’re too busy to train me to help.

Tl;dr

-Recruited for a job in a niche industry

-Little to no training on obscure information

-People get annoyed when I ask questions

1c7zxnv,"Job didn’t tell me I won awards, feeling underappreciated.","I’m a writer for a small, local company. I started as a summer intern and became a freelancer at the start of this year after graduating university. We entered into an annual contest early this year with work from 2023 that I even helped to compile submissions for from other staff members. The contest is a pretty big state competition for our field so it’s something you never pass up to enter into.

Fast forward to now, I haven’t heard anything about the competition since we submitted in January. However, my manager (who is leaving soon) told me in a secret conversation that I won the only first place award for our company and I won an additional second place award. This wasn’t too surprising because I know I’m good at what I do and I’ve been recognized throughout my life for my writing abilities. What is surprising is that the manager said they found this out weeks ago. The awards ceremony is in 2 weeks where the winners will be publicly announced (for now, the winners are just announced to the companies that had winners). I can’t even try to go on my own at this point because of such short notice.

The manager asked if anyone told me yet, which they didn’t, and said it may have been because the company doesn’t plan to go since the ceremony is an hour away. We’ve had to go an hour out just for work assignments so I’m not sure why it would be a problem now? The company has gone previous years and the ceremony has been in the same place before.

I’m not super pressed to go to the ceremony, but what I don’t like is that I’m not even supposed to know I won and no one has officially told me. The higher ups have definitely been treating me better and I didn’t know why before, but I think this is why. Why not tell me at all? It’s just strange to me.

I feel like this is an amazing accomplishment considering this happened when I was just an intern still in school. My manager gave me encouragement that I could have any job I want and I wanted to stick it out here, but all of this has been making me wonder if this is where I really should be. I feel like I’m not getting the recognition I deserve. I don’t want anything big. I just think someone should tell me that I won something so I won’t be sitting here feeling like my hard work doesn’t mean much and like I’m keeping a secret everyone else already knows. Am I overreacting?

TLDR: I won two awards from a state competition that’s a pretty big honor for my field. No one has told me except my manager who told me in secret, even though the company found out weeks ago (the winners are only announced to the companies directly, then it will be announced publicly at the awards ceremony).

Then one of my good work friends almost got fired on her birthday, but HR and the union stepped in and were like, no and gave her another written warning. For something really stupid mind you. So I have felt really uneasy and walking on egg shells. We are very understaffed and the work load at times is unimaginable. I also really dislike my hours. I was promised better hours, but that never happened. I started applying for new jobs, and was offered one at the local university. 

This job is only in person 2 days a month, so it's much more remote than I currently have. The pay isn't as good, but it's a more professional job title, pension because it's state work, and also normal hours, not nights. I don't want to seem like a job hopper. But, maybe I am. I did have an internship in college which lasted a semester, and I had a few part time jobs throughout college and high school. My longest one was three years. So I don't want to make this a habit. But, also I am young and wanted to try a lot of things. So would I be silly for leaving after 8.5 months?

1c7z56f,got offered a job and panicking about it,"Hi. So a little background about myself:
I finished my BSc (Accounting) in 2020 and worked as an accountant for a couple of months and hated every minute of it. Seeing that there's not much I can do at the time except for accounting-related roles, I decided to apply for an MSc program in International Political Economy. In 2022, I got a full-ride scholarship and had the opportunity to work as an RA for a professor. I loved it a lot and decided that academic research writing especially in political science and public policy were more of my thing. Unfortunately, it's been almost a year now (8 months to be exact) and I still can't find a job in that sector. 

Last month, I decided to try my luck and apply for research agencies doing marketing/business analysis since there were more openings there. I also consciously only applied to the roles which had more qualitative job descriptions on the job posting because I am more inclined on doing qualitative work. 

So, long story short, I managed to advance to the final stage of the recruitment process in one of these agencies. In the final stage, they required me to perform a case study analysis which was very much quantitative. There was a lot data analysis that I had to do within like one weekend. I felt overwhelmed by it that I practically lost sleep over it. It was one of the most draining recruitment process I had been a part of and the least fun I've had working on anything (even compared to accounting)

But I decided to finish it and proceed to the final stage anyway because a) they've made the time to consider me and the least I could do was to show up and respect that, and b) I wanted to challenge myself. During that final stage, I also clarified with the user about the day-to-day role of the job I was applying for and he chuckled and said it's 90% similar to the case study. A lot of data analysis, statistics, and excel. I was like welp okay. I was so relieved once it's over and had hoped I wouldn't have to do it again since I thought I wasn't gonna get it anyway. 

To my surprise, yesterday, I got an offer letter from them. Upon receiving it, instead of being happy, I felt really anxious. So today I got on call with the HR to clarify my doubts and she gave me until the end of this week to make a decision. I'm still pretty much torn between pursuing a career I might potentially hate or giving myself the time to find something that suits me more. I keep thinking what if this is the only company that wants me? and like what if I won't find anything else? but at the same time I'm also dreading working in such role as it's not what I expected when I first applied (the job description is so different than what was required of me in the case study)

I currently have 4 other active applications, all of which are for jobs I for sure will love doing but I'm not sure how any of these will go. is it valid for me to just reject the offer and move on to find other things that suit me more?",Happy-Dependent-7528,2,1.0,2,1713539110,2024-04-19 15:05:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7z56f/got_offered_a_job_and_panicking_about_it/,4,2024

1c7y7y2,Pivoting away from healthcare ? Stressed to the max. ,"I'm 28. I've worked allied health jobs in the hospital for the last 4 years. I've saved up a bit and have no dependents. I've grown to realize that there's a lot about working in healthcare that I really do not enjoy in the slightest, but all my professional experience so far has been in this space. I was feeling weird about getting to the end of my 20s without a ""real career"" so I applied to school and got in. The program would teach me to give anesthesia in the operating room. The role pays very well, 200k for new grads to around 250k with a few years of experience. I'm motivated by money/security to some extent so I applied, also you can get 6-7 weeks of vacation and work 3-4 days a week (shift work) After having gotten in, I'm realizing that maybe the money isn't worth it to me. School hasn't even started yet and I'm consistently waking up feeling anxious and dreading the idea of having people's lives in my hands or possibly making a mistake. It feels bad to pass up the opportunity, but I truly don't see myself being happy working in the operating room and under that much life and death pressure. I feel ""funneled"" into school or an advanced degree in medicine because I don't know how to pivot away. I'm spending my days crawling reddit and researching different careers. So I don't know how to move on or feel happy. It feels ""bad"" to pass up this opportunity, but what else can I do? What should I do. Is there anyone here who can relate and found an escape? Anyone who had a biology degree or some work experience in a field like mine with very little opportunity for remote work who were able to successfully navigate to working from home? My dream is to be able to drink coffee and pet my dog. I know a better life is possible than what I am heading towards, and if I am smart enough to learn to give anesthesia I should be capable enough to find a way to work from home and make decent money, right? Or a non-wfh job that just isn't stressful but still pays a living wage.

1c7xs8m,"Put myself in an awkward situation, interview for a job I don't want, or cancel and wait to see if I get an interview for one I do want?","I applied to a position that sounded somewhat interesting to me, but after my phone screen and really digging into the description/googling this position, I've decided I don't want it. However I had set up an interview with the manager which is scheduled for next Tuesday. 

The same place ended up having a position that I do actually want. Very, very up my alley and I could potentially even leverage some niche experience to help them avoid an expensive contract and do the work in-house, and argue for a higher salary because of that.

When I found the other posting, I emailed the recruiter and told them I think it would be a better fit, and asked if we could discuss further. I hadnt heard back for a few days, so I followed up today and they responded saying that position was not assigned to them, so I should just apply to it and I'll hear back from another recruiter. 

Well that wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't under the same manager that the position I don't want is under. Plus, it took about 3 weeks to get a phone screen for this position and I imagine if it's under a different recruiter it'll take a similar amount of time. 

As I see it, my options are A. Cancel my interview for next Tuesday and cite some reason I don't want that position. I think this would reflect poorly on me for getting this far in the process with a position I don't even want. That's warranted. 

Option B. Go through with the interview and try not to bomb it (it's a position I haven't done, and have little outside experience with). I feel this could also reflect poorly on me and maybe give them a second thought about bringing me in to interview for the other position. 

Option C. If possible, go through with the interview and do well. What happens if I get an offer then decline it before I hear back from the recruiter for the other position? 

Feel like I really set myself up in a dumb situation here. Maybe I'm overthinking it? ",OpportunityFancy3225,1,1.0,3,1713535640,2024-04-19 14:07:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7xs8m/put_myself_in_an_awkward_situation_interview_for/,4,2024
1c7xkhg,I dont think I have any good options. ,"So currently I am getting no satisfaction from my job, I work in a somewhat healthcare related field and I know this might sound bad but I get no fulfillment from it. I spend every day bummed and lamenting the fact I am not doing something more intune with my interests, working in a field I love, spending each day doing something I find meaningful.

The trouble is, everything I am interested in either has no jobs related to it, or any jobs related to it are very low paying jobs.. For instance I love kayaking and being on the water, if I could be a instructor, or work at a paddlesports store or business, I would be so happy, but both of those jobs pay like 15-17$ an hour IF you are lucky. 

Same with all my other interests, music, hiking, biking, running, skateboarding, photography, traveling, cooking.. that kind of stuff. None of them have any stable jobs that guarantee a good income. 

Same with anything else I would be interested in. Bicycle mechanic, low pay. Skate shop employee, low pay. Food industry, low pay. Running coach, low pay. Travel or hiking guide, low pay. Travel photography, my dream job, no guaranteed pay at all. Its like this for everything im interested in.

Now, notice I say interests, not passions. Because I know people who DO work in these fields, and while they seem happy, they all also have a ""I dont care how much money I make as long as I get to do what I love"" attitude. I really admire that thinking but I cant feel the same way. You seem to have to put away the need for money and be happy with the struggle and the fact you get to do what you care about.

As happy as these people seem, alot of work they do is seasonal or contact/ gig work. I personally like to know I have money coming. I dont want to be poor. I want to retire someday, I I like to travel which costs money, and also I have parent with health issues, and I know eventually it will be on me to take care of them. 

So it seems my options are: Keep working at jobs I have no interest in, just so I have money to do the things I enjoy and take care of my life, but be unhappy and not enjoying it. OR: go into a field I would enjoy more, possibly be more fulfilled, but make way less money, so I would also be unhappy.

1c7xgta,Am I being too pushy or overzealous? Did I overdo it?,"Okay so let me give a little backstory/context here. I'm kind of panicking a little, and I need some reassurance. If it matters, I am 40 years old, so...not new to this. But I'm great at overthinking and have anxiety. 

So long story short is that, due to unavoidable circumstances I won't get into, I need work that is part-time and work-from-home. My industry is journalism, which a really tough industry to get into and actually make decent money. 

About a month ago, I stumbled upon a needle in a hatstack - the perfect job opportunity! It was in a local Facebook group of all places. Without revealing too many details, I asked if they were hiring, and they were! It took some persistence, but we eventually arranged a time to talk. I was kinda nervous, but he couldn't have been nicer. After the phone call, he sent me a description of what my responsibilities would be. He said he'd know more in about a week. 

So the timeline of events is as follows:

February 1: We connect via the Facebook group

February 15: We talk on the phone; phone call ended with ""I'll know more in about a week.""

February 16: I get a description of job duties

March 7: I texted him to let him know that I'm still interested. No response.

April 1: I texted him again, wording it differently, to let him know that I'm interested. No response. 

April 15: I texted him again, wording it differently once again, to let him know that I'm still interested. No response. 

April 19: I finally just called him. It rang twice and went to voice mail. He texted me back and said, ""Sorry, I can't talk right now.""

And thats where it ends. Am I being too pushy or inappropriately ""intense"" ? Am I being ""too much""? I feel like I'm being annoying and pestering him, and today's interruption was the final straw. I dont want to ruin this. 

Please note that all texts were sent at different times during business hours. And I am in no way saying that this person did anything wrong. I am suggesting no fault at all on his part. I think I just need to be talked down from the ledge a bit.

Constructive input? Thanks!

1c7x2oe,Struggling to pick i direction. Advice needed.  26m,"Hello, Reddit 

I’ve recently managed to land a job in the Tech industry, it’s an entry-level Help Desk job working at a college in my state. This help desk job is a great opportunity as I would gain experience in tech and it’s a lot of people’s starting points in tech. The company also offers to pay up to 75% of tuition, as well as covering the costs of certs. I personally have no interest in getting a degree as the time I would need to invest in a degree doesn’t garuntee me a job upon completion. 

While I have been trying to get into tech and I finally got my foot in the door, I am having trouble deciding if I see a future in it. Before wanting to get into tech l, I was more so looking at Sales. Sales jobs have always stood out to me for their potential for high incomes. I’ve read of people in sales making more than doctors and lawyers. 

I think about my future and am having a hard time deciding what path I want to go down. Which skills would serve me better in the future? For the things I want in life right now, I need more money and sales just seems to be the way to go, while sales doesn’t seems easy, it seems quite simple. The psychology of sales has always fascinated me. 

So my question is this: Is getting into tech and getting certs basically for free a good path for career growth and money, or if I’m more focused on money, should I go sales? I’m wanting to teach myself skills that will serve me in life, I believe sales is one of them that would be most beneficial.",ConsiderationNo6252,1,1.0,3,1713533771,2024-04-19 13:36:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7x2oe/struggling_to_pick_i_direction_advice_needed_26m/,4,2024
1c7whpv,Support role causing me to fail,"I am in a demanding role that requires an analyst. I can’t figure out if the analyst assigned to me doesn’t know how to do the work or simply doesn’t care. He currently doesn’t have a boss (they’re backfilling that role) and has taken major advantage of that, not coming into the office and taking a ton of time off. The dilemma I’m in is that I’ll give him a simple analyst task and he will tell me he will have it done then he won’t deliver but doesn’t tell me until it’s too late for me to deliver on time. At that point either I have to work later early to get the work done or I don’t deliver it on time. If he does get the work done, the work is usually so bad that I have to redo most of it so it’s truly not saving me time when he does happen to complete a project. 

I’ve mentioned this to my manager a few times (along with others) so he is aware but the person doesn’t roll into my manager. 

Do I continue to try and use this analyst or try and do two roles by myself? Any other recommendations?

I will say I’ve offered help on managing his workload, including creating a tracker for him. When I give him a task now, I’m extremely detailed and offer an example for him to copy. I’ve told him if he needs help understanding any of my asks that I’m always available to chat through it.

1c7v0aq,Career Advice - stress ,"Hi everyone, I am on a major career confidence downfall and the stress has been deteriorating my health. I apologize for the long post ahead. I feel as if I have coding paralysis. 

I enjoy most aspects of my job and I care about the quality of work that I put my name on. I want to continue growing my career with the company. Failure is an unavoidable element of the process that leads to discovery and it should be embraced.

For context, I am the one and only of my position at my company. My only chance to collaborate someone and check my work against with is my manager. 

Last week, we were presenting my findings to a stakeholder and I based the compliance percent off the total population rather than the population we actually had data for. The stakeholder is the one who raised this oversight. By doing this, my findings were off by 12%. I held my composure and admitted into being at fault while my manager had a manic look on their face.

I have been hosting several work sessions with my manager prior to meeting with stakeholders. My main goal for these work sessions is to validate my findings, checks and balances style, so we do not run into these exact scenarios described as above.

After the instance with the stakeholder, I immediately started reworking the compliance percentage and updated the report. I then had a meeting with my manager to discuss the situation 1:1, it went as well as you could expect. 


- It was made evident that I am singular within my role and checks and balances were not to be expected.

- With the collaboration available to me, my work is my own and I own my mistakes. I want to be able to share my thoughts and understand why the analysis should be performed one way or another. A mentorship or teamwork

- With collaboration, I want to be able to compare code, side by side, to help myself grow. My company supposedly fosters continuous improvement but I feel the resources for me are limited. 


So my question for whoever has gotten this far is: What do I do? Who do I reach out to regarding this? How am I supposed to learn when I’m not able to collaborate?

I'm currently in my last year of Spatial/Interior Design. I'm studying part time, 2 papers this semester and 1 final Studio paper next semester. Since I only had one paper, I decided it would be a good idea to start looking for internships or jobs. 

Problem is that there isn't many spaces in the industry where I live. So I impulsively signed up to this company that you pay to help find you an internship. $250 deposit non-refundable. If they cant find a placement within the deadline (feb 2025) they will refund $175 ($75 for trying). If they do find me a placement, I have to pay $750 including deposit. 

  
Now I also recently gained an interest in Jewellery design/making. There's an opening for a full time jewellery design/consultant job that requires zero experience. I feel like I might have a chance to actually get it because the job has been up for months so I'm assuming/hoping that its because not many have applied. I'm also slightly more inclined towards jewellery making.

  
Problem is, if I apply for that job, it would be a huge waste of the $750. There's also the fact that I'm studying part time for a reason. I have ADHD and have been off meds for months now. I think im doing okay-ish but idk, I've had past experience of breakdowns and countless sleepless/tearful nights due to my inability to complete my work. Me feeling okay-ish led me to the rash decision of applying to the internship programme and simultaneously gaining a hyperfixation on jewellery design.  Now, I'm confused and need some sort of guidance. 

If I were to apply and get the job, and then boom I manage to get an internship at the same time. I'd have to chose between the two. I can't just leave a job within a few weeks of being with them, it would be unprofessional I think?

Thanks for having me. I need help RE: career advice. 

My current situation:

At the moment I currently teach ESL/ELICOS. Currently where I’m at, my industry is going through huge changes, no-one feels secure (much more so than usual). So, I’m looking to jump ship. I want to find a role that’s hybrid (WFH some days) & pays at least $65K full-time (I’m in Australia). 

Why this is a bit more difficult than usual:

I’m straddled with a mortgage, fortunately not huge but enough that I can’t just go “ah, I’ll take a day off, it’ll be ok.” So, $65K is the absolute minimum before QoL goes down. I also only studied a BA (International Relations), I also speak Spanish to a B2 level, as well as Italian to an A2/B1 level. Can understand some German, French & Russian too. So, I don’t have a sandstone profession to fall back on. What’s something that I could easily transition into without having to go back to uni that pays well?

What’re my skills?

Due to my previous background in hospitality for many years, I have really strong customer service & social skills. I can take complex concepts (think painful grammar concepts for example) & simplify them easily. I’ve strong analytical & research skills due to my bachelors.

What’re my interests or desired careers?

I really want to get into a role that is people-centred. I love languages, culture & history. I like the idea of being an Intel analyst also, intrigues me but not sure what’s required to be an Intel analyst. I do like the idea of academia also, but even that’s being disrupted here in Australia too so I don’t know if it’s secure or pays well.

Sorry for the Ted talk by text. But, thought I’d save the back & forth in the comments.

1c7ssti,Which is the best opportunity ,"I currently have a L3 in cyber security, should I continue to get certifications such as Cisco or azure or should I take up another career, as I have been considering leaving England to moving to either America or Canada and potentially either becoming a paramedic/law enforcement or become a chef, 

There is a few opportunities but which career makes the most money, has less stress from managers and gives the most free time, 

I want a job where I am doing something and actually working to do something such as making some sort of difference so I can say I have had a real career instead of doing a pointless job that doesn’t benefit me or anyone else, 

I don’t like too much social interaction however I do work quite well doing certain medical procedures and I work well in kitchens, I would go into either smaller town policing or more of a armed unit type law enforcement or possibly safety officer(EMT+Police+fire type job), I am also considering more like forestry type EMT stuff, like where you work as a EMT as a park ranger or whatever so it’s more remote then most jobs, 

I can handle most situations and people quite well I just don’t like office work or anything like customer based so shops or anything

1c7saux,"Help, my boss quiet quit","What should you do when your boss has essentially ""quiet quit""? My boss, ""D"", works remotely and barely puts in 3 hours a week. It's been like this for two years now. Despite her Outlook calendar looking full—since it includes my meetings and those of another direct report— she seldom attends them. 

This other direct report, who has worked with D previously, describes her as having once been an exceptional, hard-working boss. He remains protective of her, and together, we have been covering for D's lack of presence. 

I started covering for D as a respite from my previous boss, ""T"", who was just mean. Under D's remote supervision, I enjoy a lot of freedom in my work, which is a huge plus. If I'm being honest, I also love taking on projects that typically wouldn't be assigned to someone at my level, and I've been acing at them.

However, I'm facing a dilemma. I work very hard and feel that D isn't supporting my career goals because she's so checked out. I generally enjoy the work that I do and don't really want to leave this company. But I'm also growing resentful of the fact that D earns $30k more than I do for essentially nothing, while I'm seriously underpaid for the work that I do. 

To enhance my visibility, I've started visiting headquarters weekly. The CEO now knows me by name, and I often sit near HR. However, I'm unsure how to bring up my situation without seeming like I'm just complaining about my boss or without getting into trouble for covering for D for two years. 

At the same time, I'm somewhat amazed at how long D has managed this. I'm also sympathetic towards her personal challenges, including health issues and family responsibilities.

1c7rdkt,Promotion withheld due to?,"Trying to make this as brief and to the point as possible!

I am an effectively a project manager (actual title is creative ops manager) at a big athletic apparel company. For the past year or so, I’ve been advocating for myself HARD for raises - 1) because I found out I was being grossly underpaid for my role compared to my peers (like $30k less for the same role/title/similar experience) and 2) because I’m awesome at my job and have all the stats/examples to prove it. 

Over the past year-ish I was able to increase my salary as follows -
- $110k
- $120k
- $135k

My manager recently shared exciting news of a “promotion”, to sr. creative ops manager, HOWEVER, I was always coded as a “sr. Manager” on workday behind the scenes. It just wasn’t reflected in my title because my company is weird (yes, I tried to have this updated when I took on this role but they assured me it wasn’t an issue and that when the time comes, I’d be promoted to director). So basically I was expecting a director title, but they “promoted” me to sr. Manager even though i was technically already one. LOL

I’ve spoken with HR about it and she basically said it was due to 1) budget constraints and 2) the team wanting to keep me and grow me, as if they promoted me to director i would have nowhere to go from there (my role is unique so at some point they’ll have a hard time promoting me basically).

I’m super miffed bc I feel like my workplace tried to pull a fast one on me. I work super hard and drive RESULTS for my team! I’ve been advocating for myself for this raise and promotion for over a year…not sure what to do or if it just is what it is. Honestly might just start looking for another job because I certainly feel undervalued and that they’re being cheap with me despite my contributions. Like…just give me the title! Why they playing games with me?!

Any advice? Feel like I just got screwed tbh.

1c7pxri,Choices. Very Delicate Decision can’t decide. ,"Hi everyone,

Without revealing too much about myself, because don’t want to get caught. 

I have a mid level role for my current job. I was lucky , I was able to skip years of working lower roles. However I don’t get paid as well as my colleagues. It infuriates me as I out perform most of them. I work for a very rocky company. The company is always shifting sands, and it always feels like you can get fired anytime. The company is clearly not doing that well financially. It is very apparent this company is young, but that’s the thing, I fear I’m super good at my job, because everyone else doesn’t know what they are doing. In all actuality if management knew, what we do, there are a number of people that shouldn’t have this job. I think I would belong in this category. Or maybe it’s just imposter syndrome’s, who knows.

But anways getting to the point. A well established company might be interested in me. However I fear I wouldn’t survive there. Like it would require me to actually do work. The whole 9 yards, going to an office and performing my job with expertise. 

With my current company we are all just phoning it in. Everyone is chill. Remote work. 

I’m early in my career and I’m not sure. If I should choose going to a role that would be very challenging, but I would learn more and get paid more. Or just staying comfortable at my current job and being a big fish there.

Old school: 
- smaller size, less students, less hierarchy 
- not professional (good and bad, cause it has no structure, things can be chaotic and last minute, but staff often have the freedom to do whatever) 
- I’m kind of in charge of a department, so I have more power in certain things 
- no clear job roles, have to do everything, lots of extra responsibilities
- does not encourage much professional development
- school does things half-assed 
- bad facility, no clear structure for students as well 
- have to work on school holidays 
- annual company trips, bonus and yearly increment 
- love the colleagues and became friends. Easy  going work environment 


New school: 
- bigger school, more prestigious, more professional 
- name of school looks nicer on my resume 
- structured, clear guides 
- higher salary by 8%, but no guaranteed increment and no bonus 
- no work during holidays 
- just focus on my subject of teaching 
- get to learn new things, new ways 

I already travel 50 mins every day to and back to my current workplace. New school will be 5-10 mins further.

I have a job offer as SDR in B2B SaaS. They would pay a €48,000 base salary + a €15k OTE bonus. As a entry-level job, all conditions are perfect. However, this is an expat role for which I would have to move from my home country to the European headquarters of the firm in Dublin.

I personally believe that I would enjoy sales, as I believe that this is where my greatest strengths lie due to my very open minded and communicative personality.

However, coming from a non-Academic household and parents who never dreamed big, I have always been plagued by strong inferiority complexes and imposter syndrome. I compare myself to others a lot and find it really difficult to admit my own strengths and that often makes me insecure, even though I graduated from a top notch business school in my country and gained valuable internship experiences. 

Even now that I have this job offer in front of me, I'm really afraid to accept it, out of fear of failure. This insecurity is slowly but surely eating me up, even though I know that this position is exactly what would help me grow stronger.

I really need urgent advice from you on how I can deal with these thoughts and feelings in the short but also long term, in order to pursue my entry-level job with confidence.

i work in a little wellness/natural food store. we have mostly snacks and some produce, but we mostly have vitamins and supplements and funny little gifts. i have 10 coworkers, but on a work day, there’s only 4/5 of us. some of my coworkers order products from some of the brands we have, they’re in charge of ordering a certain product, but not all of us do that

i’ve always been a cashier. sometimes i put shelf products and help customers, but i mostly am on the register. not all of my coworkers order products

lately they’ve been giving me a lot of tasks to do. my manager asked me to take some picture of products we have, and i did and she really liked them. she asked if i wanted to upload pictures onto the stores instagram and facebook and i was super surprised, but said yes

today one of my coworkers asked if i knew when a nasal spray would be in stock and i said i didn’t know, and she said, “oh but your name is on the ordering list?.” i was confused and said “oh?” and our other manager told me that next month, they were going to have me start ordering product from 5 different brands we have

i told this to one of my old coworkers who was let go, we’re still friends, but she was fired in november. she immediately thought it was suspicious and i already have anxiety in general, so now i just feel a little bit paranoid

they haven’t talked about a pay increase, but i think that’s because im mostly a cashier right now? i get paid $16 an hour, and i still live at home, so it’s not like i need copious amounts of money, but is it bad if im doing all this extra stuff?

i mostly regret telling my old coworker about it because she’s been going on about how suspicious it is. she thinks someone is going to be fired and it just makes me anxious

For reference, I do plan to go back to college and get my Master's degree. This is where I try to get my money up rather than my funny up. I'm not trying to ruin my life with debt before it begins. I was in college at 17 and had no clue what I was doing. I had a full ride, and even managed to get back to that point after being hospitalized during my first round. Now, my SAP appeal would need to indicate significant improvement including a recorded history of stable medication, confirmation from specialists, and financial security. I don't mind the recuperation.  
  
I am at a loss, though. I understand that the job market is rough, that’s not what I’m asking about. I feel like I’m missing an obvious in. With my skill-set, there must be someone *somewhere* who could use me for more than counting inventory and dusting shelves. I feel my mind weakening. I am a naturally curious, academic person. Maybe I’m sick, but nothing could ever stop me from being a nerd. I’m not opposed to work that takes a lot of effort. My main qualms with my current situation are its effects on my sleep disorder and headaches. I have had two seizures on the clock and I just keep going. Since I work with nobody, I go to work *literally no matter what.* So, again, not lazy. I just really need to be suggested some jobs that might suit me better.

1c7kmin,Completely stuck and burnt out in Construction.,"Hey there friends, I really really need some help because i feel like im drowning and just better off giving up.


Im 29M, Live in Melbourne Ive, been in construction since I was 14. Started off labouring, became a Landscaper and worked Landscaping for the past 12 years, pushed and pushed myself to become better and better, changed from Residential to Civil/Infrastructure. Pushed and pushed my way from labourer to leading hand,  got qualified by myself, Ive done everything I can to put myself into a Supervisor position and yet I cant make it there despite some of the support ive had.


I left a relatively comfortable job as a Labourer/Leading hand in 2022 for a chance to push into a full on leading hand supervisor position. (I only left this company because the company didnt want to have a discussion with me about potentially moving onwards and upwards, despite all the praise I recieved)


Little did I know, despite all my research, how bad this other company was. At the same time my father was dying of Cancer and was pretty much hour to hour.
I had to have time off to organise a funeral, grieve and do all the things you need to do when your Dad dies... i came back to a newish job that I poured my heart and soul into and after all of 1week was just fired because i ""wasnt a good fit"" 


I had a breakdown and after 4 months of not being able to get work over Xmas 22, tried to commit Suicide, despite all the counciling I had previously and at the time, I couldnt cope with letting my Wife, Mum and Father down.... I felt like My career was dead and i cant support the people I need to..
I managed to take a chance on a small job, just helping a guy do fencing and small landscape stuff locally....
Its been an ok Job, but underpays given my qualifications and he is looking to sunset the business soon, after just over a year with him, things are just stagnant and agetting worse each day with cashflow and work....


Ive contemplated switching careers, but the paycut is something my wife and I cant afford, yet I need to be making more than the underpaid 73k a year as is...
I dont know if I try to go back to the big build stuff, even just as a labourer in the hopes i can get a small payincrease, or if I try to go back and push to the position Ive tried to be in and thrive in.


How would you approach this situation? Thanks for any help, questions welcome.
Cheers

1c7kk3v,Engineering vs PPE degree,"I've been admitted into the top engineering programs and the top business programs in my country, but I am torn on what do to. One of the programs, which I am leaning towards has a double major element, in which I can earn a business degree and a engineering degree, and I thought this would be a good compromise. And yet, the more and more I think of it, the less and less I am leaning towards this option. I am realizing the reason I loved the bits of engineering that I did was because of their human element- I adored material science because I thought of what innovations could come out of these new materials and help lay down new railways or revolutionize semi-conductors, not because I actually loved lyotropic liquid crystals (snoozefest). I can do good in both my STEM subjects and humanties, but I have a *clear* bias towards subjects like philosophy and history. My history class is notoriously difficult, one of the hardest in the board (to the point at which parents have complained to the school about it being unreasonable) but I was able to get 100% in it, and *actually wanted to do the work, like was gleeful doing the homework, moreso than any other subject.* I watch documentaries for fun and love reading Plato's work. I feel like I am giving up part of myself by choosing to do such an intensive course (if I choose to do any of the engineering courses, in my country it is accredited to the point at which you maybe get 4 electives if you are lucky, and with the dual degree I would get none). I know, that for the entrepreneurial path I want to take, engineering/biz dual makes so much more sense, but I can't shake the feeling of wanting to do a philosophy, politics ad economics degree or history degree with my dual instead of engineering.

I’ve been consistently top performer in my company. Now that my manager gives training for me for leadership task I really dont know if there will be chance that he will promote me since in our company there will be only have promotion if someone left from that position.

i’m currently working as a copywriter for a fashion brand. i have my bachelor's degree in creative writing, have been a copywriter for 5 years, and have been in my current position for 5 months. i am the only copywriter in the company. everything that has words is my responsibility. emails, website, app, push notifications, texts, pitch decks, product pages, web copy, collection names, social media, press releases, thank you notes, invitations…. you get the point. 

the workload unexpectedly bloomed this quarter. i compared last year’s numbers to this year, and the workload has more than tripled. i was hired as a salaried employee, but my company doesn’t like us to work OT because they value a steady work/life balance. but this amount of work is not sustainable long term and if i don’t work OT every day of the week, i won’t meet my deadlines. 

i’m getting push-back on hiring another writer, and at this point, i don’t know what to do. the stress is starting to affect my health and i need something to change. i think that if i were to get a raise i wouldn’t mind working late nights. but i don’t know if it’s too soon to ask for a raise or how i would even go about it. i just feel that if they’re not willing to hire help, a raise would be the best compromise.

1c7ezht,Potential job offer but worried I’m not qualified,"So first off, I have been in the process of a career change from clinical to research work but have not had a lot of success in the current job market. I recently got my first interview for a research job and received a tentative verbal offer pending all my references check out. The job would be an amazing opportunity with good pay, amazing benefits, and the chance to break into the field that I’ve been struggling to reach. 

My biggest problem is probably a combination of imposter syndrome but also realistic concern that I am not qualified for the job. The job requires a fair bit of coding in different data analysis languages. I did not misrepresent my abilities in the interview, in that I did explain that I had no experience with the other 4 coding languages that might be used in the role and had some experience with their main one. The main language they use is one that I’m familiar with and have done a research project with, but I would not consider myself fluent. During the interview, they repeatedly tried to ask in different ways if I might have more experience in the skills they need, and I had to answer truthfully that I didn’t but was a fast learner. I had gotten the impression in the interview that they really liked me, but that I probably would not be a good fit for the role because of my lack of experience. So imagine my surprise that they said I’m one of their top applicants. 

I’m really concerned that maybe they think I know more in this language and the skills and that I am better than I actually am. I am not afraid of hard work to catch up, but realistically it would be a ton of work and might take me a long time to be proficient in the role. I am so worried that I might drown in this role and not improve fast enough for their needs. I think some of this is anxiety, but a lot is a totally realistic estimation of my abilities. Percentage wise, I’m optimistically thinking I might be able to do maybe 50% of the role (or less?). 

What do you think? Should I take the job? And keep in mind, I’m not getting job offers left and right. If I had other options where I felt more confident that I could do the job, then I’d probably consider them. But I don’t, and I really don’t want to drown or disappoint anyone, especially because it’d be my first role in this field. So should I take the job? Is there anything I could ask the supervisor that could help me gain insight into whether I should accept the position?

1c7eo0u,Undocumented PTO Restrictions ,"I submitted a PTO request which was denied based on a rule that is not documented. The vacation has already been paid for, and the company has not yet said whether or not I'll be reimbursed.

The undocumented rule states that, once a month, specific days (Fri + Mon-Wed) are 'blacked out'. Employees are not allowed to request time off during these blackout dates. I imagine the purpose of this is to assure staff is available for financial reporting purposes, but that remains unconfirmed.

Ironically, today is one of those blackout dates and my manager, who denied my vacation request, is currently on PTO.

I've searched the company website, looked at all the bulletin boards, reviewed the handbook, and checked my employment contract. I did not find a single documented reference of this blackout policy, or anything comparable.

I've reached out to HR and we have a meeting scheduled for next week.

Does anyone know if there are laws protecting employees from undisclosed restrictions, specifically those involving their benefits? 

Would it be worth it to talk with an attorney about the inconsistent application of undisclosed rules?",Busy_Leopard_5109,0,0.5,1,1713474447,2024-04-18 21:07:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7eo0u/undocumented_pto_restrictions/,4,2024
1c7emya,Career Upgrade Time?,"TL:DR Current safe stable job at $62k. Unknown new job offering potentially $82k+. What to pick?

To preface, I’ve been with a company for almost 8 years and have received 4 promotions resulting in a $62,000 salary in that time. 

Browsing job today I found a job with almost an identical job description offering a salary range of $82,000 to $102,000. With my current experience in the field I think I would land somewhere in the middle let’s say $92,000. This job is also 30 more minutes away from my current address. 

The conundrum for me is that my current job is extremely stable. I could sit here and soak up a yearly 3-5% raise and continue on until retirement. I also do really like my coworkers. New job would obviously be a huge step up in salary, but I have no idea what the environment is like at the new company (5000 employees, provincial) and it’s further away. 

The distance issue could be mitigated by the fact that I do plan on moving in the next 6 months. 

Is it worth it to throw caution to the wind and just gun for more money? Or does sticking with the stable and safe option make more sense?

I come from a very “pick a job and stick with it for life” sorta family and I find I have a tough time breaking that mold myself. Looking for any sort of advice or comfort!

1c7e9h0,My owner wants me to run his shop but never told me.,"I know this is a very confusing story. Ask questions if you need more information.

I weld at a fabrication shop that caters to the electrical industry and I’m in school for electrical engineering. The owner of the shop is building a new shop and wants me and another guy who is very irritating to run it. He’s very controlling/ adhd which so am I.

So here’s the twist, no one ever told me that the owner wanted me to run it. My owner has a really good relationship with my old welding teacher. When I first got to the job two years ago, I messed up by smoking weed at lunch one day. This is very out of character for me and I was super depressed from having to quit my last job because my old boss was lying to me. 

I basically built a company for my old boss and found out that all of the clients I had acquired had never even spoken to him, so I learned that I did it all by myself. Even after asking him if he spoke to them. So I quit on a whim and my welding teacher got me this job that I’m at now. Anyways, the next day after smoking, I felt very convicted about it so I told the owner when I got to work that morning. I told him I was struggling with some things and I knew that it was wrong and that I accepted whatever consequences came. So he took that to be very alarming and reached out to my welding teacher involving him in this three way love triangle. After the next few days, I started noticing that all of the guys were huuuuuuge dicks to me. Now keep in mind that smoking at lunch isn’t uncommon for the blue collar world. It is for me though. And I also noticed that the owner was working super super hard around me. Harder than normal. He was pushing other people to work harder. Now I’m super intuitive and good at reading people, so I reached out to my welding teacher and asked straight up if my owner wanted me to be a supervisor. My teacher was super vague and didn’t answer a single question without turning it into another question that I had to answer, pretty much. I noticed the next day after that, that the guys were still dicks but also super taken aback. 

I figured out that my teacher were communicating more than I thought. My teacher and I have a really good relationship so I just kept updating him with things about the shop, texting things like this guy did this, because of that, this guy thinks this, etc. Just normal observation things to me. This persisted over the next few months and I started noticing that the guy who is kind of 2nd to the owner but still just a welder was super competitive to me. That’s when I put everything together. My owner told everyone in the shop what I confided in him about, and he also did want me to be a supervisor. He was super excited about my resume and told all the guys that before I started working. 

Fast forward about 6 months. I figured if everyone’s going to just keep talking shit and not tell me anything, I’m just going to do what I originally planned to do when I got there. Work and go back to school. So I told my owner if he would work with my school schedule and he said yes reluctantly. And directly after the conversation, the guy who was competing with me was super pissed at me. Which led me to the next clue, the owner won’t let him run it by himself, he wanted me there to run it with him. The competitive guy is good at what he does in the shop but is kinda a doof and wouldn’t be good at customer flow stuff. Which is what I’m good at. So I tell my teacher I’m coming back to school for engineering and I’m about to apply. A couple days later, I get an automated text from the school saying that my application had been accepted and that I could apply for classes. But here’s the thing, I hadn’t applied yet. So led me to the next clue, my owner and teacher pushed an application through for me. So I texted my teacher asking about it and no responses and everyone in the shop was super taken back for the next few days. Fast forward to school, as intimidated as I was trying to engineering, I’m not only passing, im excelling. Ive only gotten 95 and up in all my classes. 104 on my last test. Throughout the semester, my teacher started relating topics directly to me in front of the class. Some of them were trauma related directly to stuff I’ve been through. That’s when I figured out the next clue, my owner and welding teacher involved my engineering teacher in my whole experience at the shop and also confused personal things I told them. Fast forward to today, I haven given in to any advances of them trying to bait me into doing shit because they won’t tell me what’s going on. I’ve literally asked everyone in the shop, all my teachers, the owner directly what their plans are and no one tells me. It’s all vague responses. Now I’m stubborn, if I’m going to commit to something then I need to think about out it and have all the information. And no one will give it to me so I don’t participate in the game. 

Now I just found out my wife of 13 years is pregnant with our first. And I feeling a sudden pressure to make a choice. Do I go get a night job and hone in on as much school as I can before the baby gets here? Or commit to this mystery thing? It seems like a good opportunity but I don’t like the idea of signing up my future to a bunch of people I don’t know if I can trust.

1c7e8k0,Not sure where to go. Looking for some ideas. 💡 ,"Hello everyone. I currently work as a remote part time contractor for a small agency as a Marketing & Communications Coordinator. Though, the bulk of what I do is transactional media relations coverage (by which I mean I don’t go out and meet the journalists), Podcast Production (scheduling, scripting, research), Social Media Management (I say management cause I don’t really do any campaigns aside from one. It’s mostly idea generation, some graphic design, copywriting, re-posting created content, tracking analytics), I’ve also done some live producing, a little web development & SEO, and administrative work. 

I have some past public relations and social media content creation work from internships. Then administrative work where I did mainly filing but also some event planning. 

I have been using some free time to take some courses on Udemy. Took one on SEO basics, writing, and now Generative AI. 

I’m now doing volunteer work where I’ve been doing market research. Also, now starting to re-design the non profits website. Down the line I may become a co-facilitator of a new support group we are trying to get running. 

I am really unsure where to go from here career wise. I’d like to get a second part time job (doesn’t matter if remote or not). However, I don’t even really know what to apply to. 

TLDR: Need advice on where to go career wise. Also, what jobs I could go after. Thank you to everyone who provides advice. ",HelloHi9999,1,1.0,2,1713473423,2024-04-18 20:50:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7e8k0/not_sure_where_to_go_looking_for_some_ideas/,4,2024

1c7drh1,Manager advice,"


I work as an assistant to a lawyer. I am quite new in this field of law and do not know many things. I have been working at this firm for 6 months.
The lawyer I work for is very direct and expects work to be perfect therefore always reviews my work, and I completely understand as I am still new.
Generally his directness doesn’t really bother me because I still feel respected however the last two weeks, it has really been getting to me and I feel like his directness towards me has started to become less respectful.
I was really proud of learning things by myself but now I’m second guessing because of his comments towards me, and how he approaches me about something that should be done another way. I genuinely feel he is being a bit too harsh especially since I’m new and am still learning these things without help and am trying to best I can, including doing extra hours and always trying to help out with work others can’t do.
How can I approach him about his attitude/tone towards me without creating conflict

TLDR: how to approach a boss on their behaviour towards you

I work in customer service for a chemical manufacturer. We do order entry, order management, and customer communications. 

Our team is currently 7 employees and four managers. This week they fired two people. In December they fired one, before that September, before that July. All reasons were not responding timely to customers (we are overloaded with work and dumb and broken processes) and maybe “not catching on” or something. Also, training is very poor. I learned on the fly mostly on my own. Whenever I would ask management a question they would get rude, snarky, or yell. I’ve witnessed coworkers be scolded and told they are way past learning X and just not catching on. People getting yelled at. Manager yelling at me for asking a question. Manager crying because uppers were yelling at her about order entry metrics (not fast enough). Also, the CEO sends out a report every few months about all the people who got fired and why (globally, and no names just titles).

My team put out a listing with HR to hire a senior level employee, and when they did this--I mentioned to my manager hey--aren't I doing this already? I would like to be considered for a promotion. And I was told in so many words; no, due to the fact that I had not been there long enough and didn't have enough time in my responsibilities to prove consistency. Which I think is kind of BS but whatever. Especially since I got a remarkable performance review and they continue to want to throw new things at me.

Lately I had the idea to submit my resume for this role with a changed name, and also changing the company names but leaving my experience all the same.

1c7bi5k,No degree at 26 and need to get a job. Need advice! Please help.,"Im 26 currently.

History: 

Graduated from highschool and started working for my dad's family freelance web design company out of highschool. I learned a small bit of web design but mostly helped the company out with photos and videos which transitioned me to creating my own wedding photography company. It grew consecutively although hit by covid. Last year was my biggest success and made almost 60k. 


Skills:

Throughout my 20s I self learned multiple computer programs including photoshop, premiere pro, lightroom, bridge, and tiny bit of after effects. 

I developed my own crm in Excel and took on the job of marketing, seo, writing blogs, social media manager, developing contracts, client communications and more.

Problem:

This year i hit a huge rut. Im not getting the leads needed to keep up and it's giving me a reality check that i want something more stable and less physically demanding. I also want a career that has more benefits and security.

I had to move back with my parents and am considering becoming a data analyst. Currently studying for a google certification in data analysis and getting great grades on my quizzes. 

Dilemma:

However i am considering that i will probably have a very difficult road with no degree. Even questioning if this is the field i should pursue as i don't have many transferable computer program skills. However I am self driven, have good communication, detail oriented mindset, ability to solve problems and work within high pressure situations and manage deadlines. 

Advice?

What is the best path for me to take at this point? Find a career with more related and transferable skills like marketing or web design? Or go to college and get an associates or bachelors degree in computer science or business while completing my google certification in data analysis?",smallt0wng1rl,0,0.33000001311302185,6,1713466935,2024-04-18 19:02:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7bi5k/no_degree_at_26_and_need_to_get_a_job_need_advice/,4,2024
1c7b5r7,Switching from white collar to blue collar at 24 years old: need advice,"been working in retail banking for 1.5 years, about to get my bachelors in criminal justice. have thought about being an electrician for two years now..

here are my reasons:

leaving white collar:

- lower ceiling (not allowed to get real estate license, harder to use sales skills outside of the bank without it being a conflict of interest)
- if i went back to school to get an accounting/finance degree, it would take over 2 years + more $
- politics/rules: ive been at my bank for 1.5 years, they like me a lot and i got a promotion, but still cannot get full-time hours and pay my bills (the promotion is nice, but full time would make a huge difference)

doing blue-collar:

- huge entrepreneurial aspirations (can start my own company after years of learning the trade)
- trade school is only 6 months, and from being in college ive made connections to people in unions thru friends, etc
- i come from very low income household, and want to get to the money with whichever route is faster honestly
- have worked unskilled blue-collar jobs before and enjoyed it (moving company, etc)
- blue collar *seems* less political and backstabbing, also seems like there is a way higher ceiling for the money to be made (i know of bankers barely cracking 80k within 10 years, vs electricians being well into 6 figures after 10 years, depending on the situation)

any/all advice would be very much appreciated. i dont wanna end up making the wrong decision. i overthink a lot and making a decision on a career is obviously an important thing

1c7aosz,Take a Pay Cut to switch to Software Dev Job?,"I’m currently working at a marketing company using a specialized Marketing Automation tool. I could continue to spec into that niche and am already making ~80k a year with the chance to jump to $110-140k depending on if I stick with this for another year or two. 

I am about to graduate with an associates in CS in December and would likely have to take a pay cut to roughly $55-65k to stay as a junior dev if I can even land a job. 

Should I just stick with the marketing automation job? Worried the software could become irrelevant and then I’d be out of a job. CS seems like it has better long term opportunities but with a kid on the way I don’t feel like I can afford to take a pay cut. However, I feel like the longer I wait to switch to that career the further behind I’d be.

1c79uza,Overwhelm and Anxiety,"Hi, everyone. 

I've been working at a fortune 100 company for the last 5 years. The majority of my time has been spent in an analytics role, first as a data analyst, and then 2.5 years as an analytics manager.

Currently, I have 1 analyst reporting to me. He spends the majority of his time doing ad hoc data analyses for various stakeholders, as well as building/maintaining dashboards and a little bit of data management. I have been in his role before, so I make a concerted effort not to overload him like has been done to me in the past.

Currently, I have 20+ different items on my plate, ranging from one-off analyses, weekly reports, dashboard development, full scale cross-departmental projects (me as PM), and several projects where I've been tapped as a contributor. These requests come from all over the place, and I keep my boss updated in our weekly meetings and he helps me prioritize.

But honestly I'm just so emotionally and mentally exhausted that I've been fantasizing about just resigning and saying fuck it all, job or no job (I've been applying with no luck). I'm constantly getting my attention pulled in countless different directions and everyone comes to me with their cool ideas and unique problems. I can't think straight, and I definitely can't innovate worth a damn. I feel completely ineffective and my self-esteem is in the trash can. I barely go into the office anymore because my anxiety is so bad and I sometimes start crying at my desk and have to leave anyway (hybrid workplace).

When I bring up my stress and anxiety, my bosses have listened which I appreciate, but then they recommend things like getting my hormones checked or getting on medication (SSRI's, Lorazepam, etc.). One even gave me his copy of ""Rewire Your Brain"". I feel like an utter failure, especially when I know how busy everyone else is also. I don't think I'm a horrible manager, because I was highly successful in managing a 4-person team and helped make millions of dollars for the company. But hiring is off the table atm, and I don't even think a larger team would help with such a broad range of responsibilities, plus a lack of clarity, siloed departments, and little to no cross-system integration. 

For what it's worth, I have been rewarded for my performance. I started at this company making $35K, and now I make $90K and I got some RSU's for being a high performer. I put in my 2-weeks last year for another analyst job at the same pay, but my boss met me for a beer and talked me out of it. I don't only care about money. I want to do a good job. I feel like a POS for even complaining because I make good money and my life is objectively pretty good. 

Does my workplace seem uniquely stressful? Is it me or the company or both? And how do I know whether there are greener pastures or if I'll just feel this way no matter where I go?",MoonIsUpNotDown,0,0.5,3,1713463040,2024-04-18 17:57:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c79uza/overwhelm_and_anxiety/,4,2024

1c794rw,Another manager tried taking credit for my work and tried presenting it to upper management as her own. What should I do about this? ,"I had a big project at work I came up with, executed on, and implemented that was successful and got a lot of great feedback from my supervisor and director. We have a counterpart team that does similar work for a different region that I tried to loop in on the project so we could do it together. They were not interested in participating and were pretty dismissive of it. Now that my director is super supportive of the results, they wanted in and I helped them implement the same project. 

What's driving me crazy is we have some presentations with senior management coming up and the other team's supervisor tried to take my project results and have her team present it as if it was their idea and their work. The only reason this didn't happen is because my coworker thought that was super unethical and has brought me into the presentation to present with them. My supervisor has also left the group, so I'm currently supervisor-less and kind of on my own, which is also why she would have easily gotten away with it. 

So on the one hand, all is well because I get to share my work, but if it hadn't been for a good coworker, her supervisor would have 100% just stolen my work, taken credit for it, and not told me a single thing about it. That rubs me the wrong way big time. These senior managers are the main people that drive promotions and career moves in my org, so it's important to show them what I'm accomplishing.

I feel like I should elevate this, as that seems unethical and creates a toxic work environment, but really not sure if that's practical or how I'd go about it. What would y'all do?

1c78wht,"What to expect for third round interview for state government job?
","I have a third round interview for a state government job where they are expecting someone with computer science expertise to support the state's consumer protection unit. Essentially, I will be helping complete investigations of consumer complaints against companies (specifically related to data privacy and data collection and fraud) and supporting lawyers by doing data analysis and potentially machine learning. To me, it seems to be a mix of cybersecurity investigator, data scientist, and software engineering role, as it sounds like they need someone who understands data security, machine learning, and has the ability to build applications. An example application might be a tool to efficiently drop user data upon receiving an opt-out request from the user. I have all these skills (though my strength is in machine learning and data analysis). I need to figure out how to convince them to hire me and not other candidates. It's all attorneys interviewing me, so they have limited knowledge of advanced topics in computer science so I don't think it's a good idea to simply lecture them on everything I know.

What sort of questions do you think they would ask?

How should I prepare for this interview?

I was considering building a software project to showcase my skills, do you guys have any ideas that would impress them or show that I can do what they need?

No notice, no heads up, no communication. So it hit me hard. It was in my early career years. But that fear that it will happen again. 
Am I being crazy? Should I just apply?
and if I don't get it, how should I proceed working there? It will hurt I'm sure if I get that wonderful rejection email. But I know I am under qualified and still learning, as each year something changes. Is trying to grow in the same company even worth it?

1c78cor,Don't know what to do Next ,"Hello All,

I am currently feeling like I am in a rut and don't know what to do next with my career. 

Below are the spark notes of my career path:

- At 17 I began working at a machine shop after having a few teenage jobs(i.e dunkin donuts)
- 19 I moved to CA and was going to CC and was hired as a machine operator In a more digitally advanced company so less manual operation and additional computer work. The company was on the smaller side about 300 or so people 
- while working in this machine operator position I quickly realized I had a work ethic far beyond my peers and knack for continous improvement and efficiency 
- At 20 or so the few skills I had were noticed and I was promoted to a lead of shift and worked on ensuring everyone was doing their job and watching small metrics 
-At 21/22 I was promoted to supervisor of Operations and the salary started at about 50k + bonus. I was worked on many improvement projects which some saved hundred of thousands of dollars and creates real efficiency changes 
- I was given multiple departments by 23/24 still as a supervisor but was given a 20k+ raise and continued to do well
- Then at 25 I was promoted to manager with a brand new department at about 90k + Bonus and the department as a whole was a bit of a rocky start but we eventually got things smoothed over 
- At 26.5 I decided to move back to NJ to be with Family and landed a Job as a Manager without no direct reports doing more technical workwith a fortune 10 company at a salary of 110k+ Bonus and I have done well here. I was given an award for my contributions that only a handful of people receive out of the 10's of thousands of employees 

Overall I feel like I have built a decent track record and acquired many skill soft and hard. I am a solid solid people Manager and have recently elevated my technical skills being  an excel expert, now Power BI and power automate amongst many other tools and applications. Also a six simga black belt. Only an associated degree. 

I just am beginning to feel lost on what my next step should be with my skills set. I don't know if I want to go back into people management as I like to work projects and problem solve.

My goal is to be closer to the 150K+ bonus range.

Any recommendations would be appreciated and apologies for any pitfalls in this message. I typed it out on my phone while eating lunch.

1c78c7l,UK Media Student Seeking Career Path in US Basketball Sports Media – Advice Needed,"Hey, I am a second-year university student in the UK, now approaching my third and final year. I study Media Production, and as I begin to wrap up my second year over the next couple of weeks, I have started to deeply consider the career path that I would like to follow once I have completed my studies.  
  
I was always into video editing and photography as a child. Photography was something I enjoyed; however, I always saw it as a fun hobby. It was video editing where I really thrived. I became a content creator and produced hundreds of videos over the years, which helped me improve my editing skills significantly. Building myself up from using iMovie to now using Premiere Pro, I have developed a whole load of skills. These skills I now implement into different video projects for my uni degree, and I also develop various adverts and information videos for companies based in the UK.  
  
I understand that in the media industry, experience is everything. That means I need to build a portfolio, which I have slowly been doing over the years. Recently, I have been focusing on making my portfolio larger, as conveying more experience will be beneficial.  
  
I never really enjoyed sports as a child, but a few years ago, I started watching basketball (NBA), and I absolutely fell in love. I don't know what it is, but something about the sport really clicked and resonated with me. For a long time, I had absolutely no idea what I would do after university. However, I feel as if I have recently discovered my passion, which is sports media. I recently picked up my camera again and am now the sports photographer for the local basketball league and my university team.  
  
Now, for the real reason that I am here. I came here to seek advice. As someone who was born and raised in the UK, basketball is a sport we do not care for or love like we do football. I know that basketball is huge in the US, from high school to college, and then professionally. So, how would someone who loves basketball (particularly its presence in the US) go about seeking a career in basketball sports media when living in the UK? I would love the opportunity to work and live in the US, but where do I start? Yes, I have experience, and I am trying to build up as much as I can before finishing university. But ultimately, the experience I have surely can't be enough for me to just finish university, pick up my things, and move to the US, as that's not how it works.  
  
Does anyone have any thoughts on where I could go from here? How could I start my career? I don't want to spend my life in a job I do not care about or have love for. The opportunity to work in another country (the US in particular) would be amazing, as I really don't see myself living and growing old in the UK. Especially when the things I have a passion for (media and basketball) have a much larger presence in a country I don't even live in, or have a visa to do so.  
  
Any help is appreciated. Thank you for reading, wherever you are in the world.",lukecraig,1,1.0,0,1713459356,2024-04-18 16:55:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c78c7l/uk_media_student_seeking_career_path_in_us/,4,2024

I would be done with school by the time I am 27 years old and can make $75,000-$95,000/year.

Option 2:
Get a Master’s Degree to become a Nurse Practitioner. 
I would want to specialize in Women’s Health or Neonatal care. I can still work a full time job during this program and the classes can be taken online. I have been hearing that Nurse Practitioners are possibly becoming over-saturated and have problems finding jobs. Don’t know if there’s any truth with that. 
I would be done with school by the time I am 29 years old and can make $125,000-$160,000/year. 

Working a few overtime shifts in option 1 could earn 6 figures a year. Is an extra two years of time and debt in school worth an extra $20,000 annually?

Now for the curveballs. 
Over the past year, I discovered the realm of anesthesia and have been obsessed!

Option 3:
Get a Master’s Degree as a Certified Anesthesiologist Assistant (CAA). 
I would really love to do this, but there are so many obstacles. You cannot work a job while in this 2-year program. The closest programs to me are 1.5-2 hours away, and have to be done in person, so we would either have to sell our house and move into an apartment (meaning my boyfriend would have to quit his job and find one near my school), or I’d commute to class everyday. These programs are extremely hard to get into (5% admission rate). I would need to spend 6-12 months on prerequisites, shadowing hours, and have a GRE test before even applying. I could be halfway done with a Master’s as a Nurse Practitioner before I even applied to this program and may not even be accepted. 
I would be done with school by the time I am 30-31 years old and make $250,000-$300,000/year.

Option 4:
Get a Doctoral Degree as a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA). 
This option earns the same amount as option 3, but with one extra year of school, an extra 100k in student loan debt, and a lot harder coursework. Just like option 3, I would need many shadowing hours, prerequisites, and a high GRE score before applying. It is the same 5% admission rate and you cannot work while in school. Meaning, I would not be able to work for 3 years. However, there is a program where I live, so if accepted, commute won’t be an issue, my boyfriend wouldn’t need to quit his job, and we wouldn’t need to move.
I would be done with school by the time I am 31-32 years old and make $250,000-$300,000/year. 
(I’ve seen contracts upwards of $400,000-500,000/yr as 1099 CRNAs)

My boyfriend and I are financially comfortable. We pay a mortgage, two car payments, and all the other fun bills. He does not work remotely, so it would not be easy for us to move and it would be unfair if I made him quit his job to move 2 hours away to follow my dreams. Long-distance wouldn’t really be an option for us either. I have money saved up and my boyfriend could pay majority of bills, so I could be okay not working for a couple years. Is a daily 3-4 hr commute for two years crazy? My nursing program was 1 hr away, so my commute was 2 hrs 4-5x/ week. 

Ugh. I don’t want to have any regrets in the future or to wish I would’ve done things differently. 

Does anyone have any insight?

I would love option 3 because for pretty much the same amount of school as option 2, I’d earn double annually. But the logistics for option 3 are making it extremely difficult. 

Comparing options 3 & 4, the title of being called an assistant vs a doctor is not a determining factor. They earn the same annually so I don’t care about that. Option 4 seems like a lot of work and sacrifice but I think it would be worth it.

Do I put having a family on hold for another 6-7 years when we kind of want to start sooner?

I have been applying for entry level/graduate schemes in Finance and Investments for around a year with no luck but have reached a few assessment centres.

I feel like my grade is holding me back (2:2), and I probably should’ve done a masters right after I finished graduating but I wasn’t sure on what I wanted to do.

So 2 years after, should I still consider to do a masters or keep applying and get my foot in the door somehow?

1c76tgh,(20M) What opportunities or career paths can I take with my current experiences?,"I am a sophomore Finance major at a large east coast state school. I recently landed my first internship at a large e-commerce platform (BigCommerce), as an operations/strategy analysis intern. I honestly think I got pretty lucky, as this was my only offer after applying to 80+ internships. I will be working directly with the COO which I think is great for my resume. The internship is remote but pays well.  
What kind of future opportunities should I apply for? Should I give up on the Finance route and try to go into operations? Should I apply for more tech companies because of this experience? Will I still be able to get an internship within Finance next summer? I am genuinely interested in what I will be doing this summer but don't want to get stuck somewhere with lower growth potential.

I’ve had such a passion for law enforcement and the type of work. 

However, a couple of years ago I had two unjust and traumatic incidents occur in the space of 6 months as a result of poor management and no support from the organisation. I never was charged or accused of any wrongdoing as a result of the incidents just management hid and threw me under the bus. 

A few targeted incidents occurred by management as a result of me standing up for myself as a result of those two incidents which occurred. 

I left the department where it all began to another area but it followed me to a certain point. 

As a result, I suffered in many ways but mostly my mental health deteriorated as I was hanging on to the career I had a passion for. 

I am contemplating leaving due to my mental health taking a massive blow and lack of support.

1c74uvl,Burnt tf out on corporate,"My last three jobs (7 years total) went like this:

Job 1: $100k TC, was great until a reorganization put me with a terrible toxic boss who literally yelled at me on team meninges weekly. It was so bad that I quit without another job lined up. This was a $500b company for point of reference.

Job 2: $140k TC, interviews were great but the actual job was chaos from the start.  I got moved from team to team until my last boss, an old vice president, would send me long emails telling me everything I was doing wrong while I was playing a juggling act. Laid off shortly after. 

Job 3: $180k TC, things started out great until a few months in when two people from my team quit due to being overwhelmed with too much work, so instead of replacing them they put the entire workload of those two on me. Six months later fired me for not getting the work of three people done. I felt royally gaslighted and out of breath. Wound up in therapy for the first time in my life due to the stress of this job. 

I gave 50-60 hours a week to these jobs. I covered my ass every step of the way. I did my best work. But it feels like that either wasn't enough or wasn't what I needed to be doing. When you are good at what you do and are glued to a screen all day and still have a mountain of work that's all mission critical, feels like drowning. 8-10 video meetings per week. Nights and weekends owned by the job. No family time. No exercise time. Anxiety through the roof. Then you still get fired because you're not good enough. 

Not to mention when people who were basically largely incompetent doormats keep their jobs and had worked at these companies for 5-10 years. I'm over here shaking my head. 

Feels like a common trend that the more I put in, the quicker things go south. 

Am I missing the mark here or have I just been working for the wrong types of companies? Or just unlucky?

I can own up to mistakes. Under an immense work load and stress, nobody is 100% perfect on every word, every task, every email, every decision. But I've worked for good bosses in the past and can't help but feel like leadership naming me as a weak link is a cop out.

Do I need to learn how to play the game? Am I wrong to think that I should actually work hard? Is hard work not enough? I know that I'm good at what I do. I have an amazing resume. I have the degrees. I build my network. But I'm so damn tired of this. 

Current status is sitting on the couch watching cooking shows and reading reddit. Sent 200 applications out last month, got 4 interviews, 3 rejections and one ghosted. Considering working as a clown at kid parties.

TL;DR Corporate slave burned out, ranting, losing hope.

1c73dyt,Is escaping from IT to medicine at 25 sensible? (Europe),"I'm a 24 y.o. software developer. Currently laid off. Medicine started to fascinate me since I entered university (I have master's in computer science). I feel like I'm lacking a sense of purpose in IT, on top of that I'm terrified how quickly IT industry is changing. There may or not be programmers in 10-20 years. Medicine changes as well but I think doctors will always be there, just have better tools and knowledge. I love the idea of helping people out with very specialistic medical knowledge. 

I'm not doing this for money. Financially this path is not worth it. For 6 years I'll be with no income, maybe even will need a student loan for daily expenses. During intern year and residency I'll make pennies. Good money will come after residency which would be around 36-37 y.o. for me.

If I retake my high school final exams and do well, I could enter a medical university in fall of 2025. No tuition fee in my country, just need to support myself, I'm lucky to live in a relatively large city with a medical university so I can stay with my parents. Medical university here takes 6 years, then intern year, then residency anywhere from 4 to 10 years.

Two biggest issues I have with this plan is starting a family and my health. I have muscular dystrophy in one of my thighs. I can walk but I can't run. Doctors have no clue what caused that. I'm a bit scared what if it gets worse and I can't stand for long periods of time in the future. This would disable me from choosing specialties that do surgeries (surgery, obgyn, urology, interventional radiology) but there are specialities such as pediatrics, dermatology, family medicine I could do.

When it comes to having a family, I'd like to have 3 kids. I'm single now. Assuming I'd have a partner when graduating, I could start trying for a baby around 32.

I stopped that last year due to not having a reliable vehicle anymore, so I stayed at home and my husband worked. I do not have a degree or any experience other than delivery services. I know this is probably asking for a miracle, but I would prefer a work from home job if at all possible due to my mental health disabilities. I once took a typing test for a temp agency and they said I was excellent at that, if it helps. I am willing to take any online classes or courses to help with skills I would possibly need. I just don’t know where to go from here.

1c72x4f,Any advice on getting into the Cybersecurity industry? ,"I’ve been looking into cybersecurity for a while now but haven’t taken the plunge yet. In my area, I see most jobs will require a degree plus certifications. My current employer offers an apprenticeship with no degree required but unfortunately it’s only open to external applicants. I have most of my basic college courses knocked out already (from an earlier attempted degree), so if I did start classes again it wouldn’t take as long. 

My main concern is the learning curve. How complex can the work be? I am fairly decent with computers, and I’m also a fast learner. I am considering this field because I’m tired of doing manual labor jobs as I don’t feel appreciated or properly compensated for my work. I have heard there are a decent amount of remote work options in this field as well, which I would be very open to, although in office jobs wouldn’t be bad either.

I already finished training and while it is an easy position I am seeing no room for growth. The pros are that the commute is about 5 minutes from my home, and like I said it is very easy and stress free. The offer I received is for a career path that I see myself in with a growing company and a lot of benefits. However I could see it being a little more challenging. They are also offering at least $250 more a week plus incentives…also company retreats, PTO and the whole 9. The commute is a 20+ minute commute, but in a city I really enjoy with a lot of stuff to do nearby, while the office im in now is very depressing and dull honestly. Parents say I should play it safe because it’s easy and stress free, but I could really use the money. Also I feel bad that I already started this position and if I accept this offer, I would have to leave them kind of high and dry.

1c7215m,Hannaford Sucks,"Hi all-
Trying to find like-minded Hannaford workers who are sick of being overworked, understaffed and underpaid.

In my store, hours are being drastically cut, wages are super low, yet they continue adding more to the store. The current workload is already not getting done, yet they keep asking us to do more without going over hours, which is impossible. 

Equipment is constantly broken AND being used while broken, which is a health violation. Our deli is closed randomly because they refuse to hire the staff to run it full time. It's also pretty dirty at my location because they refuse to hire enough maintenance crew. Shelves aren't stocked, loads aren't worked, old/gross product is on the sales floor. The employees are suffering, morale is at an all time low. 

Me and my bosses have spoken to management dozens of times about hiring more help, paying the workers we have more because they're expecting more work from us, and fixing the broken equipment, but they just ""yes us to death"" and never fix or change anything.

We're sick of it. 
Is anyone else experiencing these issues at a Hannaford ? ",ApprehensiveNorth33,0,0.5,0,1713443114,2024-04-18 12:25:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c7215m/hannaford_sucks/,4,2024
1c71znm,Looking for University Choice Advice,"I want to ask for help in choosing between accepted universities for a BSc in Computer Science. 

CONTEXT:

I applied in US, Egypt, UK and Canada and I'm currently studying British Curriculum. Listed below are my top choices in each:

For UK I got Manchester with a year in industry, with fees around 30k sterling

For Canada I got McMaster (30k CAD w/research funding scholarship) and UofT (60k CAD)

I also got Egypt's AUC, whose fees are negligible compared to the others at around 15kUSD

For US I also got ASU and Minnesota Twin Cities, but im not too sure about their quality compared to Manchester, let me know if they are better options than what im thinking.



I really want to go to Toronto because its top-tier but I'm worried about the financial situation if I do, as ill be living on a tiny budget and my family will have to sacrifice quite a lot. If I still want to go into Canada I have McMaster which is a middle ground or Manchester (which is still really good) in the UK. Lastly, I can live comfortably with family an easy flight away if I go to AUC in Egypt.



My question is:      
  
Is it worth spending 60kCAD/year to go to UofT for a Bachelor's? Because the alternative to go to AUC without losing my family's savings and then go to Canada for a Master's later on. I can also go to UK for bachelor's as another middle ground between Canada and Egypt. My reasoning behind this is that employers dont care about what uni you went to anymore and more about what you did after or during uni. (any employers, let me know if this is accurate)  
  
Another question:  How difficult is it to be accepted into a computer science-related master's program for an outside student at unis like UofT?",ThinkTrick,1,1.0,0,1713442981,2024-04-18 12:23:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c71znm/looking_for_university_choice_advice/,4,2024
1c71qfe,Do I stay at my job or is it time to go?,"I just graduated college about a year ago and I work at a very small local business that is beloved by my town as an office manager. I’ve been there for 8 months. When I first started I was so excited to be a part of something so amazing, and while my ultimate dream is to run my own business, I didn’t mind the thought of doing this for a couple years to pay off my student loans.

The problem is my position has become so stressful. I answer to 3 different bosses in multiple departments. One of them, we’ll call him B, has completely given me his entire job to do and doesn’t ever help me when I ask a question. The other, “M”, micromanages me and is constantly on my case about things that do not matter (aka coworkers leaving dishes in the sink for a couple hours). The third, “E” is not so bad.

I have been completely overwhelmed since I started as they have just pushed every task they didn’t want to do onto me. I answer phones, I greet guests, I make sure the conference room is ready for whatever meetings are coming up, I’m now in charge of ALL billing (which was a mess from the previous people) and have not been trained on the system and have no idea what I’m doing most of the time. I handle a lot of other things that I’m not gonna mention because it will make it clear what type of business this is and there are not many left. Trying to stay anonymous in case.

On top of this the entire office is extremely toxic. The second someone leaves a room they start talking crap, doesn’t matter who it is. 

Last week I was so overwhelmed I couldn’t stop crying so I finished my most urgent tasks, calmed myself down, then asked to go home because I wasn’t feeling well. My boss, B, said it was fine and asked if I was ok, which is when I started crying again. He said I could go and I did, but I came back the next day and continued to overwork myself without complaint, and that same boss even gave me multiple extra tasks, which I thought was because he’s clueless but it I have since learned he’s just mean.

Turns out when I left he told the whole office that I flipped out on him and I’m a difficult employee. I have never complained once, I do everything he asks me well while balancing the millions of tasks from my other bosses. I don’t understand why he did that.

I had pretty much decided it was time for me to go. I’ve been running a small social media/ graphic design business on the side with a partner for about a year now. We are not making enough money to support ourselves yet, but it is growing and we see the potential. I was hesitant considering I won’t be making any money for a while and my business partner will be out of state for 4 months in the Fall. Before I fully decided, my coworker quit. Her supervisor wants me to move into her position (not a promotion, I would actually have to fight to keep my current pay), which would mean I am out from under my 3 bosses and work for this new supervisor, who seems really great. She knows how my bosses are and thinks I’d do a good job.

What I WANT to do is take the risk and run my business. I have a part time job lined up in case and I have a mother business idea I’d love to see through. However, I don’t want to completely ruin my career and my life because I didn’t stay. But I really don’t any to stay because of how toxic and insane everything is at this place.

Sorry this is so long, I’m just struggling with this decision so much and there are so many factors playing into it.

Apparently most employees there don’t have a physical contract. However, I requested to see one.  
In my sector, noncompetes are common. They are specifying a 3 yr non compete with a large radius across all their multiple locations which would essentially make me have to move out of the metropolitan city to find a new job if I were to quit. I know noncompetes are rarely enforceable but I would still be the dummy to sign the contract anyway. 

Ive also tried to negotiate the contract and it does not seem like the non compete is up for negotiation. 

Also going off of straight vibes, I also wanted to add that our interview was late at night due to our sector’s busy work hours (9-5 job) and I was kept there until 2 AM in the morning which I thought was rather unusual. What do we all think about this?

1c6whut,Changing the company I'm working for or not?,"Hello everybody, I don't know if this is the right place but I'll go ahead.

I'm working for a big company and I'm not happy there. The work itself often is a lot. You have to do this and this although it normally isn't your duty. I'm getting paid for one job but I'm almost doing 2 or 3 and it's not even safe. The company says ""occupational safety is the most important thing"" but if you do work there for about a week you'd see what I mean. At the end of the day nobody cares how you do your job, just do it. The management just want to see numbers and that's all they care about. There's a lot of things going wrong. 

Furthermore my colleagues are in a bad mood every single day. No, really.. every day. I've never seen people with such hard mood changes. This isn't normal and it effects me hard. I mean.. I see them and I spend time with them more often than I do with my family. They're also done with the things going on in the company. But they kept going the same thing for years and I don't want to be like them. There's no staying together. It's like a one vs. all. They talk behind somebodys back, giving strange looks and being disrespectul. My mind is telling me everyday I can't do this anymore, I don't want to go to work.

But here's the thing. I'm doing a further education besides working which takes 4 years. I'm about to finish the second year this summer. So.. still two more years to go. I know that changing a company makes sense, when there's a change of position possible. My original plan was to stay in this company I'm currently in until I finish my further education so I can apply somewhere else for a higher position. But like I said.. I'm not sure if I can take this two more years. But I also don't know if it makes sense to apply somwhere else for the same job I'm doing right now just to work there for two years. I have to learn how things work in the new company and I also don't know if it will change to the better. I don't know which people will be my new colleagues. 

What do you think? Should I stay for two more years and just swallow the pill and or should I look for a change? I'm really not sure what to do.

Me and my friend are foreigners but we live in USA. She was living in another state and decided to move to mine, ok.
I knew she had no money at that time and no drivers license (she has the international one) so I offered her to rent my car for 3 weeks and she did.
After that, I told her that I would sell my car and she showed interest, so I told her I know you don’t have money you can pay me $500 a month.
So I sold my Toyota Camry 1999, 100 k miles for 2.800, $500 a week.
I told her she would have to change the battery soon which she didn’t, she was jumping the car all the time and it damaged the alternator.
She also got in an accident and destroy the side mirror.
Now she is blaming me for never doing the maintenance and also said the oil is due. I told her “when you buy a car you buy as it is and you check everything and fix everything”.
She has only paid me $1000 so it’s missing $1800.
She says the car is too expensive for what is is and that I should make her a discount for the expenses that happened.
I told her that I would receive my car back and give her $1000 dollars, the next day she texted me and said she brought it to a mechanic and spend around $800 and I have to pay that if I want the car back, which wasn’t our agreement the day before.
Anyway, besides everything, the car still in my name, the insurance as well and she is telling our other friends that I sold a car with problems to her.

1c6vhj9,"Do employers care about leaving a prior job quickly? (unskilled, not career work)","I am sure this has been asked before but I couldn't find a thread that fit my question.

I do not have a career yet, I am still trying to figure it out. In the meantime I am just working a general ""labor"" job at a smaller business. I've had 3 jobs before this, the first two in HS about 5-6 months each, and another where I left after less than 3 weeks due to severe scheduling problems and having to talk to HR about my boss, so I keep that off my resume. I had been unemployed for a while but in the past week got a job. It is very different from what I was expecting and was told, and while it normally takes quite a while for me to dislike a job, I dreaded going back after the first day. Frankly I want to search for another job and same-day quit from this one once I have the other one secured. I would probably keep this off my resume, but would future employers care about this? If this was a career field I would stay longer but this is a job a 16 year old could do. 

And aside from the 3rd job (where HR offered me a form saying I would quit but not sue or anything), I normally leave a 2 weeks notice, just cause my bosses have generally been nice as well as the jobs, but I really don't want to deal with 2 weeks of ""so you're leaving huh?"" from everyone and probably catching shit from my boss.

1c6u6f9,"I relocated to a higher COL area for a new job, and 9 months later the offices (not the company) are closing. How can I ask for relocation assistance to move back?","I accepted a new job offer that required me to relocate to a new, higher cost of living area. I asked for relocation assistance and they said no. I still took the job and moved on my savings. 

My new city is a higher cost of living, and the housing I found is at the top of my budget and is adequate for working from offices— not working from home. On my salary, I cannot afford a place in which working from home would be tolerable. And those are also not the circumstances I agreed to move for.

I worked from offices for 9 months. After that, we found out the company’s offices are closing and I “get” to work fully remotely. The offices are closing because the company failed to deliver on a certain huge partnership— there was fault here, it wasn’t because of external stuff. My job is intact though.

Now I’m stuck having paid to live in an area more expensive than I want, in housing that’s not appropriate for WFH, and at a salary at which I cannot afford more. My current housing is also going to increase rent, which adds stress.

I’m in a position of needing to move from my current place either way. I want to move back where I came from. Even if I stayed in the city, I’d need to move locally to try to find some other situation. The costs would be about $1000 for a local move, or $4000 to move back. This is all I’ve been able to save on my salary in this area in 9 months, after financing my first move myself. I’m going to have to clear my savings to move again. 

What the hell can I do??

I’m really pissed. I want to leave now, and I’m working my ass off to find something new but am not getting interviews right now despite tailored resumes and cover letters and what I think are very compelling applications (with referrals!). My field is having layoffs and people aren’t hiring.

Until then, how can I ask this company to please help me out here, considering the situation?? This isn’t what I signed up for at all.

1c6s1c3,Approached by another team to apply for vacant role internally - what should be my next steps?,"Recently got approached by another team member that I sometimes work with mentioning that there are two vacant roles in their team and that I should take a look at it and reach out to him and his manager (that is hiring) if its in my career path. I have cross paths with this manager before since I do work with his team frequently. 

Role is something I would be interested in and very similar to what I do but more strategy focused - now the reason why the person that sent me the role did mention this to me is because I am a pretty high performer and people usaully do come to me (even though I'm not a senior yet) and trusts my work and what I do (from what he mentioned). I have been having discussions with my own manager to push me to the next level and he also knows that its deserved but don't think it will be for another couple months (I'm thinking end of summer). The role that the other team sent me makes around 15k - 30k more (plus more bonus) than what I currently make and would be a senior role, and if I do stay in my current role and do get promoted I should expect a 10k to 15k increase. 

&#x200B;

So the benefit of switching would be more learnings and a bigger pay increase earlier in my career. The person who let me know about the role let me know to first reach out to him and his manager to disucss and then internally apply. But how do I go with this with my manager? Should I tell him in my next 1:1? Or should I first talk to the team member and prospective manager first and then apply? 

&#x200B;

Don't want to burn bridges with my own team and manager, and want to be flexible as much as possible. Any thoughts would be great!

1c6ry0c,Im think i should quit ,"Help! My job isn’t paying fairly

I’ve been working 8 yrs at a private school where I live. I will be giving out all the information about what I earn so bare with me. It’s very little but that’s what teachers get paid where I live. My starting salary with a MD and 2 yrs of experience was 23,500. Every other year we get a 3-4% cost of living “raise” and are expected to get a “significant” raise when we reach the 5-10-15 years marks. By significant I mean stupid because it’s about 1k or 2k. 

I’ve been there 8 years and just now I reached 30k. I struggle with this because I know how smart I am, I know I can leave at any moment and actually work in what I studied instead of this but I’ve already been there 8 years and my child starts school there this fall. This school’s PK costs 14k. There’s no way I could afford it. I’ve stayed there because of the “free” school benefit, although I will pay about 2k a year. 

Just yesterday I found out that a person in my same position started last year and will be getting payed 28k 2024-2025. This person has no MD and no years of experience. Also, this year the school raised its staff members’ salary by 2k —— BUT ONLY staff members that were below the 25k salary. Which means that people with less experience who just arrived at the school are now earning the same as me. 

What should I do? Like, how am I as an employee that’s been loyal supposed to feel valued? My work bestie came in at the same time I did, same years of experience, same Masters Degree, same position and we’ve both been getting the same % of raises since. So at least I know it’s not just me. There’s no employee evaluation at this school either. They literally keep paying more to the new staff so they catch up to us but then there’s no advantage to actually being there for so long.

1c6rqdb,Fix it or Leave it ,"Hello everyone,

I’m facing a tricky situation at work and could really use some advice from the community. 

Recently, the head of another department has started working part-time in sales, gaining access to my leads, deals, and even reaching out to clients I’m actively engaged with, getting into communication at expos with the leads I am talking with and handing them his business cards. Despite my concerns, the CEO seems oblivious or protective of his actions, claiming that this dude has no bad intentions. 

However I don’t have any access to his work and I find out only late when he closes my clients or get them to talk to him, as he is a C-level leads are more likely to talk to him plus I never wanted to make a scene or drama and that will probably make this talk even harder.

This individual has been aggressive and non-collaborative, even going as far as contacting owners/investors to criticize my work and experience even though I was actually working directly under the investors guidance. 

I’ve been with this tech firm for over 5 years, bringing in a significant portion of our clients and revenue. However, the lack of clear boundaries or support from management is taking a toll on my motivation and performance, leading to burnout. I was before basically the only sales guy covering inboud/outbound and full sales cycle. 

Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you handle it while maintaining professionalism and your well-being? I’m torn between confronting the issue directly or considering other options, like leaving the company with no plan B. Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

I ll try to schedule a call with CEO tomorrow as investors also gave me the green light to fight for my self but don’t want to do anything about it.

1c6rd9x,"Coworker got fired after 1 week, was it fair?","I work in customer service. Our company and especially department seems to have high turnover. We have about ten employees who are CSRs and enter orders for four different business units, and then one assistant who manages the group email addresses by forwarding emails from the group box to specific CSRs to handle since we don’t all have access to the boxes. And the assistant will reply to basic questions as well.

The recently moved our whole department across state lines to an office in the shipping warehouse, but the assistant still has to sit at the receptionist desk in the prior office in another state.

They hired a temp to fill the role, I think they got a bit of training shadowing the previous assistant. Then, the previous assistant moved to the new office leaving the assistant to be the receptionist and forward the emails.

Turns out, the assistant was given access to view emails in the boxes, but not forward. So, they ended up getting a ton of undeliverable bounce back messages, but apparently ignored them, and just filed the emails all away into specific folders with CSR names on them, thinking the emails were going to us still. 

Management found out and the next day the new assistant was fired. Now our department is rotating CSRs to cover the front desk in the other state until we find someone else. I was the first one to cover today, and everyone in the office was asking me where the new assistant was. I had to say no longer with the company.

1c6psje,How to explain why I left? ,"I was with a company for 8 months where they created the role for me without my direct’s manager knowledge (I did not know this). This made our relationship rocky but eventually we teamed up - Had a pretty awesome couple of months, my presence really brought everything together and we were killing it. 

Fast forward now, the person who hired me left the company and lots of things started changing. I had an amazing review and all of a sudden basically everything changed with the manager, they would ice me out, belittle me over everything and constantly changing what the expectations were and feedback was constantly negative, I was constantly anxious of even coming in when they were around. Also, I had been promised a location of my own and then they backtracked, citing the success of my current location - even though I specifically took the position to be promoted within a set timeframe. I decided to leave for this and honestly, the company’s hyper micromanaging and lack of support. I’m currently taking my time interviewing for roles and making sure it’s the right fit. 

Recently I had an interview with the owner of the brand and they asked me why I left. I tried staying as neutral as possible, citing brand not being a good fit and lack of clear direction and grow path but they actually called me out one giving very “non-specific” answers and that they needed to know in more detail what was I missing specifically so they could see if they were a good fit for me. This threw me for a loop as I did not want to say anything negative and frankly left me anxious after what had started as a very positive hiring process.

I need a total of 120 credits, but I'll have around 135 due to credit requirements. Nevertheless, I must finish by May 2025; otherwise, I won't be eligible for any further financial aid or the Pell Grant. In that case, I might have to take out loans, which I'd prefer to avoid.

you might need to dumb it down for me to feel motivated if i should be. should i talk to every recruiter that reaches out? it seems like it’s every week. what are the best practices here? most everyone i started with left the company but we didn’t really keep in touch other than a few asking me to join their new place of work(probably for the sign on bonus since that garbage is everywhere in the industry). i dont have a cpa license but dont feel like id have any problems passing. however i dont really want to take on a high level of risk of being a signer and dont really care to be in high level management but can probably do it.

i recently freshened up my resume not long ago but everything on youtube says to use measurable metrics which is not how i’ve ever done it so it might need revamped. 

i need help sorting this all really before i end up in to deep of a hole.

1c6nj2e,How can I address an incomplete bachelors degree/time in university in a job interview/resume?,"I think its really important to not hide this information.  
  
Storytime: I have one completed bachelors degree, and went back to school to become a teacher (Bachelor of Education). I did one extra year of school for this, and I almost finished. However, things happened. To tell the truth about what happened, I got extremely overwhelmed between school demands, home life demands (health of a family member), as well as my own mental health, and I needed to leave to take care of these personal matters. After I left, I took off the rose coloured glasses and realized all the red flags in the profession I had been ignoring, and I ended up changing my mind about becoming a teacher.  
  
In my time away I ended up finding another opportunity with the school district to be their office clerk. I have taken a class in partnership between the school district and a community college to develop my skills, and I completed 2 practicums for this.  
  
I want to tell the school district about my time as a student teacher, as I have a lot of knowledge of how the district works because of this. I understand issues from both the perspective of a teacher and office staff. I have worked at three different schools during my time as a student teacher. I spent 3 months volunteering at 2 different schools in preparation to becoming accepted to this competitive program, and I completed one, six week practicum teaching in a classroom as a teacher. I want the school to know about my knowledge of how schools work and see it as an asset. I have also been interested and serious about working for the school district for many years. Omitting this information would be hiding an important part of the last few years of my life. But I can't figure out how to address this without it seeming like its negative that I changed my mind or quit.

This would be his first time as a manager, and I imagine he wants to de-risk by hiring someone that he already knows is solid  
I **really** want this role. It took months for HR to allocate headcount towards this opening, and it was hard not to dwell on it. Last week, he asked me to send my resume, and that we could set up time to prep once the process got moving.  
To make my anxiety worse,  when the job was posted 1.5 weeks ago, the parent company was the one listed for the role. A Top-5 sought after company in my industry. My industry has also been hammered by layoffs, so I'm sure that there are *thousands* of other applicants..

I’m losing confidence in my ability to out-compete and land the role, and all these factors has my anxiety at an all-time high.It’s taking everything I have not to send a follow up email, asking to set up time prematurely. But I think I will wait until the two-week mark. 

I know there isn't much here that's concrete enough to provide relevant advice. But any would be appreciated, whether it's about how to conduct myself, keep a level head, or anecdotes from similar experiences.",Winter-Light1326,1,1.0,0,1713393268,2024-04-17 22:34:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c6nd4d/how_far_can_a_referral_take_you_need_advice/,4,2024
1c6n0e0,Options for a professional/highly-educated felon?,"I (38m) have a masters in Instructional Design (talent development/corporate training, etc) and 10 years experience. As of 2022, I was convicted of felony child endangerment (non-violent, non-sex - basically I failed to be in the same room as a kid I was watching fractured their leg playing). Did 5 months in prison.

I've had many questions about how that could lead to a felony, so: when I took her to the hospital, they suspected abuse, so I was charged with felonious assault, felonious child endangerment, and domestic violence. CPS interviewed her, found I didn't harm her, so the prosecutor gave a plea deal that got rid of the violent charges but wanted me to plead guilty to the endangerment because the kid still got hurt on my watch. I took the deal, obviously.

I've applied to about 800 jobs since release, and was hired three times - all of which rescinded their offers after the background check (they didn't ask upfront so I didn't volunteer that info).

My earliest memories are of living in homeless shelters, and I'm aware of the sheer improbability of my success. So it's an especially bitter pill to swallow to think all that hard work was wasted so easily.

My job during the incident paid 120k. I don't expect to make that immediately again, but am I even able to work at the same professional level? Or am I totally blacklisted from white collar work?

1c6mhj1,"Role at new company changed, salary did not","So I am now working as a project manager at a company that works in the trades. What I was hired for was administrative stuff and managing tradesman essentially a support role to make sure things ran smoothly.

Since starting here 7 months ago I have implemented a ton of new things to help the company grow, have been the lead on numerous marketing changes and took over a department within my company which I now solely look after with support from the owner.

The major issue I'm having is that I don't have experience in this prior to doing it now and I am struggling to manage everything, I essentially do everything from estimating, booking in jobs and explaining processes to clients, Troubleshooting any issues the guys may have, organising their training and certifications, now I am getting more into approaching potential high value clients, building relationships with adjacent industries to bring in more organic work.

So I've taken on a boatload of responsibility, but my salary hasn't really jumped up to reflect that, I started at an hourly rate of $20/hr and now am on a $53k salary. This would have been fine with my old role but I feel as though what I am doing now, I should be earning minimum $65k-70k(this is CAD by the way).

Now my other issue is that I am somewhat related to the owner of the company, we are close enough and I have become his go to guy and I can tell that pisses off the other employee. Technically I am still under a service manager in terms of hierarchy but my role is completely outside the realm of what they do. People in my office treat me as though I am still a service advisor and have no input on things. This is frustrating as I am expected to do a bunch of things and I can't really do them.

I'm not sure if I'm going to stay here as I think the environment and the expectations I have don't really match. I feel like it's a hostile environment because people who work here think I've gotten special privileges or something.",Kippingthroughlife,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1713391117,2024-04-17 21:58:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c6mhj1/role_at_new_company_changed_salary_did_not/,4,2024
1c6mfmx,Job offer withdrawn - discrimination? ,"I recently applied for a job as a baker, i have great experience and skills and i think i would be great at the job. it helps that i like the company and would buy from them as a customer. i went for a trial shift which was 3 hours long and unpaid, and at the end they offered me the job. i accepted the offer by email and then a few days later went to sign paperwork, medical records, etc. my start date was meant to be today but i got an email yesterday saying my job offer has been withdrawn due to a reorganising at the bakery and that my role is no longer needed. 

i know the reason they gave me was a lie. 

on the day when i went to sign paperwork i recognised a girl at the till as someone i went to college with. we didn’t get along at all, we just never liked each other, she spread rumours about me and generally was not a nice person. i was civil to her anyway as college was nearly 5 years ago and we had no contact since then. when i’m in the HR office signing paperwork an employee comes in and asks to talk to the HR staff saying it’s urgent. so they leave the room and i made out some of what they’re saying. what i made out was this: 

‘*girls name*, upset, doesn’t want to work’. 

afterwards the HR staff came back and asked other HR staff if they should continue with the paperwork, to which they said yes. i know what the girl is like, she’s very mouthy and gossipy, so it’s clear she went and mouthed off to HR probably some horrible things about me, and now i don’t have a job anymore. what baffles me most is they didn’t even contact my former employer with regards to a reference, and the job application is still live on Indeed, so the role clearly still is needed, and just after the trial shift i was told by the manager that i’d be a great fit for the role. 

i am genuinely appalled and disgusted at the way it’s been dealt with, especially being lied to about the reason when it’s so blatantly obvious. what i’m not sure of though is whether this falls into discrimination. this has put me in a very stressful position as i have handed in my notice thinking i have a job lined up to start today, but now i have no job at all, i am applying for things but it’s stressed me out and quite frankly pissed me off. any advice on what to do is greatly appreciated 🙏",Fragrant-Dance5285,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1713390979,2024-04-17 21:56:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c6mfmx/job_offer_withdrawn_discrimination/,4,2024
1c6m9l4,Do I sound like a micro-manager if I tell them this?,"I manage a small team of 5 employees at a small prviate manufacturing in Texas - We are in the Accounting Team.  


I've gotten into the manager role about 6 months ago, and I was part of the interview process for all of my team.  


They all used to work together (1 got hired last year and when our team was growing, referred his old team) and have a relationship outside work (Weekend gatherings and such).

I'm all for the team being tightly-knit - it's better than having drama within the team.  


However sometimes I wonder if they actually recongize me as their manager. Today they went out for a 'team lunch' amongst themselves - Full disclaimer I was not invited or notified of this, but I'm not sour about not being invited - I like to enjoy my lunch in peace alone and would have declined even invited (And I understand, I would never invite my boss to a non-company paid lunch)  


They took an hour and a half and didn't even apologize as they came back to the office saying they took so long - We only get half and hour breaks.  


Now of course, if this was a regular occurence I wouldn't think twice about talking to them; but this happend once for a special celebration (One of the team members got engaged)  


Now - If you are in my position - Do you  


A) Tell the Team on Team's chat they were out of line and if they want to go for longer lunches let me know in advance - Not that they need approval from me but to let me know in advance  


B) Stop being an micro-manager and shut it until/if it happens again (They are always good with lunch time and working longer hours as needed)  


I have been very good with my team and giving them lots of leeway and support, but sometimes I wonder if all of them actually recognize me as their superieror (I for example respond to my manager's Team's message asap - My team sometimes would take 10-15 mins before even acknowledging my message). I don't consider myself a micro-manager at all, I don't breathe down on their necks.  


TLDR: My team went on a longer lunch break then usual due to a celebration, but negelected to let me know; Feels like a bigger issue then just lunch break of recognizing me as their manager.

Hello! 

I’m an ICU nurse with 7+ years experience, I have a post graduate certificate in ICU nursing and I also have a degree in Nutrition and Dietetics. 

I love my job but it is literally breaking my back - the constant bending and manual handling have landed me with a load of disk bulges and spine degeneration and I’m only in my early 30’s. 

I am after any job suggestions that might suit someone with my skill set that doesn’t involve any bending or lifting so I can preserve what is left of my crummy spine. I am happy to undertake new training and learn new skills. Disclaimer - I’m not amazing with computers but am willing to learn.

1c6lvqx,Time to leave my employer??,"Time to leave my employer??

I am currently working for a steel production company as an indirect procurement manager, managing a team of 4FTE.
Salary is very good with many days of holidays and quite a lot of flexibility wrt working hours.

Recently the procurement organization changed which actually resulted in a new level between me and my manager: I used to report to the CPO and now there is a deputy int between. Although my responsibilities remain the same, for me it feels a bit like a demotion… 
This made me think about my current position and future career opportunities in this company. 
Furthermore our organization (but actually the entire company) is managed quite amateurish: the entire company is managed by a gazillion Google sheets but we don’t have any modern tools available to do our job efficiently (on the contrary!)
I discussed the fact that I don’t have a positive feeling on the organizational change, but my previous manager is trying to convince me that I shouldn’t see it like that, he is very happy with my performance, and this organizational change will benefit me as it will give me a manager who will be able to coach me better and provide more ad-hoc support.

I now have a job proposal from another company (petrochemical company) for a similar job however not managing a team.
Salary conditions are similar (no lease car but compensated by a higher salary and tax advantages). The company is a newly founded company as a result of a merger of 2 well known other companies. 
During my several interviews I got the feeling there is quite of a positive dynamic in creating a new company.

I am changing my decisions around 10 times a day. Sometimes I have the feeling I shouldn’t bother too much about the org change and shouldn’t see it necessarily as negative. 
On the other hand I am fed up with the archaic way of working, lack of innovation in our processes. Furthermore given the current crisis in our industry I don’t see the sense of urgency of our management to invest in these kind of improvements / tools / resources…

1c6lcl0,Use up sick time before resigning?,"Should I use my sick time before resigning from a shitty, low-paying job? I'm not worried about burning bridges. 

For more context: 

I'm working a shitty job for $18/hr -- it's got me through college but upper management has been the worst.  I've had great reviews in all my quarterly meetings. My only issues have been regarding my benefits! My one stipulation upon being hired was that they had to accommodate my school schedule no matter what -- which they did. This has caused lots of tension because it was discovered that I wasn't getting holiday pay but my average work week was 32 hours. I requested an audit and eventually was granted holiday pay.... until recently when I was abruptly brought into a meeting with HR to sign a paper -- my hours were limited to 28 and my holiday pay was revoked.  


Fast forward a few weeks: I was offered a fantastic internship in a career related to my degree and I'll be giving my notice in a week. I dont plan to look back but out of concern for their pettiness, I haven't told my employer and will only be giving them a one-week heads-up.   


I also noticed that after their recent switch of my holiday pay, I now have 30 hours of state-mandated sick time which I'd like to use up before I go. Other than feeling like an asshole, I feel like it's only fair considering the turmoil they've put me in. Are there any downsides to doing this?

1. Y2k fashion brand 
In office 5 days a week, 7.30am-4pm no flex on start times as they have a Hong Kong office, which I get. Said can have the odd day wfh if for example there's a big furniture delivery or anything.
Very exciting opportunities with a new sports brand and existing 00s brand thats come back in fashion.
Terrible holidays - only 20 days AL (I am based in the UK, and have never previously had anything less than 25 days AL excluding Bank hols)
Line manager seems very nice, very knowledgeable, room for career growth and building out my own team
Pension ok

2. Big British Transport company
Flexible working start times, in office 3 days a week wfh 2 days
25 days holiday, free train rides in the, UK excellent pension and other benefits, holidays go up with length 
The hiring manager has admitted there's little room for growth upwards and unlikely to get any direct reports anytime soon 
5k more pay per year than fashion brand

Guess one is a bit sexier, will be a more interesting role as fashion is exciting, but the employer is a bit more rigid. Transports could be cushty with more benefits, but the potential to be a bit more dull and less room for growth. Both are based in the city centre with really nice offices.

I dont have children or pets, so there isn't a need for me to be at home all the time, but I have previously enjoyed the flexibility of a couple of wfh days.

1c6jssk,Submitted notice -- given alternative choice and may have burnt bridge,"Long story short, I need to quit my job to focus on studying for grad school entrance exam that would facilitate a career change. I submitted notice (citing personal reasons for leaving my job) and my boss asked me if I'd be interested in working as a contractor for the handful of months I was planning on studying full-time. After over a year of trying to work FT and study, I just can't hack it; I find myself working over my required hours and on the weekends, no matter how many times or in what fashion I tell my boss that I have too much work. It's a scary decision, but I've decided to make this investment in my next career.

 She -- and her boss -- would have to do quite a lot of work in trying to find out whether our company would even permit it, much less get it approved. From conversations, it seems that the general expectation is that I would work as a contractor for a handful of months (when I'd be studying FT, but they don't know that) and then return to my previous FT position (supposedly in perpetuity). The problem is that, even if I were to return to my previous FT position, I could only be there for 7, 8 months before having to quit to go to school FT.

Having some income would be nice, but it's not strictly necessary as I'll be living with my parents. The biggest concern is that I feel like I'm taking advantage/being deceptive and abusive. I'm concerned about the contractor-position -- and all the work they did to keep me temporarily in the hopes that I return permanently -- being used against me and am wondering if I should just cut off ties. I'd feel a little better if I would return to my FT position for at least a year, but the school year starts when it starts.

I'm probably going to end up burning this bridge, but is there any way to salvage this?

1c6iznr,"Advice on career next steps, stay as contractor or take permanent role at another company.","
27 M, currently work as a contractor/consultant paid a day rate for a large engineering corporation, I have been in the role for the past 3.5 years. I have gained plenty of experience and earn around circa $160,000. 

I will probably have this role for another 1 year since the project will close in 2025.

Issue / no career growth as contractors don’t get promotions. I feel like I’ve been stuck in my career irrespective of the money I am making.

Option/ competitor offering me a full time role with plenty of career growth. It’s a lateral move - same role, same work life balance, difference is the competitor is only recently setting up the department I operate in therefore tons of growth. Pay is circa $80K

Decision - shall I stay at the current contractor role, or shall I take the permanent employment role at the competitor albeit with a 45% income cut.

Apologies if this is not the right forum for this but I am very confused and have little time to make a decision since the competitor needs a response to the offer.",corporate-stoic,1,1.0,0,1713382628,2024-04-17 19:37:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c6iznr/advice_on_career_next_steps_stay_as_contractor_or/,4,2024

1c6iaq1,Thinking about going back to old job,"Hi,

I’ve been working for my company for about 5 years now, started as an electrical intern then worked 3 years as an electrical technician. Started going back to school for a bachelors and have been working as a software engineer for the last year. I enjoy writing software for home projects, but as a career I just really don’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I’m thinking about going back to my old role when one of the techs moves on but not sure. It’s just that I’ve been going to school to get the engineering role and then I’d go back to a job requiring an associates degree.

Pros of switching back:
-More fulfilling work
-Not sitting at a desk 40 hr/week
-Biweekly pay rather than monthly
-Overtime eligible and almost always available

Cons:
-Would most likely take a pay cut (possibly up to 20k annually)
-Lower salary cap

1c6i9b2,Colleague Dodging Meetings After Being Passed Over for Promotion,"I'm in a bit of a sticky situation at work and could really use some advice. A colleague of mine, let's call him John, has been with our company for five years. He recently applied for a promotion but was passed over and the position was given to someone else. Now, John has to work under the new person who got the job he wanted.

  
Here’s the problem: ever since he was passed over, John has started avoiding meetings. He always shows up about 10 minutes late to our online meetings, often claiming things like ""Sorry, my WiFi broke down,"" which seems a bit off because those first 10 minutes are usually when we have informal catch-ups.  


  
Moreover, John has stopped attending our monthly face-to-face meetings at the office, always citing reasons like doctor's appointments or similar excuses. I remember he used to have similar habits a while back (he used to dodge major team events and retreats by calling in sick or citing other reason) but had managed to overcome them. Now, after missing out on the promotion, these old patterns are showing up again.

I have looked at many industries such as medicine, police, IT, restaurant 

Which of those industries has better opportunities, pay and benefits as well as not being stressful, 

I want a job which I can go to work, finish and not have anything to worry about, I want to avoid office based jobs as I know IT can be remote and office based, I don’t want a job with alot of social interaction or being managed too often 

While I don’t like people or stressful situations, I can do alot of medical procedures: IV, tourniquet and such without any issue, same with in a kitchen I can work quite well as I enjoy cooking, 

What’s the best way to get a high enough paying job, that doesn’t have any worry’s once I leave work and I can do without much management/people (I know medical jobs and restaurants normally include working with people, but the restaurant is rather small and if I was joining the police it would be more SWAT team/ordnance since that’s less public and more exciting work) I don’t have much experience outside of the few certifications I have, I live in England but in the north so I have less opportunity.

My question relates to switching from Academia to Industry jobs and all the struggles that comes with it.

 A little bit about my background. For the last 6 years, I have been a professor teaching relational database, SQL, data analysis, Python. I should get tenured in a few months but I am not really enthusiastic about pursuing an academic career. While I do enjoy the teaching aspect, I feel like my few research has been lost in academic journals and any more advanced research has also been discouraged as being too ambitious.  
I would also add that I live in the bay area and being paid close to nothing.  
Regarding my profile, I have degrees in Computer Engineering, Information Technology as well as an MBA. I am also close to 40 years old.

About 3 years ago (during covid times), I decided to apply to several UX Research and Research Scientist job in various tech companies. Going over job requirements, I figured my profile would fit perfectly. However after 8 months of not even a single interview, I felt lost and asked advices from friends.  
While looking at my resume, a couple people told me I would be a perfect TPM. I had no idea what it meant, so I looked into it and saw how a Project/Product manager role in a technology area would be a good transition for me.

I decided to go all in. I learned management concepts. I took several PM certifications, including the CAPM. I joined the Project Management Institute and even spent a year in a volunteer manager role with them. While networking with people there, I was repeatedly told by various Managers there that I have the ideal profile to be a Project Manager or Product Manager.  I worked with several people to reorganized my resume to fit the job profile.

About a year and a half later  and having applied to 200+ PM jobs in various companies, even early careers jobs, I am not receiving a single positive response and haven’t had a single interview.

My mood is quite down and I am not sure what to do :  
  
1. Should I keep applying to PM jobs ?

 

2. Should I give up and go back to apply to Research position ?  If I do, how would it be seen by recruiters if they notice I applied to PM positions a few months ago.  
I also reorganized my LinkedIn to indicate my strong interest in Management. If I give up, I would have to change it again. Not even talking about all the money I spent on certification and such. I guess I should just remove it all from my resume and linkedIn profile…

1c6cvcb,Should I ask for more money?,"OK, so I wanna start off by prefacing that I have been in my current role for 18 months. I had applied for a management possession within my role and got turned down. The interview process was conducted by a competency based interview and decided based on percentages graded by the matrix. I had been planning to leave up until this new job had been posted as I do not like the company, and when I got turned down, I started looking for a new job.

Long story short, I received a job offer in a new company which would be £23,500 + benefits. I accepted the offer and handed in my notice in my current role. I am really excited about this role and the company seems really really great so I have decided to go for it.

Last week an opportunity was presented to me by upper management in my current company. This new role does not align with my career goals. However, it is significantly more money at £27,000. 

My question now is, should I go to the company that I have accepted the offer for and let them know that I have been offered a new role in my current company for more money and ask if the salary that they have presented to me is negotiable at all?

1c6cv2q,Let go for being sick before 2 weeks notice time was up,"I turned in my official 2 weeks notice at my job last Friday, April 15th, making April 26th my last day. 
My job was aware I would by leaving as late as the summer ask my husband got a new job offer in another state. I had been told a few days prior at work that they did already have a replacement line up. So  my husband and I talked about it in length and due to an upcoming vacation we had planned, needing to get the current house we live in ready for us to leave and the fact I would not have child care over the summer without paying someone, we decided for me to leave my job early so that 
1) I would not lose a pay check (vacation time is earned as you work through the year and if I took vacation time my last check would be docked to repay what I had not yet earned) 
2) I would be here to help clean and pack up the house in preparation for our move
3) We would not have to struggle to find childcare once school ends. 

This all being said, yesterday, April 16, I text my boss in the morning letting them know I was going to the dr because I had a sore throat.  I was asked If I would be coming I to work after, which I was planning to do and let them know that. After getting to work, about 2 hours later I start experiencing medical issues. I called my Dr letting them know what was going on and they said for me to go to the ER. I was in no position to drive so after a discussion with my manager, my Lead at work drove me to the ER. 

My husband was also no feeling good when he woke up that morning and had been sleeping off and on all day. When I had to call him to come get me, I suggested he go ahead and get seen too as he suspected he had the Flu. 

So I find out from the ER I had a reaction from the steroids shot I got that morning, but the nurse questioned why I went to the Dr in the first place. When I told her is was over a sore throat, she checked it and said it looked like I may have strep and tested me. It was Negative, but my husband who was also being seen tested positive for strep. The nurse said I like have strep too with my throat looking the way it did and suggested I stay out of work the next day just to be safe. 

Upon being told that I texted my Manager and Leads letting them know about the reaction to the steroids shot, but that also the nurse was sure I had strep, because my husband had strep even though my test was negative. I let them know I would be returning to work on Thursday April 18th. I had a Dr's note saying as much. 

So this morning, April 17th, I wake up to a text from my manager stating that since they have found a replacement for me there is no need for me to return to work and that she hopes I feel better and wishes us the best on our new adventure with our move. 

My question is, did I just get terminated early and can I file for unemployment? I know they let me go because I did not show up to work today (per Dr's orders) as they could sometimes be petty in that way.

1c6c30t,Should I quit my job? ,"Healthcare startup based in SouthFL. Remote work. Started (2020) in one department and then was promoted (2021) to a clinical role/department. I have been promoted now to team lead which they’ve been promising since 2022 and I only got it because another manager resigned. Now they want to make some changes to the entire department: Turn our team (except the SR manager) into hourly employees - including myself, which means: clocking in/out, no unlimited PTO, limited holidays off, excluded from all the corporate meetings which I’ve been going to since the beginning. My raise for this promotion was around 4.5%.

1c6c2jo,Need advice: should I leave federal employment for contacting job?,"I have been working in the federal government for about 6 years now in an IT role.  The work has always been very easy and chill.  I'm highly respected at my job because they now I will always get the job done.  They do let me go to the gym every day for roughly an hour and I can request time off anytime I want.  I'm currently a GS12.

That being said, I have been somewhat bored with my job for the past year.  The work is super easy and not very challenging.  I have been taking different trainings, but I'm starting to think what's the use if I'm never going to be able to practice the things I'm training for.  We recently hired an associate and he has been doing a lot of the little tasks I used to do to help the day go by.  Now I spend 90% of the day twiddling my thumbs waiting for something to go wrong that I can fix.

I hold a security clearance and I have been having recruiters reach out to me quite a bit lately.  I recently had an offer for a job that is doing pretty much everything that I do now for around $20k/year more than what I'm making now.  I have researched the contracting company and they have really great reviews.  From everything I have read they really care about their employees.

I need some advice one weather I should jump ship or not?  When I talk to my friends they all envy my easy job, and I get that, but at the same time I don't feel that in 20 years I will be where I want to be in my field due to the lack of experience I'm currently getting.  I feel like it would take an act of god for me to get fired from my federal job, so it's a little scary knowing in the contracting world they can cut you very easily. Does anyone have any experience leaving the government work and going to the private side they could share with me?

1c6b23z,Leaving amazing job and company for a better career opportunity? ,"I (26F) am at an amazing job and company learning a skill I’ve always wanted to learn. It takes 18 months to learn the position and I’m 12 months in. 

I met someone through this job - someone real, credible, the real deal, who started their own company (a competitor to my current company) and is offering me a position with the new company and to be my mentor. He is a master in the industry I’ve dreamt of being in for my whole life. 

It’s a no brainer that the new opportunity is the best one for me, especially as I believe I’ll get a pay raise and I’ll get to go remote full time (choosing where I get to live is very important to me and is a downside of my current job). 

However, I don’t want to burn bridges at the company I’m at because they’ve been training me from the ground up. I just started 11 months ago and I’m in the middle of projects until August. 

My pay isn’t great here, I will say. I struggle to make ends meet. 

What do I do? My parents always taught me to never quit something I committed to in the middle of the season. I feel like I’m in the middle of a season here. But business-wise, it’s a no brainer. 

I can’t give more details as I need to stay as anonymous as possible. 

Edit to add: I could stay longer at the company because it would look better to the company (that I’m leaving) that I stayed for longer. But I’m worried that as a female, I’m making decisions more for other people than for what I want to do. I’m convincing myself to do the “right” thing and at the same time telling myself what I want to do.

1c6az6h,Need advice on new career path ,"I just started a job that is offering tuition reimbursement and I can’t decide which degree I would like to pursue. 

I will most likely only do an associates degree because I can only take classes part time and that alone will take about four years to complete. 

Initially I wanted to stay with this company long term and do an electronics engineering degree so I can work in the production area building computer components. I could also work in other departments such as procurement and quality assurance. 

But now I am starting to consider a degree in something I could use to work from home. I had the opportunity to work from home for a bit and I fell in love with it. I was thinking maybe something like an information systems or information technology degree. 

I am having trouble deciding which will be most flexible with finding future employment as I may not be staying in this area forever. I would also like to make decent money. 

 I would like to add that I am not very tech savvy and this is a brand new environment to me. I came from a healthcare background but have always wanted to get into a technical field. 

I also have some social anxiety and prefer not associating with tons of people on a daily basis. I feel like both of these jobs could require minimal social interaction.

1c6aa0z,Forget Everything You Know About Resumes,"Forget everything you know about resumes.  
Let's start from zero.  
Your resume has one singular job at the core.  
To get you an interview.  
Your structure isn't going to get you an interview.  
The font you use won't get you an interview.  
The template you use Won't. Get. You. An. Interview.  
Do these things make recruiters' lives easier so they can find key info?  
Of course.  
I love me an easy to read, crispy, boring resume.  
But, what IS going to get you an interview are these things:  
1. Aligned experience to the job you applied for  
  
Are you 90% or more qualified for the job in the current market?  
  
2. Showing your impact.  
  
Focus on your measurable outcomes. What were the results of your work?  
  
Don't have those numbers? Fine.  
  
Then include the scale of your work.  
  
Like, ""Managed a $10M marketing budget across 5 Fortune 500 clients.""  
  
3. Weaving your hard and soft skills into your experience sections, not listing them.  
  
Congratulations for being a self-proclaimed ""team player"".  
  
Apologies for the sarcasm, bad habit.  
  
But listing ""team player"" doesn't say or prove anything.  
  
Show it instead.  
  
""Collaborated cross-functionally with Engineering and Customer Success teams daily for product iteration""  
  
To tie it all together, remove filler words.  
This isn't an easy trying to meet a word count.  
It's a resume that needs to show how well-suited you are for jobs.  
Be concise.  
I recommend using a free tool like Hemingway to help (type Hemingway App into Google).  
Plug your resume bullet points in and start dissecting.",markthetechrecruiter,2,1.0,2,1713361520,2024-04-17 13:45:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c6aa0z/forget_everything_you_know_about_resumes/,4,2024
1c69qim,I can't choose between a safe career or my passion and it makes me feel stuck and extremely sad.,"I (21F) have never been really great at choosing anything in my life. My studies have been a mess until now, with Covid and other stuff that happened, the only diploma i got right now is my highschool diploma (I went to college and tried other stuff but alwayd dropped out).

I have always loved art. I've been drawing since I'm 13 and it makes me happy. But I could never pursue it as an actual career. I've tried multiple times but always ended up thinking it wasn't a stable job, or that I would never succeed and always ended up trying to have a ""real job"" (though I don't think being an artist isn't a real job but you get it).

I've tried translator, watching over kids, supermarkets, secretary... and none of them stuck.

I've been to a private art school and honestly i absolutely loved it. But it was private, so that meant I had to pay it and it was a full time school so I had no money and no time to work either (And my parents weren't able to help me since they're not rich AT ALL). So I ""had"" to drop out. For info, I live in France and that art school couldn't deliver an actual diploma since it was a manga school and ""mangaka"" isn't a ""real job"" here. So finishing school with a 25 000€ debt and no actual diploma wasn't a safe bet, even if my art did improve in that time. I'm still sad I dropped out and wished I stayed there and found a way to make it work but that's too late.

Right now I'm trying to get into an auto-body mechanic training, but again I don't know if it's what I want. I like cars and I like art so I thought it could be a nice compromise but I don't know if I actually think that or if I'm just trying to makes excuses for not going for my art directly.

The situation is getting extremely stressful for me and I honestly can't deal with it anymore... I need help and I don't know who to ask so asking strangers on the internet felt like the best option lol

**In my opinion, these are my options :**

* Finding a not so good job, and keep pursuing my art on the side through social media (not knowing if it'll ever work)
* Abandon art and find a real job career (Right now, auto-body mechanic)
* Try art school again (I maybe found an art school that offers internships so it could be a compromise between being in art school and earning money, but I'm scared for the ""after"" side of it if I will actually be able to get a job or not yk).

Also, note that I'm not alone in this. I have a boyfriend who I plan to move out with and he also has a job and career etc. So not earning money monthly is literally impossible.

What should I do ? Should I listen to my head or my heart ? (As cringe as that may sound lmao)",k4tsie,1,0.6700000166893005,6,1713360140,2024-04-17 13:22:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c69qim/i_cant_choose_between_a_safe_career_or_my_passion/,4,2024
1c6945t,Disappointed by raise at work,"I am part of a development program that trains new college grads. We started with a compensation plan that gave raises (generous) every six months. My organization had some changes and was forced to pause raises for all of last year. We had several meetings discussing what the roadmap would look like for future compensation and leadership kept promising that we wouldn’t receive back pay for the time spend without a raise (totally reasonable) but we would be bumped up to the raise we should be at depending on our tenure. For most of us that translated to two pay bumps. My peers and I are very transparent when it comes to pay, so I knew what the class above me was making and based on the promises from leadership, I was expecting my upcoming raise to be a bump over their salary. 

I worked really hard over the year and was recognized by management and my peers constantly. I was promoted to a different role within the same organization that handles a larger scope of the business, more responsibility, and is just harder to do. I accepted this position (nothing on paper, just a change of manager) because I felt comfortable in my previous role and I wanted better experience and to keep growing and learning. Most importantly though, I accepted the position knowing that a big raise was coming my way regardless, which gave me comfort in my decision. 

I found out that my raise is significantly less than I was expecting and that team members that are much less tenured than me are making the same salary. 

I just feel so disappointed and used. It feels like the time I spent working my ass off over the past year is literally worth nothing if someone with a year less of experience makes the same salary as me. I literally trained them!!! 

I know that I have to advocate for myself, because I just can’t stay quiet and send the message that I’m okay with it. I just need advice on how to approach that conversation and would love to know if someone else has experienced something similar.

I am a Computer Engineer, 25 years old. Graduated with honors last year, I chose a first job position in a small company that allowed me to do full remote (job=ML Engineer) and, in addition to the 8h per day, to spend 50% of the year abroad as a Visiting Scholar at some universities around Europe. After a year of traveling, culminating in a publication of one of my scientific papers in Paris, I have to say that the absence of a place in the world weighs on me.

I have no friends with a similar path to mine (not even degrees), nor relatives to take cues from.

My current position is slightly tangential of what I want to be doing but still in the design field. 

Should I take down my current job status on LinkedIn and also leave off my resume? Or should I update my resume with my current position? 

Other things to note is that my current company works for a lot of major businesses and since the design world is small I am concerned about maintaining a good reputation and not burning bridges. 

Also if anyone could let me know how do I take interviews during work hours while not letting my employer know I am doing it would be appreciated!

Thank you!!",oo_lina_oo,7,1.0,24,1713350495,2024-04-17 10:41:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c66lyv/how_do_i_handle_leaving_my_job_that_ive_been_at/,4,2024
1c660wc,Really lost and desperately in need of a new career direction - what careers should I consider switching to?,"I am UK based.

After school I worked in Market Research for 15 or so years before moving into a data analysis/insights role a year ago. I really hoped taking a more hands-on role would help with my motivation but it really hasn't.

I have no degree FWIW, this hasn't really been an issue since I worked my way onto the grad scheme in my first job but I am sure it's relevant still.

I am so sick of feeling like an idiot. I know I am not stupid but I constantly feel like one in my job and past jobs. I find it almost impossible to motivate or apply myself fully and am always on the back foot and feeling out of my depth. I have tried and tried and tried to overcome this but I simply cannot and it's wreaking havoc on my self esteem. I literally cannot make myself be proactive and I hate myself for it.

Everyone around me seems to have some way to find motivation somehow and it honestly baffles me, I wish I had it.

I earn OK money (I took a cut when moving to my current role and am on £42K). I don't mind taking less money initially but ideally would be in this ballpark again once I have some experience under my belt.

I am very creative and good at coming up with ideas. I am good with people. I have excellent powerpoint/excel skills. I am quick to understand new concepts. I think these things have kept me just afloat in my career so far but I have never and will never excel in this career path.

I am very bad at motivating myself if something doesn't naturally interest me. I am seemingly useless at analysing data past a rational read on what is it showing (which is a key part of my current role!).

I think I want to do something that is creative or something that actually benefits the world. Teaching appeals but the horror stories put me off. Firefighting appeals but seems like an iffy choice long term,

I think learning python/SQL and going into a more data management/visualisation role might be a good next step and build on my current career rather than abandoning it but I worry I will just end in the same boat I am in now somehow.

Sales and Recruitment also feel like they would play well to my people/social skills but these have such awful reputations and that must be for a reason.

The point of this post? Good question, I guess party to get my feelings straight and party in desperate hope someone might be able to share some wisdom or an idea that hasn't occured to me yet.

I genuinely feel I am starting to get depressed and I think my job/career is a major factor at the moment. I KNOW I can be good at something, I just have no idea what or how to get to it.

Any help would be much appreciated!",MaximusSydney,1,1.0,1,1713348257,2024-04-17 10:04:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c660wc/really_lost_and_desperately_in_need_of_a_new/,4,2024

1c64ve1,A series of questions about how to handle name discrepancies and other things that signal you are transgender...,"I will post this to some transgender subreddit, as well, but I want to get some general responses, too... It matters what the general public thinks because that's most of y'all. 

To start, I'll say I spend a lot of time observing the internet. I enjoy writing posts and comments online... well, on reddit and YouTube. I don't use anything else.
I'm fairly introverted--a PhD candidate about to graduate, so I've spent quite a bit of time working alone analyzing data and writing. Most interactions outside of my wife and dogs have been with old friends via text or with strangers online. Academia is so deadline-driven, that no one cares when you work or where you work as long as you are being (hyper)productive... So I've been highly independent working 60 to 80 hours a week for the past 8 years (I did my Masters and PhD back to back and had research assistantships and adjuncted some, too). All this to say that I know the internet is not real life, and I am aware I have no idea how people actually are outside of academia anymore. This is important because I'm transgender, the internet is nasty toward us, and I can't tell whether it's real or just fringe groups online... I've seen a lot of people say things like, ""I would never hire one of those."" They call us ""it"" and ""that thing."" Someone used the word ""vermin,"" which... wow. And this is one example among many. 

Hearing it within the context of hiring made me concerned because I've heard the job market is also bad. Weirdly, if I wasn't transgender, I think it might be easier for me than it would be for some people to get a job for various reasons, which I'll get into below. I have some valuable skills and cross-disciplinary connections, though I'm not discounting how rough it is out there for even the most qualified people. The problem is I am highly findable. I'm not open with my own gender identity (I pass as my gender), but I've published a few articles reporting findings from studies of transgender people. I have quite a few publications, and only a few are on that topic. Academic articles come up in Google searches immediately, so I can't really hide that I've been associated with transgender research. I know some people who dislike transgender folks will say I deserve not to have a job because I dared to write about transgender people in a peer reviewed journal and that was my choice. I've observed how they speak online for the past, oh, six or so years now and the Venn diagram between the ""personal responsibility"" and ""anti-trans"" crowd is a circle. ""You decided to be a freak, so you deserve whatever you get."" But how many people think this way, really? Is this just a fringe group that flocks to YouTube for anti-transgender content, or are there really that many people who hate us so much they want to go out of their way to disrespect us? You know, the type of people who harass you for being transgender, even if you pass as your gender, purposefully calling you the wrong gender, once they find out? I don't need that. I just want to do my job and be left alone. Am I paranoid that most of the job market will reject me if they find out and not even let me in the door? What is the temperature in the room right now?

Another (potentially fixable) problem: the HR department for one job I had 8 years ago knows me by my old name. I did supervise around 50 people there, so they might actually want to call them... That company has already ignored the shit I sent them to change my name on my old 401k. The thought of calling them is just... I'll do it, but idk if they'll behave in a competent manner when someone calls, even if I do. They were disorganized when I left. I could totally see them fucking up when someone calls and saying they don't have anyone with my name on file. The only people who still work there who would know me are the owners of the company. But they'll get some HR person who has no idea who I am. So basically, should I prepare to out myself to this employer, or is it unlikely they'd go back before my masters program to my non-academic job experience? I don't want them to reject me because it looks like I lied about my work history.

Aside from that, what about the question, ""have you gone by a previous name?"" Academia tends to stay away from those invasive questions. I've never had to answer that since transitioning... Tbh, I was also handed jobs quite a bit, which fucked me up with remembering how to interview or what job applications even look like now. That's a whole other can of worms. When you're a PhD student and faculty see you as a productive researcher and valuable to furthering their own research agenda, they will ask you to do assistantships with them. They specifically have you in mind for that position...  And that happened to me with multiple faculty. I never had to look for jobs. I was handed them for 8 years. I'm rusty at interviewing or convincing anyone to hire me, to say the least. I just let my work speak for me for so long. 

I would be awesome to hire, imo, because I'm a huge stats nerd and enjoy teaching myself new things. I have evidence of what I can do through sole-authored publications (i.e., I was obviously responsible for carrying out the analyses). This is a huge sidenote unrelated to the transgender thing, but may also be an indicator of my being out of touch with what's normal on the job market, so worth asking: I think It would be neat if employers could fund stats and methods books that I get to keep as a work benefit, but that seems like a weird thing to ask during an interview, right? People ask about pay and other benefits, but I'm not sure if they'll be expecting ""can you add to my library for professional purposes?"" Hard copy books aren't very cost effective when ebooks exist. But a book/month plan, maybe lol? Idk, the kinds of jobs I imagine myself doing involve a library of books and continuous learning. I have a moderately sized library already and rely heavily on my stats and methods books. I don't really ask for much else, and I'm willing to move to some areas to work in person, but I can do remote. I'm probably more flexible than the average candidate. Not a fan of where I live, anyway, and I'm bored and want out, but I'll stay here if it ends up being a smart move. How do you convey to employers you really will move and have them take a risk on you when they already might see you as a liability? I've seen people assume we (trans people) will be crazy in the workplace and demand all kinds of things of others and accuse people of discriminating against us, and therefore, they worry we'll be a pain in the ass and a legal liability. I want nothing to do with whatever that shit is. I'm good. I want to fly under the radar.

Like I said, I do think I am a valuable job candidate, but I've also heard it's gotten nightmarish. I'm a social scientist, but I have the unique experience of having published with computer science academics in CS venues because I've worked on a lot of interdisciplinary projects. I have heard this is valuable for social scientists... Admittedly, though, I am stronger in stats and just learn what I need to do to get things done. I'm not a huge programmer. I have/can teach myself how to do things in R, and I've been using SPSS for 15 years. Basically, if I can't do it in SPSS, I'll do it in R. But I am going to be slower than people who really know the language well. I'm piecing together and editing code that's already been written, mostly. I don't trust computers, either, so I tend to check my math a lot. This might either come off as obsessive and perfectionistic, or a valuable skill because I am good at spotting when something is not right. I've gone on many a crusade to double-check something that seemed weird, and I'll be frank: some people have written shit I cannot figure out because I calculated it myself using the method they claimed to use and... No lol. They did something wrong. So despite being somewhat of an amateur with R, I have strong analytic skills. I know how to conduct a robust analysis and demonstrate what I did and why. I have been PI on three of my own projects and carried them through to publication. I have a very high publication rate, particularly first and sole authored, so ample evidence of producing work (which helps to prove perfection doesn't get in the way... I am just thorough). So I have actual skills here... I just worry other things will count against me and I'll never get a job. I shouldn't feel I have to hide my work, to be honest. I haven't done anything wrong by publishing it, but sometimes I wish I could. I didn't feel that way about those few publications on transgender folks until things got worse with anti-trans stuff the past few years. The internet has become rabid, and that's why I mostly pretend to be cisgender online. I will never use a main acct to post about being transgender, ever. 

I hear from my wife that she encounters the occasional hate for people like me at work. She never admits I'm transgender to them or defends transgender people, even. She doesn't want anyone to suspect she is associated with a transgender person. She pretends not to care. And I know that sounds sad, but it's the way it has to be because people now think it's appropriate to say rude shit casually at work as though it has anything to do with the job at hand.

I spent so much time in academia because it's something I knew I could do well. However, I have really come to hate the lack of work/life balance, and though I am safer here in what we all admit is a fairly left leaning institution across universities, I've been finding myself wanting one of those 9-5s. I need to live a life outside of work with structure, and I'd prefer someone else to create that structure for me by requiring me to show up from 9 to 5... I could probably get a tenure track position easily, but I really don't want one. I am not a huge fan of teaching. I'd really like to make an industry or government job work. What are some tricks to hide that I'm transgender effectively? Am I actually seen as a liability these days? They won't know for sure I am trans based on the publication, but the name thing will definitely be a problem if it comes up, and with jobs as scarce as they are, I can't look like I didn't exist at a job where I supervised people outside of academia. People already don't take the PhD years as seriously, it seems...",CuriousAd3565,0,0.5,0,1713343507,2024-04-17 08:45:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c64ve1/a_series_of_questions_about_how_to_handle_name/,4,2024
1c64k1f,Are they stringing me along?,"Hi, I been working in the IT department of a big medical private company for 2.5 years, I have a CTO and a team lead as my bosses.
My CTO has been giving me extra work with no compensation in the last year, this extra work makes it so I have to sacrifice work hours for the job that is actually on my job description.
The issue is that the CTO wants me to focus all of my time on his extra work yet doesn't tell my team lead to free me from my main work so I could make progress.. literally stuck in between 2 bosses...

My team lead told me that I'm next for a big promotion like 5 months ago..my CTO officially brought up the promotion in a yearly performance review in March(which also granted me a 15% increase in salary)
I asked 2 days ago and he said that the promotion is mine but he doesn't know when it will actually happen.. 
At this point my team lead keeps pushing for me to do my main work and my CTO keeps pushing me to do his extra work yet doesn't allocate me work hours to do it..(tell the team lead to let me work...)

It feels like they hang this ""promotion"" Infront of me to push me to do 2 jobs and this promotion won't happen..
This said promotion means dropping to 50% working off-site at a different company and getting a company car, and hopefully more increase in pay(am I allowed to ask for an increase to offset the company car expenses?)",PancakeDeAwesome,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1713342150,2024-04-17 08:22:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c64k1f/are_they_stringing_me_along/,4,2024

1c63j6f,I want to report to HR but i feel like it is my fault.,"To begin, im 18F. I just turned 18 in october and although it is not that short of a time ago, i still do not feel like an adult. I am very vulnerable and young and make stupid decisions. 

I work at a restraunt as a togo specialist and the head of my area of the restaurant (shift lead) is 21M. After his first shift training me he found my instagram and started dming me. I responded as we were beginning to get along as friends.

 However, after a while the conversations started to get more intense. He was very suggestive and after about a week he was calling me around 3am asking me to come to his house. He made a strange joke about how my dad is absent and how i ""only like him because he's older than me."" Which was the first comment of his that made me uncomfortable.. I told him that I would come over and then he kept saying that we shouldnt do this and it wouldnt be right. So i agreed and i never went over. 

Ever since that conversation, he started getting touchy at work and would hold my hand when customers were not around and make suggestive comments. He started calling me every night around 1am-3am asking if he could pick me up or if i could go to his house. Kept asking me when i was free and i had flaked on him a few times because i knew in my heart that it did not feel good to be doing this. If i would flake on him i would go into work the next day and he would ignore me and make rude comments to me and this made me really upset because i felt like he saw me as less of a person and more as a sexual object. I thought we were friends until he started to show he ONLY wanted sexual relations with me.

One night he facetimed me and made me answer very innappropriate and invasive questions and would make me feel really bad if i tried to hang up. I only kept this whole situation going so long because i feared the awkwardness and uncomfortableness at work if i had cut it off. Or the fact thathe could tell other coworkers things that are not true and theyt would believe him and not me. After this specific phonecall i started to be really uncomfrtable with the whole situation and i stopped interracting with him at work.  I stopped texting him and we did not talk for about a week until i saw him again at work. That day at work he was very rude to me, yelled at me 3 times and completely ignored if i needed help or anything. I realzied when i got home that he blocked me on everything. 

Today I worked with him and it was my breaking point. I could feel the tension between us all shift and it made me really uncomfrtable to know that the only reason he does not like me is because i would not pursue him sexually. I am also worried that because of his position he can send me home early and mess with my hours, as today i was sent home earlier than normal. 

I want to report him to HR but I am horrified. He made me add him on snapchat so, verbatim, I have no reciepts of him saying things to me. Which proves to me that he knows he is in the wrong in some way. But because of that, I have no proof. I have no genuine evidence that he was saying these things to me. And also, i feel like its my fault because i was entertaining the situation in the beggining but it was not until recent that i realized just how disgusting and used i feel. I plan on quitting my job or getting a transfer to another location because i genuinely cant be in the same building as him or i get anxious and uncomfortable.

I just dont know what to do. Am i in the wrong? Should i go to HR?",Sufficient_Stock_417,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1713337861,2024-04-17 07:11:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c63j6f/i_want_to_report_to_hr_but_i_feel_like_it_is_my/,4,2024

1c63ge3,Seeking guidance !!,"Hey everyone, I hope you're doing well. So, here's a bit about me: I graduated in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 2023 from a tier 3 college. Back then, I had a couple of job offers in my field, but I couldn't bring myself to accept them because I was really unsure about what I wanted. It sounds silly, but I was honestly lost. All I wanted was to figure out what I'm passionate about, and that led me to make some pretty questionable decisions. I started dabbling in coding and even took some offline classes, but health issues forced me to put a pause on things and focus on self-study from home. Things were going okay for a while, but come September, that feeling of uncertainty crept back in. I found myself wasting time scrolling through Instagram instead of making progress. It wasn't until March that I snapped out of it and realized I needed to get back on track if I wanted to be the best version of myself. So, I restarted my journey of self-discovery, but now I'm facing a new dilemma. I'm torn between different paths: should I explore opportunities in the business field, like becoming a business analyst? Or should I stick with my interest in coding and delve into Java Full Stack Development? And then there's the option of combining my love for technology and creativity by pursuing a career in UI/UX design. I know this might seem like a random post to some, maybe even fodder for mockery or discouragement, considering the time I've wasted. But deep down, I'm genuinely seeking guidance.

During the break I was also taking accelerated winter classes and got incredibly burnt out from the stress of doing both internships and the classes. Once the spring semester started I went back to remote only once a week but really began to feel overwhelmed with my final semester. I would miss days due to school commitments and eventually just stopped going all together last month. After a few weeks my name was taken off of the schedule.

1c5zvxp,Boreout and accumulating skills,"I'm in the tech industry, 7+ years and still going as a Software QA to be specific, but always gets assigned/lands in manual role - not all tasks can be automated though.

From my previous experiences, I had hands-on with no/low code automation using in-house tools, and on another testing job even got trained before being assigned to a project with  high-code automation testing but again, unfortunately got assigned to a manual team again (automation team at that time has no vacant), but on the other hand, I learned new tools/tech.

Now reflecting from all of these, it felt like I am just accumulated a lot skills yet I can't even properly apply/level it up evenly alongside with my manual.

1. Let's say for the automation part as a QA, current work has no plans yet (honestly it's been a plan for long already even way back before I joined them). 

2. Then, recently I had enrolled and even got certified in a certain management framework course from which I got interested during my previous work (the one that trained me in high-code automation) and I did this to prepare myself if some opportunity presents itself. All I have is a 25% hands-on experience on that role which also the reason for really taking interest to transition to that. But not sure yet when I can apply this in actual setup as current work is also not using the kind of framework I got certified into --- I already have plans of leaving already and actively searching (I don't jump out without securing a new landing), but the jobs that always gets attracted to my skillset is always manual testing and if I continue this it would like defeat the purpose of taking this course and even getting certified.

While on the hunt it got me thinking, if I want to continue to pursue testing that has automation mixed with manual, I cannot be accepted easily since I have low experience on it or been long off from it, and the tools I used before are in-house. As for the recent certified skill, it would be a first time doing it officially if ever I will be accepted into one, and on a company stand-point, I would not risk someone doing it without experience yet.",Rare-Present-3689,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1713324841,2024-04-17 03:34:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5zvxp/boreout_and_accumulating_skills/,4,2024

She, my boss, is leaving due to hernia removal and she wants me to do her computer work such as putting new residents in and also their diets. I expressed to her that I'm not in a good place mentally and that I do not feel that I'm right for that kind of responsibility and she got angry with me and told me that things will be different when she gets back. She also stated that she does everyone elses job but no one can seem to help her. Now was I wrong to express my true feelings? I'm honestly thinking about quitting but I don't want to let my team down while shes out since they'll have more work. Should I wait till she gets back to get possibly fired or put in a 2 weeks.

1c5ylda,Did I make the right choice? ,"In September I got my first job at a local small business. From the beginning they have been bad at paying me on time. Anywhere from 3 days to a week late. My grandfather did work for them at the store, and the one owner talked bad about him right in from of me. I went home crying that day. I wish I could’ve spoke up in that moment but I just freeze in moments like that. I became friend with the one owner which made it hard to speak up and ask to be paid or things to change. I started looking after there child (for free) on occasion. We had a new employee start recently and she is a lovely woman. She is a single mom so getting her pay on time is important to her. I have had to ask on several occasions to be paid on time but at some point just gave up. She made a point of asking for our pay on pay day last week. He gave us both our pay stubs and paid her but not me. 

I got hurt Sunday and couldn’t go to work Monday so I messaged and said I wouldn’t be in. He sent me a message saying that he’s noticed excessive time off recently. I had Covid and the flu so that was my only reason for time off. 

My mom talked me into sending a message basically saying everything that was wrong and at the end just that I feel it’s in my best interest to leave my position. It felt good to do but at the same time devastating. I feel like it’s for the best just with how upset I was after they were speaking bad about my grandfather in front of me. And they were 100% wrong in what they were saying about him too. I just feel so conflicted with my life right now. Especially being very close to there child makes me sad thinking I won’t get to see him anymore. After I quit she messaged me back but didn’t really take accountability for any of the things that took place.

1c5xgj1,What are the best careers where I can work independently and make money? ,"I'm lost in where I can take my career. I'm at the point where I'd like to do a job that I can at least tolerate my job but also make money where I'm not struggling financially.  I like my current job driving for Amazon but without overtime it's not enough.   My current Amazon DSP only gives overtime during peak season and prime weeks.   

I have my bachelor degree in accounting but after 15 years going nowhere with that, I have no interest in going back into accounting.  My current job with Amazon I love the independence of not bring micromanaged and petting cute dogs all day.

The struggle of not making enough to pay for things like car repairs and having to restrict everything I do so I'm not going into debt is catching up to me. It's very stressful not knowing what to do. 

What kind of jobs are there that I can actually do something that I enjoy and tolerate and make money?  Ideally if I can work towards making $70k/$80k a year would be great. Other home daily driving jobs around me (Pittsburgh PA area) don't seem to pay a lot.

1c5winz,Can I clear my name?,"I’ve been with the company for four years, consistently delivering strong performance. During my boss’ leave of absence, I was transferred to a new team/role with a new manager (a valuable and well respected move). Recently, I had a productive discussion with my new manager about my performance and expectations. I realized that I hadn't fully met their expectations in my new role, but we made a plan to improve, and I've been making great progress that my manager is satisfied with.

However, recently my manager informed me that HR flagged me for poor performance/maybe a PIP because my performance from the previous evaluation period was also poor, while I was still in my old role. This is completely new news to me and is very surprising because I was never informed of this poor rating and don’t even know who submitted the evaluation while my old manager was on leave or what I was evaluated on (in hindsight I should have gotten clarity on this before their leave. My current manager believes that it was leaders that I have never interacted with or worked with directly and had no insight into my work). Now, because my current boss logged my recent mediocre performance from this most recent evaluation, it looks like I did not improve from one evaluation period to the next, which has put me in hot water. 

My current boss was surprised to hear that I was unaware of my previous poor evaluation prior to joining their team. I've asked for more information about what I was evaluated on in the previous period and who assessed my performance. I'm also trying to understand what this means for my future at the company.

Any advice on what I can do to clear my name or, if I even have a chance? Can I appeal the unjustified poor rating from when my previous boss was on leave?",mooseisloose_12,2,1.0,5,1713314905,2024-04-17 00:48:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5winz/can_i_clear_my_name/,4,2024
1c5w8v7,How do I tell if it's a setup?,"So I had a write up conversation at work today. With my manager and the manager above and I'm not sure if something is just really bad timing or if it's the setup that it looks like it is.

To provide full context because I definitely don't want to give the impression that I'm the perfect employee, I've been late a few times and that was why I was getting in trouble. That's been happening due to transportation and health issues. However, in the same meeting they decided to tell me that I am going to be written up as well if we lose another bank card which is accessible to about half of the employees.

This bank card is specifically for one of things and while it isn't uncommon for somebody to take it, they are supposed to sign themselves out and I was always supposed to keep track of them. The previous management administration said that it's not my fault if it gets lost because somebody took it without signing themselves out. Essentially saying that their adults and if they make that choice then it's on them. This administration is saying it wasn't my fault before but from now on it will be and that I'll get written up if it happens again.

Prior to this, I had put in a multitude of concerns and suggestions to my managers about the accessibility of the card. They don't want it locked away and they still want it to be something that myself or my boss or the other people in the office can easily get to for the purpose of handing out to the rest and it's important that they get signed out. That being said, it is crucial that one of them isn't lost on my watch or I'll get written up. However, the others weren't lost on my watch. They were taken when I was away from my desk fulfilling other parts of my duties.

So while I'm not being blamed for following instructions before, the new instruction that they're giving really feels like they're trying to get a reason to fire me.

1c5vts3,Deciding between two jobs.,"This will be my first job that pays above minimum wage. 

First job pays from $17-$20 an hour and is the exact same title i have been working under for the past five years- ""office assistant"" but at a larger business with a slightly higher salary and a great benefits package. Job description is receiving calls  - overseeing accounts payable and receivable, reconciling warranty claims things like that. 

The other job title is ""Client Account Administrator"" which only requires me to oversee accounts receivable and track down outstanding invoices - and it pays 22.50 an hour with decent benefits but I feel I'm still really under-qualified for the job. I've also never really had to deal with vendor contracts or anything. The job requires a formal education in accounting which i don't have but the recruiter privately reached out to me. The job isn't listed anywhere online.

I feel that I'd be much more comfortable in the first job. The thought of working the second job fills me with dread for some reason but I feel like that title would look good on my resume rather than another office assistant job. it is sort of the lucky next step in the natural trajectory of my career but it fills me with horrible dread so yeah. I'm not sure which job will set me on a better path. I don't plan on doing accounting or administration for the rest of my life. This is just a fluke summer job, but I have this gut feeling that this decision will shape future job opportunities in a major way.

1c5t3kn,College freshman interested in PT freaking out about my future. Where should I be focusing my energy?,"Hi everybody—I’m currently a 19F finishing up my first year of college who has been having a bit of a career crisis lately. I would be super appreciative of some advice about where I should be headed next, thoughts from people currently in the field/s I’m interested in, or just some reassurance if nothing else! :)

I’ve really had trouble settling on what career to pursue. I can’t really afford to float around in college searching for what sparks joy, sadly—I have very little financial support, and a pretty tenuous relationship with my family, so they’re difficult to fall back on (though not impossible) if things go wrong. If I’m careful about my spending, work as much as I can, and continue getting scholarships, I’m confident that I can graduate college with little to no debt, but I need to be VERY focused on what I want—no room for extra classes. Now that I’m reaching the end of my freshman year and about halfway through my GUR’s, I’m really starting to get nervous about my career plans, and having second thoughts. 

My big thing is that I really like the healthcare field. I feel like helping people and medicine are some of my biggest passions, and if possible, I’d like to stay in a career focused on it. However, I also can’t lie that salary is also an important factor for me (I live in very high COL areas and am not super interested in moving elsewhere), and I’m hoping to maintain a work/life balance (not be on call, reasonable 40-50hr work week, etc)—something I know is pretty hard to come across in the healthcare field. 

I landed on becoming a physical therapist as a result—apparently decent pay, a good work/life balance, and in high demand—and that’s what I’ve currently been planning on doing, with an undergrad major in kinesiology. But the more I learn about it and hear about what people in the profession are *actually* saying, the more nervous I get… the idea of being “trapped” in a role scares me, and apparently there is very little upward mobility in PT past a certain point, and the program is usually very expensive for what peak salary ends up being. I know loans are basically inevitable, but the less I have to take out, the better. The whole thing just looks a bit bleak.

Anyways, tl;dr, I’m freaking out that PT might not be what I want it to be for me. Are there other healthcare roles with more flexibility/transferable skills that still have decent salaries and aren’t soul sucking 80hr work weeks? I feel like healthcare is where I belong, but I don’t want to set myself up for failure, either.

Do I just need a reality check? I know healthcare as a field isn’t “easy,” but am I expecting too much from it? 

Thank you all in advance!

1c5rs47,Career Options in India After 12th Grade,"I'm reaching out on behalf of my brother, who is currently in a bit of a dilemma regarding his career path after completing 12th grade in science. Unlike me, who is pursuing engineering here in the USA, he's not keen on following the same path. Our father runs an engineering business, which has made my brother a bit hesitant about pursuing engineering as well.  
He's looking for something unique and exciting in the business domain, preferably in India. He's intrigued by India's rapid growth and doesn't feel the need to come to the USA right away. He's exploring the idea of pursuing a major related to entrepreneurship but is unsure if it's worth it.  
However, he's also incredibly talented on the intelligence side, and we're torn between choosing a path that blends his business interests with his intellectual abilities. Personally, I want him to have a fulfilling college experience, where he can meet new people, work on exciting projects, and have fun while pursuing his academic goals.  
We're seeking advice on what colleges, majors, and cities in India would be worth considering for someone interested in business but looking for something different. He's particularly interested in areas that offer excellent networking opportunities and exposure to the business world.  
Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help.",Some_Fly_2001,0,0.5,2,1713302623,2024-04-16 21:23:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5rs47/career_options_in_india_after_12th_grade/,4,2024

1c5rljs,I can’t find a job. Should I go back to school for something else?,"I’m 27-years-old and recently graduated with a computer science degree in December of 2023. I was in school for about 6 years because I wanted to take it slow to graduate without any debt. However, I have been completely unable to find a job for the past 4 months. I’m applying to jobs I’m qualified for (entry-level w/ no experience and new grad positions), but I’m not getting any interviews at all. The only places that have called back were ones that sound like scams where they train you, lock you in a contract, and make you pay about $20k if you leave early for that training. I’m desperate that I’m considering this, even though it might be career suicide. I don’t know.

The thing is, I have zero related work/internship experience to help with my resume, which I know is absolute shit. The only thing I have going for me for these positions is my 4.0 GPA because they often list a GPA requirement. That’s really it. At this point, I’m wondering if I should just cut my losses if nobody wants to even interview me. I want to work in this field, but I’m trying to be realistic here.

I’m thinking about going back to school for something in the medical field or something else that can help better ensure a job after graduation. I graduated without any debt, so I would have to take out student loans to graduate sooner than it took me for my current degree. Is this wise? I really just want a fucking job to move on with my life.

1c5qtt6,Suffering as an environmental consultant and needing help,"Hi everyone,

10 months ago I (23M) graduated college, moved from MI, and took an environmental scientist role at a small environmental consulting company in TN. I thought I was going to love the job, but it has been **hell**. 

The onboarding process was a nightmare, where I was instantly overloaded with work and had to remind them I needed training. This is supposed to be a travel job, but in those first three months I was stuck doing data entry for 1.5 months. Just staring at spreadsheets and convoluted air permits all day. My boss is incompetent and, no matter how much you prod him, cannot, or refuses to, explain even the simplest things. This creates a TON of stress, especially in the field. The culture sucks, and I am a bad fit. The lab is also poorly kept and feels like a safety hazard. We have had to do sketchy field work at a landfill (which I was never told was a possibility when joining), which also tainted the experience.  Training is extremely hard to come by, with everyone seemingly too busy to properly teach me any of the necessary skills to do this job properly. I feel set up to fail with every task. I am also constantly asked to do random BS tasks that are definitely not in the job description. For example, for the last three weeks I have been packing up shelves and our in-office library of books and reports, rather than doing anything actually environment-related. It's frustrating, and the other new hire, who was hired around the same time I was, feels very similarly. I was put through 4-day wetland delineation training (which was less than acceptable, in my opinion) last summer, only to never do a delineation. I am anxiety-ridden and need out of this job ASAP.

 I have an Environmental Science degree (environmental biology minor), and I am looking for any and all advice here. What kinds of jobs can I get with one year of environmental consulting experience? What should I look for? I love the travel and biology-related aspects of this job, but consulting, at least at this company, is not what I thought it was. At some point I want to get a masters in wildlife conservation, but it's very competitive and not an option right now. 

If you can spare a moment, I would deeply appreciate advice at this difficult time in my life.",Fancy_Telephone_5263,1,1.0,3,1713300283,2024-04-16 20:44:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5qtt6/suffering_as_an_environmental_consultant_and/,4,2024
1c5qlpf,"Let go from generous Talent Acquisition role, feeling lost (24M)","Recently, I experienced a significant shift in my career path, and I'm seeking some advice and perspective on how to navigate it.  
I've been working as a talent acquisition specialist at a small pharmaceutical company based in NC, initially starting as an intern and gradually transitioning to a full-time role. During my 3.5 years tenure, I had some remarkable opportunities, such as being flown to HQ in Europe, receiving several raises, and maintaining a manageable workload, averaging around 25-30 hours per week.  
However, around midway through my second year, I started to feel a sense of stagnation and demotivation. This was primarily due to the repetitive nature of my tasks, challenges in working with certain hiring managers, and a perceived lack of opportunities for advancement. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I found myself becoming complacent and feeling entitled to more significant roles and responsibilities within the company. When I raised these concerns with my manager, I was gently reminded that the nature of recruiting often involves working on boring roles as needed.  
The most difficult part for me is pursuing something I'm passionate enough to stay interested in - as recruitment in that company wasn't enough to hold my engagement. I wasn't able to commit to any graduate degrees, coding languages, or new fields while I was employed. Now, I realize it was a gift to be employed in the first place. It feels like I will have to make a forced decision into this next chapter without giving myself the grace to think it through.  
In hindsight, I realize that took my position for granted. While I continued to fulfill my responsibilities (until the end), I struggled to find the same level of motivation and drive that I once had. This complacency eventually led to my recent layoff, which has left me feeling a mix of guilt, regret, and shame.  
However, I'm determined to view this experience as an opportunity for growth and reflection. Since my layoff, I've had two interviews—one for a talent acquisition role and another for a sales position. While I'm awaiting feedback from both, I can't help but feel apprehensive about potentially falling into the same cycle of complacency if I accept a similar role for less pay.  
With this in mind, I'm reaching out to this forum for advice and guidance. How can I ensure that I approach future opportunities with the right mindset? How can I avoid repeating the same mistakes and cultivate a sense of enthusiasm and motivation in my work? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  
Thank you all for taking the time to read this and for any advice you may have to offer.",Ok_Preference6441,1,1.0,4,1713299741,2024-04-16 20:35:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5qlpf/let_go_from_generous_talent_acquisition_role/,4,2024

1c5q51x,Easy Resume Tweaks to Land More Interviews,"Your resume can be filled with qualifications and experience, but there’s a key step you might be missing. Most companies use software that scans resumes for specific keywords. If your resume doesn't contain the right percentage of these keywords, it won’t make it to a hiring manager's desk.  
For instance, if you’re great at frontend engineering and the job requires expertise in Angular, stating just ""frontend developer"" might not be enough. The software can't recognise that these are related skills unless you specify ""Angular developer.""  
**Here's what to do:**  
**1. Customize Your Resume:** Start with a master resume and tailor it for each job. Add keywords from the job description where they make sense—within your experiences, skills list, or your summary.  
**2. Mention the Role in Your Summary:** If you haven't had the exact role before, but your skills match, mention this in your summary. For example: ""With my extensive experience in X and Y, I am well-suited for the role of Z."" This helps your resume get past automated screenings, especially if the job is looking for specific past roles.  
**3. Always Include a Cover Letter:** Even if it's listed as optional, a cover letter can set you apart. Make sure it includes relevant keywords and complements your resume.  
**4. Use Tools for Help:** If tailoring your resume and cover letter sounds daunting, use tools like echotalent AI to insert relevant keywords and Jobscan to ensure your resume matches the job description effectively.  
Remember, these tips aren't just suggestions—they're crucial steps to ensure your resume gets the attention it deserves in a competitive job market.",hola-mundo,1,1.0,0,1713298622,2024-04-16 20:17:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5q51x/easy_resume_tweaks_to_land_more_interviews/,4,2024

1c5oywp,I did this to myself,"I'll try to keep this short, but there is a lot of context.

I am a masters student and I was offered a job opportunity last summer on a casual basis as a project manager. Simply put, the job was working for the hospital but funded by my university, for that reason, I would not be able to get an official contract or pay until school resumed in the fall but there was work to be done in the interim. Not a lot, I maybe worked 20 hours total before receiving a contract.

I normally am very firm in not working for free, but I wasn't counting on the money, I just wanted the experience for my resume and knew I was taking a risk working without a contract.

Ultimately, I received my contract and the rate of pay was low, barely above minimum, and the job title was student research assistant despite the fact that I was given the responsibilities of a project manager and introduced as the project manager by my leader.

I'll be honest, i was disappointed and as a result have not been prioritizing the job or going above and beyond in my duties. I will do tasks that are asked of me directly, but if for example I am asked to email someone and they don't respond I have not been following up with them.


The contract is coming up for renewal in June and the leader has asked me if i would like to continue and how we can work better together since she has been feeling on her own lately. Would i be in the wrong for telling her i have been prioritizing spending time with my child, my schooling, and personal matters over taking initiative in this job since my job title and compensation are not aligned with what I feel her expectations are?

1c5oump,I broke my compass and I need to find a way ahead.,"I'm feeling kinda stuck right now and hoping to get some advice from people who have already been through it. Here's the deal:

  
Did IBDP, and got decent grades (around 34) even with some extracurriculars like a short film project and a podcast! And got a CAS award for that, I was not a kid who liked to study even a bit. Due to some family stuff, I couldn't go and study abroad. Ended up staying in India now to big shocker came that most of the good universities need a JEE score (if u know JEE and IB don't go hand in hand), secondly, I applied to an average uni that accepted students not only based on their marks, that basically asked for a donation amount to get in, and my family...well, let's just say they weren't exactly supportive (harsh words about ""deserving"" things). Ended up at a private engineering college in India (Tier 3, I guess?). After all that ""deserving"" part I tried to work hard and push myself out of my comfort zone(moved to another city and currently studying there) Now I have a 9.23 CGPA, the highest in my whole Mechanical Engineering Department of 2nd year Engg. I've been trying my best to grab all opportunities outside of classes too! Submitted some conference stuff and even have their paper ready to present. I've also done a couple of projects, one where I built something and another using computer modelling (CAD). Back in high school, I even did my EE in Physics HL on this Li-Fi technology (pretty futuristic, right?). I am also part of my uni's Placom (got some reality check there). Now for the hard part. When I think about the long run, I have NO idea what I want to do. Feels like I'm just wandering around.

  
1 - Masters Abroad (then Back to India): Sounds good, but gotta pick a field with a future. Plus, it's expensive as heck, and I don't want to burden my parents after the whole ""we won't help you"" thing.  
2 - The Job Hunt: Seems like jobs are scarce these days, especially for mech engineers. Any leads on who might hire interns? Asking for a friend... (it's me)  
3 - Family Business: Pays enough to cover the basics, but sounds like a dead-end with no room to grow. Plus, I'd basically need permission to breathe from my family. Feels kinda of suffocating.

  
Ugh, remember when I thought good grades were the answer to everything? Now I'm questioning if all this effort is even taking me anywhere. Feeling like I'm just pushing against a wall.  My parents are also new to the whole ""college thing"" so they can't offer much guidance.

  
Basically, I'm lost at sea with a broken compass!  Does anyone have any advice or maybe even some other options I haven't considered?

1c5nvhv,"Student in College, about to graduate and I still have no idea what to do.","Hello, I am a college student that is about to graduate with a major in Business Administration. I still have no idea what to use it for.

The only passion that I have is art. I have created art for as long as I can remember. It has always been my number 1 hobby that has come naturally to me. I am not into any other art form other than traditional art with real paint, pencils etc. I have thought about starting my own art business for a while now, knowing that it will possibly take years to kick off. I get it, I know that art is an unpredictable route to go towards. But I have been viewing hundreds of other artists on instagram and they are making reasonable money because of the opportunity the internet provides for artists. I look at some of the artists and some of them make minimalistic doodles and still have over 100K followers with a shop. That gives me hope and inspiration, seeing hundreds of successful artists with thousands of followers. 

The problem with me though, is the fact that I have no creativity. My whole life, I have looked at photographs and drew/painted/sculpted exactly that. And while I am a great craftsman and can create what I see and it turn out to look like the photo, a camera can also do that. An artist is someone who has creativity and can look at a photograph and see what can be done to change it in a better way, if that makes sense. The other problem is that many people advise against turning your hobby into your job. 

I will probably have to get a job until my art business potentially takes off. I don't ever want any kids, so I don't really have to earn all that much money because I will be supporting myself only. 

I just don't want to live a life hating my job as so many people seem to be doing and complaining about (which is 100% understandable and why I want to pursue art).

Then I worked as a store manager for a high end children’s boutique. The “main brand” is a very very popular women’s store, and this was the “new” children/baby boutique is where I worked. I became familiar with lots of components of business operations, communication between team and corporate, helping them come up with sales ideas and creative marketing solutions, taking pictures for social media, etc. I feel like this is good work experience because I had a “higher responsibility” position than a typical associate at a big brand, but in its “start up” brand. And it was very successful (our store at least - there were 5 others built when I left) making almost a million dollars in its first “year” that was actually only 9 months. I left this job because I was still in school and I was not able to get the work life balance needed for me to do well in school (and be a mom). 

Then I took an internship with a non-profit as a grant writer. I had zero experience and when they hired me, they thought I was a seasoned grant writer who had already graduated. They were actually extremely disorganized and chaotic if I’m being honest. Even fighting on zoom calls. It was so awkward lol but anyway, i surprisingly thrived. I understood the grant process easily and ended up being a key part in the creation of a new urban farming program for refugees. I even created the budget and did 90% of the marketing ideas. The grants I wrote for $5,000-$50,000, and I know at least two were successful but I was no longer there to see what others had been successful or not. (Which was most of the grants I’d written). 

After that internship ended, I continued looking for work. But to no avail. I’ve been applying places since August 2023 and I have had zero luck. My dad said I’m being lazy and choosy. But the jobs I apply for are not picky. I apply from jobs that are $15/hr to jobs paying $60k a year. I absolutely think I’m capable of doing any job I apply for, and I don’t try to just get some easy high dollar job. People keep saying it’s the market and it’s just bad right now. But that doesn’t work with me because I need money. So something needs figured out. 

If you were me, what job would you go for? What pay could you see me making? What do I need to “get real” about? Be honest. Be brutal. I don’t care, I need a job. 

I’m interested in creativity, teamwork, marketing, writing, program development, planning, business development, etc. I like fashion/beauty, sustainability, charity, community development, human interest, tech, engineering, etc. I like many things, so I’m flexible with industry.

1c5nhp5,Job Gaps while applying/interviewing for other jobs; insignificant or not?,"Hi all. So a lot of context to get a solid opinion, long read warning; if you have any questions before imparting any advice let me know and I’ll try to answer  
  
In my early 20s, I work as an ""accounting analyst"" at a local tax firm, specializing in reinsurance, since October after a summer stint with my dad. Have a bachelors in accounting 2023  
  
While I appreciate the accounting experience, I'm honestly disinterested and even hate parts of the job, especially the industry-specific insurance aspects. Despite enduring long hours during busy season, the experience feels lacking compared to larger public accounting firms, and the high turnover rate, with even close friends leaving, suggests underlying company issues. Inadequate training, a toxic workplace environment, and inconsistent management feedback add to the challenges.  
  
Now that busy season is over, I'm strongly considering leaving without another job lined up to explore opportunities in public accounting, given my financial security for at least a year.  
  
However, I'm concerned about potential employer perception of a job history gap and its long-term impact, seeking professional opinions on how this scenario might be viewed in the industry. Should I endure the current situation while searching for a better job, or is it better to leave now despite the uncertainty just for my mental and physical healths sake? Does it matter having a small gap in employment in the long term?  
  
I genuinely am not sure what choice to make, as I’ve gotten so many different responses from friends, family, mentors, etc.",No_Chef_4362,1,1.0,0,1713292195,2024-04-16 18:29:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5nhp5/job_gaps_while_applyinginterviewing_for_other/,4,2024

1c5lkns,How to Choose Between 2 Jobs?,"Hello

I live in the Midwest and already have my Bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts. It's been hard to find a job out of call centers so I'm pivoting to a new industry in the Healthcare field and need some advice.

I have 2 job offers, Job #1 - gives me growth opportunities and a feeling like I am contributing for the greater good but the pay is less than what I am currently making now and the hours are slightly less (32 hrs instead of 40/week) and I have to work at least 1 weekend day every week, work all holidays. There is room for growth as I can be cross trained into other things to possibly change my hours (and possibly change my pay). This position gives me the experience I need so I can go back to school within the next year or 2. It's a mixture of administrative duties please assistant duties to doctors.


Job #2 - has a more predictable schedule M-F 8-5, no weekends or holidays, a full 40 hr work week and pay is about the same. The experience could help me in my career aspirations, but it doesn't have as much responsibility as Job #1, but the work I would do is more just administrative (answering phones,  taking appointments, verification of insurance,  etc). But since the hours are a full 40 hrs per week I would be making more initially, but I'm worried I would get stuck in that role with no room for growth.

Both companies have stellar reputation so that is what makes this hard.

The Job #1 has a lower pay overall since it's less hours, but I know I would have to take another job to make ends meet.

My question is this: would it be worth it to do Job #1 even though it's less pay starting because of the opportunities for growth down the road? Would it make more sense to do Job #2 to make the more money and have the stability/flexibility of having weekends and all holidays off?

1c5kkot,Feeling indecisive and guilty about leaving job,"Here's some short context: I'm 25 years old, I've worked 10 years in digital marketing for four different companies. Yes - I started my first internship at 15, I grew up having to financially support myself and build my future because my mom had cancer and was sick most of my childhood. Anyways, I always liked my jobs, the work was engaging, felt like innovation was happening, the culture was positive and I felt valued. 

The last job I had, new (and very toxic) management was what turned me off and I left for a two year hiatus to finish my bachelor's degree. Now I'm graduated and back in a corporate role for a new company, been here since November. I really like my manager, who is one of the owners, but everything else about the job I dislike. The job is bland, my coworkers are straight up rude and will ignore me to my face, there's no growth and no room to do anything differently, hustle-culture, no humanity, just feel like I am checking boxes everyday and there's no fulfillment to what I am doing. I tried talking to my boss about this and he advised me to learn how people operate so that I can try to create change and creativity for projects by persuasion.

 I feel stifled creatively, but the thing is this job is super easy. I don't want to be un-grateful and leave an easy job, however when I was doing grocery store delivery on the side during school I was making similar wages without sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day. I am also fearful that I may find a new job but that I won't have a great manager (ptsd from my last job) or that the work will be overwhelming and consuming. Although the job I'm at right now is easy, I don't enjoy the work life balance. 

My actual dream is to publish a book, but I can't even write anymore - I've developed insomnia and struggle feeling guilt for any choices I make. I also think I could try to freelance and have more control over how I spend my time, but everything feels scary right now. Overall I just feel like I don't want to sit through zoom meetings anymore.

1c5k6p6,Seasoned Procurement Manager looking for my first degree late in life. Can you help me pick one?,"Obligatory I'm on mobile so excuse formatting, spelling and grammar.

I'm at a crossroads in my career and I'm being forced to grow or eventually be laid off due to the shrinkage of the specific government sector I'm in (schools). 

Background:

- School: I grew up poor and at 18 got financial aid to goto community college. I left my parents house immediately after my HS graduation and couch surfed (for 5 years) because they were controlling and overprotective. I was too young and dumb and crashed my car and couldn't get to school anymore so I dropped out after a couple semesters and barely got any units.

At 21, I went back again, more mature and paid my way through another 3 semesters part time while working, mostly focusing on history and some gen ed, electives, etc. Then, I lost my primary job (I was working 2 at the time and still couch surfing) so I dropped out again.

At 25, I had moved to a new state and had a stable job so I went back to school again, this time for business. Got 3 semesters in, and got a new challenging job and decided to drop out to focus on this new career path. 

Work:

I'll go quick through this part and only reference parts that advanced my career:

- Restaurant Supervisor/Asst. Manager for 2 different corporate fast casual spots 2006-2011.

- High performing B2C/B2G phone sales associate in automotive aftermarket parts sector - 8 months in 2011.

- 5 years of a different automotive aftermarket sector phone sales job, 1.5 as an associate and 3.5 as a manager of Purchasing and Sales manager. Lots of B2G and B2B sales. 

- 3 years as B2B Account Executive - good performance but when I left, the bridge was burned sue to their own hurt feelings, so no reference available.

- 3+ Years Government Agency Puechasing Manager.

Currently: Now here I am. I'll be demoted due to budget cuts next year and likely laid off within the next 2-3 years. My plan is to complete and online BS degree at WGU at night while working. The question is now, what degree? Supply Chain and Operations Management? Accounting? Finance? IT Management?

Goals:

- Stay in government if at all possible. The PTO to be with my young family is precious and more plentiful in government. Also, government is generally more flexible and understanding with kid obligations.

- Work my way back up to a management/director position. I like having a team to develop and work with and the flexibility to focus on big picture strategy. 

- Flexibility: Maybe the government thing won't work out, I'd like to still be desirable to the private sector. I'm a high performer, hard worker, and fast learner, even at almost 40. 

- Stability: I want to stay ahead of the AI layoff wake.

- Process Improvement: I really enjoy analyzing processes and improving them. 

Weaknesses:

- Not formally trained in math. I hated math as a kid/young adult. But I'm pretty good with Excel and using AI to assist with generating advanced functions. 

- I need to be challenged. Right now, even as a Purchasing Manager, I'm bored. I want more work, I want more advanced work that requires me to think and push myself. I've written the manuals and automated/improved all the processes for this place and now I'm not really needed, hence the demotion. 

Conclusion: What degree will help me the most in advancing my career and achieve my goals now that I'm almost 40, have 12 years of management, and experience in various sectors? 

My thoughts: Thus far I'm leaning toward Supply Chain and Ops Management because I'd like to stay out of sales unless it's in a management/coaching/kpi analysis position. Plus most of my management experience is in procurement/purchasing despite not having the knowledge/lingo/software experience that the degree will give me. But most supply chain folk say major in something else so you have something else to bring to the table. I feel like IT Management might be a bit of a stretch for my skills. Sure I can work my way around building a computer, learn software, and use AI to build some killer spreadsheets and dashboards, but IT management feels scary.

with that being said, a client of ours who ive been working with for the past few years recently came to me in private essentially offering me a job. given the nature of my work, there are not too many people that can do excactly what i do. there is currently a known shortage of professionals with experience in my industry. 

currently, im making around 63k a year and the client has stated that if i were to be hired their starting base salary for the postion would be mid 70s but that i can potentially negotiate more. while thats extremly tempting because i know the nature of the work and from what i can see it would be less work for more money. 

my only hesitation is that the comany ive been with has told me very bluntly that a promotion would happen soon, the problem with that is its been said to be since after my 1st year working here, and since then people with less tenure have been promoted before me. ive since had a 6% raise since i started but im torn on what the best move would be. i know how much money the company i work for makes off me and i find it hard to see them mathcing what i might be offered because if my hourly rate was to be increased at my current job, they wouldnt make as much as they are now. 

any advice would be helpful! i dont really want to switch over if theres a promotion down the way but i also dont want to let this oppurtunity pass because i know there will be room for growth there too.

1c5jcm9,What to do with my political science degree ,"Hi folks. Graduated 2 years ago with a political science degree as that seems to be the golden degree for those who want to go to law school. Luckily did get into law school and am there. 
However, I have a poli sci degree with an intl studies minor, many scholarly publications, and strong work ethic. My uni was quite a respected one.

Long störy short, I’ve been working at unrelated jobs in the chemical plants making easy money. I make $25 per hour and they pay me to drive to work. They don’t require college degrees. I’m sure the degree helps. I could probably move up to manager based largely on having academic success even though it’s a totally unrelated field. 

But I spent 4 blazing years on this thing. If I was an international student this would have been a hundred thousand dollar degree. I want it to be worth something. There are some jobs across America that of course look for bachelors degrees like mine, I would highly assume that a whopping maj of them want multiple years of experience, which makes the vein  in my forehead erupt.  I want to get a job right out of the gates that makes me feel like my degree is a key, not just a coin that won’t hurt me. 

I understand that engineers probably can walk out in their robe and degree in hand and land a big dollar job in a comfortable office. I don’t think that is necessarily the same for liberal arts degrees. But, at the end of the day, shouldn’t having a degree as a requisite ordinarily garner and demand higher pay from a job than some unrelated unskilled craft? It seems without a masters or significant work experience, I will make the same or less as I do now in some junior level political role designed for college students. 

If someone can learn how to be a hole watch in a plant in 1 day and clear $20 an hour (not my job, but I have done it) sitting around and doing easy work, how can I explain to an intending international student that paying for a degree here in any non STEM field is worth a cool 150k",Sharp-Situation3586,1,1.0,1,1713282302,2024-04-16 15:45:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5jcm9/what_to_do_with_my_political_science_degree/,4,2024

1c5jbe7,Huge Dilemma in Job Offer!,"Will try to make a long story relatively shorter.  
My boss left my current job a month or so ago and said she recommended me for the position. Fast forward, I have gone through the whole interview process and yesterday, I was officially told I would be getting offered the position. The offer letter will be coming through at some point this week. This position is Marketing Manager with 4 direct reports, essentially the head of marketing for the US, with a track to have the Marketing Director title within a year or 2. Salary range given was $110,000 - $120,000. Not sure what the offer is yet. Also I work remote - 3 days in office, 2 days at home.  
Now a huge side note - they offered me a Manager position, with one direct report in Sept 2023. In that situation they said I would have 6-9 months to prove myself within this position, and at the end of that period, I would see a 7% pay increase. I was not happy with that as I'd be doing the job, and not seeing the monetary benefits, plus I feel as though I am pretty underpaid with what I bring, so I asked for 15% (I know it's a lot, but it's on par with the market). Long story, short - the offer was rescinded, they told me they only want what's best for me, that I don't trust the company, and they couldn't offer me what I wanted so they took the offer off the table. I felt 7% was a bit offensive, as they gave me 5% for my annual raise the year prior. I currently sit around $84,000. Before I left, my previous manager told me marketing is very underpaid at this current company.  
Now my dilemma, I have been in talks with a company in a different state. They want me to come in for an interview next week. The position has a ""Manager"" in the title, but there are no direct reports. The job is pretty much what I do now, if anything, there may be less responsibility because it's a larger team. The job would be remote, with visits to the office every 5 weeks or so (2-hour flight). They said salary was $110,000. I already told them I would fly out next week to meet the team for the next step.  
I am seriously stressed right now because my job now is expecting me to sign my offer letter this or next week, with a target start date of next week or May 1st. The timing is horrible and I just don't know what to do.  
Any advice would be much appreciated because I just have no clue what to do. I know there's no offer in place at the other job, but I feel it's a very strong possibility of getting the job.

I was recently told that the position is being eliminated and they offered me to stay on as a fitness coach. If i do not accept that job, they are asking me to resign.

I do not want to stay as a fitness coach as my current hours are 40 hours per week and being a trainer would start me at 10 hours per week.

1c5ijw2,Should I negotiate my salary if I'm already happy with it?,"Title says most of my dilemma.

I found a company that is interested in my profile, and, even if they weren't recruiting, we got a couple of informal interviews and they ended up offering me a position!

I'm excited about it and that would be a great career move for me, since right now I don't feel challenged at my current job.

In our initial talks, we mentioned a salary of 95k per year with paid overtime (+10k than my actual job). The position that they opened for me had a salary range of 90-115k.

The final offer is 105k per year with unpaid overtime, which could be close to a 95k with paid overtime.

In a separate email, my future supervisor told me to not hold back and counteroffer if I want.

Overall, I'm fine with this salary and the position is super interesting and I don't want to lose it. Should I go ahead and try to counteroffer?

1c5i328,How a carefree loudmouth like me got better at interviewing?,"  
Ever have such a big ego you thought you could wing anything and be fine?  
That was me early in my career when I went in for interviews.  
Not to mention, I thought what I had to say was more important than the interviewer.  
But I learned a few things along the way.  
And last year when I was on the job search I ended up putting my money where my mouth is.  
3 offers in 2 weeks.  
Being in the interviewer seat as a recruiter the past few years? I know what flies and what doesn't.  
And what hiring managers love to hear and hate to hear.  
So, when you're interviewing, avoid making these mistakes:  
→ Not coming to interviews prepared.  
Again, this was me a few years back thinking I was a hot shot.  
Reality check.  
The number of times I've gotten on the phone with candidates only to tell me ""what opportunity is this again?""...  
Too high of a number.  
Doesn't look too good.  
→ Badmouthing previous employers.  
It's red flag in most cases and makes you look bad.  
You can be honest or elude to things while staying professional.  
Instead of ""My old boss was horrible""...  
Change it to, ""There wasn't as much internal support as I was hoping for"".  
Or ""I'm looking for a team that supports professional development a bit more"".  
→ Interrupting the interviewer.  
Nothing screams insecurity more than this.  
And it's annoying and unprofessional.  
Again, it's telling the interviewer ""what I have to say is more important"".  
So, want to get better at interviewing?  
Start with stopping these bad habits.",markthetechrecruiter,1,1.0,0,1713279195,2024-04-16 14:53:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5i328/how_a_carefree_loudmouth_like_me_got_better_at/,4,2024

1c5hkzp,Is this higher paying job worth the switch ???,"So I’ve been in sales for 7+ years 5 years of it car sales btw while doing fitness is my passion as well. I started working for a remote personal training certification company selling programs for almost 3 months now still new. The quotas and goals are pretty high not gonna lie and each month it gets higher and higher to the final goal is $72,000 a month after 3 months and goal to hit to start making a good commission. We do have a base salary of 40 K. To even make a commission check, you have to hit 80% which is still kind of hard but you can have good days and bad days of course and sales it’s all phone call based so a mix of warm Leads, but mostly cold calling old leads. I came close to hitting goal my first month and I was one sale away from hitting 80% to make an extra commission check but I felt like I did so much work for nothing making a company revenue and literally not even a dollar extra for myself, so I don’t know how to think about this recently, I got offered a store manager job at a GNC on a military base that is 15 minutes away from where I live they are offering me $24 an hour plus little bonuses here and there weekly and monthly if we hit our goals both jobs have insurance and benefits but I keep thinking about the remote and having weekends off versus in person and just need to know if the extra responsibilities of being a store manager is worth it but the sales obviously it can be stressful and annoying asf a high turnover rate and people leaving all the time because the unrealistic goals that only the top people make. what do you guys think? I never was a store manager before in my life but since I had a strong résumé, they reached out to me just need to know some thoughts on this to see if it’s worth it or I can make any personal growth for myself or if it’s even worth the extra stress I’m just don’t know what to do.

1c5gqos,Signing job offer in person only?,"So I was offered a job verbally last week with a school district and when asking if I accept (over the phone), I responded asking for the offer in writing so I can make a decision. 

The HR employee pretty much said I would see the job offer and benefits in person when I sign the paperwork so they can’t send the offer through email. 

I thought that was weird but what do I know, i’ve only had a few jobs in my field. So I pretty much just said yea I accept verbally on the same call and said I’d let her know when I can go in person to sign. After some thought, fast forward a couple days, I asked the HR employee again for the written benefits, wage, job description, etc. through email so I can have grounds for putting my 2 weeks in without worrying. She pretty much just said “she’ll try” and send it but it’s been a few days and still nothing…

It’s a 20 mile drive and I can’t take off my current job just to review paperwork that should be being sent online anyways IMO.

1c5gmnb,Insurance Underwriter Considering New Career,"Hello Everyone! I've been an underwriter in the property & casualty insurance industry for about 10 years now. I received both a bachelors and masters in the field. I'm in my early 30s at this point and I'm pretty sure I am no longer interested in being an underwriter.

Some reasons I do not enjoy it.

I do not find any meaning behind the job, just feels like pushing work off the desk. Sometimes it is great if I write a new account or provide a solution, but for the most part I am just moving stuff along.

I do not enjoy the constant ""conflicts"" of the job. I am often saying no or just having difficult conversantions with agents because they do not see the situation the same as I do. Often they are stubborn about it.

The amount of work. I have sooo much on my plate, it's overwhelming. I don't like taking PTO because it just means when I sit back down at my desk I'll be more backed up. I would love to be able to take PTO knowing work isn't piling up.

How crazy inefficient the insurance industry is. Everything has to be documented over and over again. The same piece of data is manually entered in multiple locations. It takes too long to do what should be a simple task. There's a lot of room for automation. It infuriates me daily.

My current job situation has become really sour. My manager isn't happy with my performance and I've mentally checked out. I probably would of quit sooner, but I have a two year rentention bonus I'd have to pay back in full if I quit before June. (Never signing something like that again)

I've read into data architecture or web development jobs that sound interesting, but I have zero experience. I am also getting married so I can't afford to take too much of a pay cut.

Does anyone have advice for careers I could move into from underwriting that would be more positive, meaningful, and less stressful? Also how I could move into a new field without having to make massive financial sacrifices?

Sorry for the length. Appreciate all your responses.",anonperson2345,1,1.0,0,1713275497,2024-04-16 13:51:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5gmnb/insurance_underwriter_considering_new_career/,4,2024

1c5fd5e,"I feel like I'm running out of time and waisting my potential, but terrified to make a wrong move. ","I'm  36yo (F). A little over a year ago I decided to leave factory work which I had done for the past 10 years because my body was wearing down mentally and physically. I went through surgery to have my thyroid removed because of cancerous nodules right after I left. I worked 12 hour rotating swing shifts (often forced mandatory OT up to 60-72 hours a week) but made good money in factories, however it wasn't worth what it did to my health. Since leaving I have lost almost 70 lbs and mentally I am so much happier. However I feel lost in my career.  When I left I decided I would go into healthcare. I have an associates degree in pre nursing. I work at a hospital as a nursing assistant now. The hospital has taught me additional skills and I get to jump around to different hospitals, but I'm stuck on my main unit working every weekend on a telemetry unit. Since working at the hospital I've realized healthcare (especially bedside nursing) is NOT for me. I'm willing to go back to school and further my education, but I don't want to waste my time on something I'm going to hate. I hate how the patients and family get to treat us all like we're nothing, even the nurses, and we just have to grin and take it. I hate how administration pretends to care about patient care, yet we're so purposefully understaffed it's scary, then every one on the floor gets blamed when bad things happen. If we speak up and say ""more staffing would help"" they say ""oh no, we think you guys doing more work, with the little staff you have would help"". It's so uncomfortable because this is people's LIVES we're dealing with! Not machines, numbers, or data and our management needs to consider that when making decisions. I feel like I would do well in property management, project management, maybe something where I get to talk to people a lot but I don't have to necessarily listen to a lot of emotions. I like facts, logic, independent work, problem solving,  analyzing, and I'm dependable. My weaknesses are that I can come across as critical, I am impatient, I can seem overly confident, I suck with social sues and networking but i do enjoy talking people about intersting things if that makes sense. I have been told several times at work patients families have complained that I'm ""abrasive"", I'm stubborn, and I enjoy a good debate. My question is does anyone have any idea of a career path that would be good for someone like me? Like somewhere i would  fit in and my personality and ideas would be appreciated and not overlooked or seen as a trouble maker? I'd rather not go back to school if possible but I know I'd probably need to. Everything i put my effort into i excel. My past employers would probably say the exact same thing ""shes an exceptional worker. Dependable and goes above and beyond, but she kinda had a bad attitude"" but they dont realize its because i dont feel appreciated. Im just afraid to waste time going into something else I might hate. I wasted 10 years in a factory, I wasted time getting my pre nursing associates, I don't want to waste MORE time 😢.

When it comes to numbers, I don't have anything of strictly ""individual"" and since I joined 6 months ago and the first 3 months were strictly onboarding, I don't have much to say. 
What do you recommend me? I don't have any accomplishment so far, other than the deliveries of shared projects that are indeed my job. 

Thank you!

1c5f6qs,“We have a 90% fail rate”,"Went to an interview at a IT firm, interviewer casually mentioned this. He also used words like “meritocracy” and “career advancement”.

How do I gauge here if he is full of shit and trying to cover up a toxic work culture? 90% fail rate sounds like an employer problem ngl. On the other hand, it could be that the bar is set so high that they want to keep only that 10% and reward them adequately?
I am EU based if it’s of any importance.

Also since I have no prior experience in the sector, they mentioned an “apprenticeship contract” (which means a low wage basically), are they masquerading this as a learning experience just to lowball me? How common is this in general (to lowball people by saying that their experience doesn’t apply to the position you’re interviewing for)?",GreenX45,103,0.8500000238418579,133,1713271483,2024-04-16 12:44:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5f6qs/we_have_a_90_fail_rate/,4,2024

1c5eg64,I’ve hit my breaking point with my job and want to leave ASAP,"I am 23, got this job right out of college and have been here for almost 2 years. I work 7am-4pm and work from home. Every week (sometimes daily) now I cry and have a mental breakdown about this job. I’ve never been so depressed in my life. I barely do my work now either. My motivation is at an all time low. 

Ideally I want to have a job lined up before leaving but I feel too drained to look for jobs while also still working my current role. I also want to really sit down and take time to figure out what I really want to do so I don’t end up in another soul sucking job. I have about $12k saved and I pay about $1600 a month in bills. I want to put my 2 weeks in ASAP. Is this an absolutely horrible idea??? I do resell clothing on the side and have been making around $400 a week when I put effort in. So it’s not like I have no income at all. It’s just not super stable. 

Is it actually easier to get hired while you still are in a job? I have gotten great feedback from management at my current company and got exceeds expectations my first year in the role which allegedly is very hard to get. Maybe I am naive but I feel like I have a decent chance at getting a job within a few months of quitting. I work in an up and coming industry that is high demand right now for most major companies.

1c5d2ih,Stop looking for the meritocracy that doesn't exist,"I can't logically understand why anyone would expect their job to be a meritocracy. Companies do what the very human people who control them want them to.

You are a human. Think about how your friends and families would feel about you if you became disproportionately powerful and successful and you turned to them and said ""ooo so sorry. You see, we live in a meritocracy, and I'm so much better than you that I get to enjoy all this stuff and you just have to watch. Love you tho!""

Imagine being the most powerful person in an industry and having to decide whether someone you like or someone you hate gets ahead. Are you going to choose the person you hate because they are marginally better just because that's true to the meritocracy?

I'm not denying the value of merit entirely. Just acknowledging that it should be very obvious to everybody that merit is catalyzed by connection. 

Your skills mean shit if no one knows who you are and you don't have the charisma to make connections with new people.

Do not focus on picking up skills you'll never be able to use if you're in the wrong circles. Don't ignore the very real social class systems that exist and impact us all more than we'd like to admit on a daily basis.

And most importantly, don't be such an autist that you think you doing your job well on paper gives you the right to be an insufferable cunt to work with.

Then beat the system. It's actually very easy to move up the ladder once you understand the whole process and don't just focus on individual components, whether that be skills, systems, or people.

There's no greater path to upward mobility than being a skilled, aware crony.

1c5d2aa,Should I move to Japan for engineering after college?,"18F from India

I'm studying at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS Goa) which is a fairly reputed institute, probably top 5/top 10 in the country. I'm going into my second year in the fall. My degree is in mechanical engineering.

My dad works in a Japanese company at a pretty high position and knows the recruitment process well. He says Japan is in ""dire need"" of young skilled labourers. Should I move there? What are entry-level jobs like in, for example, design engineering? What is the expected salary? What is the work culture like for foreigneird?

I don't know any Japanese but I have three years to learn and I have taught myself languages before so I'm confident if I work hard enough I can get it.

And before someone asks, no I don't watch anime or studio ghibli or anything like that. Nothing about this is related to like a Japan obsession or something. I just want a fulfilling job before I return to school for my masters.

Also, for any Indians reading, I am giving the JEE again this year (got a 99.7%ile in JEEM, 30th Jan, Session 2) and maybe if I get into IITB/IITD/IITM, I might transfer.",1Mad1Scientist,1,0.6700000166893005,7,1713264617,2024-04-16 10:50:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c5d2aa/should_i_move_to_japan_for_engineering_after/,4,2024
1c5cax0,Why do I feel guilty for wanting to quit?,"Hello 6 months ago I started a new job inside my company group. The original company where I worked, was getting incorporated and we would be reassigned with no lay offs. Of course there were layoffs so I applied for another position and I received this after some interviews. On paper it really looked like something I would like but in reality it’s something else. My job has some great benefits and is close to my home. My team is great and I have a lovely manager. The team is based in several countries so we only meet via teams.I need to coordinate several parties in sales and research issues and see how to improve. Problem is I need to rely on people who often don’t think any further and often say can’t do it or wrong person. There is no clear structure which also makes it hard to do my job. I need to distribute tasks to people while sometimes I could do it better myself. This has stressed me out a lot which also took a toll on my mental and physical health. I kind of had a breakdown and decided to start looking for another job. I sent my resume out but in the meantime I got a performance review and I got a salary increase because the company is quite happy with me.
Now I feel bad for wanting to quit. Am I giving up to soon, should I keep continuing hoping it will go better? I am at a loss what to do.

in commerce maths and then a bachelor degree in B.COM (NON college).  
  
I've spent the past three years pursuing a B.COM degree from a non-college program (where you just have to take exams), which I now realize is basically worthless. I didn't grasp the seriousness of this at the time and ended up doing nothing productive during these years.  
  
Now, I'm feeling lost and desperate because I have no idea where to go from here. I have some options in mind:  
  
MBA: To pursue this, I need to prepare for the CAT exam and score well to get into a reputable college. However, I'm not sure if I'm eligible for CAT since I'm uncertain about achieving a 60% score in my B.Com.  
  
Professional Courses: I'm considering CA/CMA/ACCA/CS, but I'm conflicted. I want to earn a master's degree eventually and not spend all my time solely on these professional courses. I'm also unaware of all the available options.  
  
Data Science: I recently came across this field but don't quite understand it.  
  
Master's Degree: If I do not do MBA, should I pursue an M.Com or an M.A. in Economics?  
  
By the time I'm 24, I want to have a steady income.  
  
I'm seeking advice on what steps I should take now, what I should avoid, and what courses or combinations would work well together. If possible, could someone provide guidance that includes a specific timeframe for securing a job?

Some backstory:

\* Im currently 20 years old studying media studies at university and have always loved making youtube videos (even though i have only 150 subscribers).

\* I used to be a profesional athlete in rhythmic gymnastics and did some gymnastics coaching but its not something i want to do with my life.

\* As for work experience i have done customer service (barista, restaurant), I have handled my dads social media account before and done invoices/accounting/copywriting work and have coached gymnastics/event planning and been a head instructor for birthday parties (kids aged 2-14)

\* I have a good work ethic but I just don't have anything going for my life right now.

\* I have a tiktok account that has around 8,000 subscribers but my engagement isnt the best and sometimes i think being a content creator is impossible in a world full of people trying to do that. Im also insanely broke.

I honestly don't know what i want to do with my life because i want to go into digital marketing and social media marketing but also would love to get into acting (i acted when i was little in commercials and was almost cast as renesme in twilight series) or modelling or even motorsport media. I sometimes even feel like I could create a business but i dont know what to invent or anything like that.

All in all I dont know what i want to do with my life and im scared that if i go into one thing ill hate it and wont be able to change my career course and ill end up being dead broke my whole life.

One thing is for sure...i want to be FAMOUS thats it lol

Any suggestions?

1c59ggo,My work environment is very toxic. Really struggling - What do I do?,"LONG POST \[NEED HELP\]  
I \[28M\] am international currently living in Australia (Prior work experience outside Australia: 3+ years as business analyst). I have recently graduated (in Dec) with a Master's degree in Management but did a couple of internships in the product/project domain. I know most graduates are struggling to find a job in this tough market but I got lucky and landed a project/product development coordinator role at this IT startup and have been working full time with the company for over 6 months now. I report to the CEO.  
Initially, the work culture seemed fine but it has taken a drastic turn since the last 3-4 months. This guy micromanages me all the time. He changes priorities for projects as he wishes and does not inform me about any changes that are being made to the project's scope or deliverables. He constantly assigns me new projects that need to be delivered ""urgently"" without sharing any information about the project (documentations, timelines, backlogs). Moreover, he blames me if the project is not being completed/delivered on time and if any client raises issues with anything on their project. The work has become so toxic that I am constantly thinking of quitting my job. The sole reason I am not quitting is because I have to pay my student loan. Last week, one of the projects were to go live but due to server issues the offshore development team in India was unable to make it live. Although, its not a part of my job to resolve technical issues but I still spent 1.5 hrs with the offshore developers to debug the server issues (servers are located in our office in Australia) but we could not figure out what the issue was. So, I left work around 5:15 pm. The next morning, he called up a 1:1 meeting and yelled at me for going home without resolving the issue although I spent 1.5 hrs trying to resolve the issue with the development team. He said ""I don't care if it took you 5 more hours to fix it, you should have stayed at the office till 11 pm if it was needed."" He also said ""I don't pay you this much money if I have to do everything myself."" I tried to explain my side but he was not ready to listen to anything I was saying. Not sure if I am wrong here for leaving without resolving the issue?!  
Due to all these issues, I have been really really stressed and it has taken a toll on my mental and physical health. I have been struggling to come to work every day and I am not sure if should quit or continue here till I find a new job. Although, I have been applying for jobs for over 3 months (on and off) but no luck. I landed a few interviews but could not convert those as I have less experience of the Australian market (something companies value a lot more than your overall experience here in Australia). I don't have the mental energy or the time to apply for jobs anymore or properly prepare for interviews after I come back from work. I feel like I have lost all confidence in my abilities and I don't know if I will even get hired or get out of this place. I need some guidance as to ""should I just quit this job and then put in all my efforts to prepare for roles that I really want"" or ""should I take up any other role to get out to this company"" and ""what roles should I go for"". What do I do and how do I quit?

I graduate soon, I had an almost one-year internship after my bachelor and hated it lol but my former boss liked me and is offering a fair opportunity to work for a big four consultancy firm, they waived the initial stage because he already saw how I work. Small problem: I haven’t done those things in 2.5 years and I am not truly passionate about them. I love data science, I learned a lot about it but I still need to improve my coding skills and working on the foundations true IT engineers  have. 

I like data science but I could be good at consultancy because I am empathetic, love working in groups and speak many languages fluently. Despite my studies and good grades, I don’t feel as confident when it comes to data science. I would like to pursue it but this nigh mean another internship with no guaranteed job + not enough money to even pay for the rent of a room. I’d love to find a remote internship to live with my parents in the mean time. 

What should I do? They are offering me an apprenticeship contract for 2 years, I would get the better end of the entry level compensation and no need for stage. I would begin even before graduating officially. Should I take it and work in the background to get my dream job?

1c58iri,Balancing unbillable time with work friends in a consulting job with leaving work for home at a reasonable time,"I work in consulting where we bill our time to clients at 15 minute increments and make an hourly wage. If we aren’t working/billing time and are chatting about things unrelated to a project, then I have nowhere to bill that time, and I need to work longer in order to bill my full 8 hours on the day. I’m young (26) and have a lot of work friends that are younger and not quite at the same stage of life as me (long-term relationship at home), and they like to chat, don’t mind working later to make it up or don’t seem to have this problem about unbillable time. I’m trying to balance time with my friends at work and maintaining these friendships (yes my work friends are my friends, very American of us), but I also want to get home at a reasonable time to spend time with my long-term partner or just to spend time generally not at work. How does anyone in similar consulting positions balance unbillable time with work friends with trying to get out of the workplace at a reasonable time?

1c57n1g,I have multiple job offers but in 2 different industries and I don’t know which is good. ,"So I am in my final semester in university and I got multiple job offers this April. I filtered the options and ended up with 2 options. 
Option 1 : Is a local independent IT company in which I am going to be a system engineer and a sales rep. of sorts. 
Pros: The scalability i feel is very good since it’s the IT industry and the company provides good opportunities for skilling up and funding. And they provide commuting stipend which is quite generous and also has overtime but from what i heard in the interview they rarely do that. And they do have flexi time system with WFH and onsite hybrid working.They also have paid leaves with 120 days off a year.I can join from april next year till then i can work part time here.
Cons: It pays less. The starting salary is fixed so there is no room for negotiation. It’s 190,000 jpy so you can use this figure and tell me your opinion about it.
Option 2 : This is a job in a trading company which mostly acts as a middleman and introduces small and medium sized companies with projects for the bigger companies which consists of parts and machinery altogether.The industry which this place deals with is mostly manufacturing sector. That is the basic operation but they have subsidiaries which does many other things and soon they will start up a new subsidiary in my home country as well by this year’s fall.
Pros: I can act as a bridge between countries and gives me many hats. Right off the bat i feel like this position was made for someone with my background. They will provide housing and commuting stipends. I will able to frequent between counties for business trips. They are flexible with when i can join. 
Cons: Hours will be long. Since there is a long list of things to be done I wasn’t even told the job title which makes it feel pressured. The company is small. All of the subsidiaries companies combined is equal to the size of option 1.This whole thing feels too good to be true but it’s credible and the fact that it is the pressure is just too much. I don’t know about the scalability as well.

1c578tz,Moving off the tools,"I've been an Electrician in New Zealand for over half my life at this point (15 years since I completed my apprenticeship) and I'm ready to start working towards getting off the tools. 

A bit about me, I have worked across a wide range of roles with large, multi-national companies down to being part of a two man team working directly with the boss. I have experience in generation (maintenance and operation) industrial, commercial, residential, heatpumps and alarms and have some experience as a leading hand on large commercial jobs. I mostly enjoy my job, especially when I'm dealing with customers directly and have some autonomy. Unfortunately due to injury and general bodily wear and tear I am starting to slow down a bit and am looking for some kind of sideways career step to get off the tools so I can wear my body out with my son rather than at work.

What are my best options? Bearing in mind I can't afford to go backwards in terms of salary. I can't afford to be earning less than $75k, though $85k would be my ideal starting point.
A recruiter (who turned out to be a dead end) suggested sales or project management, both of which I can see myself doing. However, my experience with project management is that you're only as good as your team which makes me a little apprehensive. 

Any advice as to what to expect in these two career paths? Any other suggestions? And what I can do in my own time over the next 6 months or so to make myself more employable as someone who has worked mostly with their hands for the last 18 years and has very little experience in an office environment?

Any advice greatly appreciated!

1c56kdh,Help me choose the right career.,"

Hey seniors need your guidance. I am 22M from Pakistan, gonna graduate in my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence, hopefully next year XD(well actually the degree wasn't about AI, the courses were entirely similar with computer science degree so yes, I got scammed, other courses which were included were entirely based on theory and old AI techniques). Anyway, I desparately need career advice. Throughout my degree I haven't found any course interesting enough to help me make a career in. (Well I won't blame my teachers or the education system) but now as the end of degree is approaching, I feel like I have wasted my time. I am soon gonna be steping into real world on my own and literally IDK how I am gonna make it. I've worked on IOT projects and made a few battlebots along with my friend(who is passionate about robotics) but I feel as if this career aint interesting for me. I hope to seek a career on which I can work from my laptop remotely any where from the world as far as I have internet. 

I have done some research and found Data visualization(Neo4J and powerBi) pretty interesting, wanted learn web but that is now very crowded. I have now started a new course in my uni ""Deep learning"". The teacher is a great guy. Maybe I should pursue it?

The problem is that my country is facing financial and econonimical issues, looking at the political conditions, I know the country won't make any progress clearly in the next 20 years. So I wanna move out of here but currently I can't due to financial issues, would definitely move out as soon as I get financial stability. My friends who graduated are earning like $100-$200 per month. I just hope to find a remote job which will pay me better in the comfort of my home.

If you have any recs please let me know. I would appreciate any advice/tips or course link.",SheepherderAlone923,1,1.0,0,1713239409,2024-04-16 03:50:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c56kdh/help_me_choose_the_right_career/,4,2024

1c56gst,Math tutor for 10 years. Now what?,"I've always had a passion for mathematics and pursued it diligently throughout my academic journey. I majored in math at UW-Madison (w/ phd qual exam courses in Abstract Algebra). Then I became intrigued by stochastic processes during my senior year. This led me to pursue a Master's degree at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, mostly because I wanted to take more grad courses in measure-theoretic probability.

Upon completing my MA degree, I returned to South Korea, my home country, to spend more time with my dad who was retiring and suffering from a cancer (he's okay now.) I spent time tutoring high school students. It was financially rewarding, with earnings exceeding $150k annually. This is when I stopped my academic journey, and it has been ten years tutoring kids. Now, at 36 years old, and with the impending arrival of my first child this fall, I find myself at a pivotal moment in my career.

1. Data Science: Despite my strong theoretical background, I've realized that I need to refresh my skills in statistics and data analysis. While I considered a bootcamp, I believe a more comprehensive approach, such as enrolling in a master's program, would better suit my needs.
2. Quant: Though I'm intrigued by the field of quantitative finance, I wonder if my age may be a deterrent in gaining acceptance to prestigious programs. Nevertheless, I remain open to exploring opportunities in this area.
3. Jobs at Boarding Schools: Having attended a college preparatory high school myself, the idea of working as a dorm parent and teaching math resonates deeply with me. However, securing visa sponsorship has proven to be a significant challenge. While some interviewers have expressed willingness to assist with the process, the uncertainty surrounding timelines remains a concern. I've contemplated pursuing an Ed.D. and transitioning into school leadership or administration roles, which may offer a greater chance of securing sponsorship.
4. Other Suggestions in the Tech Field: I'm open to exploring alternative career paths within the tech industry that leverage my mathematical expertise. I'm particularly interested in roles that involve data analysis, algorithm development, or software engineering.

Do you have any suggestions, advice, criticism, or harsh comments on my future path? Many of the options I'm considering require significant investment in terms of both time and money.

1c548em,How to (tactfully) answer why I’m leaving my current job,"In August I started a new job at a nonprofit with a reputation for being a great place to work - and maybe once upon a time it was but I got there and basically from day one it’s been messy (a team member was laid off on my first day, the assistant I was promised got cut from the budget, turns out my role is a consolidation of 3 people’s job previously, I inherited a seriously screwy budget… and most of my coworkers hate the management team. I could go on.)

I am proud of the work I’ve done while facing considerable obstacles, but by the hard metrics my major project has not been a success - I may be culpable for some of that but mostly it’s been a matter of the circumstances I’ve been put in (to support that, I even got a stellar performance review from my supervisor for what I was able to accomplish). A big part of my reason for wanting to leave is that I dont think I was ever set up to be able to fully succeed in this role - no one could have turned around what they were expecting because it wasn’t based in logical thinking.  But I am really anxious about talking about this work experience in upcoming interviews without seeming like I’m badmouthing my employer. I’ve been there less than a year and don’t want to come across as negative.

Would appreciate any advice on how to approach this - thank you!

PS: I am also struggling with how to put in my notice (when I eventually do) without burning bridges, especially since I’m considering quitting without the next thing lined up - mostly in order to give my employer enough notice before the next cycle of this project picks up. It feels pretty hard to ignore that the working situation has been less than ideal for me, but I want the reference if I can keep it…

1c53tt3,How Often can you leverage your current job?,"For context, I work at a Fortune 500 company and am a manager of people. Two years ago, I was approached by another large company, interviewed, and got a job there to which I used the offer letter to get a raise at my job. I love the work-life balance I have at my job and my preference is to move up here. I kept my bosses in the loop going through that interview process and they told me not to leave without giving them a chance. My bosses boss got me a raise and then our company did a catch-up so everyone was moved up to the standard pay for the position I was in, so it amounted to a zero sum as I would’ve received the same raise even without the offer, but my bosses boss feels like he did a lot for me to get me there (which is true). I now have another unsolicited job offer where I’d have another sizable raise. How often is too often to try and leverage your current role for a pay raise?

1c531zz,I'm torn and not sure what to do,"Hello all 
I want to preface this by saying, please do not tell me ""do whatever you enjoy doing"" 
I should also preface this by saying I highly highly value good/high pay, work/life balance. Okay so to start, I studied Maya in university and was never THAT good at it and didn't find, well to be fair I didn't look that hard for jobs in Maya or animation I just wanted what was available, I also was decent at photoshop and video editing (Adobe suite basically) but those well get to that

So what I found to be emerging and best paying was software development, so I spent a year teaching myself how to code, Web design, javascript, react. Created a portfolio for myself. Then I was stuck in recruitment hell and not knowing how to apply to jobs. 

I then decided to go back to my photoshop and editing work and started interning for a social media outlet that covers events, so I got to go out and film and edit videos and it was enjoyable and I got a portfolio to apply to jobs with 

So now I have essentially 3 portfolios for 3 career paths. My degree in Maya/animation, which I realised I can go back to if I wanted to since I do like design and artsy stuff, and I can start working on a portfolio and fully pursue that 

A portfolio for software development and a gateway to IT, I would say I like coding and software the least, but in terms of work conditions, salary, hours, I wouldn't mind and I do enjoy some parts of it 

A portfolio for video editing, magazine, social media, filming work. I also really liked doing this too, like I had a great deal of enjoyment making content with this one

Anyways that's kinda it. I'm kinda just not sure what's best for a career, I want a safe, comfy life and I wouldn't say I love any of the three I just listed enough to dedicate my whole life to it as I have multiple other interests.

1c52n36,Not interested in AWS,"Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely see the benefit of cloud infrastructure. Also I recognize that provisioning infrastructure on AWS is a good skill to at least have some exposure in. 


 However, I find much more joy when working with on premise infrastructure. I love the process of planning out and configuring all infrastructure from scratch on prem. I find enjoyment in getting to actually build something on prem. The type of work I enjoy involves working in switches, firewalls, hypervisor environments like, distributed storage systems. I know AWS can do all of this in the cloud, but I just prefer the on premise solutions more so. 

Not doing anything manual either, most of my on prem solutions I have built custom Ansible and Terraform stuff for it to run smoothly. I use self hosted custom Linux solutions for everything. 

In my current role I do systems engineering, network engineering, and some DevOps tasks. If I want to continue within the realm of systems engineering (with a HEAVY emphasis on open source and Linux), am I doing myself a disservice by making the choice to stay away from AWS?

I mean, I get being somewhat familiar with AWS utilities , and I’m not exactly opposed to hybrid approaches, but I’m just not fully interested in diving deep in AWS. 

My big fear is that my love of on prem systems is going to make my current system engineering role obsolete. Is there any point? Should I start looking for more blue collar IT work?

I come from a less fortunate background. I pursued a bachelor's in business from a public school because my family was in a tough spot, and it offered the best employment outlook, even if I liked more maths and econ. But it was not realistic for me to pursue this at the time.

I did my best, balancing work and study, and managed to do pretty well. Upon graduation, the job I landed is in a field I despise – audit. I took the job, as it was my highest paying option (around 45k, I had to leave my country, but it really pays better than any opportunity available at home). It's not like it was the first time I had to do something I didn't want to do, so I thought it would be fine.

But the reality is hitting me hard. The job is draining, uninteresting, and demoralizing. I have zero interest in it. I've been struggling to find the motivation to continue. I used to wake up early every day to study. I don't even have the energy to do it anymore.

I'm looking for other jobs, but no luck so far. I’m trying to save up some money to study, but I really feel miserable after a 12-hour day doing the most manual and uninteresting tasks.

I’ve always worked on finding a way to better myself, but it certainly has been hard to find the motivation to keep going.

I want to eventually go back to school and study maths. The prospect of quitting my job, I think, would help me improve my mood, but I'm hesitant. My employer recently booked a business trip I'm supposed to attend. I think I would leave them in a tough spot. I'm also in a rent contract, and I’m not sure if quitting will really be beneficial.

I’m not trying to complain; it's just that I don't have anyone for guidance. Any advice is welcomed.

1c4xwsx,Promotion but company claim they have no budget for an increased salary for 2 months but want the work ,"This is written on behalf of my boyfriend who does not have Reddit.


So last week he was pulled into a meeting where he was told he would be promoted to a more senior position. This role is due to start on May 1st and will of course come with more responsibilities. However his company are asking him to stay on his current salary until there is budget for the pay rise by the end of June, which of course is not great or confirmed.

The company has made it really clear that they do not have it in their budget to increase his pay immediately. 
 

He works for a tech company as an account manager and has been offered a promotion to a more senior account management role. 


This is an American company who over the last year have been making cut backs in terms of travel budgets and a freeze on new hires. As far as he is aware, other employees that have been promoted have been told that their salary increases will be addressed when there is budget for it.


What type of advice would you give? 
My suggestions have been:
Ask for backdated pay or reduce your working hours. 

Other points to consider:
- There is another candidate that could take the position, however this person is 'less able' 
- He doesn't want to ruin any potential relationship he has with his current team.
- He’s been guaranteed shares in the company from the start date",Taiyella,5,0.6700000166893005,22,1713215948,2024-04-15 21:19:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c4xwsx/promotion_but_company_claim_they_have_no_budget/,4,2024

Anyway, now turns out these extra responsibilities are not appreciated, Instead, these reports have been used by the big boss as a reason to criticize me, deeming them not actionable enough and consequently rejecting my promotion request…

These additional responsibilities are consuming so much of my time that I no longer have the capacity to complete my usual tasks as quickly as before and not able to initiate any new projects. Moreover, I've lost the time to do online course and learn new stuff. 

Meanwhile, a British M colleagues who join a few months later then me are promoted…without take on extra work or responsibility…


I'm feeling frustrated and so undervalued! Should I just quit? The amount of workload makes it difficult to have time to prepare and scheduled interviews

1c4wzyw,"I got 8 years of nursing, 2 years in sales/ executive assistant. Where can I go?","So I was a nurse for 8 years and hated it. I had an opportunity to jump ship for a promising sales gig. I did ok, door knocking and closing deals is a weakness for me to be honest, but I feel like part of that is from the specific nature of my industry what was rapidly moving away from the large corporate model pretty much the second I got hired to a large corporation. Kinda felt like I was on a sinking ship from day one. My friend who go me into the industry broke out in his own and I’ve been pretty successful at managing already landed accounts. I’m kinda his executive assistant and we’re making great money for not a lot of work. However, I think the sun is setting on my industry as regulatory bodies a closing in, which I admit is incredibly needed. But once they do that im out of luck, none of the big fish in this industry are going to take me cuz I don’t have my own accounts and they pretty much only hire people that have ready to go business. 

Anyways, I need to find a more secure, reliable job. I wanna make six figures, I don’t want anything to do with healthcare, I’d prefer to work from home, but moreso I’m just looking for ideas on what I could do.

1c4wwch,Career dilemma at 33: personal growth or financial growth?,"Hello, community! I am facing a career dilemma and would like to hear your personal stories, opinions and advice.  
  
A bit about me: I am 33 years old and work in IT industry, in a business management position. Almost 2 years ago, I changed jobs, moving from a software company to another.  
  
In both the current and the former company, the scenarios (comparing over time) have similarities: I feel that I have made my mark, there was/is a good relationship with my boss, and people are friendly and helpful. But I notice a difference between the companies.  
  
\- The previous company (I'll call it **Company 1**) was a great place to work, with very intelligent people, and I felt that I was learning most of the time. The company is very well managed, makes good data-driven decisions, and is an intellectually challenging environment. However, I was financially stagnant, and after it was acquired by a multinational, the business became more corporate/boring. The business itself grew a lot in the first years, but it was already showing signs of wear/lesser growth. Still, I always enjoyed working there.  
  
\- The current company (**Company 2**) pays much better in every aspect (fixed salary, bonuses, stocks) and definitely has more potential to grow more and become a bigger business. Financially, I feel I made the right decision. However, I feel that I have taken two steps back in terms of learning/intellectual challenge. Everything is still very manual, few processes are automated, and I am facing challenges that had already been overcome in the previous job.  
  
Even though I consider myself young, I am no longer at the beginning of my career, and making a transition also carries personal risks (I am married and plan to have children soon). I think IT industry has an implicit 'ageism' in my country (Brazil).     
  
Has anyone been through a similar situation and could share their story? Any thoughts on my dilemma?

1c4wma2,My dreams are so big it fucking hurts,"Idk how to start but imma j say it. I don't want to fucking compromise anymore. My mom died when I was 5 but never really felt her absence, missed her yes, because life was pretty decent had everything.

My father remarried and it was hell for me and my sister. It's been 7-8 years I've been suffering. She, fathers wife, always favours her daughter and she tries to steal whatever our privileges are. She's here for her daughters education and future then why doesn't she focus only on that. On the top of that my father and his wife have a 5yo daughter.
I don't hate her, I like her I want the best of her but that's really selfish on his part thinking of his future with his family while destroying ours.

If my grandparents wouldn't be alive today, they all including my immediate family members would've destroyed me and my sister by marrying us somewhere horrible.
To begin w my father was never like this. He was opposite of what he is today.

This lady came(from a poor family background) and she had a problem with how we eat, how our demands and wishes are fulfilled and how spoiled(in a good, mannered way) we were. 
Soon enough this man acted like he is a different family member like he has a whole goddamnnn family and me and my sister belonged to grandparents, who kinda raised us(i live in a joint family). 
Grandparents were fine but as soon as my uncle had 2 boys (5 and 3) they also changed and favoured them because 1.they didn't like my father as much as my uncle 2.and they were boys.

My father(second floor) pays for my school and other expenses excluding food in home. I eat at my grandparents(first floor(They also like taunted us almost everyday in covid because they had to support my uncle too and we were burden on them.
On that day, I was broken felt alone as ever. Cried alone, still am remembering it. That day, I knew who to rely on- no one but myself.
my fathers wife also suggested him that he should get me married and the married guy would pay for my education. Like I'm a fkn toy to sell. My father even asked my grandma for permission and at that time I knew nothing. It fcking broke me again and every day. 

My little sister (biological one)(not step sister not half sister) is protected because of me. I'm her shield and they know if I'd be married to a miserable guy id be over so would be my sister.

Cut to today. I have dreams istg I will die if I don't achieve them. That's the only thing which is keeping me going everyday. I want to study Computer Science and psych, conduct research , I want a phd and what not in The US bevause it's got resources. India, please don't try to convince me. Research is not respected, not paid enough. Whatever USA is my prefrence.
My father, if wants to, can pay my tuition fee in the US and I promised him to pay back Ion care I'll give it to him. But he's skeptical because apparently he has 4 kids THATS NOT MY FKIN PROBLEM, HE DIDN'T ASKED ME BEFORW MARRYING
and he's insisting ME to go to Germany because education is free.(hard for bachelor's) my dreams would be shattered. I then have to complete my cs only then get a job and then save. ITD BE FKN HARD TO DO MASTERS IN PSYCHOLOGY because of the curiculm. US allows a minor like they consider a minor for masters application.

I'll fucking cry. I want to study in US. There's alot to do. I'll grow alot which would not be possible in another country. Every other countries curiculm is diff. They don't allow you to explore.

My dreams are so big it fucking hurts.

1c4wcdm,Need some advice ,"I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. I am a 27M and work in HVAC. Been doing it for 5 years, but am burnt out. We do residential systems so we are in and out of customer homes everyday. 

Lately I can’t shake the feeling it’s just not for me. I’m burnt out on the customers (customer can be a PITA when you’re working on their home, some worse than others). Our family owned shop has recently turned corporate so new faces everyday and we never know who to report to. Without getting into too much detail and trying to explain everything, I’m over it. Not sure if HVAC is the route I want to go. Here is the hiccup though 

None of the other trades are hiring for what I make now. I do make a decent living doing what I do. I’m on commission based pay so when work is booming, so is the wallet. But when it’s slow (like it has been for 6 months), I’m barely scraping by. The commission based pay is new as they just rolled it out a few months ago. On top of that, I’m expecting a little one in September, and if I leave I will lose my FMLA leave. I’ve searched around to see what other options there are out there, as far as maybe getting into a different trade (pipe fitter, plumbing etc). But im at a point to where I can’t start over as an apprentice because my family who I am financially responsible for can’t take that hit. I just can’t think of any other career field that would pay me decent off the bat. 

I feel stuck and can’t shake the feeling. Hopefully I didn’t ramble on too much and what I said makes sense. Thanks for any an all insights. ",Chrisadco17,1,1.0,0,1713212212,2024-04-15 20:16:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c4wcdm/need_some_advice/,4,2024
1c4w530,Employer moving my position from salary to hourly to 'comply' with FLSA regulations -but something's off,"I work for a very small company, only about 25 employees. I work as the project manager and essentially just make sure the projects get out smoothly and on time. 

This is my second corporate job and I am the first official project manager they've hired. It's pretty obvious at times the company has no idea what they're doing or how to deal with their employees. 

Anyway, the General Manager/HR (yes, they are both the manager and HR) pulled me aside when I came into work yesterday and gave me a piece of paper with a notice that my salary will be going from salary to hourly to comply with FLSA regulations beginning immediately. For context, as salary, I was earning 60k per year. I did a little bit of research and understand the basics. If I have the same hours, I earn about the same and will be compensated more for overtime. I've seen others' posts as well and it seems to be happening to quite a few others and doesn't usually mean too much change other than clocking in and out. 

That aside, I would like to note I have a gut feeling that something else is going on:

1. It doesn't seem like anyone else is receiving this notice (it's a small office so I would be able to tell if they're pulling other people aside). They even have part time employees that seem to be staying as salary. 

2. When the General Manager/HR pulled me aside, he was talking a mile a minute, fidgeting, and mumbling his words. The interaction lasted maybe 2 minutes then he puts the paper on the table next to me then practically speed walks out of there. 

3. Without going into past frustrations I and my co-workers have with this company, I'd like to reiterate this company (only about 5 years old) seems to have no idea what they're doing or how to deal with their employees at times. They have the ""we're a family"" attitude while also taking any opportunity to take advantage of their employees. 

Just seeing if anyone has any feedback or any possible questions I could ask them before I continue.",North_Pressure_2326,1,1.0,5,1713211748,2024-04-15 20:09:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c4w530/employer_moving_my_position_from_salary_to_hourly/,4,2024

I do not like sales and after experiencing a major traumatic event at work last year it’s hard for me to work in high volume/ busy places.

The position is sales coordinator; I do not have a specialized hard skills that would make me difficult to replace - I’m fully aware that I’m not that special…I do feel lowballed, however remote is worth everything to me.

1c4rnl8,Should I quit?,"TLDR I spend most of the time at work idle. Should I quit?


Hey everyone I’m in dire need of career advice it would be helpful to get your advice on whether quitting my job is the right thing.

I’m 22 and this is my first real job (desk job). FYI I’m not based in the US.So the thing is I signed up for this contract job where I should work for 3 years. It’s been more than a year I still feel like there is no growth.I don’t have any work and most of the time I’ll be idle at work. I have raised this with my supervisor but no use. 

I feel like I’m stuck with no growth and worried that it might affect my career in the long run where I’m used to being idle and when work comes I would find it hard handling it as I was in the comfort zone too much. I’m pursuing a professional degree and I’m unsure whether to focus it on full time and enter into workforce after completing it.

I’ll break up the pros and cons of the organisation 

Pros:

It pays a decent amount
5 days a week with 40 hours a week
No issues with the team and colleagues so far
I get paid 30 days off 

Cons:

The upper management is a bit right with the policies like can’t be late to work not more than half an hour

Can’t work remotely or WFH

Can’t leave early even though u don’t have work

Restricts the use of phones

So if anyone was there in similar situation earlier or now what are your thoughts? Please share and thanks in advance

1c4re3t,Friends pointing out red flags with my current job...starting to wonder if they're right.,"Background: Currently managing a warehouse, official title is ""Plant Manager"". I was promoted to this position back in 2016 which required me to relocate to a different part of the state. Prior to this I was a delivery driver for the same company, making deliveries throughout the state.  


I manage a team of 5 delivery drivers and mainly oversee routing and delivery schedules. I also handle inventory counts and receiving when applicable. I typically go to the warehouse in the morning to get everyone set for the day and then I can work from home for the remainder. On occasion I have to make deliveries myself which can sometimes include working a Saturday or Sunday. There were also two instances where I was asked to go to warehouses out of state to train others but not additional compensation was received since it was a request and not mandatory.   


When I got promoted to this position the salary was $50,000. Today my salary is $60,000.  


As for the red flags, my friends believe the salary is insultingly low considered the location and also how long I've been in the position. They also believe that there's no reason I should be making deliveries as a Plant Manager and that if I don't have enough drivers to handle that I should make a requisition.  They also feel that my management / company is taking advantage of me, recognizing that I'm complacent and not one to make waves. 

Overall I'm happy with the status quo but I think that's because I never considered these things and now I'm starting to wonder if I should speak up. I did discover that the warehouse I was at as a driver, the manager there makes $75,000, but it is closer to a city.  


My friends strongly believe I should be looking for another warehouse manager job to significantly increase my salary and that there's no opportunity available for me within my current company.   


I get really stressed about stuff like this and I know they're looking out for my best interest but I'm not sure what to do. I feel comfortable but doubt is creeping in that I've been naive and potentially putting myself in a bad position.  


Looking for any advice on how to proceed, or if there's a need for it. ",TheSpiciestBanana,8,0.8999999761581421,16,1713200578,2024-04-15 17:02:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c4re3t/friends_pointing_out_red_flags_with_my_current/,4,2024

Basically, I drive semis in the NYC area and in the city itself hauling construction equipment, heavy machinery, weird loads etc. Its intense because its physically demanding from having to chain and climb trailers and mentally because its all tight and technical driving for 12 hours a day. Usually gotta wake up at 3am to get the day started... 

But family and my spouse has really noticed the mental toll its taken on me. I cry a bunch randomly, I can never get off the couch once im home, all my hobbies are on the back burner, and i just get this intense dread and instant light switch rage trigger when i gotta go to work or am at work, drinking on the weekends to excess.

1c4qswl,“GodFather” offer - WWYD,"I very recently (3 weeks in) started a fully in office role as a department Manager for a small business. I’m the sole member of this department and have spent these first few weeks “getting dirty” and formulating a modernization plan for the company as it’s light years behind in many aspects. 

However, last weekend, an old boss of mine called me with a “Godfather” offer to come work for them at a new company they’re involved with forming. Essentially a 50% salary increase, fully remote role with a superior title. I would be an absolute buffon to not take it. So, I verbally agreed, and have been in contact with my old boss since. They’re expecting to have a formal offer letter to me within the next 2 weeks, as the company formation is all but finalized. I would trust this person with my life based on our history together. I have no reason to doubt their word.

I’m doing my best to act like it’s status quo at this new job I started until I receive the offer letter, but that’s proving difficult. As I’ve laid the ground work for how I think the company should proceed with modernizing and set down those paths, I don’t want to take any of the projects I’ve started too far if I won’t be here to see them through.

I feel like my best option for now is to just drag my feet and hope the offer letter comes before the new company can even notice.

1c4qqap,Promotion changed me (and I don’t like me anymore),"Reddit, I (45f) need your help with my first world problem. I’ve worked in Finance most of my career. I love the industry and working- I was the annoying person who loved going back to work after vacation. 

Three years ago I accepted a promotion and am now on the leadership team. I was the fourth person in this position in five years but was confident I’d be different. My gut told me not to take it but I did. I now manage multiple areas of the organization and make $140,000 a year. I work around 45 to 50 hours weekly, sometimes more depending on travel. 

I’m well paid for my area of the country and don’t log a lot of extra hours. I have great benefits and a great title. The problem is I absolutely hate my job and dread coming to work each day- I used to be a go getter and now it takes everything in me to get out of bed and go to work. We have a less than ideal culture/work environment and are very much a “good old boy” club. My boss  encourages me to keep on keeping on, be the bigger person, and overlook it all but I’m exhausted of battling to accomplish what’s been asked of me. Frankly, I don’t like who I’ve become. 

In the last year I was offered four jobs but all require relocating. My husband loves his career and doesn’t want to move (which I support). Our child is getting ready to start school and we have a great support system. 

I started going to therapy to get myself back on track as I hate who I’ve become. I’m torn on what to do- stay in my well paying job and be miserable (understanding that people have it MUCH worse) or step away and focus on my family and volunteer more? Pack up and move? Change careers?

1c4qmkq,How to phase title/role on resume?,"Hello!

At a former company, I was interviewed by both the Dir and VP in the department.  During the interview with both individuals the VP got up and left, then came back and asked the Dir to bring me to his office when they were finished with their portion of the interview.

As I was talking to the VP, they made it clear that they were looking to replace the Dir (the person I just interviewed with!) and they appreciated my experience both as an individual contributor and as a manager.

I accepted the job with a title that is reflective of an individual contributor, but the entire time I was there, I was doing the work of the Director.  The VP wanted me up to speed on everything the Director did, so it would be a seamless transition when they got rid of them. 

However, I left before the transition happened...way too much drama.  So my question is, how can I reflect that on my resume?  If I write my official title, it appears that I took a step back in my career as I was previously in management, then accepted an ""engineer"" role.  However, while I was there, I was acting Director.  I was responsible for budgeting, project planning team leadership, technical direction, etc.

1c4prwr,"I hate the job I went back to, advice ???? Anybody? ","I am an engineer assistant/electrical mechanical technician. I used to work at this well known company for 7 years. I’m highly skilled at my job but I left because the toxic environment. The management has a lot of favoritism, the majority of men are perverted and the women are jealous. The main reason I left is because I started the job when I was 21 years old and left at 25-26 years old. Everyday I’d go to work and mind my business. Just work. Go home. That’s it. I’m a simple person. 

because I started young, I naturally have attention drawn to me. I work with a lot of elder folks. If I’m not being sexually harassed/objectified by the majority of men there, I am being bullied by older women who are upset just because of my presence. 

I don’t want to sound full of myself but I am a young attractive woman and 70% of the time I try to make myself “look ugly” so people don’t look or pay attention to me. It doesn’t work. You’re probably wondering why does this matter? Well because I’m someone whose always being noticed by everyone, I try to blend into the crowd (done this most of my life and it usually doesn’t work). I try to be super nice to everyone so I don’t get on peoples bad side, still doesn’t work. I try to work hard hoping I get promoted like others, instead they just give me more work load. 

I was working at 2 private companies. Both in an office. The first one I quit because I worked there for a year and they still wouldn’t hire me nor pay me for my skills so I resigned (tired of being underpaid for my experience). The 2nd office, I was the assistant to the Vice President of the company. That job was the best job ever and paid well but I got laid off because of “budget cuts” … the whole staff was sad to se me go but it was the CEO’s decision…. It sucks because usually every job I work at I’m the managements favorite due to my work ethic and intelligence in my field but being nice to look at also has its advantages… 

Because I got laid off I had to go back to this warehouse I used to work at … I hate it here. The people are miserable and they put the definition into “misery loves company” if you will. 80-85% of people there are extremely negative and two face and all talk badly about each other and tell on each other like they’re literal children. 

I need to have a job and been trying to start a business so I can gtfo but it’s hard to pay bills and also support my business (inventory etc time effort). 

What are y’all’s advice opinion on going back to a company you quit? (They pay the best :/ ) secondly , how do you ignore crazy people? I ignore people and they still try to find a way to get me noticed to a point where management likes me as a topic of discussion … I don’t like being noticed unless it’s to do with promotion or more pay. I don’t like any negative attention on me. Even when I mind my business ppl still find a way to bully or harass me. 

Example: in my department it requires me to gather my supplies. The other day we didn’t have what we needed on the floor so it’s normal for ppl to go upstairs into the office and grab what they need. I’m gone for 15 minutes waiting for my supplies to be handed to me by someone. I get downstairs and start working , my supervisor pulls me to the side and says we need to talk and I say about what? (She always has to talk to me about BULLSHIT!) she said “Chris said you disappeared for an hour hiding in the restroom” - mind y’all I said I was only gone for 15 min upstairs in the office! He lied to my supervisor, didn’t know where I was at, and made me look bad!!! This happened to me all the time! Lies and bs like this. It gives me negative light and causes management to micromanage me which makes no sense because I’m not doing anything other than my job!!!!!!! When I tell my management the truth they believe others over me and it’s unfair (the favoritism I mentioned earlier)

I first went remote in 2020, and at the same time went on antidepressants after a huge weight loss, and stopped going to the gym, and gained a tonnnn of weight in one year. Then I got fired from that job… because I had just graduated, looking for a job for months, got very depressed, couldn’t sleep, and woke up late and clocked in late a couple times, and suddenly was let got after 5 years, 8 months being remote.

Then I had a job for 2.5 years fully remote that really only took a couple of hours each day, was only making 42k. Struggled a lot financially, anxiety and depression ramped up, I wasn’t making enough to go do things I wanted. 

I got a new job fully in office making 52k. Unhappy with the culture here, only got a 1 percent raise after a year, very toxic workplace, overwhelmed and understaffed, constantly threatened, high turnover, three people fired in six months. It’s a customer service role. I enjoy being around people and going to the new office, but I’m not super social, I feel like I’ve hurt myself by not socializing enough or attending any after work happy hours. I’m very quiet and an introvert.

I have been interviewing for an account manager role that I’m a great fit for making 65k fully remote for an ERP tech company. I am excited about it, because it would round up my experience in supply chain, customer service, and BA in Communications nicely, and getting into tech sales can pay a lot eventually. I am a bit worried about how to maintain my mental health during working remote though. 

Any tips?

1c4lq6w,Should I continue doing a job I’ve been doing for 2 months but haven’t been hired into?,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible but there's a lot to unpack and I'll have a TLDR.

At the beginning of this year, it randomly came up in a conversation with a higher-up (we'll call him Tom) that I am currently pursuing a Computer Science degree (should be finished early next year). For a little background, I self-studied for almost 2 years (online course, certs, etc.) prior to officially pursuing a degree so I had projects and was very familiar with programming and data analysis as I'd also previously been an Economics student.

Fast forward to February and I randomly get a Teams call from Tom who asks me to remind him what degree I'm getting. Tom then explained that our data analyst (the only data analyst for the department, level 4 who we'll call Adam) is leaving on the first day of March and asked if I wanted to shadow Adam. Tom said that he could wait on posting the job until I've finished shadowing Adam. My current role is an unrelated step-below managerial role so I agreed.

So, the shadowing was great. Most of the stuff I already knew aside from learning VBA. Another higher-up who we'll call Dan asks me how the shadowing is going. I tell him great. Dan tells me that once February is over, they will post the job internally and send it directly to me.

So, March 1st comes around. The data analyst is gone. And I'm doing his work which is various reporting and analysis. Dan calls me and tells me that instead of posting the job right away, they'll have me do the work for a month to give me an edge up in the event that an applicant has ""10 years of IT experience or something like that.""  I don't think anyone with 10 years in data analytics is applying to a government job that starts at $60k but I digress.

A week passes and I get a call from Dan. He says that instead, they will be posting the job within a couple of days. Dan also says that the job will now be posted externally too because they don't have the ""skill set internally that is needed"" and that ""the posting will be really competitive.""

During March, I wrote code in VBA to help create and maintain some productivity tracking tools, time reporting, etc. I was bored one day and I decided to initiate a data analysis project of my own accord. I've been using Python and SQL. Without releasing confidential details, this project will potentially allow the agency to recoup tens of thousands of dollars if not more and also has highlighted a system issue in some software that we use as well as process issues among employees. Furthermore, the other higher-up Tom, who is Dan's boss, was so impressed with this project that he wants to present it to a much higher higher-up who I guess would be the public sector equivalent of a C-suite position.

At the beginning of April, I asked for an update on when the interviewing/hiring process will start. Dan in one sentence over IM says ""We have started screening the applications."" 

Another week passes, I asked Dan for another update on the process because I did not see a status update in our job portal. Normally, the status will say 'Screening' once the process has begun. Dan says that they haven't updated the status yet because they don't want applicants who haven't been selected to ask questions about why they were screened out. Dan further explains that they don't have a large enough pool of qualified applicants because many get screened out for not being willing to meet the travel percentage, not willing to work outside of 8-5, etc. 

I asked Dan when the process will begin. He says that he doesn't have a date for when it will start.

Another thing I noticed on the job posting is that the closing date is in September 2024.

Note: Before Adam, this position was unfilled for a year after the guy before Adam left.

What I want to know is: Are they yanking my chain? What would you do? I am genuinely lost on what I should do. I've been doing this because it would be great to have experience in the field I plan to go into before even graduating. The previous data analyst Adam also negotiated his salary above the starting so I could make $20k - $25k more than I'm making now in my current unrelated role.

TLDR: I've been doing a job for 2 months that I've significantly contributed to but haven't been hired and it feels like I'm getting the run around when asking for updates on the hiring process.",idobethrownawaytho,1,1.0,0,1713186313,2024-04-15 13:05:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c4lq6w/should_i_continue_doing_a_job_ive_been_doing_for/,4,2024
1c4leob,More time off with less money or vice versa,"Last year I decided to make a career change, I went from 170k+ working 40+ hours per week to an 80k job that gives me months off at a time.

My current job is a retainer salary. I'm contracted 1650 hours for $80,000 per year. If I work more hours I make a standard rate for every hour. Never ×1.5. Plus since my job involves travel I get per diem which average $500/week when I'm traveling. The problem is I'm not guaranteed extra hours, so I have to be able to live off $80,000 which of course can be done. Also, this company had a lot of issues that make it hard to work for them.

The main reason I took this job was to travel on my off time. When I'm off, on standby,  I can travel anywhere I want within the US. They will fly me from wherever I am to the job and pay my airport parking. I'm allowed to take 2-4 months off every year to travel wherever I want without being on standby, this would be mainly international travel. But its extremely hard to do for me at this salary. Since covid, traveling has gotten very expensive, especially within the US. I'm not a backpacker or hostel type of person, I snore so I cant do that the other people in the hostels. So my dreams of traveling the world are currently more expensive than what I make. It would take me 5 or so years to be at the salary I want at this job.

Now, I may have the option of going back to a job similar to my old one. I'd be making closer to 160k per year plus a bonus, but I would only get 2 weeks vacation starting off with this new company. The career growth would be unlimited. This new company is huge and has a reputation for promoting from within.

I know everybody's priorities are different. My main dilemma is giving off this much time off.  Is it worth the time off if I can't afford to do what I want with it? I could get an apartment in a decent city and just enjoy my time off in one place, then travel internationally to cheap areas occasionally. What are your opinions on this?

1c4jvma,Suggestions required ,"Hey guys,

I hope I get a good response on this. I've just completed my UG in Mechanical Engineering and entered corporate. There are a lot of things happening at the same time, a few are planning to do masters, a few are trying to switch jobs for better packages.

I just wanted to understand if you need an MBA for switching to a better job and getting a better package. Right now I'm in technical sales and I intend to do stay in similar roles (Project management, product management, etc.)

Could you share your insights on this? Is MBA needed so much to get a career boost? Is there a way to get better packages and career without out an MBA?

1c4jj82,"Interviewing for position with a heavy marketing component, haven't been primary on marketing since 7ish years ago in entry level positions. How best to smooth over some of this lack of experience?","I'm interviewing for a marketing and membership role at a membership-based organization.

I have extensive membership-management experience, and that has involved a lot of collaboration with a marketing team, and just from that I have a solid foundation to go off of. Beyond this, in my previous roles, I was much more ""primary"" on marketing/communications, but these were entry level roles, and didn't involve as much high level marketing planning as this role will. I did do a decent amount of video and copy editing, helped launch a podcast, and did a lot of ""member outreach"" that wasn't strictly a marketing/communications effort, but amounted in many ways to the same thing.

I think, between all my roles, I have enough exprience to come into the role with a solid skillset, and quickly pick up on anywhere that I might be lacking. 

But how do I convey this in an interview? I'm reading up on some of the academic terminology, marketing funnel, marketing mix, customer journey etc, some of which is familiar, some I'm a bit rusty on, but conceptually it's not difficult for me to understand. Do I just shoehorn these terms into my interview?

Alternatively, do I just cop to where my experience is lacking, or do I draw attention away from that, and instead focus on how the combination of experience from my various roles makes up for any defecits? Do I throw ""I'm a fast learner"" type stuff in there, or does that just draw attention to areas where I'll need to brush up, and thus make me look like a less attractive candidate?

The reality is, I've learned most of the skills I use in my career on the job, and pick things up quickly, and am good and filling in gaps by doing my own research and asking for help where appropriate. I absolutely can do this job, I just don't know the most tactful way to communicate that.

1c4i9pl,Would you take this job?,"I always want to be 100% comfortable with myself before taking on a Big career decision.

I currently work for a large nonprofit (1000+ employees). I have regularly been swamped with work and stressed generally. We just went through layoffs and my group was hit hard. My manager is pretty great and has been telling me to dial back the hours so I am not spending much time working. However my workload has definitely been increasing an worried about the budgeting season starting up soon. Also our tems and software are crap and do not make things better for us, there are so many leadership and communication issues, people are actively leaving or trying to leave, and things are generallt sucky here. Although my coworkers are great and supportive. My salary here is $116K and is fully WFH.

I have also been interviewing and the job market has been brutal to say the least. I interviewed for one position that is made for me at another NGO. And I got an offer  Essentially my career has been built up to land this sort of position. It's a badass position in a really interesting field. However it's still a growing organization but I would be helping to start up the department which I have quite a bit of experience in and know what to do on. Hiring manager said it would be intense and well we will see. My offer is $125K and I plan to negotiate in a call today with hiring manager. It's 100% remote and fully flexible with lots of geographic mobility which would be amazing for me. The whole org is fully remote. This opportunity would be such a legit opportunity for me. 

I am wary of work life balance because in my current job, I am trying to just coast and just get by especially after all the layoffs that have happened. Even though it's hard. There are always meetings and calls for nearly everything and there are so many deliverables and working in an inefficient and ineffective environment is just so challenging. I prefer things done much more simply which I think might be this new job. The job itself is really just cool.

I would keep looking but I can't take it anymore at my current place. Also this new opportunity doesn't always land at my feet. The pay raise to switch to the new job isn't that much given the intense type of work but I can't shake the feeling this type of opportunity won't land again, or rarely.

What should I do?

1c4hhk4,Can't get over previous trauma ,"22F, had a horrible job experience last year. Fixed Term contract at small start up engineering job straight out of Uni in NZ. Lots of drama, and bullying. Groupchats made mocking a manager. Near the end of my time there, the office space was redesigned, which left the manager and I alone. He ignored me all day, waited till we were alone and said he was testing me, cut up the paper work I did and held it up to my face. Ended up telling the CEO and he said ""did that really happen"" etc, next day he wanted me gone. Said work was drying up and when would I want to leave, but then ended that comment saying things might change. Ended up basically saying my last day was in a few days. Didn't give any written notice. Emailed and asked for written notice of 4 weeks per contract. Called me into his office and said I was morally wrong.

1c4gapw,Auto Manufacturer Corporate Career advice,"Not sure if I’m posting in the right place, but feel pretty confident that there are people here that can at least chime in with their perspective 

*Why I’m posting:* I have 8 years experience at the dealership level with a high line German auto manufacturer. I want to transition to a corporate role for multiple reasons, but highlight the main drivers below.

*Dilemma/Value:* I do not have a completed college degree, but understand a substantial amount about the auto industry (at least from the dealership perspective), and also understand through my years of experience in varying roles, the relationship between the dealership and the manufacturer in addition to everything an 8 year veteran would know about customer service and dealership processes.

*Outcome:* After multiple applications to a high-performance, exotic auto manufacturer (only for roles that I have matching experience with), and applications to the brand I currently work with, I haven’t received any calls back.

*Goal/Desire:* My main goal is to work my way up to a Monday-Friday, low-mid 6 figure career where I can leverage my experience in a challenging role, but I don’t know where I would fit. I’m averse to pursuing a role with a manufacturer that’s not my current brand, or one of higher quality because of testimonials I’ve heard over the years from those working with these other automakers.

*What it all means:* That being said, I’m at a loss for how I can make myself more valuable/marketable to these manufacturers given I am a high-performer, without taking out student loans to finish my degree. I work 45-55 hours a week currently, and have a kid and wife, as well as volunteer locally, so my days are pretty much full, and can’t change that. Also not able to relocate for personal reasons.

Am I just stuck? Or is there upward mobility available for me? If there is, what do I need to do to tap into that? Who do I need to talk to? What kinds of questions do I need to ask?

1c4fcov,Got put on an extremely unreasonable PIP. What should I do?,"Really upset with my company right now. I've been at this accounting firm (not B4, smaller firm) for 2 years.  
First, I get vague accusations of ""over-billing"" despite zero communication from my manager of how long a task should take, or what the threshold for ""over-billing"" is. No explanation was provided to me about the details of what exactly was excessive about what I billed either. And it wasn't like I was screwing off either, I literally show up in person to the office more than anyone my level, more than what is required. Even some of the accusations came from tasks where i can definitely say i was focused the entire time.  
But the ""over billing"" isnt what got me the PIP  
And then, a manager I'd never worked with before asks me to help with an extremely tight deadline project, that was described as ""4 months of work in 4 weeks"" (i was only working on part of it though). I was the last one working in the office during the project, putting blood sweat and tears and working OT to help, despite it being the hardest and most difficult client work I've had. Yes I struggled, and the manager had to take over some of my work. But I literally don't think at least 60-70% of the employees my level could have done what was asked of me.  
The manager on the team doesn't say one word to me about my performance on the project. Then the next week, with nothing put on my calendar, a different manager sneaks up behind me while I'm working and says ""you're coming with me"" and drags me into a meeting with HR, and makes me sign a 30 day PIP with vague objectives, and no actual tangible goals to meet.  
So I'm literally getting fired for working overtime. And my honest reflection of my performance at the company is that I'm an average performer. Yes i've struggled at times before, but I honestly feel like I'm just as good as most of the employees my level, and I show up more than them too. I think I just unfortunately worked with mostly toxic managers, who think any work product isn't good enough. (other managers give me little to no comments and say my work is great, but certain one will always have complaints).  
I've wanted to prove to them that they're way off base here and being unreasonable, so I've actually been working the entire PIP period to prove them wrong.  
30 days is almost up, so I assume they will still try to fire me without severance soon. They'll probably try to claim that I didn't live up to the PIP, but I feel like I did, and I have my work product to prove it. And it was super vague anyway, so I think I could have a solid argument.  
Is there anything I can do to earn more severance? They might not fire me but just make it so difficult on me that I want to quit myself, as my manager has been micromanaging the crap out of me for most of the PIP period.

1c4e20m,Red flags of the norm at a small company? ,"I’ve been working at a small IT company for a while. But the longer I stay there the more suspicions I have about the company. To start with, there’s no accountants at all, only one HR paying everyone off. You wanna know a breakdown of your earning? Proudly no details, because, “like I said, me no accountant. “ Also, the so-called managers are all so deep buried with tons of tasks and there’s lil to none actual managing happening in the company. The tasks are poorly assigned, discussed and measured. And micromanaging seem to be the only reliable approach to them. The majority of the work really relies on previous experience and personal work ethics instead of clear guidelines or trainings. High turnovers- three  employees in my team have left in the last 6 months. The list goes on. 

My question is - I definitely see those as red flags. But I also understand that most companies are recovering rather slowly from Covid right now and, especially for smaller companies, we can’t ask for perfection can we?

1c4dp8c,I need reassurance that being selfish is the right choice,"I have a second interview for a job on Tuesday morning. An actual salary, benefits, relevant-to-my-degree job. Not only that but, literally precisely what I went to school for.

I have tried SO many times to get a job like this. Resumes, long cover letters, etc. Never hear back. For some reason, one night this job popped up on Indeed, I decided instead of putting any effort in that I would submit my resume through Indeed. No cover letter. No physical resume. Just pushed ""Send"" on my resume. I had my first phone interview and was anxious they would not call me back, then found out they want an in person interview! I'm so excited but also terrified because of my current life choices I have dug myself in...

I am a student and accepted a part time internship over the summer for a non profit that pays $1000 for the whole summer (150 hours total.... math that out.) I likely would not be able to participate in this anymore, but would likely fuck the two ladies in this program over..

I work on a food truck. We have 4 employees total. It's summer season (the BIG season...). I have worked here for over 4 years and I know when I tell my boss it is going to keep him up at night trying to figure out how he can replace me (it won't be difficult, but more the logistics of having to hire). I was also supposed to cover my coworker for the entire month of August as he's having a baby and will be gone. It is likely I would fuck him over a bit as well and this is someone who is like family to me.

I am telling myself I need to take this job for not only fulfilling my actual dream career that applies to my Master's degree, but also pays extremely well +401k, health insurance, blah blah.

1c4cqkc,"At a crossroads and extremely anxious, any advice?","
I’ve been extremely anxious and stressed about work lately, and am really feeling lost.

To summarize my current career situation, I’ve worked in higher education mostly in an administrative fashion and my first real job post college I was an International Student Advisor at a University. I had that job for about 4 years until I was laid off due to a restructure. After that I had a hard time finding a job for a little while and took a temporary job at another University. I left that job for the full time job that I’m currently at. I’ve been at this position for a little more than a year.

This job is another administrative position at a University. Around October I started covering for someone who went on maternity leave. This person had a different position from me and mostly worked with faculty support, which was new to me and not part of my own position. I was the main coverage for 2 faculty members who are also heads of research labs. I was essentially supporting both with all their scheduling, expenses, finance stuff, etc. It was extremely overwhelming and stressful and I made mistake at certain points, especially towards the end.

My manager spoke to me about it and said while although I was covering for someone she can’t accept when I flat out miss things, which is fair. I’ve finished covering for them and just transitioned back to my hired role’s full responsibilities, which entails a lot of tracking for onboarding and visa purposes for new students, postdocs, etc. I’ve been getting everything back up to speed in my end with how I track these. But last week I missed something when an incoming student emailed with my manager cc’d asking why they hadn’t received a confirmation about one of their forms being submitted. My manager emailed me asking why this hadn’t been prepared yet, and it had been almost 2 weeks. I had to tell her that I missed it and wasn’t aware it was ready for submission (which is not a good excuse).

Now I’m extremely stressed about our weekly meeting this week. A PIP had been mentioned in the past when I made the few mistakes while covering for the faculty. I’m really scared that if I get put on a PIP that it’s basically it and I’m going to get fired.

I moved in with my girlfriend this year and we have been discussing finances and things like that going forward and me opening a retirement savings, etc. To be honest I don’t really love this job, but it’s a good job for now and I don’t know where I would go from here if I did get fired. I’m just really anxious and scared for my future and feel lost career wise as I don’t want to be in higher ed long term anyway. 

I was considering taking classes that are part of the benefit of working at this school but I have no idea what I want to take, or where I want to go career wise. Now I’m just scared I’m not gunna even have a job.

Here are my questions. Please don't feel like you have to answer all of them. I will be appreciative of any insights you're willing to share.

1. For those that have remote customer success jobs do you have any down time during the day? Like time to do laundry or cook a meal or run an errand or just take a breather or is it usually go, go, go for the entire day?

2. I realize that most customer success jobs are with tech companies but I'm more interested in doing client success for training and coaching companies. Does anyone have experience doing client success in this niche? If so, what do you love most about it and what do you find most challenging about it?

3. What are the best books to read, courses to take and YouTube channels to follow to prepare me for a career in customer success?

4. What would be the best way to try out this career path to make sure it's right for me before committing? Is there anyway to test drive the career and also get some experience?

1c4aqpv,Should I be worried?,"so i was hired for a hybrid job and started last month. they let me know that for 3 months id have to be in the office everyday then i could start working remote. i never thought much of it until i started and realized my manager is not as nice as i thought and seems to be very controlling. in my offer it does not state that it is a hybrid position and after talking to other people on my team i learned they were all hired for hybrid positions but lost the opportunity to be hybrid for a year and just got it back in january. the whole company is hybrid but it was just my specific team that lost that privilege for some time. this is my first post grad job and i struggled to find one for so long so obviously i want to keep this opportunity but given the fact i live an hour away and was really counting on working from home twice a week eventually, should i be worried? can this be something that could be taken away from me? its been miserable being in the office everyday but that’s a different story. i knew my first real job wasn’t gonna be amazing but im just anxious. i feel like im counting down the days till 3 months hits and worried that then i won’t be able to even work hybrid bc there is no where in writing that states that i guess?  i did ask my manager once if she meant 90 business days or calander days before i could work hybrid and she said calendar days and that i would have to do a “bootcamp” and if i passed then i could be hybrid but that was my first week there. it probably seems like im worried over nothing maybe but there’s been a lot of confusing things my manager has said, and tbh i just get the vibe that she doesn’t like me and she’s really controlling (ik she’s my manager but i thought working a big girl job wouldn’t feel like highschool!)",Some_Entertainment70,3,1.0,0,1713146768,2024-04-15 02:06:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c4aqpv/should_i_be_worried/,4,2024
1c4aq8g,Which job is the better option long term?,"
I am 35yo and live in WI USA. 

I worked in the Veterinary field for 12 years, 8 serving as a Veterinary Nurse/technician at various clinics. After I had my child I became  SAHM but continued to work 1 day per week. During COVID, I felt burnt out from the field. It was mundane and I needed a break. 

I decided to start a plant and design sector for my husband's landscaping business. I had been doing design for a few years on the side so I knew I just needed to Amp up Services. 

It went great/has been great. I love working outside. Even though I had a few jobs it wasn't enough especially during the winter months. I found myself to be depressed and unhappy.

So this past November I got a job at a Veterinary Teaching Hospital at a University- 30 hrs a week. It has great hours so I don't miss any non school hours with my kid. Great benefits- health, retirement. My issue is that I can only take 2 weeks off per year for PTO and you aren't allowed to take time off without PTO. 

The job also doesn't truly utilize my skills as the work I would normally do is done by students. 


I am contemplating quiting and going back to landscaping/design. We would then go back subpar health insurance and no retirement plan (besides one we sign up for individually). I am not necessarily happy in the vet tech job. I also feel like I can't keep up with basic housework or grocery shopping.

Vet tech:
30hrs week.
Great benefits - retirement and health
2 weeks PTO/yr
+/- some design work
Love medicine and animals.

Landscape:
20-30 hrs/wk
I choose the schedule 
No benefits
Love design and planting

I realize many people work 40+ and deal with the daily grind. (You are super human!) 

 I am fortunate enough that I can choose what I want to do. 

What would you do?

1c497j9,Five years ago I was able to get my dream job as a research scientist. Realized that I don't have much of an identity outside of work and I am always worried about getting fired. How do I let loose and learn to enjoy life?,"Hello all,

This is a bit of a vent and a bit of a call for help. I am a first generation college student and American. My parents always stressed doing well in school. We didn't have a lot of money growing up and I had a lot of familial responsibility which caused me to miss out on things like camps, extracurriculars, big commitments to clubs, etc. I was always good at school and enjoyed learning / academic environments.

 I decided to pursue a career as a research scientist and got a BS and PhD in physics. I was able to get myself into the position of getting a research staff spot at a National Laboratory. I get the pleasure of learning new things and working on / leading research studies that have a high impact. This is what I thought I always wanted.

However, I am not very happy at all. I have trouble bonding with my coworkers, who have largely come from wealthier backgrounds, and learning how to play office politics (I didnt know the phrase ""manage up"" before I started). I am always anxious that I will be let go (this is despite the fact that I have gotten several extra raises for good performance). I don't know what else I can do with a PhD in physics if I am told I am not up to snuff as a researcher at this position. I can't go back to a postdoc, or at least I dont think I can. Why would anyone take a chance on me?

 I relocated to a VHCOL city for this job and have been saving like crazy but no amount is ever enough. My coworkers are all highly intelligent and dedicated and I feel that I need to work overtime to ensure that my contributions are up to snuff. I suffer from massive impostor syndrome and my anxiety/insecurity IS making me an ineffective comunicator. I have not developed hobbies or a friend group outside of work because I spent my time working, exercising, or resting / taking care of chores.

On top of this, I have almost zero path of upward progression other than becoming a Group Leader or Senior Researcher, both of which will not be on the table for another 5+ years. 

I feel behind. I feel like I cannot rest. My friends and family have noted I seem much more serious and easy to agitate. I worry that this isn't actually the career that I wanted and I just picked what was in front of me and thought that a physics degree would open up a lot of doors for me.

What advice would you have on how I can best proceed and learn to enjoy life? How can I best use mentors and what are the best questions to ask?

1c48ihp,What do I do if I accepted a job I don't think I'm qualified for?,"Hey there! I'm thrilled (and a bit nervous) because I just landed my first fully remote job at a non profit. For the past 13 years, I've been working in the medical field, the past 7 a a tribal health facility—doing everything from medical assisting to billing and currently as a patient benefits specialist. I handle new patient registrations and assist with applications like Medicaid, SNAP, and HEAP. I also had a short stint as an executive assistant in a nonprofit that managed community health related grants. However it was a very toxic environment where the CEO bullied staff. I saw it right away and left before she could treat me that way.  
  
Now, I've accepted a remote program manager position with a nonprofit that supports medical providers in less-resourced countries with equipment and training. The job will mostly be project-based and asynchronous. I'm looking to get a head start and learn more about non profits, global health and the processes involved. Is there anything specific I should study or familiarize myself with? . I love helping people and I feel so grateful that I'll be able to combine my passion for all things medical with making a difference in the world.  
  
Also, I probably seem a bit neurotic, but I looked up the person who had the position before me on LinkedIn, and this is what she listed as her job duties. I thought I would share them in case there's something there that could help guide me to specific topics or resources to study.  
  
""Managing and executing projects including project scoping, planning, developing strategic recommendations, and overseeing project delivery  
  
Responsible for strategic planning, including setting targets for milestones and adhering to deadlines  
  
Making use of productivity tools and creating processes to improve productivity  
  
Overseeing the installation of lab equipment in low-resource settings  
  
Enrolling, and serving as liaison between labs and partner organizations  
  
Developing processes and procedures to vet and determine eligibility of laboratories to participate in L projects

Organizing and administering virtual education courses for pathologists and laboratorians  
  
Collaborating with partner organizations to expand current projects  
  
Creating budget and adjusting them when unforeseen barriers come up""  
  
I'm feeling quite nervous because I feel totally unprepared. In my previous role at a nonprofit, I helped manage grants by ensuring all the reports were printed and sent out each month, but we had a dedicated staff member as a grant writer. So, I've never actually written a grant, and it sounds terrifying. Additionally, I've never had to create or adjust a budget. I really want to be the best employee I can be and come prepared as much as possible.  
  
I honestly don't even know how I got an interview , let alone an offer. The person prior to me had dual masters in public health and I only have an associates degree. I want to take this opportunity and learn the skills. I think it can shift my career into a new direction. But I am feeling like a complete fraud.  
  
It will be a mostly asynchronous schedule aside from a few set meetings each week as all the rest of the staff are volunteers and are employed as professors, doctors and pathologists during the day. How do I ensure that I get the training I need? And how do I explain when I do not know something. I was thinking there may be a way I can screen record so I can reference meetings and explanations later.  
  
I'm really excited about this new opportunity and would appreciate any advice or pointers you can share.

I've been exploring other job titles and responsibilities, but I could really use some guidance.

Here’s a list of what I do:

* Audit and manage website backlinks on for-profit website
* Website build management for nonprofit arm, including content creation, with no supervision or direction
* Design and oversee print and digital ads for franchises
* Create various marketing materials (brochures, rack cards, ads, etc.)
* Advise on trade shows and sponsorships, manage booth logistics
* Manage promotional items and apparel selection and design
* Develop handout items and seek operational efficiencies
* Create microsites for franchisees and maintain mailing lists
* Conduct trademark checks and update outdated information
* Develop templates for franchisee self-reliance
* Audit and code credit card receipts, assist with marketing budget
* Future responsibility for managing and updating the new for-profit website

1c48gaa,Would you take a job offer lower than what was agreed upon?,"I am really bitter at this situation. When I initially discussed the position with the interviewer he had asked for a range which I gave him. After numerous interviews I was offered the position. The offer was in the lowest part of my range and I asked if it would be possible that I could be closer to what I was making at my previous employer. He indicated he could and it would be just 3k less than what I made previously. 

Fast forward to almost a month letter. I get the offer letter and the offer was not only not the lower part of my range but 4k less than that. So I would be taking a 1k hit per month on my salary from what I made at my last job. When asked about it he said the department that handles this looked into the data and came up with this number. The number I was asking for wouldn't be fair to the other people in the same position.

I just don't understand how they can have a wide range and not even be able to meet me within the range. I have another offer I am waiting on but will lose vacation and 401k match. I think the job would be a good learning experience and maybe I could be promoted within as it is a large organization but IDK how I am going to feel about it.

What have some of you done if you were in this situation? I have some sleep issues I am working on and this job is remote so that helps. I was laid off about 3 months ago and only had a handful of callbacks so far.

1c47xig,How do I re-negotiate my salary at my current job?,"Hi, 29F here and recently new mom of a 3month old baby girl. To provide further context of my situation, at my current job I get paid well and have an easy role.

What sucks is vacation policy, l'd be losing 2weeks & only have 1 week of vacation.

1c47cl4,Salary Ranges Posted on Job Announcements,"I recently applied to a position that posted a salary range of approximately $45k difference between the low end and the high end. I make a little bit more than the low end and looked at it as a good opportunity career-wise so I applied. 

In the application it asked if I would be willing to accept the bottom of the range and if not, what would be an acceptable salary. I stated no and selected a range in the middle of the $45k range thinking that the employer would be willing to pay up to the maximum in the range for the perfect candidate.

I just received a call from the HR department asking if I would accept the bottom end of the range. I stated that I would not because I make more than that.

Why would anyone put on a job announcement a range if they aren't willing to pay more than the bottom of the range? I'm sure there are a lot of people such as myself that were interested in the position and would make a good match, but they wouldn't want to make the bottom because they make more than the bottom and have the skills and background to start at a higher salary.",PuzzleheadedWeird402,2,1.0,3,1713136879,2024-04-14 23:21:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c47cl4/salary_ranges_posted_on_job_announcements/,4,2024
1c472z7,Should I apply for a different position at the same company?,"Two weeks ago, I had an interview for a research analyst position at a tech company.  At a high level, the interviews went very well, or at least I thought.  Both interviewers noted I was very qualified, the second interviewer noted that I was the most qualified applicant he had talked to. 

However, things fell apart when it came to salary.  I am making a bit (\~5%) above the salary band\* and asked if they could match my current salary... and they tend to come in at the lower range of their salary bands for new hires.  It was a bit of an awkward discussion, and I'm pretty sure I ended up pricing myself out of the role.  I have yet to hear back and sense that it's because of this salary discussion.

They have another application open for a similar role that has a higher salary band that I'd be interested in.  Is it appropriate to apply for it?  Should I wait?  If you all think it's appropriate, I'd love to email the first recruiter I interviewed and let her know I'm also interested in this new role... but I'm not entirely sure it is and don't want to offend anyone.  Curious on thoughts here! Appreciate the advice. 

\*For context, I work in consulting and finding a place that will match my current salary is tough as I'm paid pretty decently.  I'd be open to a slight decrease in pay (aka, to the top of their band), but not a major one.

I've been working here since OCT of 2022 and loved the job, benefits, coworkers, and work environment. Unfortunately, OCT of 2023, I found my direct manager/boss sleeping with my girlfriend of 3+ years in a house we just moved into. This destroyed me mentally, and wanted to move as now I have no separation from my work and personal life. The town is small (10kpop), so I see on the weekends and still work with my boss directly. Anyway, this is why I'm desperate to move and change paths. 

&#x200B;

I have received a job offer in NY with a salary of about $130,000 base with $15,000 in environmental/hazard/hot pay. They match 9% 401k and pay for relocation amongst all other health/medical benefits. The offer seems good, but they seem desperate for the hire which makes me second guess the reason for their desperation. Toxic work environment? Toxic Management? They also scheduled an interview with their senior HR for a salary offer before I even attended my first board panel interview. I want nothing more than to get out of this town, but is it worth it to move when there are a few red flags?

I have been constantly applying to Berkeley, SLAC, Lawrance Livermore, and Sandia Labs all in San Francisco area. I feel confident about hearing back from them for interviews, but nothing yet as the FED GOV works very slowly. All the positions I applied for have salary ranges between $130,000 to $165,000. Also, I would much prefer to move to SF than to Long Island. 

Should I just take this NY offer and bite the bullet, or suck it up in this shit town and hate working here for couple more months until I receive an offer that I want.

In July 2023, I relocated several states away from my hometown to accept a position with a large utilities company operating across multiple states. Fresh out of school and lacking prior experience, I got a great opportunity of employment with this company. While I generally find satisfaction in my role and enjoy collaborating with my colleagues, the location where I settled isn't proving to be a good long-term fit for me. Both my girlfriend and I sacrificed a lot to make this move, but we've mutually concluded that this area isn't conducive to our happiness, and we're eager to explore other options.  
Despite my desire to leave, I grapple with feelings of guilt when considering the prospect of transferring. My employer and coworkers have invested significantly in my development, anticipating my presence in this role for years to come. I genuinely value the support and opportunities provided by my workplace, yet our current situation is taking a toll on our mental well-being.  
Additionally, I feel apprehensive about initiating internal job applications. How should I approach discussing this with my supervisor? Is it even necessary to disclose my intentions? Transferring within the company isn't guaranteed; it entails submitting applications and undergoing interviews like any external job search. What if I express my interest but don't secure a new position? Being relatively new, I fear this revelation might prompt my employer to hasten my departure, knowing my desire to leave. Am I wrong for wanting to leave so soon? Should I just tough it out? Any advice would be greatly, appreciated.

1c45b2j,Asking for old job back after one week?,"Hello all,

So for starters I started a new position about a week ago in retail management & it just really wasn't what I was expecting or really even told about during the interview process.

I know a week is a small amount of time to really get the gist of a job but I just get the feeling that it's really a sink or swim situation & I've been there before and don't really want to put myself through that again.

I took this job mainly because of the pay & distance. The pays a lot better & it's closer to where I live at the moment. I didn't leave on bad terms with my previous job and was even told by my immediate supervisor to text her if I ever needed anything.

I don't mind swallowing my pride and asking for my old job back if it's available but I really would like some insight from other people on this matter.

Moreover, I'm debating on also asking if there's a way I could potentially come back with a small raise? I was at the lowest of the pay range they had listed on the position so it's not like I'm asking for something outside of it. Just to meet me half way on it so making ends meet won't be as difficult.
Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",mchammer126,1,1.0,4,1713131417,2024-04-14 21:50:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c45b2j/asking_for_old_job_back_after_one_week/,4,2024
1c45ar3,Next step,"Hi there!

I'm a Spanish developer with almost 3 years of experience

My evolution

First company - 6 months 18K/€

Second company - 2 years (25k/€)

Current company - 3 months (37K/€)

I have to say I have been really lucky (of course due to job hopping) because the average salary for a dev in my country's market is max 30K and my city has the same prices as any other European capital

In terms of career advancement I feel I'm learning a lot, but since I'm not working directly for the company (big french logistics's company) I feel I'm quite disposable if the project finishes, and also the organization and manganement is crap (they removed the old team also from external company to hire engineers from here due to budget)

So now I'm wondering what should I do since I'm not that comfortable with the company (unless in the future they hire me directly) and if I have to change job here I cannot ask for more unless it's a lead position (I guess I have reached the peak)

I feel like my country's job market is crap and the only reason I have good conditions is because I'm employed by a foreign company so that makes me want to move abroad

Which European countries have a solid IT sector and can be accessible for me? I have no bachelor's but a vocational degree so I guess that limits my options (unless I get more years of experience I guess)

Thanks in advance ",s3ktor_13,1,1.0,0,1713131397,2024-04-14 21:49:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c45ar3/next_step/,4,2024
1c4592d,Drug test clinic said I would not be contacted by an MRO and must disclose prescriptions to employer. ,"I completed a drug screening on Friday for a preemployment drug screening for what might be my dream job. I am on prescription that might (altho many say it doesn't not show up on 10-12 panel drug screens) show up positive. To be safe I brought my prescription with me to my drug screening. The tech told me that if it anything is positive I will be contacted by an MRO to confirm any prescriptions. So I go home and I notice on my donor form that under donor information, they put my EMPLOYERS phone number where my phone number would be. So the MRO would never be able to contact me like they said and if an MRO did try to contact me they would get my employer FIRST. 

 So I call the testing center asking to get the number changed. A different person (a clinician not a tech) told me that my employer would be the only one contacted and that I would have to contact my employer for any results. I ask her how was I supposed to confirm any prescriptions if the need arose? She told me I needed to have DISCLOSED my prescription to my employer before taking my drug screening. Being told two different things is super frustrating and now I am worried for my job that I am super excited to finally get. Does anyone have any clarity on the subject and would know what my next steps would be? My drug test was sent off on Friday the 12th of April. So it's already being processed. Do I really have to disclose my prescriptions to my employer before speaking to an MRO? How do I save my job. Thanks for everything all!

1c454j0,"My manager and the owner is failing our team, and I don’t know how to confront them about it.","Today I hit a breaking point. I work in a small cafe, it was just me and my coworker this morning. A woman comes in and tells me she has a post wedding party coming in soon, about 30 people, and that she messaged our job on instagram asking if we could host them (I later find out she asked a couple of weeks ago, so not forever ago but also not too recently). I tell her I wasn’t informed about it but went along with it anyways because I’m basically the person in charge when the manager isn’t there, and also because she showed me the response from our Instagram page that said that was possible and that we’d be extra staffed to accommodate her so I couldn’t turn her away. 

I message the owner asking about this, I get no response. Dozens of people walk in. Well over 30 people. Plus our normal rush of customers. There must’ve been 50+ people in line within 15 minutes. This isn’t normal for us, we don’t have the capability to handle that crowd.

They’re all ordering food and drinks, it’s just me up front handling the mess and drinks and my relatively new coworker who hasn’t been trained too extensively in the kitchen. I call for backup, the owner finally gets back to me and sends in 2 people. The owner is telling me she had no idea, she wasn’t made aware, that the lady didn’t respond to their message after they sent their message back to her assuring her that we could host them so she didn’t think they’d come in, etc. I didn’t look too closely at the lady’s phone when she showed me our message, so I can’t confirm anything like that. I just saw that we responded. We finally get everyone taken care of and the team does great, i let them go home because it’s their day off and they’re not happy about being called into work to take care of this group either, and I want them to take care of themselves after this multiple hours long shitshow.

 The owner sends an apology text to me and my original coworker, but I really can’t bring myself to be okay with it. I’m not okay because there was so much more I wanted to address with them this morning before this event happened. Every day I walk into a disgusting sticky understocked mess. I have to finish the closers job more often than not. I started taking documentation of everything that was left undone and dirty so that I could send a message to the owner and manager to discuss the subpar quality of the closing shifts. Im upset about the closes because the morning shift gets 2 people to handle that shift, the closers get at least 4-5. I ensure that the morning shift leaves the cafe in good condition for the closers, that everything is clean and stocked. We don’t set them up for failure. The morning shift gets 30 minutes to prepare for the day, but that time is cut into by having to clean up the mess the closers made.

This isn’t even touching on the abhorrent miscommunication epidemic we have here. The kitchen manager will change the menu or ingredients on an item on a whim, not informing anyone or changing our physical menus. They’re big changes too, not unnoticeable ones. I’ve asked him to communicate to us multiple times, he never changes. I’m left looking stupid and having to do damage control because of his actions and the expectations of customers. It gets tiring. 

I’m tired of babysitting our management. Our manager is consistently late, doesn’t confront problems when they should be confronted, and doesn’t set any standards. He’s there for the closes. My female coworkers tell me that him and the other male coworkers stand around and converse and drink while the rest of the team is busting their ass to get out on time. I only see what happens in the day shift, and the only things that go wrong during the day shifts are to the fault of what the closers leave us with, along with miscommunication from management.

Me and my coworkers are tired of the shit we have to put up with. I bring up the issues of what I’ve found wrong to the manager just for awareness, but it feels like talking to a brick wall. I want to tell the owners and manager how me and my coworkers are feeling, because they look up to me even though I’m not a manager and I care about them and setting them up for success. My coworkers are scheduled for clopens, doubles, split shifts (where they open, leave early, then come back to close), etc. multiple times a week, they’re tired and burnt out and feel like they can’t say no because we’re understaffed. We don’t get our schedules until literally last minute.  Our inventory management is nonexistent. We sell pastries from fucking kroger instead of a local bakery like they say they do. This feels like a sinking ship. I want everyone to do their job easily and with confidence without the million roadblocks they face every day. We all feel failed, especially after today. 

I don’t want to burn bridges, I just want there to be change. They know that I’m leaving this job next month due to a move I’m making relatively soon, but after today I have no respect for our leadership anymore. I want to give my two weeks instead of leaving in a month like I planned. I know they rely on me heavily but I can’t do this anymore. I’ve been taken advantage of, provided services that were promised to be paid but were not paid for months, and I’ve had to teach myself every aspect of this job because there’s no training standards. I’m so stressed and feel sick when I come into work. The newer coworkers are experiencing this too and they’ve already gotten a bad taste in their mouth about this place. We are all unhappy here. We want to care but we can’t, the manager doesn’t take us seriously and the owners are too lighthearted about the mistakes they make. How do I tell our leadership that they’re driving us all away by their lack of initiative and their seemingly inability to care and burning us out? I feel like they deserve to know, because shit is about to hit the fan here and as much as I don’t respect them as business owners, I know them personally from before getting hired and know they aren’t evil.",thathappyhippie,3,1.0,0,1713130952,2024-04-14 21:42:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c454j0/my_manager_and_the_owner_is_failing_our_team_and/,4,2024

1c44e3a,How to stop getting treated like an intern and taken seriously ,"I have realized recently that I am always getting treated like a kid when interfacing with other companies and customers and even internal employees. 

The problem is that I am in my mid 30’s but probably look more like mid 20’s. I am in an executive engineering position that is typically reserved for engineers in their mid 50’s or older. I have about 200 engineers of all ages under me. 

Some examples: 

“Are you a graduate student?” Said at a board meeting for a nearby university. No! I’m a board member! 

“Maybe we can talk to you more about working together”, after a long conversation with me, said to one of my program leads who is 20 years older but 2 levels under me and doesn’t work between companies. 

When we do intros, people typically want to come back to me in shock that I am the senior leader from my company in the room. “I don’t understand, so Charles works for you??”  

“You have a house in the mountains? What, is it like your parents’ house?” 

I could go on and on. What can I do to stop this? I feel like shaving down the middle of my head to appear balding and older. 

Has anyone else had to deal with this?

1. Continue on the accounting path - get my CPA license. I would probably go into tax. 
2. Go back to school for computer science. I love this idea, but I think the field is becoming over saturated. 
3. Go back to school to become a therapist. I like this idea but 2 years undergrad + 2 years masters + 2 years to get licensed is a lot.

My manager was super happy for me and super motivating, but now I have to deal with handing him my accounts that were not handled correctly, and I feel awful.

Sometimes I feel like it’s burnout, but this time around I feel like it’s more boredom from the job than anything and now I want out.

1c3z13e,"Early Career Help (25, ~$130k)","Hey everybody. Kinda stressed about my career and need some knowledge from people far more experienced and smarter than me.

Background:

I have a degree in accounting from a decent university, but quickly decided accounting wasn’t for me and looked elsewhere. I found a new job working in a very niche market where my duty is to create all construction plans required to construct what we build, and also any other plans required for permitting. I got this opportunity after working a much lower end position where I showed I have motivation to learn (and I guess I learned very quickly). 

One issue though is that this business is very undeveloped and “old school” or “mom and pop”, so processes are borderline non-existent. However, my company got bought out by an investment group and is slowly “going corporate”. 

Fast forward to today my responsibilities consist of: 
1) creating our construction plans 
2) calculating profit margins for each sold job 3) giving guidance to salesman on how low of a price they can offer a customer to beat a competitor 
4) providing construction knowledge to newer salesman to ensure they sell something we can do and that makes business sense 
5) reviewing all contracts and price breakdowns to ensure salesmen didn’t miss any necessary costs 
6) creating tools in excel to help automate/improve processes [ex: inventory system, profit margin/target price calculator, and other tools that manipulate data to help understand our market/competitors and allow for good business decisions
7) assist with managing employees and help solve problems for people at all levels

*one thing I know I’m good at is communication and for some reason people just want to work with me and do things for me, but I’m not sure how that translates into long term career success.

So long story short; I take initiative, I figure things out, learn quick, and solve problems. But none of this is a specific skill. If I lost my job tomorrow what do I apply for and where? What can I even say I’m good at? This is where my stress lies. I worry that I may never be able to find a job that pays me this much (or more) because I’m inexperienced and not really sure if anything I do is valuable outside of my company.

I'm currently facing a tough situation and could really use some advice. I'm studying abroad, working towards my bachelor's degree in my final semester. Previously, I had a solid two years of experience working for a software development company. However, despite my qualifications and experience, I'm finding it incredibly challenging to secure a job in software development here in Kosovo, where I'm currently residing.  
The job search has been disheartening, to say the least. I've been receiving rejection after rejection, and it's taking a toll on both my financial situation and my morale. I've been dipping into my savings to sustain myself, but unfortunately, that well is running dry, and I'm facing the very real possibility of having to leave my apartment.  
To explore other options, I've also been applying for remote positions worldwide. However, despite my efforts, I haven't received any interviews or positive responses yet. It's particularly frustrating because, even though I've applied to jobs in Europe, as well as other countries including the US, I've had no luck so far.  
In addition to applying for positions, I've been actively networking within the industry and maintaining a strong presence on GitHub, showcasing my skills and projects. Despite being just 21 years old, I've also been diligently working on personal projects to further hone my skills and enhance my portfolio.  
I feel stuck and uncertain about what steps to take next. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice to offer, I would be immensely grateful. I'm open to any suggestions, whether it's refining my job search strategy, exploring alternative career paths, or any other insights you may have.

1c3yh3w,Feel confused and lost with work and dont go where to go,"Hey there, 

I'm 25 years old, I'm from India and I work as a Senior Automation Engineer. I've been working for 3 years now and I earn up to 8.7L Inr (10k USD if if helps) a year. 

Now there are a couple problems that Ihave. First, Despite the role saying Automation Engineer we do not work on Quality Control at all. We do not create automation for testing purposes, In reality we work more on data and do ETL (Extract, Tranform and Load) stuff. So the role which I have doesn't really match my actual work at all. Second, We don't work or use enough data tools to call ourself Data Scientists, Data Analysts or Data Engineers. I thought I will upscale myself with tools but it looks like in Data, It's never just enough. I tried applying and 7/10 times companies are asking for something which I have never worked on nor our company wants to use. I tried upgrading myself and learnt 3 new tools and even then it wasn't enough. I've applied for alot of companies and I'm yet to get a s single call. Maybe skill issue. I blame myself for that. I should have upscaled myself in 3 years instead of doing it now when I'm getting tired of my job but thanks to all of this, I remembered something. 

I remembered that, I was never really passionate about this. The only reason I took Data was because It was new for me and I thought as I'm just starting in the corporate world, I could play around but now after spending 3 years which I shouldn't have, I feel like I'm stuck. I wanna get back to Web Designing. The thing im passionate about but I'm worried how it'll affect my pay and my resume. 

Is it too late for me to get into Web Designing? Will I even get the same or more pay than what I'm getting now if I do switch? 


And if someone is skilled with Web Development, Can you guys tell me where to start? I've worked on alot of Web projects, its not like I know nothing about Web Designing. I just feel rusty and outdated so wanted to ask. 

First post, Lemme know my question is confusing or doesn't make sense.

1c3x3qv,I had to report a clients employee in my first week. Is it ok if I refuse to work with them if he is not removed from the team?,"I started with a new client this week and I was repeatedly told by everyone involved that a certain resource was volatile and everyone including his bosses have to walk on eggshells around. By the end of the week I was the blunt end of this, but I immediately recognize these actions of theirs as mentally and emotionally abusive as my background has dealt with many like it as well as just personal experience. I reported him.. the clients management went into immediate damage control apologizing for him and even put me in a position where they asked if he is someone that should be on the project (I am very low level but ultimately was supposed to be the abusers lead) so I felt very weird and didn’t feel right expressing my true opinion but also I was just still processing everything. The abuser sent a very horrible apology over teams stating “he is willing to wipe the slate clean”… as if this was a two party incident and I was also hurling insults and cusses at him and caused him to be in his position… I 1.) do not tolerate abuse like this 2.) am very troubled by the fact he had turned my first week (a high performing week as told by superiors) into a drama fest that centers me.

 My question is; is it ok for me to return on Monday and fully state that if he is to stay with the project that I will not interact with them at all? How can I navigate this without continuing of the drama he has put me in and not subject myself to his abuse?

1c3wzlp,Feeling Undermined as a junior partner,"
I am a junior partner at my investment firm – we have about 15 people on our team, and I directly manage four of them. 

Recently, one of the senior partners has been working closely with one of my employees on several strategic initiatives. Now, this wouldn’t bother me so much, but the issue is that the senior partner doesn’t really keep me in the loop on what they are working on together, and sometimes, it just shows up in an all-team meeting where my employee is presenting on a topic. Moreover, the stuff that they are working on together would actually benefit me from a knowledge-gathering perspective if I were asked to collaborate on it.

This also ends up causing me to be kept kept out of the loop when my employee is working with other people on the team, as the senior partner suggest that they reach out to my employee to collaborate on something. There have been several instances in which my capabilities, which would’ve been useful on a project, aren’t brought into a discussion and instead, my employee becomes the “point person”.

This is all led me to feel very insecure about my role, capability, and future with this team. It’s compounded by the fact that my annual review for last year was good, but not perfect, and I didn’t receive my full bonus for the year and a modest salary bump. I go to work every day worrying that it will be my last, or even worse, I will continue to be iced out of projects and undermined.

I want to raise these points with the senior partner, but I worry that I would come across as paranoid and have misread the situation - especially because the senior partner has told me often how valuable I am the team. I just wish her actions reflected that belief.

Am I reading something wrong here? And if not, what do you think is the best way to raise this with the senior partner?

1c3tcuw,In need of encouragement & advice ,"I’m almost 3 months into a new job. 

At the beginning, I was excited about this new opportunity because:
1. It was a 50% pay raise from my previous jobs, and they were paying me way above my expectations. I had finally hit 6 figures and it felt unbelievable 
2. Everyone spoke so positively about the company across the interview process.
3. I bought it because the all of them have been at the company for over 5 years, some close to 10.

However 3 months in I feel super burnt out and disillusioned. My boss constantly breathes down my neck for things that aren’t urgent. My to-do list just keeps piling up and I don’t have enough time to finish my tasks. It’s a Sunday and I have to start on my work already. My role is also quite ambiguous which adds to the stress. Worst of all I’m exposed to lots of politics that I feel are beyond my pay grade. 

Most importantly, everything just feels meaningless. I can’t be bothered with office politics and putting CxOs on a pedestal. It’s all a construct that means nothing outside. 

My colleagues take pride in working hard and long hours. I respect that but I just don’t see the point slaving away and giving up your work life balance. 

That said.. there are pros… which are the comp & benefits. And there’s a lot of “growth” here. 

Should I hold out and hope it gets easier? Or leave before my probation ends knowing that this isn’t for me. ",Proud_Ad_874,1,1.0,1,1713100579,2024-04-14 13:16:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c3tcuw/in_need_of_encouragement_advice/,4,2024

Money is tight so I would really like to make more, and with a young family it’s way too much to handle my current stressful job and be an active father.

But mentally I think maybe it’d be for the best. I have anxiety & I’m a people pleaser and therapist says have hyper responsibility lol.

1c3pq1o,"Finishing a master degree in Finance, don't know what I would like or be good at","Hi everyone ! 

I am finishing my master degree in Finance at university in Belgium. Currently in an internship in Big 4 which I absolutely hate (doing nothing in Tax) to get my last credits. A few days ago, I've been rejected from Odoo for a business analyst job after the final interview and a month procedure. I am not in a great place mentally right know, with the lack of incentive through the week (40h at desk a week to do, maybe, 2 powerpoints and one internet research on average) and lack of social interaction. I am waiting the feedback from the HR from Odoo, I don't know wether the motif was technical or more personal. The last interview was 3 hours long, I talked a lot and I need to know what went wrong if I want to improve. 

I am feeling lost and anxious. I don't know what I would be good at and feel like at don't have any hard skill at all. I was very good in uni (never failed any exam, even while running a small student company and going out 2 to 3 times a week, while the success rate was sometimes very low for a lot of them), I consider myself quite good in math and critical thinking. I am a mensan, even tho I don't go often to the meetings. I am extremelly mediocre in networking, surface social interaction. I am introverted and a lot of my closest friends told me that at first sight, they though that I despised them before knowing me a bit much, which is basically the worst trait to have while managing clients. 

I love cinema, and I could start a paid internship (900€ a month) in a studio with my degree, but this is not a stable market especially in Belgium. My qualifications could theoriticaly give me access to plenty of jobs with very good pay and perks. 

But I honestly don't know what I would like, and more importantly what I would be good at. All I know that I hate Big 4, and that I don't like tax and audit. I know that I would be a terrible in sales. But I lack a lot of confidence and perspective of what I should do with my life. I started regretting not doing something more concrete like engineer instead of receiving a shitton of management classes.

I'm an older, non-traditional student and a junior undergraduate at Rutgers Business School Newark, majoring in Supply Chain Management. Currently, my GPA is under 3.0, and I'm facing difficulties in both securing an internship and managing my classes. Honestly, I want to quit, but I only have about 9 classes left, so I might as well finish. However, I'm concerned that attending Rutgers Business School Newark instead of Rutgers Business School New Brunswick might affect my earning potential and job prospects. Specifically, I worry that I won't be able to make the same amount of money or obtain the same job opportunities, such as earning an entry-level salary of $75,000-$80,000 in a top company in supply chain management in NJ, which could lead to a salary of $100,000+ within 2-3 years. Are my concerns valid, or are they just in my own head? They say it's the same business school, but New Brunswick offers career fairs and events that Newark students can attend but there in New Brunswick not Newark. However, I have to take classes in Newark because when I applied to New Brunswick, not all of my classes or credits transferred, whereas Newark accepted everything.

1c3pkb3,Internship Advice,"I want to make this short and to the point so here it is; I  am in school in France doing my masters degree and what’s required here during a masters degree is a 6month end of studies internship. I applied to a ton of internships back in January and hit it off with one company which works in luxury. I’ve had to do about 8 rounds of interviews and about 5 case studies/personality tests. These people seem very genuine and i think it’s just their way of being sure of who they’re hiring. The guy who was setting up everything from interviews to case studies is extremely unpunctual; over the course of all these interviews he would OFTEN change the times, change the days, change it from in person to online ALWAYS AT THE LAST MINUTE. The only reason I haven’t just said they’re messing with my time is because it really honestly is an amazing opportunity. Finally, we come up to these last few weeks where the CEO of the firm asked to speak with my references because shes “had a lot of issues with Americans in the past” granted it sounds bad but she did explain what she meant and K understand the stigma around Americans in Europe much better now. 

The guy was supposed to finally give me a call to give me their decision last Wednesday, he did not call so I emailed, no response. I am worried but not at the same time because last time he did this, he called me and told me not to worry about the process and everything was fine but it’s more the lack of respect on his end for my time. 

Can someone tell me what they’d do in this situation?

AND my dream is to see my book become a movie, so now I wanna do that? AND I really wanna travel the world and have a YouTube channel as well to empower people AND I really wanna blog my experience and publish poetry AND I wanna create a business to empower women to go into financial literary and obtain freedom and give them help to learn to code for job security. 

Like how do I choose one. I can’t think straight that I get so overwhelmed and only think of my achievement in my head. It’s so sad cause I want t do all of them but because I hate my job and my life right now I wind up doing nothing. I don’t even know where to start and I had to push my degree to one semester because I fail Japanese.

I can't find anyone willing to give me a job in solar or in any job where my degree would be applicable.

1c3klxp,Agency vs. Client side. Opportunity. Torn. ,"Hey everyone,

I'm currently facing a dilemma and would love some input from the community. I currently work as a Digital Production Lead in a growing digital agency, earning $130,000AUD annually. I manage a team of developers and producers, and while I love the variety of work and being the decision-maker, there are some challenges.

On the positive side, I have the respect of my team, and the agency is growing. However, I often find myself stretched thin due to under-resourced projects, navigating team politics within the leadership, and struggling with work-life balance.

Now, I have an opportunity to move client-side. The pros include better pay, the chance to focus on a single project and excel at it, being the go-to person for all digital needs in the business, and working for someone who truly respects me. Plus, there's the perk of traveling interstate once a month. What makes this opportunity particularly enticing is that the client knows me well from my previous work at an agency I used to work at.

However, there are some concerns. The role would be fully remote, which isn't ideal for me, and I worry about potentially becoming bored with the lack of variety. Additionally, there might not be as much room for advancement.

One intriguing aspect is that in the client-side role, there's potential for me to start my own agency and come to them with a team ready to go (it’s required for the project at hand). They trust me and don’t mind the working arrangement as long as the job gets done.

Another consideration is the potential for a higher salary. I could negotiate $150,000-$160,000AUD with this move, either at the client-side role or by leveraging my value in my current position.

I'm torn between the stability and growth potential of my current role and the potential benefits of moving client-side, including the chance to start my own agency and negotiate a higher salary.

1c3kclq,How to pivot between sectors of engineering in Australia?,"Hi there,  
A while ago I posted on one of the engineering advice sub-reddits but my post got removed due to similarities with other posts, I suppose my situation is common enough to be seen as annoying for those sub-reddits. Anyway, I'll explain my situation here as best I can and hope for some advice or personal experiences related to the post title.

I graduated from electrical engineering in late 2021 and for a fairly long time was very uncertain of what I wanted to do. That, coupled with the death of my brother later that year led to me exerting little to no efforts in trying to land a job in any engineering field so I was just a bartender for basically all of 2022 and most of 2023. I even studied for post graduate medical entrance exams (the GAMSAT for those that are familiar) and sat it a few times and was made an offer to a uni that is on the opposite side of Australia before I started to realise that this desire was perhaps just made in reaction to being so uncertain about engineering and making a link to medical practice and the rather unfortunate manner in which my brother died (electrocution).

Eventually I concluded med was not for me, or at the very least I should explore engineering more completely before just throwing in the towel as I hadn't even worked in any engineering role up till that point. Unfortunately this conclusion came by mid 2023 (1.5 years after graduation) so I started to panic apply for anything related to my degree as I was worried if I waited for the 2 year mark from graduation and still had 0 experience, then applications after that point would be much much harder as hiring managers would see my resume in hospitality and just assume I had no interests or drive or whatever other negative associations would be made with a resume like that.

I was offered an internship with a private defense company that worked on manufacturing radar for early warning detection systems in use of naval warfare and that would have been right up my alley given my interests (I'll expand on this later) but I took another offer instead, again largely because I thought it was really important to get an actual job as an engineer on my resume instead of another internship (see my attached resume for my prior one). This I don't think was the best course of action for me.

The graduate engineering role I accepted is in electrical distribution design and I am finding the work to be everything I feared about becoming an engineer. There is little to no use of any of the things I learnt in my undergraduate, and anything I do that could be deemed as ""technical"" is of a civil engineering nature. I legitimately only use AutoCAD, MS Excel (all the time), and a program similar to poles and wires which just models the force magnitude and direction on pules due to overhead conductors and wind pressures.

Needless to say, this job is really not my cup of tea and I derive no satisfaction from it. I have investigated what other roles there are in the field of power engineering and most of it is not something I would enjoy

My interests lay more so in biomedical imaging and control systems. The latter especially is quite applicable to nearly all sectors but I am unsure of how to actually pivot into either of those fields by any method other than just spamming applications. I've spoken to some recruiters and they have said my qualifications are adequate and really the best thing to do would be gain relevant experience, which they have all confirmed is not being achieved in my current role.

TLDR; I made a poor decision with what engineering sector to enter and am desperately trying to move to another. I am unsure of what to do other than spamming applications and would appreciate any advice from others that have gone through a similar process in their early career.

1c3k8ni,"Job Requires Four Weeks Written Notice, What are my options?","Hi All.

About 11 months ago I signed on to work full time at my current place of work. I'm currently looking to leave as quickly as possible as the job environment is quite bad. However, I'm in a tricky spot because of my contract.

When signing on, my superior walked me through the contract, and everything at the time made sense. The only thing that was out of place, was that on paper, under termination by the employee, it said I needed to provide at least four weeks of advance written notice. While we read this, my superior explicitly stated that this was a mistake and that it should say two weeks' notice. They said that they would ""fix it"" - and I was naive and had no reason to not trust this person. However, this ""error"" was never fixed, When reviewing my contract, I signed a copy which stated that four weeks' notice was required.

Now that I'm looking to leave, I'm trying to figure out what my options are. Some things that I've read say that notice technically isn't a legal requirement but rather a courtesy. Some things that I've read say that the company could come after me and sue me for a breach of contract and for damages. I can't afford to get sued. I also don't know how I'll be able to obtain another job if I have to stay at my current place of employment for another month. I have a job interview on Monday, so I'm hoping for some insight to help me proceed.

Also, I'm in Ontario, if that's of any help.

1c3k3lp,Job-hopping while consulting & getting a degree,"Hi All,  
There are endless threads about job-hopping but I wanted to get this sub's feedback on my specific case:  
I started working in 2014 and am now on my 6th full time role. I work in tech in GTM operations. I am considering leaving my current role, however I have generally gotten feedback that I've ""built a reputation as a job-hopper"" and this worries me.  
My average tenure at a full time role comes out at 1.69 years with my longest tenure being 2 years and 5 months and my shortest being 1 year and 2 months.  
I have mixed feelings about this feedback since, on one hand it's true that I have changed jobs often, there's a lot of additional context which gets overlooked.  
Alongside working full time since 2014, in 2017 I started consulting in my free time (with written permission of any employer with which this consulting overlapped). In 2021 I began winding down my consulting as I began a part-time master's program, which I completed this year (2024), having worked full time during its duration. This comes out to 4 years and 9 months spent consulting and 2.5 years t complete my master's degree.  
Each job I have left, I have left for a different and verifiable reason, such as having a remote manager earlier in my career (when I needed in-person, same-time-zone support), to wanting to learn a specific skill which an existing role was not willing to enable me to do.  
Lastly, while my roles show a clear progression in title and responsibilities over time, I have never managed people and don't really have a desire to. I think there is a lot of growth left for me as an IC, and I'm not in a rush to be a manager.  
With all of this being said, my reasons for considering leaving my current role center around a lack of managerial support around career growth. My current manager's feelings around my career advancement can be summed up by ""that's not my problem, you need to be a self starter"" however I find this puzzling since I'm also actively discouraged from interacting with other teams (this is framed as ""taking their resources without approval""). The company for which I work is \*not\* an early stage startup.  
My understanding of the role of a ""people manager"" is to partner with them to chart career growth, but this doesn't seem to be the case in my current role. Final note that all of my performance reviews in my current role have been positive, while not exceptional. I acknowledge that I have some growing to do.  
Anyway, with all of this said, is jumping from my current role in the near term career suicide? Should I just tough it out for another 1-2 years and make the best of things? Is there a sensible way to split the difference?",from-the-cog-lab,3,1.0,1,1713065837,2024-04-14 03:37:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c3k3lp/jobhopping_while_consulting_getting_a_degree/,4,2024

Guidance with my lack of career understanding

TL;DR  currently work in retail, enjoy my job but want something more. Considered active jobs as I have fun doing them but tech/finance/business style jobs are more career driven and I want something I can set goals and strive towards. Currently no clue what career I want.  


Hello :) I’m gonna yap a little first
I turned 20 in February and currently with as a warehouse operative for marks and Spencer’s (UK Retail company).

I generally enjoy my job. Aside from the obviously less fun aspects of the job, I actually am happy enough to go to work every day and I have a good time doing what I do. 
I’ve never knew what I wanted to do in my future. The lack of understanding for me was always a huge problem. As a kid I was in and out of hospital being seriously ill, which lead me to miss out a lot on school. Despite this, I still passed all my GCSE’s. I then got my current job and have been working here since October 2022.

Ideally I would like something which I can enjoy but also earn decently. Originally I was thinking that as I have a lot of fun with active jobs like the one I have right now maybeny some type of Trade would be my best bet. Something like an electrician, plumber etc. I could go to school to learn and then job hunt. This would be something I would most likely “enjoy” doing as I’m always on my toes and generally busy.
However Ive been thinking more into it and have thought about different “career” job options such as tech, accounting/finance etc.
While I think getting bored would probably be pretty easy as most of the time you’re sat down doing general computer work, I think it would be something I would be proud to do and something I would work hard to achieve.

I do work hard. I frequently get told at my job that I’m an extremely hard worker. I handed in my notice mid 2023 as I was planning on travelling for 3 months and being busy with life things. They asked if I would consider taking that time off and then returning back to my position when I get home from holiday, which I accepted. They just filled my position for that time off and then I went back to what I’m doing now. I don’t need anything too extreme, just something to work towards and I will absolutely do everything I can to achieve that.

I guess what I’m wondering is some general advice for someone in my position where I have no true guidance on what I should do in the future. I want to start now while I’m young so I have a clear goal to work towards but right now I don’t have any idea nor do the people around me have any jobs worth striving for.
Please write below any ideas to help myself or any job career options which I could research to work towards!",BradleyStickland,1,1.0,1,1713055599,2024-04-14 00:46:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c3gz3i/advice_on_lack_of_career_guidance/,4,2024

1c3gbun,I need advice dealing with toxic job,"I need some major advice here. I am in my first post grad role working in social media with a toxic company. There is very high turnover in my department, like there is a whole new team every year. The company overworks people while underpaying them. I love my team and so when it came to learning that I'd be moving to another state, I let them know way in advance (that was a huge mistake and I know that now). Things started coming to a head when another girl on the team of three announced she would also be leaving. My manager asked me this week that if I get a job offer that I ""fight to get the start date extended"" because it will end up leaving the manager alone to do the work of three people. She went on to tell me that she feels like I've been very one sided and I only care about my job security. Despite me saying from the beginning that I don't want to leave the team unprepared and informed her I'd work ahead as much as I can. I feel for her and I do feel horrrible but at the end of the day, I gave them notice in mid February that I would be leaving and they could have had my replacement, they just don't pay enough. On top of this, they have asked that both myself and the other girl leaving get 3 months worth of work done in just 20 days. I did get a job offer and I have to start on May 1st. I immediately felt guilty about the offer and the dread of telling my manager has over powered my excitement. I now have to tell her on Monday and I hate how she guilted me during this whole ordeal.

1c3fjeo,Advice on Career Optios (Gov contractor or Gov Civ)? ,"I am lucky to work for a great company and overall great group of people. I'm an RF Design Engineer for a government contractor. 

Lately I've been reflecting on the past few years being at the company and realize there is very little opportunity for growth given the size of the site. Right now the site is undergoing a transition, mainly many are retiring and others are leaving the company for similar reasons. 

At this point I've been wondering about new opportunities. In particular I've been wondering if it's worth looking at similar government contractor roles or roles as a government civilian engineer for a military base. There are many trades between commute time, salary, and other benefits.

 I know, ultimately that I wouldn't explore this for another year due to family circumstances, but I'm interested in getting others perspectives and overall advice. 

Would you consider exploring other opportunities? Has anyone worked as a government civilian engineer for a military base? Any negatives or positives?

1c3efry,"My job, my passion, and what I studied are significantly different and Idk what my career looks like in the next 5 years. What to do? (Long post)","I (m23) live in a south asian country and I am about to graduate college in 2 months. I have done my bachelors in business administration with majors in marketing. Now, this is a really popular degree and over a thousand students are doing it from my university. You can imagine what the rough number must be like in the whole country. 

Before I talk about how my career is looking so far, I think I should just mention that I love writing and I want to become a full-time published author. I've loved poetry and fiction ever since I was a kid and it's always been a dream of mine to write my own book. I am not a native English speaker but I've mastered the language throughout the years by reading a lot of books, playing a lot of games without skipping the gameplay, listening to a lot of English music, watching movies, shows, etc. I didn't necessarily do all of it to learn the language but doing so has contributed a lot to my proficiency in English. It helps that I always took English in my school and college a bit too seriously as well (which is usually the easiest course to pass for everyone). I started writing poems when I was at school and my craft has only gotten better over the years. I know this because I've received a few academic and art awards for of my writing (poems, essays, and articles). I am not published anywhere yet, despite trying. 

I started freelancing as a content writer in 2017 and I have built up a really good career in content writing. Last year, someone recommended me for a job at an SEO agency as a web content writer and I took it because it paid significantly better than what I was making as a freelancer. I am not leaving this job anytime soon but I now see other job ads that pay even better, so I know there's chances of financial growth in content writing as a career. However, I didn't know that I'd be making a good money in writing so I also wanted to pursue a degree in case things don't go well with writing. I also think that having a degree benefits you a lot in terms of how you control yourself in a professional setting and if you're ever trying to apply for jobs out of your country. So, I pursued business administration and I knew in my second year that I wanted to major in marketing because it interested me the most. I won every major marketing competition in my university and have also had extremely good GPA throughout the years.

Now, my dilemma started when I was applying for internships in the third year and didn't get any good ones at big companies. There's a lot of factors that play here, including if you have any past internship experience, your references, etc. And I only had a freelance writing experience at that time and didn't want to use any references. I was sure that given my academic achievements, I'd easily get a good internship anywhere. Clealry, I was wrong and got a reality check that it doesn't matter how big of an academic achiever you are, you must know at least a few people at big companies if you really want to end up there. And I've seen far too many examples like that. Anyways, I was disappointed but got an internship at a decent company and moved on pretty quickly. Right after the internship I got the job as a web content writer at a US-based SEO agency. I have a reasonable amount of flexibility over the work hours, I work fully remotely, and there are good benefits as well, including travel, PTOs, etc. So I am financially happy with my job, despite dealing with a lot of repetitive tasks and getting no credit for my writing (I'm a ghostwriter for commercial websites). 

Now that I'm graduating, I am confused if I should continue with my freelance content writing career or should I be really focusing on starting my career as a marketer. I really like advertising and brand management as fields but it means I'll have to start off from scratch and work hard for a lot of years before I am able to make good money, which I am already making now as a content writer. My friend told me that I am earning real good right now but if I don't switch now then it would be too late, and if I want to get work in the field that I studied for 4 years, it's the time to start getting experience in that field so I can good money when I'm in my thirties and have more responsibilities. 

But I am also constantly worried about my dream of becoming a writer. I find no time to work on my novel that I started last year and it has only been written a few pages. Even if I have a manuscript ready, literally no one reads here and I can count the publishing houses on my fingertips because the reading scene is so bad. I also don't want to self-publish because I think there's a credibility attached to a novel if it's published by a company and not by the author themselves. Judging by the amount and quality of books self-published in the past few years, I'd say I am one of the people that are automatically turned off from the book if it's self-published, so I don't want to self publish. 


I am super confused about what should I do. I feel like I'd be missing out on 

on what I know and what I've told y'all above. I have two options:

1. Continue with my career as a content writer, make money and work on my novel. Find a way to get it published when it's done.

2. Leave content writing job and start a marketing/branding/advertising job from scratch and excel in it. Make way less money in the start and then work my way up. This would leave me no time to work on my novel since I wouldn't have the same amount of flexibility. 

For those of you who have been kind enough to read till here, what should I do? I know the first one seems like an obvious choice to make but a lot of people say that working in the same environment for too long can eventually take a toll on you and you'd want to work somewhere that's more dynamic than just writing on a laptop. Also, some people say that writing is my dream and this is literally what I'm doing right now but of course it's not the same because I'm not writing for myself, I'm writing for other people about things that don't even interest me. So, what do I know. Can anyone please help me put things into perspective. 

PS: Sorry for the long ass post. I might have ranted a bit too much. 

TLDR: I want to become a published fiction writer. I work as a ghostwriter for an SEO agency and make good money. I studied marketing for 4 years and really like it too but have no real experience in it and won't be making as much money in the start even if I do dive into it. I am graduating in 2 months. How should I plan my next five years?",bettercallsaud,1,1.0,1,1713048429,2024-04-13 22:47:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c3efry/my_job_my_passion_and_what_i_studied_are/,4,2024
1c3ef6k,I have a job opportunity that’s so good that I can’t sleep,"Hi all,

I live in South Africa and work for an EU-based customer support company. I earn about $1000 a month working here, which is pretty decent for where I live. 

My job is being made redundant on the 30th of April, and naturally I’ve been on the job hunt. 

I sent over 150 applications, and got about 4 “yes” answers to move onto the next stage. 

Thing is, one of the yes answers I got is for an insane opportunity, I don’t use the word lightly. They emailed saying they’ve received a ton of applications, but mine is one that stood out and they have some follow up questions for me. 

The job spec is about 90% aligned with my skillset and CV, and pays $4500 pm. This is literally a life changing salary for me. I know I’ll look back on this opportunity as a defining moment in my life, because it’s highly, highly unlikely I’ll find another job that pays that kind of salary.

I can’t sleep and all I’m thinking about is how to approach the next stages of the application. Does anyone have advice for me, or just words of encouragement?

1c3dgy6,Jobs for Introverts that Pay? ,"I used to work in a kitchen. I loved it. Loved the banter. Loved the heat. It was good for my health. It was good for my mental health. Loved the fact that I could listen to music. But I couldn’t pay my bills, and that financial pressure was killing me. 

I have hopped three jobs since then. CSR, Maid, CSR. Both CSR jobs were in veterinary medicine.

I hate it. I hate sitting all day and answering phones and pretending to be peachy and the weird, rigid friendships that come with that space instead of the slap-happy dorkery that is in a kitchen. I hate the emotional toll it takes on me. 

But, kitchens have serious downsides too. Not just pay. There’s more workplace S/A than most other jobs. It’s somewhat hazardous (being surrounded by fryers and ovens and wet floors and grease. You’re standing in a fire hazard while holding knives or blowtorches or red hot pans. And you’re the one responsible for not setting anything on fire or cutting off a digit .) the anxiety can be hard to cope with. 

Does anyone have jobs that sound like a happy medium? I cants stay in CSR. I feel this pressure not to go back to kitchens, cause it’s not a “good career,” and they pay so terribly. But CSR has sent me into a deep depression every time I work it. I want to be around good people, doing something with my body that is fast and feels good where I don’t have to wear the *peachy sweet* mask all day every day. But I have to pay my bills and retire.

1c3bah8,Is involving HR job-suicide?,"Hi, 

I'm a female who has been working in IT for 23 years. I've been with my current company for 3.5 years. I'm currently a systems administrator.  We are a small company and the general attitude is that everyone at all levels of employment are treated equally and with respect. The executive team is and has always been very approachable. 

About 2 months ago our company hired a new VP of IT. I've caught him in a couple of blatant lies where denies having said something that he said... via email or teams, in writing.  At the beginning I chalked it up to him being nervous or something. 

However, he now seems to be targeting me and I'm not sure if his behaviour is gaslighting, manipulative, or outright toxic.  In Quebec, where I'm located, I believe it does fall under workplace harassment but I'm not quite sure. 

Generally, he completely ignores me. He ignores emails, teams messages, and even ignores in person. I'm talking blatantly ignoring me when I stand in front him waving and saying hello. Others have witnessed it. 

He speaks in obscure acronyms that I'm quite sure he makes up. An example was that he used the acronym GF saying that a cause of a particular problem was with the GF. I was confused because most people interpret GF as ""girlfriend"". I privately messaged him explaining that I find it difficult to understand his acronyms as they are obscure and seemingly made up. I told him that it makes me feel stupid that I have to keep asking him to clarify his acronyms and intitialisms, and it makes me feel like there's some kind of secret language I don't know. I asked if he could use those less in his communications with me. His response: ""I don't have time to spell everything out for you like that"".

He sent out an email telling us we had to provide him with personal contact information including personal cell numbers and email addresses that he will store on a network drive to be used in emergencies.  He indicated that we must monitor these alternative contact points. We all have work provided cell phones and we have no requirements to be on call or available 24/7. I asked for clarification regarding the expectations, are we meant to be reachable 24/7 and what events would be considered emergencies. His entire reply was ""Nevermind"". 

I then sent him a message asking if he'd have time to meet because I feel we have a communication issue and I'd love the opportunity to work through that and get some feedback on anything I can do to improve the situation. He did not reply. I sent the same request three times over three weeks and on the third time added that this was my third request, could get please reply. His reply: ""I am too busy, talk to your manager"". 

I have brought the issue up with my manager already but he has not taken action, and he is out of the office on vacation at the time of my second and third requests. 

I forwarded his answer about being too busy to HR, along with the e-mail and then informed him ""since my manager is out of the office, I have raised the issue with HR"". Well, that got his attention and his reply to that was: ""I don't understand, if this is an HR matter you need to inform me first. All I see is that you want to chat about tickets"". 

Nowhere in any of my communications with him, which are all via Teams or email mention anything about tickets. I can't tell if he's got some pathological issue that prevents him from understanding my communication or if he's trying to gaslight me by making it seem like I'm saying something I'm not. 

There are a couple other examples that are exactly the same, but this last one I finally went to HR. 

Is this an example of gaslighting?  Would his behaviour fall under creating a toxic work environment?  

Any and all thoughts are welcome, thank you for your time in reading this.

1c39u13,Navigating Corporate Politics With Weird Boss (2 Part),"Part 1)
I’m struggling with one of my bosses at work who is on the older side and doesn’t treat me with the same level of respect as he does others. He’s extremely rude and seems like he takes random jabs at me for no reason. I perform well, I’ve gotten promoted (not through him - he’s new and got grandfathered in [haha] to being my boss). I don’t kiss his ass and I honestly don’t think he adds much value to the company (outside of having experience in the business but all he really adds are trivial suggestions). I usually judge the value of someone’s experience based on the problems they point out and the solutions they propose but he does not of that. Maybe he knows that I know he’s full of it but hey I’m at my wits end trying to understand him. He’s in his 60s, I’m in my 20s but the maturity levels are reversed. He acts like a child and it sucks because I feel like I have a target on my back even though I’m doing good work and am working my butt off. 

Part 2)
To add more color: in my mind there are two types of ~older engineers: those who continue to learn and those who want to maintain and coast. As a younger engineer, I’ve come across both but have found it difficult to navigate the latter. I’m excited to learn and be on the cutting edge with new open source projects but do understand the value in reusability and not reinventing the wheel. At a certain point, I don’t know how to argue with those who don’t want to reason objectively with what make sense for the company in the long term. It seems like it’s an ego thing but, for example, why should we continue using a homegrown job scheduler written in the nearly unmaintained framework by developers who are no longer on staff? We could be using a great open source tool. Don’t get me wrong, I get the argument of cost - “we already have this and it works.” But other than the obvious argument of general tribal-knowledge risk, I can’t find a compelling way to argue that we should continue to grow and improve our software - that’s how it works and it’s better to upgrade and improve overtime instead of all at once when it’s already too late. Maybe I just want to work on the cutting edge, but if the core components are antiquated, it’s hard to do that with anything else. I know my commentary is somewhat high level but seeking advice on strategy here. Open source is a beautiful thing and I feel so deprived.

Don't get me wrong its a safe, nice area but I'm younger and I don't like the weather here, I don't like the lack of things to do, I don't like the price of apartments and I really don't like the price of housing, I don't like the fact that the job I have is one of the ONLY GOOD jobs in town either. I don't like being stuck at my mothers anymore too, where I have been this entire 3 years...this isn't my home state and so basically the only thing my experience here has going for it is my really high paying and awesome job!

Though to tbh, I'm not super close with my coworkers and I can take or leave how hot and cold they are sometimes too.

I'm realistically looking at losing about 30% of my salary --- maybe have to work a bit more too. But where I'm going the cost of living is actually 20 to 30% less. Anyways, my reluctance to move and accept responsibility for bills again and taking the easy street here with my gravy easy job saving up...for...crickets. My girlfriend left me and moved back to a place we both would have rather been. 

I'm heavily on the side of following her. Will I regret this? Any similar experiences? I know they say not to move for love but ...it's more than that with my situation. We needed to move for me and my mental health too...she's kinda just given me that PUSH because I honestly would have just kept making excuses so I could keep ""saving"" and being selfish.

1c38ukt,Please help guide me,"Grad School in Late 30s

Hello, I need some advice. A bit over 10 years ago I graduated with a BS in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation with a 3.0 GPA (I started off really strong, but I ended up dealing with depression and a traumatic event in the end of it). I always wanted to go to graduate school, but someone close convinced me not to since I struggled at the end of my undergrad. I decided to pursue wildlife rehabilitation instead, so I went back to school to become a registered veterinary technician (with significantly better grades). I ended up staying in veterinary technology, but mainly working with cats and dogs. I really want to go back to grad school for biology/ecology. It’s what I really want to do and looking back I am not happy that I strayed so far from my original goal. I have questions:

1) How do I get back into the wildlife biology research field?

2) Are there job opportunities if I do go to grad school? Am I too old that I am competing against bight young minds fresh from undergrad?

3) Do I need to quit my full time job and start from the bottom with internships/seasonal positions?

4) Can I keep my full time job and add more classes related to the field, such as GIS certificate?

5) Is graduate school even feasible? I have a 1 year old. Maybe wait until she is a few years older?

6) Do I even have a chance of getting into grad school after being out of the field for so long?

1c37dx0,Resiging with sick time:,"I've been dedicated to a role that's seen me through my college journey, but as I step into a new chapter with a summer internship, it's time to bid farewell to my current position. While it's been a reliable source of support, the dynamics of the workplace have become increasingly challenging.  
The nature of our production work, coupled with a rigid pay structure and limited avenues for advancement, has made it clear that my professional growth is stunted here. Attempts to seek clarity on my role and advocate for fair compensation were met with adversity and even retribution in the form of reduced hours and benefits. Despite consistently positive performance evaluations, the toxic environment persisted.  
In light of these circumstances, I've made the decision to resign in two weeks. However, I'm mindful of the value of the hours and benefits I've accrued, particularly given recent changes to my working conditions. I believe it's only fair that these be reflected in my final paycheck.  
Navigating this situation can be daunting, especially given the reluctance of management to address compensation matters openly. Yet, I refuse to be deterred. I'm prepared to assert my rights and ensure that I receive what I'm rightfully owed.   
Living in Oregon, I understand there may be specific regulations governing such matters, and I'm committed to familiarizing myself with them to safeguard my interests.

I hope you don't mind my specific requirements, but I'm really in need of some guidance. I'm a woman in my mid-20s, and I must mention that I'm shy and introverted, which makes me hesitant about roles requiring extensive interaction with others. Additionally, I don't have a degree, which further limits my options. Despite these challenges, I'm determined to find a career that fits my needs.

I have limited professional experience, mainly working for Uber for the past 3 years. While I considered becoming a medical assistant, I found that it doesn't offer the salary I'm seeking - in fact, it's possible I'd either make the same amount of money I am making now or even less.

I'm aiming for a salary of at least over $20 an hour or $40,000 annually to cover the ever-rising costs of bills and rent, plus inflation. I'm open to positions where promotions and advancement can lead to higher salaries over time.

Job security is crucial for me. I've seen people struggle to find jobs after investing in education, and I want to ensure that any training I undertake guarantees job placement. If anyone knows of schools or job training programs that offer guaranteed placement after completion, I'd love to hear about them.

Ideally, I'm looking for a career that doesn't require extensive schooling or education, preferably less than 2 years if possible. Online options would be even better.

If anyone has suggestions or insights into careers that fit these criteria, especially ones with good job security and growth potential, I would greatly appreciate it. Personal experiences or success stories would be incredibly helpful.

Then,I went to YouTube for some research and most of the videos saying ""Why you shouldn't take architecture"" and etc which made me doubt my choice.

I was also very interested in learning architecture in Japan specifically because I don't want to waste my 5 years of learning Japanese in school. However, some people kept saying I'm wrong and I should take architecture in a country that is good in architecture eventhough Japan was number 5 based on my research.

1c321sd,Need some perspective,"Tl;dr at bottom.

I was unemployed at 32 and decided to go back to school to learn a skill I could take with me anywhere (welding and fabrication) I did this through a govt program so it didn’t cost me anything. I’m 33 now and in my final week of classes before graduating. 

I am debt free and am a fairly decent welder and have been asked to apply to a few welding jobs (24-28$/hr to start for entry level) I dont need a huge salary and dont expect one off the bat, it needs to be earned with experience. 

The thing is, while in school, I applied for a govt work placement and actually got it (it’s like a lottery system) I have been working for the feds at the DND in a position that is still hands on work, but no welding is involved. It is a graphics print shop and military event set up (air shows, recruitment etc) 

It pays $20 an hour while I’m a part timer in school but will jump to 60-66k/yr (not finalized yet) once I’m done my PT contract and they bridge me into a 6 month contract. After the 6 month contract I would be “indeterminate” and would earn roughly 77k in year 1 and 85k in year 2. 

The thing is it’s a completely new skillset I’m learning with very little crossover to the welding I was doing. While the pay is good and the benefits are great, I just do the work, I don’t really care for it but I don’t dislike it either. It is also going to lock me into living in this city, which Ive lived in for the last 14 years.

My girlfriend has her own home here and business, and she is pushing this job over choosing any welding job because the pay, benefits, and job security are important to her and our future. She wants me to move in with her, but her place doesn’t have a garage or anywhere I could at least practice welding as a hobby after school is done. 

Essentially I would be deserting welding. The DND job has a lot of air travel during the summer, which I’m not at all keen on. I’d like to be in my own bed every night instead of some hotel.

I also have severe ADHD, and despite being medicated for it, I’m worried about the responsibilities and time management skills required for this job because I’m not great with administrative tasks like booking my flights, keeping track of my expenses and receipts etc.

I feel like the DND isn’t a bad choice, and there is a fabrication aspect to the job but it’s a minor part of the role. But for some reason it just doesn’t feel like I’m on my path. It feels like I’m abandoning my goal of becoming a welder for the safe option of working for the govt.

At the same time, I have no experience in an actual welding shop. So I’m not entirely sure what it would be like. 

I’m torn. Am I romanticizing about welding? Would I be throwing away a good govt job opportunity by holding the line and staying on the welding path? I know it’s an impossible question to answer.

Tl;dr 33 year old who spent the last year in welding school offered decent govt job unrelated to welding but with good pay/benefits. GF wants me to take govt job for future stability but a large part of me wants to see what I can make of my life as a welder. 

Any perspective would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

Does anyone have any career advice or suggestions on career paths that they have undergone with a similar situation as myself?

1c30izk,"Supervisor didn’t respond to my email, now I’m in hot water","I can’t really think of a catchy title for this post, but here goes:

I’m a lower man on the totem pole at my office. There’s one guy below me. My responsibilities include ensuring our equipment runs properly when we need it in the field. We had a very specialized piece of equipment fail (that I was never trained to use, or maintain), and I was told to troubleshoot it, and fix it. No big deal. I ended up having a meeting with the manufactures technical department, and we were able to isolate the issue to one connection point between the primary unit, and the cord that connects it to its computer. After our phone call, the technician sent me an email summarizing our findings, and saying that they believed we needed to send all their equipment back for service, and specifically requested the unit, and cord for inspection. They sent me a form to complete, and put billing information on, and then I could send it back to them. I relay this information to one of my higher ups, who we will call Tony, who is one of two people in our office that actually has training to use this device. He said to move forward on repairs. 

I filled out the form, though couldn’t put down billing information as I couldn’t cover the expenses on my card. I also had a complete inventory of all the items I was returning to the company for repairs. I emailed Tony all correspondence with the service department (including where they asked for the parts specifically and said: “look it over, and see everything I’m doing looks correct, and if you can add billing information as I couldn’t cover the costs. Once that is done I can print off the service form and ship the unit today.” 

No response. That email was also sent the friday before I went on a week long vacation. I informed the guy below me, who helps me out and said “Tony hasn’t responded to my email yet, but is probably busy. If he gets back to me while I’m gone, I’ll send you the forms, and please ship off the items.”

I had a nice vacation.

I returned the next Monday, and I saw the unit hadn’t been shipped off. I later received a call from Tony, who was working remotely asking what its status was. I told him he never double checked my forms or gave me any way to bill it. He told me we had a company account, and everything else, including our return by date, looked good. 

I emailed the form to the company, and was told we had no account, and they sent me, a mere peasant, a company credit application form. Now this is going way over my head, so I call Tony’s boss, and explain the situation. I email him all my correspondence showing costs of repairs, and what will be serviced. He says he’ll handle it. Two days later, I get a call from one of our directors saying billing has been set up, and I’m good to send the equipment. 

Fast forward a week and a half, Tony returned to the office and I get a slap on the wrist for delaying sending the gear and then leaving it for when I got back from vacation. He admitted fault for not responding to my email, but I was more at fault for not mailing it when I said I would, even though I asked for him to check my work to ensure I wasn’t doing anything unnecessary or incorrect. The meeting was concluded with the threat of if I needed micromanaging, I’d be micromanaged.

Fast forward to yesterday, I missed multiple calls from one of our regional managers, and a coworker asking where the heck one of the items I shipped off was. Mind you, that exact part was requested in the emails, in the repair authorization form that I had sent to Tony, and his boss, and I told him it was shipped off. Late last night I received a text from Tony asking for all receipts I had for the item. 

I’m already not pleased with Tony, but now feel there’s going to be more fallout for this item being missing when someone needed it (even though it was possibly faulty, and needed the manufacturer to look at it). I’m already going to have printed emails and call logs if this regional manager is upset the gear was gone when he needed it (of which I was never notified, as I am the gear guy, and we haven’t passed the return by date that Tony and I agreed to). Should I preemptively notify HR of me possibly getting reprimanded for doing my job correctly and being delayed due to Tony not responding to my email, or do I just wait and see if I get called to his office Monday?",ThrowRA36281947,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1713010409,2024-04-13 12:13:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c30izk/supervisor_didnt_respond_to_my_email_now_im_in/,4,2024
1c309nn,What is the best career to pursue as a UK student going into university?,"  
Fairly simple, I'm sitting my a levels now and have received nearly all of my offers, 3 in physics and astrophysics, 1 in aerospace engineering. I am also waiting to hear back from a Nuclear Engineering apprenticeship and UCL Astrophysics. Astrophysics has been my passion for years, but after speaking to industry experts, I'm not sure it fits my criteria. I have various different things I want to pursue in life, including politics, personal fitness, but a key one is the money to provide comfort for my family.  
Which of these fields, with them all being up and coming, looks the most promising money wise, and more importantly job wise as despite some jobs paying well, it is a bumpy road to begin.  
Any and all advice is appreciated.

1c2yd3u,I just want to be paid the same as everyone else. How do I make that happen?,"I started my job about a year ago. A few moths after I started, I discovered (mostly by accident) that everyone else on my team in my office was hired on for $5k more than me, even the person who was hired just 4 months prior to me. 

I brought this up with my team lead when I found out and the only answer that I got was that my salary “reflected the current market rate.” I’m not mad at them, they were just telling me what they had been told from higher up, and given the company culture, I am 100% sure that their hands were tied. 

I should also point out that my salary is (some would say laughably) low, and $5k would not be an insignificant boost. 

Fast forward to now, and I exceeded last quarter’s goal by a lot, and was the top performer on the team for the quarter. Would it be unreasonable to ask for my salary to be bumped up to match the rest of the team’s? What would be the best way to do that?

I should mention that the team lead from earlier in the story has left the company, but we’re currently being managed by the next person up the chain until they can fill the position. I’m on good terms with and not intimidated by this person, although talking compensation does feel awkward.

I've moved into another state after being redundant and I'm having trouble finding work. 

I've applied for many jobs but havn't heard anything. Being employed for 13 years now waking up doing nothing is mentally draining.

Was seriously thinking about starting a cleaning business, I genuinely enjoy cleaning and i'm a guy if that matters and it's something I reckon i'll enjoy doing as a job. 

I'd want to clean everything, houses, apartments, offices.

I have a large van with storage compartments inside it's big enough for cleaning equipment. 

Maybe I can take photos of my van with cleaning supplies and use that to advertise online my business, put business cards in mail boxes around my area.

1c2w9uh,Yransitioning to Cybersecurity,"Hello guys!  
  
I may need some career advice here.  
  
I'm currently a Senior QA Automation Engineer (5 years of experience) and I would like to pivot to Cybersecurity.  
  
You may think ""Why not go into development?"", well, the truth is, I find it boring.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I like programming, but I don't like ONLY programming. Apart from that, developing such corporate projects is not that appealing to me.  
  
I dread every time I have to review algorithms, system designs, data structures, grind leetcode for technical interviews, and so on. (Although I would say I'm doing decent on that front, I hate it)  
  
What I found that aligned with my interests from what I have researched is Cloud Security, Security Engineer, or Red Team Operator roles. (If you think I may be better for other roles based on my knowledge and experience, just let me know the name, and I'll look into it)  
  
My current skills are as follows: I know Python, JS, some basic c/c++, postman, jenkins, sql, html/css. I'm familiar with hardware, windows/linux, back-end development for some personal projects using django, Azure, docker. (Not gonna list all of them because they're not all helpful to my transition)  
  
I have the CCNA but I took it when I was 15 (my teacher was a trainer) and I'm no longer that updated with it since I didn't quite need it in my current job. I'm currently doing the ""Security Engineer"" path from tryhackme and I completed the ""Introduction to Cyber Security"" and ""Pre Security"" courses (which I pretty much covered easily since I'm already familiar with some terminologies)  
  
Made some keylogger, reverse shell and currently working on some malware development as a personal project.  
  
My Questions:  
1. How needed are certs? From what I've gathered Sec+, Net+ (or CCNA), A+ are a good start. Can you get your foot in the door by having the knowledge of said certs?  
  
I love learning on my own, that's not a problem, but I was thinking if it's more ""Do you know how to do x, y, and z?"" as opposed to having a cert just for the sake of it.   
  
From the technical interviews that I've been in, experience triumphs over all, having certs is good for beginning if you don't have any experience but that's all.   
  
With that being said, it's still worth asking since I don't have any certs security-related.  
  
2. Based on your experience, can you recommend some other roles that may be a better fit for me? (I researched some of them on the internet like SOC, GRC, red/blue/purple/, malware analysis, etc. but more often than not, reading a post on google is nothing but a ""TOP 10 HIGHLY PAID HACKER JOBS 6 FIGURES"" post)  
  
My Action Plan:

* Finish the Security Engineer path from tryhackme and do CTFs (as well as on hackthebox)
* Follow this [cybersecurity roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security) and check what gaps I have in my knowledge 
* Focus on the getting the CCNA (I no longer have the digital access since it was some high-school provided account of some sort, but I do have the physical certification, yet I'm still thinking to do it again as a refresher wouldn't hurt)
* Go for SC-900, SC-200, SC-400, AZ-500. (I have AZ-900)
* Make some personal projects
* Try and look for a Cloud Engineer/Administrator role in the meantime. From there I can move in time with learning and experience to a Cloud Security Role.   

Any thoughts or suggestions are more than welcome. Most likely, there are a lot of things that I'm missing from the picture. Sorry in advance for any grammar errors, English is not my main language.  
  
If this post doesn't belong here, let me know so I can remove it.

1c2w2qr,"Should I leave from medium size company with more ""benefits"" to a larger one without?","This has been tough one for me for almost a week. I work as a project/product manager in a medium size company and for two years have been in charge of development of a system for government. This means, the budget and the deadlines are quite flexible. My team consists of only five people and my boss is CEO himself, which leads to informal type of communication occasionally. 

I have received an offer from large company they provide clients from several countries with systems for mining, oil&gas and so on, so the budgets, the revenue and the responsibilities are much larger. They want me to be a lead project manager for inner projects with some duties of scrum master for other teams and offer +30% to my current salary, they also provide yearly bonuses based on the performance and there are non in my company.

I do struggle to decide if I should give it a try.
On my current place I have been close to C-level and was invited to informal meetings with them. 
I perform well on my position and the pay rises were good for the last two years if compared to other people in the company, but I do understand, that this is also the result of good performance on the company's strategic product. On another projects and products I wouldn't be paid the same. 
I get really accustomed to what I do and the atmosphere is great. But still I feel like I want to learn more, I want to earn more. Considering the size and the revenue of the company it might be hard to earn much, but being close to CEO provides some bonuses like bigger fund for courses or easily (in comparison with other's) salary increase.

New company is way more bigger and the projects will be much more complex, I wonder if I'm qualified enough to maintain good performance. I also a bit worried about the fact that they want my skills and they had difficulties in proposing a position since it's hard for them to decide what role I'm more suitable for. I will also lose the privilege of being close to CEOs and any promotion must be justified by me and my boss. 

I would be glad to hear any advice on this! ",ouverr,3,0.7099999785423279,7,1712992463,2024-04-13 07:14:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2w2qr/should_i_leave_from_medium_size_company_with_more/,4,2024
1c2v717,Signed a contract for promotion but haven't been entered into HR’s system or received the new pay rate.,"I work in a public organization and I got a promotion 9 months ago and signed a contract for the position, however even though I have been working in the new position, I still am not receiving the agreed upon pay rate and am still listed in the organization’s internal system as my former position.   
  
When I ask my boss about it, they have been giving excuses that HR is having some sort of legal stuff that they are trying to figure out before they fully process everything. Given that this has been going on for the past seven months, I have begun to suspect that HR is unaware of the situation and didn’t send the documents to HR.  
  
My boss recently posted that they are hiring for my position and wants me to apply for the position that I am now working in and when I asked if HR would put my start date as the date that I originally signed the contract, they said that they would not.  
  
I’m very upset and confused at what I should do at this point. I honestly don’t care that much that I haven’t been getting paid the agreed upon rate but what really concerns me is when I apply for other jobs and they do an employment verification check, it won’t list that I have been working in this position for as long as I have.   
  
I have lots of proof that I have been working in this position through emails with my signature in the title as well as an email announcing to everyone in the department that I am the new person in this position. What I don’t have though is the contract that I signed. I’m intending on leaving to go work somewhere else soon and having my current job on my resume would be hugely helpful. I just really don’t know what I should do at this point and I would really appreciate any advice that I can get.

I'm a junior in college. My major is computer engineering, but I'm strongly considering having a major in electrical engineering with a minor in computer engineering instead (because there seem to be a lot of advantages to electrical in the market and learning wise as well). I also had an internship last summer (it was mostly mobile app development and backend mobile app development). I am also currently in the FSAE club at my university, working on the VCU.

It seems to be too late to get an internship for this summer (I went to Job fairs and applied to all those companies). So right now I'm trying to look for work in the field of software design, but I'm not sure how to best go about doing that. I also really to get a full-time job source of income for over the summer.

My advisor recommended I take an ECE4000s level class that's heavily research involved over the summer, but the highest level class I've taken is like ECE2000s. I couldn't even understand the description of what this class is about.. RF circuit design and ADs something or other.

All in all, I feel completely clueless about where to even start with my situation here, with the indecisiveness about work, the class, and even my major as a whole. 

Any and all advice would be most appreciated. I can put in a good effort as long as I know what I'm going for.

i love working with people with disabilities, particularly younger. i love to help people. i love to support others through some of their worst days. i bring a calming sense to every room i walk into. i am passionate about mental health, and giving everyone the resources and support they need to reach their full potential.

earlier this week, i had an interview for a group home with 3 young adults who have autism. i was offered the position on the spot. within this position, i would have the opportunity to transition into being a special education teacher through the same company at their school. it's not a public school. it's for kids with autism who are very low on the spectrum. if i wanted to stay in education, this would be the perfect route for me to go. the company would pay for my licensure, pay for any extra training i'd need, and i'd be able to work while doing so.

on the other hand, i job-shadowed a 911 dispatcher the other day and i absolutely loved it. i loved the atmosphere, line of work, people, location, all of it. there's more money in this job. i talked with the person who would hire me, and she encouraged me to apply so i can start working with them. they loved me. it was beyond interesting and i sincerely loved every moment of it. 

now... i'm so stuck in the middle between these two opportunities. if i go the dispatching route, i don't think i'd ever go back to education. if i go the education route, dispatching could still be there if it didn't work out teaching.

1c2ter5,Role Elimination….,"I need some advice on how to handle the situation I’m in. For context, this is my first “big girl” job out of college. 

I was told today by my supervisor that the organization is restructuring and my role is going to be eliminated. The team would consist of three roles: HR manager, payroll, and recruiter. I am currently the HR assistant and have been actively involved in the recruitment process along with onboarding and other administrative work. I was told that I wouldn’t be considered for the recruitment role bc I’m essentially not a strong candidate for this role. As much as I appreciate the honesty. I think that it was unfair to state that when I’ve recruited for almost every single open role in the organization besides a couple since I started working there almost a year ago. I’ve also been doing a two person job for the last few months. I’m not saying that I’m perfect at my job, but I always try to give 100%. 

I’ve struggled with my boss micromanaging me ever since I started working there. My boss used to call or stop by my desk multiple times a day, but once they were in the talks or what I assume was the talks about restructuring they stopped checking up constantly. In the beginning I thought my boss was just checking in and making sure my transition to the organization was going well. However, over time I started to lose most of my confidence and ability to do my job. I was constantly stress, anxious and kept thinking I was going to get fired for every little mistake. I’m digressing though…the issue is that I’m not getting fired or laid off. I was given the option to interview for a different role in the organization or essentially resign. I’m not guaranteed a new role, so it feels almost as if my hands are tied. There’s only two options, I interview for a completely different role and hope the team is interested or resign from my current position. 

Maybe is this my sign from the universe to get out while I can. I’m struggling with the thought of starting over especially in this job market. Is it right for them to eliminate my position but not even lay me off or fire me. What they’re doing is limiting their liability by making me choose to resign on my own or interview for a different role in the company that I have no interest in. I’m not even sure what advice I’m asking for right now. I’m still trying to process what happened today. But any advice on how I should move forward would be greatly appreciated and any general career advice. 

Thank you in advance!",Nanabearr_,0,0.5,4,1712982491,2024-04-13 04:28:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2ter5/role_elimination/,4,2024
1c2t9ln,Should I go to HR or is this normal?,"Back in Nov I started a new position at my current company, I QUICKLY found out this was not the job for me.  I understand this is fully one sided, but I'll give all the details I can. I also only work from one one day a week, other wise I am onsite just about every day.

Backstory:  I was software tester, my friend saw there was an opening in configuration Management, said I'd be a great fit due to everything I test and I know how to manage documents. So I talked to the hiring supervisor and she told me I'd be great because I can test their programs for them, learn how they do builds and be a ""Build Manager"" in the group. I asked what a typical day looked like she said I'd be in the labs and following scripts, reporting bugs, ect. So it seemed like the same thing I was doing, but instead of hourly I would be salary and get more money as well as advance my career.

I would like to preference where I work hourly and salary are VASTLY different, I didn't realize how different until I started this change of a job. 

Upon starting the position, I was told they already had a build manager for  the past 2 years, I was told  I'd be running meetings, making meetings, taking meeting notes for the manager when she had meetings, as well as write up procedures  for us to follow because we had no training or anything to really follow when completing tasks. They didn't have an on boarding until after I arrived. so I have to write my ""How to's"" As I learn the position.

I know and fully admit I was being a jerk at times because I was grumpy and held in my disappointment with the position. She did have to talk to to me and tell me that I need to change my attitude. I said fair, I'll change how I'm responding and not be so negative because I know it's not helping. And I explained that I didn't know this job had so many meetings, and didn't know I'd be writing up the how to's in a position I barely knew. and I expected the position to be what was described to me. She said ""This is an adult job now, I'm sorry you have to work."" That took me back and I was like... Ok. I changed, helped more people in the group, helped out some coworkers that started a month before me figure out some issues with their linux code in order to process a task. I was happy to help, and I was completing my tasks.

We have Jira, we track EVERY Task in Jira. I put everything I work on in Jira. on 02/03 she sent me a 5 paragraph email and said I have to start sending her daily updates about my success among other tasks that I had no control over.  I have been completing more tasks than a few of the others that started before me (Sometimes i make mistakes but I'm learning). I've been super busy with work and forgot a few times to send her a daily email. 

She emailed me that I had forgotten and to send her  a daily email. I sent her my updates then added some questions.

I have completed ""xyz"" and have CCed you on my completed tasks. I had some trouble with xxx but finished it on time and was able to learn how to do xxx. Can I ask when the daily e-mails will be completed or if they will lessen? Can I know why I'm doing the daily e-mails? If it is to see roadblocks they've lessened over the last few weeks because I've learned a lot and have been completing tasks that I've added to my Jira (Link jira). Are there others in the group sending daily tasks as well? Maybe we can get a consensus of where a majority or roadblocks on and work on a procedure to fix the issues. I am more than willing to comply and send you a daily e-mail, but between task e-mails, putting all my work on jira, and the general e-mail traffic, I got bogged down with work and sometimes forget to send an email.  If this is required, is there a way we can work something out so I can send a weekly update instead of daily?""

She responded twice with in a somewhat demeaning and rude manner. One e-mail was a follows:

""This is not optional, nor is this a request I am seeking assistance with. When I have a level of confidence in measurable improvement and achievements you provide in the daily updates we will discuss altering this requirement to a weekly update. At this time, this is a requirement for your daily tasks, this is not negotiable. We discussed this at your one -on-one verbally and in a past e-mail.""

we DID NOT discuss this verbally. I feel like she doesn't trust my work ethics. I am the ONLY new person in the group that has to do this and I've been at the company 2 years longer than the other new coworkers. I worked in IT before this and understand a bit more about the program we are using. I do need help from time to time, but I work very well with my coworkers and we help each other out. They've all been nothing, but kind and helpful and really supportive. One saw the e-mail and literally said ""What the fuck is her problem with you?""

She has been saying snide remarks to me since I came to the group, I was very helpful and confident but now  feel so stressed, everything I do is not good enough for her either, she makes comments about all the work I do verbally. Not in the E-mail as much. And I DO give her updates daily verbally when she comes to talk to me. Is this normal? Do any of you have to send out daily updates? I fear she is trying to get me to quit for some reason.

One person said to go to HR, but I have no idea if this is a normal thing or not. I went home crying twice and felt really stressed trying to make her happy with my work. and I fear that going to HR would hurt me in the long run.",Known-Citron,1,1.0,4,1712981976,2024-04-13 04:19:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2t9ln/should_i_go_to_hr_or_is_this_normal/,4,2024

1c2rw57,Seeking advice on navigating the union game to secure a raise without leaving.,"Hello Reddit! 

I am turning to you for help.  I’ve been in my role for two years and the team has had 90% turnover. I’ve had great successes in my portfolio despite the shitshow. But now, I’ve now been given several more projects. 

I’ve advocated for myself and why I deserve a raise, but unfortunately I’m tied to union pay bands. I’ve met with the union too and because it’s all extra work in my portfolio I can’t reject it and I can’t get an increased wage due to the pay bands. They say I can only do one step at my yearly salary range. 

Yet, new people are being hired at the same or hired salary range than I with less experience. New leadership are hiring and there is no consistency. Ugh.

I don’t want to leave because I enjoy my wfm arrangement and frankly don’t want to learn a new organization. They would be lost without me since I’m one of the most veteran people and am the backbone to my portfolio.  

So now, I turn to you… how do I get a raise without jumping ship? It feels like a union game unfortunately. Feeling stuck in union rules.

Hey all, I recently started my first AE role mid-February. Super small tech startup.

Because this was my first AE role, I had to source 10 opps in March and 15 for April in addition to a $20K quota by end of April (end of Q1 for us) 

I’m drowning. Our sales process is nowhere near established and the tools we had been using up until a few weeks ago were just terrible. I’m nowhere near goal… like nowhere.

I’ve been told to “just get creative” and am often being compared to an AE who went through exactly what I’m going through now, but had great success. 

Although I’ve picked their brain to understand what has historically worked best for them and replicate that, I’m just not seeing the results. 

Is this typical for the AE position? I don’t want to make excuses, but I’m struggling.

1c2pa56,How to get a raise?,"Hi. I have a job where I run a department for a university.  I was a consultant for 1 year and i've been running it for the last 2 years. My starting salary was 95k. About a year ago, they spontaneously raised me to 120k with my boss (the university VP) expressing gratitude at what I've been able to accomplish.  I feel like that raise stopped me from asking for what I really want which is 250k.  Here's my reasoning:  Within the first year, I took a department that had been overspending 800k a year and was able to meet all financial goals.  I have also build the reputation of the department tremendously and objectively.  When the marketing dept did a marketing value analysis of the value built over my time there, the report showed 5 million dollars of new marketing value built.  The entire upper administration is proud of what i've done and the president quoted ""(my) work at department is the best thing they've ever done as a university.""  The point is, everyone is excited about me now and i want to capitalize on it.  How should I approach this raise?  My salary was set by looking at my title and checking what other people with a similar title in the state are making.  The value I have brought the university is well beyond that.

1c2mt22,How to not see a morning shift as a life sentence?,"Not too sure if this is the correct place to ask, but..

I always struggle when summer comes around because work has me crazy and I feel like I could never enjoy it. 

I’m very lucky where I have 15 days off a month (even though I work weekends)

The problem is the 15 days I work all having me starting my shift at 5AM. This means, the 15 nights before I work I’m in bed by 7 PM. So it doesn’t matter that I have off, I’m ruining my night by being in bed by seven. 

Does anybody have advice or tips on how to keep myself fueled during the day so that I don’t have to try to get a full eight hours rest the night before and I can actually enjoy my summer nights by staying out until about 10 o’clock every night?

1c2m9n3,Tips for the workplace they don't teach you in school,"I'm not sure why but the longest job I've had has been under 2 years. I've been fired (without cause), laid off and several jobs have been short term contracts.  
Here are some useful points I learned that they don't teach in school. Feel free to contribute to the list:  
\-There is such a thing as a stupid question. Try to ask questions that relate to your productivity and have answers, and not something overly theoretical.  
\-Don't ask the same person the same question more than once. If they can't explain it the first time, asking a second time just makes them annoyed.  
\-Try to get things in writing so you can refer back to them and don't have to ask the same question again.  
\-The quality of a persons work and productivity is very subjective. Lots of workplaces value a worker who can follow instructions more than someone who thinks for themselves or brings a lot of new ideas.  
\-If you're new don't make suggestions to improve the existing systems for the first few months.  
\-A lot has to do with your relationship with your boss. Does he like you? Do you make his job easier? Actually being productive is low on the list.  
\-If you don't have a direct relationship with your boss, he probably is asking other people how you're doing (when you're new). The feedback he gets from other people may be what determines if you pass probation.   
\-It's up to you to gain exposure and get recognition for your accomplishments, especially in larger companies. Email your boss or team if you just solved an outstanding issue or documented something that hadn't previously been documented.  
\-There's a learning curve to every job. Don't expect to know how to do a job after the first day.  
\-The first week to a month is probably going to focus on paperwork and on boarding. Don't expect to be very productive during this time. 

\-Keep a copy at home of everything relating to employment agreements, time off requests, metrics or performance reviews. If you get fired or laid off you may loose access without warning.

While there were scheduling delays/ reschedules between all of them, I heard feedback pretty quickly after. I finished my last interview about 4 weeks ago, but have yet to receive next steps.

It is for one of the largest companies in the US, so I expect there are several hoops/approvals to jump through when hiring someone. The team is also very small, and they are hiring due to the fact that they don't have enough hands on deck.

1c2l25r,Anyone work in real estate escrow?,"Hello,

I’m currently a closing admin doing back end stuff for a mortgage company. I currently WFH and I love it but the only way to advance is to move to a position that requires me to work on site which is downtown in a city that is a hour away and that’s without traffic. So therefore I have been job hunting for a better paying job. I just got offered an escrow assistant position that is paying $4 more a hour than what I make currently. I was a loan processor for a lil while before moving to closing so I am familiar with what escrow does as I interacted with them on a daily basis. 

My question is, does this seem like a good career move? I feel like I’m pretty knowledgeable in the real estate realm now so I would like to stay in this field for now but I’m not sure if there’s much to grow into other than being an escrow officer, which in itself would be nice for a little bit but I would like to make more money eventually. 

Can anyone kind of relate to this transition or have knowledge in the escrow world? And what avenues this position could lead to down the road?

1c2kl3r,"Wife got ""promoted"" as an independent contractor a few months ago without a raise, now she's getting a full-time status ""promotion""... still without a raise","My wife has been working remotely for a company since last summer as a full-time, 40-hour-per-week, scheduled ""contractor"" employee. They've been paying her $30 an hour with no benefits due to her being an independent contractor employee. Obviously she's been misclassified, as have all of her co-workers, because they all have a set schedule and aren't allowed to work for any other company within the same sector. The misclassification was annoying, but it's been a good job for her, so she's stuck it out, as she was hearing that they were looking at making some of their employees full-time employees (with benefits, PTO, and 401k) some time this year. Near the beginning of this year, my wife was offered a ""promotion"" to a supervision/management role within the company. I put quotation marks around ""promotion"" because of course it didn't come with a pay raise, just more responsibility. My wife and I discussed it and she decided to take the new role, with the thought that it would help her secure full-time status and a raise.  
  
My wife's new role has been far more demanding than her previous role, complete with numerous meetings per day and a ton of new responsibilities. She's handled it very well, and has received numerous accolades in the last few months for the job she's been doing. This week, she was finally offered a ""promotion"" to full-time employee status. I put ""promotion"" in quotation marks again because, well... They're offering her full-time status at the same hourly pay of $30 that she's been at since she started last summer.   
  
It was bad enough that she was given a new role responsible for dozens of other employees in addition to other duties that have left her far more busy during work and drained after work without receiving an increase in pay. She's been making the same amount of money to train and manage new hires as the new hires she's been training and managing. Now, with full-time employee status, she would be taking home less money than the people she's training and managing. Sure, at least she'd have healthcare benefits, 15 days PTO, and company-matched 401k contributions, but most of those things would reduce her take-home pay. Unfortunately, they told her until she accepts full-time status, they won't be able to tell her what her healthcare premium would cost monthly, so she doesn't even know whether that's going to reduce her take-home pay by $100 a month or $500 a month, or anything in between, above, or below. The 401K with employer matching is an obvious benefit regardless of it reducing her take-home pay by a bit, but the healthcare premium cost being unknown could potentially reduce her take-home pay drastically.  
  
*In summary, my wife has been a misclassified independent contractor employee for nearly a year. She received a promotion a few months ago without a pay raise, but took on much more responsibility and duties. Now she's being offered full-time employee status, which would give her healthcare benefits, 15 days PTO, and 401k matching, but still with no pay raise. She's excelled at this company, but if she accepts full-time status she'd be taking home less money per month than when she started in addition to her already having far more responsibility. As a side note, she's confirmed with the other handful of employees being offered full-time status that nobody else is getting a pay raise, either.*  
  
This wouldn't have been an issue if I was still working, but I quit my job making $38 an hour with too much OT back in February because I was on-call 24/7, getting an average of 19 calls per week outside of work hours, and my former employer had fired a few people and had me doing the equivalent of 4 full-time jobs by myself the last 9 months I was there... They still haven't filled any of the 4 jobs I was doing by myself, but I'd never go back for anything. I thought I had a job with my friend's company that would be ready in March, so I had planned on taking a month off of work and then jump into that, but his company had a slow-down in demand that has pushed that back, so I'm currently not working full-time, either. We've both been without healthcare since I resigned, because the ACA healthcare is expensive, and my COBRA offer after I resigned was absurdly expensive. I don't really care about having healthcare because I've rarely gone to the doctor in my adult life beyond job-sponsored yearly physicals, and I've never had any health issues. My wife is also very healthy, but she does want to have healthcare.  
  
  
*Should she risk putting a target on herself by negotiating for a pay raise as a requirement for her to accept full-time status? Should she just flat-out decline the full-time status and cite the lack of a pay raise? Should she accept the full-time status without any fuss and just start immediately searching for a job with another company that would pay better? Should she request to be ""demoted"" back to her original role after accepting the full-time status? Should she decline the full-time status AND request to be ""demoted"" back to her original role?*  
  
  
She likes her job, and has liked her company, but she's definitely disappointed. She knowingly accepted more responsibility and duties a few months ago without a pay raise because she believed it would help her get full-time employee status and a corresponding raise... She is being offered the full-time status, but the absence of a raise while being told that the company values her so much that they want to give her full-time employee status feels like an insult, since, as the adage goes, ""a promotion without a pay raise is actually a demotion"". She's doing 2 or 3 times the amount of work she was doing before the ""promotion"" and has far more responsibility now, but still no pay raise. Any advice on what she should do?",Temporary_Nebula3712,2,0.6700000166893005,17,1712956700,2024-04-12 21:18:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2kl3r/wife_got_promoted_as_an_independent_contractor_a/,4,2024

1c2jv9c,Should I pursue CS Masters in USA or remain in India to join Startups?,"Good morning everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. Given the diverse nature of this community, I thought it would be a good idea to seek your advice. I’ll try to keep this brief. Please bear with me as I’m relatively new to this.

I’m a 28-year-old software developer from India with five years of industry experience. Recently, I’ve been accepted into a Master’s program in Computer Science at Ohio State University. However, I’m unsure whether to proceed with this opportunity or not. My dilemma stems from two main concerns:

**DILEMMA**

1. I’m uncertain about continuing in the software domain for the rest of my career. If I move to the USA, I’ll likely have to stay in this field due to visa constraints (H1B). And later if I don't like software then unnecessarily I have to be there until I pay my debts. On the positive side, if I continue in the tech domain, I’ll have the opportunity to learn a lot from US startups and potentially save some money before returning to India and start something of my own.
2. I’m fairly certain that I want to pursue entrepreneurship at some point. If I stay in India, I can start learning about entrepreneurship this year, rather than waiting until after my Master’s. It’s also easier to switch careers in India compared to the USA, allowing me to explore different industries and find a domain that truly interests me. Startup culture is growing pace here as well and definitely it would also be great to work in those budding companies.

One of my fears is that if I don’t start working with startups soon, it might become more difficult as I get older and have more family responsibilities. If I go to the USA, my next 4-5 years would be pretty much set in stone.

**QUESTION**

So, I’m wondering if going to the USA would be beneficial for my entrepreneurial journey, considering my uncertainty about my future career. Or would it be more valuable to stay in India and pursue my entrepreneurial aspirations here? Would I feel difference in my career growth based on learnings in USA vs India? Because I saw people who went to USA learned a lot about startups, how they are built, how decisions are made etc and this I think I might have a FOMO about it.

Given H1B conditions is it tricky to switch careers in USA?

Please let me know if I’ve misunderstood anything or and feel free to share your thoughts and feedback.

Thank you

1c2izuv,Making Career Move Decisions,"
I HATE making decisions. What to wear, what to eat, etc. 

So it seems fitting that making a big decision which may impact my life is freaking my brain out. 

I am self employed but have been contracting to one company about 8-10 hours a week. The consistent weekly pay has been a bit of a safety blanket as most of my other income isn’t weekly. I feel that I am making good money and I also feel that money shouldn’t be my only reason for staying at a job. 

The company I contract to is so disorganised and my ‘boss’ changes the goal posts almost daily. I’ve wanted to leave for a while but always thought I could hang on, but I’m starting to notice that it’s having an impact of my work outside of this company and on my mental wellbeing. 

I am also studying a short course which will almost certainly give me a skill which will easily replace the income from these hours. I just need time to finish it but I’m running out of hours in the week where I can function. 

Have any of you taken the risk of stepping away from consistent work to focus on your growing business?? 

I have friends and colleagues asking me why I am still working for this boss too. 

I’m worried that I am being to emotional and that I should suck it up. I think I have some sort of mislead loyalty to someone who sees me as a chair filler.

I am putting in hours that I am NOT being compensated for. Yesterday I worked 7am to 4:30pm doing meetings and collecting needed parts and supplies.

1c2hspb,I hate my job,"Hi everyone,

I have moved across the globe for a new job two months ago, but I hate it with every part of my being. Never have I ever felt very upset as soon as I wake up on a workday and very happy it's finally Friday evening. The frustration is killing me; I feel like I haven't thought this through when I accepted the job offer.

While I was aware of some of the downsides of the job, I feel like I was a bit misled regarding the upsides. For instance, I was told it's long hours (which I am fine with), but I have never been told I might also be working on the weekends. I was told that we do not have access to the same data sources I had in the previous job, but I was not told we have access to NO sources at all. I have been told it will be less analytical than my previous job, but I was not told it's not analytical at all: Now I feel like all I am doing is reading articles and reports and summarizing main points.

I have started applying to new jobs again (all of which will require moving continents again), but I am also worried how this might be seen by the recruiters. How should I, for instance, answer the interview question ""why do you want to change jobs after only two months?"". Will it reflect badly on me if I want to change jobs again in the future?

However, I am a bit worried I might be overreacting, and that my frustration is part of the adaptation process. My previous job was my first job, and I liked it very much, but it was so good that it might be hard to find something  that good ever again. My new job is also not as prestigious as my previous one, and doesn't fit well within my career goals (at least from what I have seen in the first two months), but it's not entirely off. I am also very much better off financially with my new job, and it might be hard to find something as generous somewhere else. 

My questions are:
1- How long should I wait before I know this job isn't my thing and it's time to move?
2- Is it possible that I am overreacting? 
3- Should I stop using my previous job as a benchmark? It was the best job anyone can get in my field.

Advice are also welcome. Please note that quitting my job before finding something else is not a viable option.",LebinDub,3,0.6700000166893005,6,1712949741,2024-04-12 19:22:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2hspb/i_hate_my_job/,4,2024

I started as an intern and my title was changed to associate designer recently in November. I have worked full time since I started and have also been doing college work simultaneously. I’m just about to graduate in May and am trying to figure out what salary to ask for.

I have been integral to the design team according to everyone I work with. I occasionally people lead and direct other designers with my advanced understanding of our libraries and design processes. Everyone constantly tells me I over perform. I even got to work on the two most ambitious/complex projects the team has ever handled very recently. I probably know the system and program we have better than almost everyone else we work with and constantly pull more than my load, I even lead the directors on the program at times. However as a contractor, I have the same salary I started with (which isn’t much, but good for a student) and never received a bonus or promotion financially.

I’m earning my BFA in graphic design and this is my first job in the field. I also have done graphic design and freelancing for about 5 years professionally but nothing too crazy.

1c2dmow,Peer Feedback - I'm always negative and closed minded.,"My entire career I've been told not to be afraid to speak up, yet when I do I'm told that I tend to be negative because I'm pushing back. Recently, during our annual reviews, I had a peer say that ""I should be more positive and open minded and that I should give praise to fellow co-workers when they do something to help me."" This is frustrating on so many levels!

For one, no one on my team (except my boss) has ever acknowledged anything I've done to help them (yes, I know how that sounds, but a part of me has a hunch they're just looking to boost their own egos and get noticed by others in the company.) But if they're concerned, perhaps I need to consider going about this in a different way because I do often give recognition. I usually give shout outs during weekly meetings and in reports I give to execs. Whenever someone asks for my help, I tend to drop what I'm doing, prioritizing their projects over mine to get them what they need.

In terms of being more open minded, I don't necessarily disagree, but this defensiveness comes from a lack of being heard. I will typically say something like ""This is a great idea, but I'm concerned about a few things. Here's how I think we should address them."" Apparently, all they're hearing when I say that is ""No. I don't want to do this."" I come prepared with as much data as I possibly can to back up my suggestions, take the time to explain my reasoning, and while it's acknowledged, there's rarely any agreement to act on it. The perfect example is recently, our CEO hired an outside consultant to go through our website and make suggestions to improve it. Almost everything they came back with were suggestions I've been mentioning over the past several months. It makes me feel like I'm incompetent and not trusted to do my job.

My manager is fantastic. She's easy to talk to, listens, and takes the time to understand but rarely takes my side on anything. I'm hoping to find the most appropriate way to bring this up (without sounding negative lol) as well as any suggestions on how I can improve communication with my peers. I am not the type of person who does well with confrontation, and clearly since this isn't the first time someone has mentioned I'm too ""pushy"" I'm doing something that's being interpreted the wrong way. I just don't understand how they're expecting me to act.",fazzio514,1,1.0,2,1712939540,2024-04-12 16:32:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2dmow/peer_feedback_im_always_negative_and_closed_minded/,4,2024
1c2d3kg,30(M) Advice on how to transition into a new career path,"I am 30(M), living in a country in the global south. Until a few weeks ago I was working as a policy and digital systems analyst(part-time) at a small-time consulting firm, like 4 employees small [.](https://firm.It) We haven't been doing too well financially and have been heavily relying on one clients' projects to fund everything from salaries to marketing expenses right now living paycheck to paycheck and might have to dip into my savings to make rent for at least the next 3 months. 

I studied law in college, but didn't practice and went directly into consulting after, during this period I also decided to self-learn how to code because I loved it and hoped I would be able to land a job as a data engineer eventually, which didn't pan out the way I though it would, because I realized I love coding more as a hobby and less as a full-time job option after endlessly stressing about mastering the coding interviews. I am currently not sure about what career path to take going forward.

My role was pretty niche, and isn't that common in the job market so it's been really difficult to land a similar position elsewhere. I learnt quite a bit  of technical knowledge from the consulting gigs we did, but most of it was learnt on roughly 2 projects that we did for 4 years, I learnt quite a bit during that time but it's knowledge concentrated in one particular domain,coffee industry, and since I was the most senior in the team I didn't really get to do much hands on. 

Most of the senior colleagues would work in silos, and just present their work.I would have to learn by myself from their reports. Fortunately, because I was self-learning how to code I understood quite a bit of the technical aspects, but have never really felt confident about the knowledge I gained.  


I am currently playing around with going back to school, for a masters degree in IT or an MBA, but I am still not sure about that decision. And I would also love to be working while I am studying, but I can't seem to find a role that captures the nuances of what I did in the consulting firm.

I’m unsure of what the best course of action is. Do most people informally tell their supervisor that they are quitting in a conversation, and then email a formal notice? Do I just email them and wait for them to read it and reply? We don’t have assigned desks at my office, so I can’t really turn in a physical note. 

In addition, is it ever worth it to air out my grievances during my exit interview? It’s abundantly clear that my supervisors do not like me and I have not received support or mentorship. I know that they would not give me a positive reference, and I would not ask them for one either. I’ve had to get on antidepressants since starting my job because the office environment has been so hostile. I am also unsure if this is the career path I want to take, but my experiences and degree are all in this field so far, so I’m hesitant in case somehow future prospective jobs may contact my employer.

1c2c68k,Career change advice - late 20s,"**Looking for advice/thoughts as I've started to more seriously consider pursuing accounting as a career, with the primary aim of getting into a line of work with decent work-life balance and earning potential (aiming to reach $100-150k range by my mid 30s), and that I could find reasonably interesting.**  
**My background:** Humanities/social sciences undergrad (with lots of economics and some moderately advanced math classes, no accounting specifically) + master's degree both from a top 5 US university, 2nd social sciences master's degree from a top UK university. I'm a pretty good example of an over-educated millennial.  
Career-wise, I've had a couple different if somewhat random full-time entry-level roles at small companies, none in jobs or sectors that I feel particularly passionate about or interested in long-term. They've been roles that I'd broadly describe as providing professional services, with client-facing work but I'm not really on a clear career ""track.""  
In my first job out of school, I advanced rather quickly in the 2.5ish years I was there -- got hired at $50k starting salary and was near $80k when I went back to school in 2021; I know I'd have reached $100k if I had stayed given I left a promotion that would have gotten me to that salary band. Took a significant pay cut (am back around $60k) when I accepted my current job, mainly because it's fully remote, pretty easy/not demanding (so lots of time for travel and non-work hobbies), and it has allowed me to stay in the UK for a couple of years after finishing my degree. Been in the role for about 1.5 years now, but don't feel like there's a ton of advancement that I can work towards at the company. Ultimately I don't want to be in an entry-level role forever, plus I know that the earning ceiling at this company is lower than what I'm looking for so I'm feeling ready to move on and head back to the US.  
**What I'm thinking:** As I think about next career steps, I'm looking to be more pragmatic and strategic than I have been with career choices so far. I don't have any regrets about how I've done my 20s and am comfortable with the trade offs I've in terms of not climbing as high on the career ladder as many of my college peers/I know I could have, in exchange for a lot of really fantastic lived experiences.  
However, as I near my 30s, I have some more real financial responsibilities on the horizon (paying back a bit of student loans I took for the 2nd masters, supporting parents financially - first gen/working class immigrant background so my siblings and I are basically the retirement plan, etc.). I want to set myself up to be able to meet those without having to make a lifestyle sacrifice.  
Part of where I've landed over the course of my 20s is also moving away from the idea, which I held on to for a long time, that I need to be ""passionate"" about my work. I know that I have a strong work ethic, am capable/intelligent, and take pride in delivering good work -- but at the end of the day, the things that bring me the most joy and a sense of meaning in life are not things I have found at work. I also don't aspire to building massive wealth, but I do want to be financially comfortable, like in a middle/upper-middle class type of way. So I'm ok with having a job that's just a job, and finding a line of work where I can make enough to not be constantly worried about money and have time to do the things I really enjoy. I do still want to learn, feel challenged, and interested in what I'm doing, but I don't need or want work to be what I build my life around.  
**Accounting seems like a career path that could fit that bill - stable, decent earning potential, something I could pursue without needing to do too much additional schooling to get my foot in the door. For any folks that have made a move into accounting in your later 20s/earlier 30s, what has been your experience? Would it be realistic to aim for a salary progression where I'm making low-100k range within a couple of years?**",jadedoptimist17,1,1.0,1,1712936021,2024-04-12 15:33:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2c68k/career_change_advice_late_20s/,4,2024

Secondly, I plan to take my PE, although kind of scared until the green card stuff gets solved, because I fear even if I somehow pass the PE but the green card issue still stays uncertain, if it’s gonna go in vein. My current job is not asking for PE at the moment, and there are people above my rank in the office who do not even have the EIT.  
  
And lastly, I am planning to buy a starter home/apartment by this August, I don't want to renew my apartment lease anymore and somehow land a starter home and start building equity. But the uncertainty is also affecting this decision as well. Would it be a good idea to buy one now, and God forbid if things go south, still possible to sell it back and leave the country.  
  
That being said, the guidance I seek is, do I finish the house-buying phase first by this August, and then set for the PE, or it’s also fine to do both in parallel? Asking because the PE does not have a set deadline as of now, but I do need to finish my house phase by August or I will get delayed another year. The visa uncertainty stays regardless, so would you say I wait till that part is fixed, risking a whole year?

1c2btnn,I’m stuck between 2 industries,"Background:

I (31M) have a bachelors and 5+ years in accounting. I also have 10+ years in construction with a contractor’s license (Class B general contractor). I stopped working in the accounting field a year and a half ago to pursue construction full time. I live in California in a HCOL city and currently make 65k a year. I’ve recently started talking to a girl and it’s progressing nicely. But a gremlin of a thought came to me, “how would I provide for her and a family?”


I recently took an accounting position within a major city (gov accounting). The reason for the move was that projects were hard to come by and only getting harder. So the position would supplement the lack of projects with steady income and good benefits. I become hybrid after 6 months with the minimum of 3 days in the office.


But the lack of pay, hours worked, learning new accounting principles, and the work environment has made me question my choice. After takes and everything I make 4k a month. I’m also on a 9/80 but I’m in the office 10 hours a day. I thought I can take on projects while working for the city. I recently worked a 75+ hours a week. I’ve been working 11 days straight and I’m off this Friday. I can stomach all of this but there’s no room for growth. A non manager/director position is 6.6k a month after taxes, that’s a person who’s been working there for 15 years. Small raise every year and I’m the last person on the totem pole. I’ve talked to other peeps there and they said lateraling to another department/city is impossible. They said that it takes a year and a half to find, test, interview, and train a replacement. 


On the other side, I’m my own boss within construction. I make my hours and I do what I want to do. Money is also good but only if you work hard. It’s fuuuuuucking physically demanding and you can get permanently fucked if you’re not careful. The problem is I didn’t know when my next project is gonna come in. I haven’t been perusing jobs since I applied to the city and I’ve been coasting with small jobs. My company has partners and they take a percentage but they also bring in work. I chose to only get paid on jobs I do and nothing from the entire business. The reason for this is I want to be free to peruse other jobs without them. I can always renegotiate with them for a percentage with the promise of taking over the day to day and bringing in more jobs. 


I’ve asked for advice but it’s been a mixed bag of opinions so I’m turning to Reddit for help (casting a larger net as the saying goes). 


My options as I see it is:

1. Stop complaining and stick with your current job and see where it takes you.

2. Quit this job and find another accounting job.

3. Quit and to continue in construction.

4. You guys chose.

Update: The other day the boss I'm still contracted with asked me for more documents on Sue's behalf. I was able to brush it off- she has all of these things. Now, I have an email from the big big boss, asking again for materials for Sue.

Let me be clear- none of these are essential materials and all of them she has access to (with possibly the exception of one table made in Word). 

I feel I need to respond to big boss, but I also feel I need to draw the line.

1c2beth,Jobs in Academic Advising,"Hi, all, first time poster here!

I am a former Christian pastor looking to start a second career in education. I have a B.A. in secondary Ed and history and a M.A. degree in theology and ministry. I have experience substitute teaching, working with teachers and students, but my talents are more suited for the administrative side of education. As a pastor, I was an administrator, overseeing a church, addressing problems and concerns, and delivering exceptional service to meet the congregation's needs.

As such, I did some research, and I think academic advising would suit me well. However, in looking at available academic advisory jobs, they all require some sort of experience in higher education, which I don't have. What would you recommend, given my job history, skills, and education?

1c2b2gv,Seeking Career Advice: Considering a Job Hop from Developer to Business Analyst  ,"Hi everyone,

I'm seeking some career advice and would appreciate your insights. Here's a snapshot of my background:

Current Position: Salesforce Technical Consultant

Experience: Over 8 years in Salesforce development, including roles at various companies.

Current Dilemma: I have been offered a role as a Business Analyst(but involves technical work too), which would involve a shift away from development. The new job offers a similar current salary and attractive benefits, but I'm unsure about leaving the technical track.

Factors to Consider:

Years of Experience: Over 8 years in Salesforce development, indicating a strong foundation in technical roles.

Current Salary: 23000 AED  Comfortable, but the organisation has not been stable and is frequent lay off offender. Industry: its a food delivery app giant.

Next Job Salary: 22500 AED this is from a very well known aviation group and is a semi government entity. 

Job Benefits: Attractive benefits package in the new role such as education allowance for kids, flight tickets.
 
Role Change: Transition from developer to business analyst, offering new challenges and opportunities for growth.

Previous Job Hops: Varied experience across different companies, demonstrating adaptability and willingness to explore new opportunities. 

Also, I'm in my 6th company in total of 8 years experience.


In my POV: 
I feel i have too many job hops but Im worried about job security, hence I'm leaning towards the new job. 

I'm torn between sticking with my current technical trajectory or embracing a new role as a Business Analyst. Any advice or insights based on your experiences would be greatly appreciated.

1c2axd3,"Joined a training program after college, but I hate the workplace. Can I leave?","Hello everyone! I don’t post often so sorry if I explain this badly lol. Using my throwaway.

After college, I joined a 2-year entry-level program at a retailer, and at first, my coworkers helped me understand the basics and put effort into teaching me about the position and workplace. I’ve been here for almost a year, and am about to hit my next rotation (there are 4 total). There has been a downfall in management’s work ethic in general. When I ask questions or ask for help on a new situations, they are less likely to respond or try to answer my questions (These are things that I HAVE to follow protocol on or I could see consequences). I’ve noticed a shift in the salesfloor associates towards all managers as well. I’m worried that if I stay here, my growth will be stunted early on as well as my ambition to learn. A few months ago, I hit a level of depression and helplessness where I can’t sleep or put in my normal effort to do things properly (at home and at work). This is very abnormal for me, even when I was working 2 jobs and going to school full-time. I feel as though I have to take on way more than the typical manager to make sure the store runs smoothly, because if I do not, it will lead to future stress and arguments between managers.

When I share my concerns or solutions with other managers, I hear things like “That’s just how it is here” or “it won’t change anything.” 

At what point, do I call it quits and look for a different job that aligns with my goals and values? I will have to pay back the sign-on bonus I received if I quit, but I’m willing to do so. Should I apply for other jobs now to see if I can get a new opportunity that would help my future growth? Or try to keep pushing through this one and not let it crush my spirit?

I’ve never quit a job like this before and I’m new to the career game. Any kind advice is welcome!",handsomepancake1,1,1.0,0,1712933017,2024-04-12 14:43:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c2axd3/joined_a_training_program_after_college_but_i/,4,2024

They said they were going through old applications to find someone to fill a role they have and wanted to see if I was interested. They knew the email I used for LinkedIn, when I had previously applied to the company and the role seemed reasonably related to my skills.

They said to get in touch if I was interested. However when I replied I got an invalid domain error (recruitmentfin.com) and they hadn't actually provided an email address or specified HOW I should get in touch, nor was there a link to a place I could apply for the role or anything. 

There were a couple of phone numbers in their signature but they looked like they'd be overseas calls and I don't like calling random phone numbers. I looked the person up on LinkedIn and worked out their actual company email and replied there (explaining the domain error) but it's been crickets thus far.

Hi, I'm seeking some advice on a career crossroads I find myself coming to. Currently I'm employed as a Platform Engineer in the tech world in the UK. I switched careers from being a plumber because I lost any motivation for my job as a plumber. 

I'm approaching the 1 year mark in my new career but have found the change difficult and challenging which I knew it would be, I had been learning new skills during my job as a plumber. I learned cloud, iac and touched on programming languages before I gained employment. 

As I was a career switcher it meant that I had to start at the lower end of the pay scale, something I knew before I switched, however circumstances changed for me when my partner fell pregnant and we needed a new home. This put an added strain on to my decision to switch careers but we carried on with the change. 

I recently learned that a colleague of mine earning a lot more than I am with the same amount of experience, I'd say the only real difference is he has more knowledge of programming languages where I have more experience in cloud iac stuff. He also knows his salary will increase substantially come this summer, I should note my pay review is the same period. For reference I currently earn 26k per year and he is on around 32k. His increase is to around 42k. While I know my pay review is likely to be an increase from what I get currently it is unlikely to be towards the 40k mark. 

Now the crossroads. With the changes in circumstances in home life and also in the knowledge that I'm probably one of the lower paid platform engineers at the current company it's made me re-think my choice to change. I'm in a unique position where I probably don't have enough experience as a Platform Engineer, 1 year this summer, to switch company. However I have been offered a job back as a plumber at around 52k with the possibility of bonus and a chance at moving into a management position further down the line. 

My aim when changing career was to move away from the labourious job and into something a bit more forgiving on the body, I don't have any health issues but that's not to say they wouldn't begin to creep in with age. Also the tech world has more opportunity to grow into a better paying position, at my current career stage I'd say it's quite a significant time away before I reach what I could get right now as a plumber and then another substantial amount of time before I surpass that. 

My real question here is does anybody have any advice on my next steps? Is it worth riding out the hard times at the moment in terms of salary, I'm starting to feel it and if I didn't have savings this decision would be taken out of my hands already. Moving into the 2nd year I have a feeling ill still need to dip in. I have a few gripes with how this company operates like expectancy to take part in extra things outside of working hours but that is optional even if it is used as part of your pay review! You get gripes in every job though so it's not a deal breaker. Or maybe move back into a career I could do with my eyes closed and earn really good pay, work is left at work no expectancy for extra curriculars without over time pay. Although the pay ceiling is lower I could probably make more use of my free time if I wanted to earn more. I read a quote somewhere that says you won't get rich working for someone else!

Recently, I’ve been leading a technical team for the past 5 years as a ServiceNow Engineering Manager for ITSM.

Here’s my dilemma: While I’ve never directly used Java or coding in my roles, I do have a foundational understanding from my college days and early career, but I do get my personnel hands-on once in a while on Java & Python to not loose my grasp of understanding the basics. However, when it comes to code-related questions in work, I often turn to Technical Leads or Architects for answers or solutions. 

Note: I do have high level understanding of aws, azure, python, java, javascript, jdbc, dockers, containers, javascript (servicenow) and infrastructure (network, monitoring tools)

Now, I’m contemplating my next move:

1. **Coding and Emerging Technologies**: Should I dive back into coding and gain a deeper understanding of how applications are built end-to-end using new technologies? Is this necessary for driving progress, or is a high-level understanding sufficient?
2. **Returning to ITIL**: Alternatively, should I revisit my old profiles related to ITIL?

As a **Software Engineering Manager**, I find myself at a crossroads. When exploring new job opportunities, employers expect high proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, AWS, Git, and more. However, learning these technologies from scratch feels overwhelming, especially with the demands of my current role and priorities.

I’m torn between staying in my current position and expanding my technical knowledge or exploring new roles within the engineering space. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",amakkuva,1,1.0,0,1712923445,2024-04-12 12:04:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c27fat/how_to_move_forward/,4,2024
1c26yf5,New job I like but my slowly realizing my manager is awful,"I started a new job 4 weeks ago. The pay is great and the company culture is amazing. I love the 3 girls on my team but within the first couple of weeks I realized they didn’t like our manager. Their last manager was a great leader and mentor who unfortunately passed away. They promoted the longest member on the team and his title has been “Acting manager” for 8 months now. 

I thrive off of a good leader and mentor. My last 2 roles had that. This manager is a jerk, doesn’t have empathy or care (my coworker is pregnant and had to go to ER and he was mad she took 3 days off as she was supposed to train me. Didn’t ask if her or her baby was okay when she came back). He is hands off but not in the way you want a manager to be. He’s been there for 12 years so I doubt they’d package him out. 

I really like the job and company but I’m getting the feeling that the 2 girls are looking for a new job and the other is going on mat leave soon.

1c26f25,Left job of one year because I was recruited by a former boss. Regret it. What should I do?,"I am a mid-senior executive level and I left a job I had only been at a year to work for a former boss. The move was unsolicited but he lured me over with the promise of standing up a new department and a financial offer that I couldn’t turn down (20% increase). Unfortunately, after only a couple months, I can tell the company culture and work aren’t the right fit. I’m miserable and regret moving from a role I enjoyed. I’m having anxiety attacks which I’ve never had before. This experience has made it crystal clear what I value in a role. 

My previous company was very happy with my work and I believe would rehire me despite my short tenure but they’ve already filled my role. 

I’m not sure I can continue working in this environment. I’ve talked with my boss and there’s nothing to be done because the issues are cultural. I’m concerned this leaves two major flags on my resume. Prior to these moves I had been with my company for 8 years and am genuinely a loyal and hardworking person.  

My questions are:
1) how do I seek out new opportunities when I’m starting to look like a job hopper?
2) do you include the 2 month (current) position on your resume? 
3) I’m considering hiring a career coach. What are some things I should be looking for?

1c25ryn,"A Billionaire CEO Asked Me to Work for Him, But There’s a Catch… ","I got the opportunity to work for the CEO of a pharma company of around 35 people. The CEO is almost a billionnaire (his NW is around 700M$) and is the owner of the company. 

He reached out to be on LinkedIn and told me he really liked my pedigree and he was looking someone to be his right hand/assistant and to be the marketing director of the company as well.

I’m around 30 so the opportunity is great: getting an amazing title on the CV of Marketing Director and Right Hand to the CEO. 

However, there are quite a lot of drawbacks too. This CEO (owner of the company) fired the previous appointed CEO as the company wasn’t profitable - he wants to get the company back on track, which is why he’s looking for top talent (which, he says, he sees in me as I did a top school/worked for companies he likes) :

1. No work from home at all. 

2. Long hours (12h per day), and potentially work on weekends. 

3. He told me he would pay me 50% of my current salary for the first year, 75% of my current salary the 2nd year, and then I would get my current salary back. He explained that this is because this company is his dream and that there needs to be a sacrifice, and he wants someone who will be all-in.
 
4. I talked to another employee of the company who told me that the atmosphere of the company isn’t great since he arrived. He is from China and believes in hard work, and is very directive. 

He told me that after 3-5 years, “money won’t be an issue for you”. He talked about someone who worked for him for 20 years and retired because he had too much money.

What do you think? What should I do?

1c23ota,Changing fields from engineering,"Hello everyone, I’m in need of some career advice.

 

I’m M26 and I’ve been a mechanical engineer for almost 10 years. In those years I’ve done an apprenticeship and a further education (machine construction). I’ve never been fully satisfied with my career choice even tho I like the mechanical aspect. I thought it would get better after the further education, but the main problems remain:

 

1. The pay (in my country atleast) is kinda bad. Its enough to survive but its more on the lower end (considering it’s a rather difficult field)
Most people in this field are very uptight. 

2. Meaning everything is very traditional, analog and “how we used to do it 50 years ago”.

3. Because of people being uptight, there is very little homeoffice, and you have to fight for every day you want to work remotely.

4. A lot of responsibility for mostly very little reward (money wise and recognition)
 

Since those problems occurred in every job so far, I feel like it’s a problem with the field and not with the company. Therefore, I’m thinking about changing to e different field. But which? Where do I have less of these problems? Is there a field that’s not too far from what I’ve done so far so the last couple of years won’t be wasted?

 

For example, I’ve heard a lot of good things about HR. The pay in my country seems very good, and the work conditions are very modern. Sadly, it has nothing to do with my mechanical education, but apparently you don’t need that deep of a background to start a career in HR.

 

Any other fields like this? Any insights?

Hello guys I am here to give me some opinions about what side hustle should I do. First of all I am a complicated case. My first degree was a Bsc in Physical Education & Sports Science and my second was a Msc is in Business Management. 
Currently I am working as a fitness instructor at people with special needs. I am not satisfied with my salary it barely covers my basic needs. Moreover I don't want to be a personal trainer or a PE teacher and relevant jobs since I regretted for my first degree.

I tried multiple times to get hired as an Hr Recruiter or Hr Assistant or even a Generalist but after dozens of interviews I got rejected from all the big companies in my country and the smaller companies as well. I must mention I have completed 2 different upaid internships just to gain a basic experience, I also have completed 3 certifications in Tech Recruitment but neither that was enough to get hired. I tried once to work as a freelancer recruiter paid by commission  but it didn't go well. 
I don't what is going wrong maybe because I have 2 different degrees and diverse background? Maybe because HR people want woke shit culture stuff? Or because it is a bit saturated market? Whatever it is sometimes I feel stupid for these two past years spared in my life so far. 

Anyway at current period I need asap a side hustle that will give me boost and why not to do it and evolve it as my main job into the future. 

Thank you for your time.

1c220cf,I’m going to meet everyone at my 100% remote company in person at a 4-day retreat in another country. Any advice on how to make a good impression?,"Since October I’ve been working at this 100% remote company, and it’s been amazing. Great benefits, great pay, I absolutely love the work, and it’s very relaxed in terms of day-to-day schedules. I truly feel like I’ve landed a unicorn job and I’m very aware of making sure I don’t do anything to mess it up. 

Every year apparently the company has a summit where everyone (20 people) can get together and meet each often. It’s hosted by the CEO. This year it’s in Costa Rica and it’s 3 nights / 4 days of hiking, city tours, coffee tastings, and eating at fancy looking restaurants. On paper it sounds really wonderful and I’ve been really excited. 

But all of a sudden I’m very worried about this and making a good impression. I’ve never had a job this (for lack of a better word) prestigious (?) before, and I really, really won’t want to mess it up. It doesn’t help that I’m pretty sure I’m younger than everyone (late 20s) and I already have major imposter syndrome from landing this job. 

I won’t be the only newish person there, but lots of people have been with this company for years and years, so I’m ALSO worried that if one of them doesn’t like me for some reason, that they’ll tell the CEO and he’ll take their side. (I recognize this sounds really paranoid but it’s where my mind goes). The CEO seems nice but also very zero-bullshit and intense. 

I think I’ve already decided that I won’t drink alcohol while I’m there, but are there any other tips or advice from people who’ve maybe been in a similar situation?

I panicked and started applying, and within a month, I got a job offer at one of the partners of my then-current company.

I was so worried and confused about joining this company and started thinking about my career. I thought joining this company could downgrade my profile, and having a junior manager might not sync well with me. How could I take him to client meetings knowing he hasn't done much in his career, etc.? Anyway, after so much back and forth, I decided not to join, but now I'm regretting it. I've been jobless since last year and have given over 50 interviews. I regret my decision so badly that not a single hour goes by without me thinking about it. Now our savings are nearly over, and I might have to start driving Uber or doing some odd job to manage daily expenses, which is giving me more depression.

I work for an insurance company, and I make about 22/hr plus comission. I get no health benefits and no retirement, no real bonus for working with this company and in this position. I've interviewed with a few other insurance companies and realized there is no difference in switching since no other company offers benefits. The only good thing is that it's fully remote and that is nice being a single parent.

I have about 7 years experience in the automotive industry. (3 years detailing, 4 years selling cars). As well as about 4 years in the hospitality industry. 

I am struggling to make ends meet every month and I had a friend tell me the other day that it seemed like I was severely underpaid. He was stunned that I don't at least have benefits being that I work for an insurance company. 

Any recommendations on what I could do with my previous job experiences that could possibly land me a different job that pays better and offers some benefits? At least until I finish my degree? Ideal position would be remote since sometimes I have to stay home with my kid if he's sick or anything but I am not opposed to going into an office.

One of these aspects more or less runs on auto pilot, the crews do their jobs well, clients just renew every year and all is good. The second aspect is pretty new and fundamentally changing every year with regulations, technology, and expectations. Over the last 6 months we've gone from a compliance based service into a preventative and analysis based one. I've been forming partnerships with other companies to supplement each other in order to put all of us ahead of the competition. The intent is to gain more clients and revenue.

The final aspect I've had to completely rebuild the reputation of the service. Prior to me they went through 4 managers in under a year. It took months to get client trust back in order to get the work. However we regained all but 1 client and got two new ones, unfortunately the season just kind of sucked and there wasn't many projects.

Now here comes the problem. My boss threatened my job last week saying I'm not performing well enough. We haven't gained new clients as of yet (contracts are awarded yearly) were in a position now to double our workload next year though. 

I believe his threat was unjustified and incredibly shortsighted given what I'm building. After that conversation I called up someone in this space and now it looks like there's a job offer coming my way next week that is apparently very generous.

Am I just being sensitive here? Is my performance criticisms justified? Should I just put my head down and keep going so I can finish my plan off? 
Or do I take this role and leave my boss to try and recover?

Side note: I maintain our cyber security, reporting systems, and fix the various computers as they get messed up. ",Krugle_01,1,1.0,0,1712896044,2024-04-12 04:27:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c205e3/am_i_being_over_sensitive_and_too_reactive_long/,4,2024
1c200dj,Regretting ,"Hi there,I'm not sure why I'm writing this, maybe I want to hear other thoughts.Last year around August, I was working at one of the big IT companies in a good position with decent pay. I'm in enterprise sales. Around July, I was told that my job could be affected during layoffs. I panicked and started applying, and within a month, I got a job offer at one of the partners of my then-current company. The company had just moved into our region, and the hiring manager was junior, meaning he didn't have much experience, which made me worried about my future and working with him under his mentorship. I was so worried and confused about joining this company and started thinking about my career. I thought joining this company could downgrade my profile, and having a junior manager might not sync well with me. How could I take him to client meetings knowing he hasn't done much in his career, etc.? Anyway, after so much back and forth, I decided not to join, but now I'm regretting it. I've been jobless since last year and have given over 50 interviews. I regret my decision so badly that not a single hour goes by without me thinking about it. Now our savings are nearly over, and I might have to start driving Uber or doing some odd job to manage daily expenses, which is giving me more depression. I'm not sure why I'm posting this because I made that decision not to join, and I'm the one to blame, but I don't know where to go. I guess what I want to know is, has anyone ever had such a situation?",Fair_Secretary8608,1,1.0,0,1712895589,2024-04-12 04:19:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c200dj/regretting/,4,2024

1c1z37v,"Had a great internship before school, didn’t finish college, 50/50 (pls help)","Half the time it’s odd explaining it, half the time it’s over looked and not regarded in any interviews. 

I interned at Adobe prior to college/ dropped out while working at Apple. 

So I’ve been in media design for ever now, legit 11-13 years, of course started in my teens just designing shirt merch stuff, I started making sites, a distant relative hired me at a like Fortune 500 company, I hadn’t even gone to college yet, went to school, didn’t learn shit compared to the internship, and then at the end of my college there was like those internships for people on a grade, well my assigned company was dog water and didn’t end up wanting to work with me or the school anymore, so that also made a speed bump in my grades.

If needed a timeline:

2014 started designing and marketing
2015 interned at god tier design software place
2016 started school 
2017   
2019 finished school with caveat / didn’t get degree
2020 quit apple and school 
2021 agency work
2022 agency dissolved 
2023 agency work again
2023 dissolved 
2024 - pending interview for first big time job, but seeking more, this post does not reflect this interview.

so in the mists of this, I’ve worked on some software builds and sells and it’s been paying the bills, but again, sometimes places and people discard my works, I’m at a triple fork crossroads in my resume and in my career/life

1c1y246,How do I stop work from defining me existentially?,"Hey fellow Redditors! This is my first post….. 

TLDR; my (32 F) main client keeps getting my name wrong for >1 year and I’m managed by shaky leadership that are withholding a promised promotion, but I currently have good pay & benefits - need job to continue on IVF journey for my wife & I - but existentially, I don’t know how much longer I can hold on… I’ve tried for other jobs but been dropped several times in final round during interviews. What can I do to make this job more bearable/fulfilling? And/or just define me less? Can’t a job just be a job? 

I work as a middle manger data scientist w/ a handful of direct reports... I’ve worked my way up the corporate ladder a few times since starting at this company over the past 6 years — came in as low level analyst after switching careers later in life. 

At this point in my career, there’s no meaning other than collecting a paycheck to keep my happy life. Being in the financial sector has me feeling like I’m just continuing to line the pockets of already rich people. My old career had a heavy emphasis on working with those that have certain mental illness… so much different types of motives getting me out of bed. My current job’s pay is phenomenal and so are the benefits (esp. when my family depends on these benefits… My wife and I are on our IVF journey thanks to these benefits). Other options open in today’s tech market do not feel like comparable matches and tbh I’m getting more rejections than not… or getting dropped in final round (3x now)… and that also takes its toll. 

Some specifics of my situation— 

My main client I speak to multiple times a day cannot even remember how to spell my name. Multiple reminders do not deter this from being a constant thing from happening. We’re over a year in now. It’s also literally in my email address. The disrespect feels unreal and I’ve never felt so tiny in my life. It’s a little thing but the effects are big. 

My upper management feels shaky, at best. Our new leader (~1.5 years now) is someone who brought me on board to this area of the firm. As a middle manager boss with specific focuses, he was great. As a manager of an organization with 350+ headcount, he’s absolutely not ideal. There’s zero focus on professional development overall. He’s completely inaccessible. There’s no connectedness across our organization. There’s no transparency to what other teams are doing or what we’re supposed to be doing as a larger team. We never get more context to help understand bigger picture of our work. The business we serve are absolutely disconnected across the board. It seems he favors certain parts of the business we serve over others. He has absolutely no line of sight into some of the work going on. Almost seems disinterested or annoyed. It causes friction among his direct leadership team and between senior stakeholders in the business we serve. Trying to keep my many direct reports fulfilled and primed with professional growth and meaningful work is a challenge when I get nothing concrete from upper management. I don’t know if this is just a symptom of moving up the hierarchy myself being exposed to more of the political inner workings or if it’s truly poor leadership. The only reprieve I have is my direct manager is a good source of support through some of this. 

This new leader is also supposed to be the main advocate for a major promotion I’m slated for start of ‘25, but I’m slowly loosing faith in that happening. He’d promised this promotion last year as a counteroffer with a very large immediate raise to deter me from an external offer I was going to take. I got the raise but a year passed, and I did not get the promotion as promised…. and now I’m promised it this year. 

Title means something here — better projects, more transparency, and more respect. I often see on these subs, never take a counter. Maybe those people are right. But, I also see some people saying the grass really isn’t greener on the other side. So not sure where my next step is but wanted to release some noise out of my head and ask how do I just stop this from having so much power over me? Can’t a job just be a job?",FunFollowing5087,1,1.0,0,1712889570,2024-04-12 02:39:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c1y246/how_do_i_stop_work_from_defining_me_existentially/,4,2024
1c1xxmx,Do you think I’m going to get a third interview or job offer?,"Do you think I’m going to get a third interview or job offer?

I am currently looking for a new role. I am in customer service / supply chain support and am currently looking for a sales role (after also applying to a lot of other various roles). I have a BA in Communications and a lot of customer service and supply chain experience.
I am also looking for something remote so I can move to be with my boyfriend who lives on a farm, with no work around. 

I found what I thought was a perfect opportunity. A more entry level sales/account manager role for an ERP software company, totally remote, paying about 10-15k more than I currently make. 

Had interview with recruiter like a month ago. Then dragged my feet a little when responding to the hiring manager as I wasn’t so sure about sales, my mother was telling me salespeople are liars and sleazy, so I was feeling iffy. Scheduling conflicts. Got to meet with the hiring manager finally on Tuesday. Interview went pretty well, there was a poor connection with zoom call though. But he seemed really interested, told me all about the team, the company, talked about setting up one more interview that probably wasn’t necessary with another VP, talked like I was going to work there, said process will be quick. My experience fits very well. I got excited. Probably overshared…. 

But I sent a thank you on Wednesday, still haven’t heard anything back. It’s Thursday night. Job posting expired on indeed like a week or more ago. He said there would be one more short meeting during the interview, and then offer stage, talked about onboarding.

I’m getting nervous! I really want this job now. It’s more customer support than anything.",RealAd1811,1,1.0,0,1712889205,2024-04-12 02:33:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c1xxmx/do_you_think_im_going_to_get_a_third_interview_or/,4,2024
1c1xlw2,Stay with safe job or move and risk moving,"Hey everyone,  
  
I've been pondering a big decision lately and could use some advice. I've been working as an analyst for 10 months now, and while my job offers decent benefits and pays slightly above the average for my city, it's the freedom it provides that I truly value. I work remotely, putting in about 3-5 hours a week to meet our goals, leaving me ample time to explore new hobbies, travel, and simply enjoy life.  
  
Here's the catch: my family, who lives in Connecticut, is urging me to join them. It's an appealing prospect to live with them, especially since most of my friends have moved away for jobs or are starting families. My family members have great incomes and have settled into promising careers.  
  
On one hand, I'm tempted by the idea of being closer to family and possibly pursuing further education with the flexibility my current job provides. On the other hand, I worry about leaving a role I genuinely enjoy. I fear that finding another job like mine might not be easy and that I could end up settling for something I'm not passionate about.  
  
So, here's my dilemma: Would it be wise to leave my current job? Despite the lower pay, I genuinely love everything about it, and the freedom it affords me is invaluable. I've even started exploring new opportunities through interviews and applications, but so far, it's been a string of rejections.

Potential problems: I'm physically disabled in ways that limit my ability to stand up for long periods of time, I'm not very physically strong and am hypermobile (i.e. easily injured by trying to do a lot of physically difficult strenuous tasks), I have chronic pain, etc. I also don't do very well in loud environments.

I just. Don't know what fields my skills would be good in where I could actually make a living. So.

1c1xgq3,How do I tell my boss I don't want a promotion?,"This isn't one of those posts where I am being offered a new title and more work with a crap raise.
Just want to make this clear.

Every 6 months my company goes through performance reviews. The last review was last month. I wasn't promoted, but got a cost of living raise, which I was expecting. There weren't any real conversations around promotion. So I had no expectations.

However, my boss is now talking in our 1 to 1s about me being promoted in the mid year performance review. Just from the conversations, I feel like I'm being promoted because I am the only one that can be....

They require a 6 month ""show me you are already doing this role"" performance in order to promote. 

However, I realized yesterday that I'm the last of the old batch of hiring and the new hires (there's four), don't qualify since they just started in the past 2 months.

So, I'm being promoted because there is no one else. I don't want the promotion. It's making the promotion disingenuous and not real. Just a title slap and a decent raise. It sucks out the excitement and the motivation.

Why bother? My salary is fine now and the title won't help all that much on finding other job opportunities. 

I don't know how to tell my boss I don't want it without them thinking I don't care about my job or less ambitious.

1c1xa55,Feeling guilty for being rewarded from a mediocre performance,"I am transferring departments in my company after a horrible 9 month stint in their customer facing department, complete with layoffs, reorgs, toxic energy, and minimal training on a extremely complex product that would leave me finishing calls extremely embarrassed because I could not keep up on a technical level. The last quarter I really dropped the ball on some of my accounts, but some I did very well with (maybe like 25 really good, 5 just ok, 5 ehhhhh). I satisfied not all of my KPI’s but my manager gave me a glowing performance review, and I’m convinced he didn’t check any of my work because he felt bad for all that the company had put me through (maybe I’m projecting but I would be shocked if he checked my work and found it satisfactory). 
I recently applied internally to a more thriving department, killed the interview and got the role, but I have this overwhelming sense of guilt for all the time I slacked off and didn’t help my customers as much as I should. I’m also worried they’ll find this when I move my accounts. 
They’re also dealing with multiple other departures due to the toxic environment so I’m hoping I can skate by but how do I drop the guilt of having a bad quarter.

1c1x2f8,What MBA concentration will open up more job opportunities?,"1. Yes, I know experience is more important. I just know once I stop school, I am not going back lol. 
2. I will complete my 1st masters in December 2024 in Human Resource Development. Please don’t say it’s worthless or why get a second one. I promise you, I thought about it and I just need help with the second. 
Also: Paying for additional school  isn’t a problem because I know most people will go to that first lol. 

I am wanting to pursue a MBA, and that’s what I know for sure. HOWEVER, I am unsure about the concentration to go into.  I live in small town in Oklahoma that’s about an hour and 30 minutes from DFW in Texas and OKC. I am wanting options to ensure I have multiple opportunities to be successful. The job market from what I’ve seen locally have been:

1. Operations manager in a warehouse
2. Procurement
3. Project manager 
4. Safety manager 

My options for the MBA  concentrations are:
1. Supply chain management 
2. Financial planning and analysis 
3. Business analytics 


My first thought was the financial planning and analysis because each of those positions besides safety manager will deal with finances. But I was not sure how in depth. I’m still young, and I know a MBA is what I want to do, so please don’t be negative 🥲 just trying to secure a future for myself and future family.

1c1wdzs,Career question: Advice ,"
I have been working at a company for 3 months now. 
I just had my probation review done and my boss is quite happy to have me work for them. I have brought new ideas and done good projects and the team is happy with me. 
I have an opportunity to get a management position at another company. I just read the job description and I have a good chance of getting that job. 

My question is: Do you think it is bad to move onto another position this fast? 
The industry is small and everyone knows each other but I just do not want to let this opportunity go. 

At the same time I am also afraid if I do not get the job and my boss ends of finding out I applied to that other company. But, I also think I do have a good chance of getting the job because it is in a smaller town and I am willing to relocate there.

 My current job is a bit of a commute and the other new job would be a better commute for me.

Dealing with kids is tedious, annoying, unfulfilling, I’m really not that good at it (I really wanted to be at first 🙃), and I’ve generally grown apathetic towards it. At this point I think it’d be best to do something else but the fact that the job is seasonal is making me think I should just stick it out these last 2-ish months.

I feel like I’ve signed up during the second half of the school year so it’s expected that I finish it? Like if I quit now (by the end of this month since that’s about how long it would take to find a replacement job) would they have time to find a replacement? Probably not this late in the game?

1c1vnbe,"Got referred to friend’s company, but got another offer after I signed with them","
Back in the end of February, my current job (Job 1) was going through massive layoffs and outsourcing. I had been with them for four years because the PTO and benefits were pretty outstanding (however the pay not as much - with my differential I was sitting at around $18.60 an hour) and it’s been WFH. It was never something I got a degree for but it was pretty laid back and I didn’t have anyone breathing down my neck. 

One of my closest friends is a computer programmer and she forwarded me a job with her company (Job 2) and said that if the job looks like something I’d like to do, i should go for it. The job title itself was very meh to me (customer support) but it paid more ($21.75) and is WFH. Benefits were still good I guess but it was three weeks of PTO (Job 1 has three weeks vacation and 13 days of regular PTO) so that’s where I was taking the bigger hit. I applied anyway and told my friend about it and (I didn’t ask her to do this) she emailed her HR and said her friend applied. 

I got an interview, waited around 2 and a half weeks, then they told me they wanted to hire me. It took a while for the background check and references to clear, but they officially offered me the position at the end of March and I took it. At this point I had no other interviews going on and I was happy to take something that paid more money and still WFH even though I wasn’t particularly jazzed about the position. 

After that time, I told my friend I got the position and she congratulated me - then went on to tell me how the hiring manager was between myself and another referral and was having a hard time choosing between us - she  kept checking with my friend that I wouldn’t just up and leave the company. The reason for this was because the last two people they hired for the same position ended up bouncing pretty quickly after they were hired - both saying that they had found a job that paid better/found a job they wanted more. My friend assured the hiring manager that I wouldn’t do that. I didn’t know any of this beforehand and really didn’t want my friend in the hiring process. 

My issues started when all of a sudden a week ago (After I signed the offer letter for Job 2 and put my two weeks in Job 1) another job I had applied to at the end of February (and didn’t hear from for over a whole month) got in touch with me and they were interested in interviewing me. This job (Job 3) is actually a job that I have a degree for (graphic design). I was encouraged by family members and my partner to schedule an interview for it anyway. I wasn’t comfortable at all at the prospect of interviewing elsewhere, especially because of what my friend had told me, but I decided to give it a shot. Maybe I wouldn’t like it or most likely I wouldn’t get the position.

Turns out after my first interview, they seemed to like me so much they wanted to schedule a second interview within the hour after I left. We scheduled an interview for yesterday and they offered me the position (unofficially) right after the second interview. Job 3 pays $24 an hour, has all the same benefits and offers 4 vacation weeks and 17 PTO/personal days (I was surprised that was even better than Job 1) The only hiccup is that the first month I’d have to try an hour there and an hour back every day for training. After that I’d be working from home four days a week with one day in office. 

So while Job 3 is checking my references, I’ve gotten a lot of anxiety over ditching out on Job 2 at the last minute. I’m supposed to start Monday. I told my friend about this job and she seems….miffed or maybe angry at me. She said I should at least tell Job 2 before I start the job so they don’t waste money or time on me. Which I completely understand. 

I don’t really know what to do and I’m a little upset by my friend’s reaction at me mulling over Job 3 - I know it came out of left field but i’m just trying to figure out all options before going with something. I definitely never intended for this to happen at all - Job 2 still seems like a good position at a good company. I’ve been having a difficult time trying to figure out which to choose by tomorrow. 

Job 2 is stable and pays well enough and wfh.

Job 3 is considered a civil service job. I have a degree for it (I’ve been in many jobs that aren’t in my degree because I freelance/contract often) and the benefits/pay are better - it’s a lot of driving for a month until after I’m done training. They have offered to train me on how to do new things I’m not as familiar with too (web development) 

I’m looking for advice on how to best navigate this? 

Honestly I feel like it was a mistake even going for a job with the same company as a friend. It’s very uncomfortable for me that my friend had to reassure the hiring manager that I wasn’t the type to leave out of nowhere like the other hires - I didn’t really want her to have a part in the hiring process or have the hiring manager’s decision be swayed by her. But I guess here we are.

I have a passion for the stock market and investing and I thought about moving into financial advising, After going to a couple interviews with different companies I got the initial offer of around 24k salary + commission. I thought about it and I don't really think I have the family + friends background to be pedaling these products too. Some of these financial advising companies seem like MLM's

&#x200B;

As for my background I have a 4 yr degree in Strategic Communications and an Associates in Business Administration. I'm applying to more PR jobs now but my family really wants me to stay in banking. 

&#x200B;

My area does not have many PR positions however and I've thought about relocating from my small town but I really just want a better gig. Any advice? Demographic wise I am 24 and still living with my parents.

1c1ua7a,This is nuts but can i ask for my job back after being fired??,"Hello all- sorry for the length

I am a young therapist - finished my masters a year ago and was working at an addictions recovery center for five months - the place hadn’t even been open a full year yet so there was a lot of organizational issues in management - laying down procedures and rules and then re-writing them every couple of weeks as well as lots of people quitting and being fired- it was chaos but i weirdly enjoyed being a part of the journey and knew things would settle eventually

i honestly loved the work i was doing so much despite the lack of stability in the workplace

During my time there I was a great employee- worked extra hours - came in on my days off and took on double the caseload during staff changes- i’ve received thank you cards and notes from patients and even still get happy updates from patients who are now home and living their life in recovery- two of the owners of the program praised me on my work - my 90 day review was all positive 

On the other hand- because of the disorganization and chaos i would periodically speak up in meetings and to my supervisor - some things didn’t make sense and being new to the field i truly had no idea how screwy the healthcare system was (especially working with that population)- it was like i finally got to see how they make the hot dogs and it was disgusting lol

Anyways- new to the field fresh from the books i was struggling to balance my ethical duty to my patients with working in a system that didn’t really allow for that so i started to burnout- i spoke to my clinical supervisor and HR -they were semi-understanding and were kind of offering time off for me but i admittedly was past that point and after having a couple of rough days ultimately wrote a termination letter that was effective immediately - i explained in the letter that it was for personal reasons yada yada (in hindsight i think mentioning mental health was a big mistake). so i left cordially - the program director said “take all the time you need” - “we would like for you to come back whether it be in two weeks, two months, or two years” and i gathered my stuff and left (they didn’t allow me to properly terminate with my patients which is a whole other thing but whatever)

two weeks after i left i decided to go back and staff was grateful for me to return - two weeks after that my clinical supervisor called me and told me “i unfortunately have to let you go because you started group therapy late” he said in text that it wasn’t his decision and he was told to fire me— i was baffled- i started group therapy 5 minutes late one day and group rarely started on time no matter the facilitator - i didn’t get any warning - i was fired through the phone - i absolutely did not believe that was the real reason i was let go - i went in and gathered my things again - met with the program director and my clinical supervisor and was sobbing confused - they couldn’t offer me any more information and both agreed that this was not what they wanted.

weeks after that i learned that my supervisor who fired me got fired

this might be absolutely batshit of me but i did love the job and i want to go back - could i go back after all of that? how would i go about this if i decided to put my pride aside and return? 

i realize this is nuts but advice would be much appreciated

1c1tfi2,Great review but no promotion ,"I got a glowing review with high ratings - was told I am diligent, cooperative etc. The only negative feedback was that I need to take more initiative. The thing is, I have, but I feel that because of my quiet introverted personality it often goes unnoticed. When I gave examples, I was told it hasn’t been enough. Then I mentioned that if they have more expectations from me, that should be reflected in the title, and they said I need to show them that I am ready which I haven’t. They ended the review saying “We don’t want you to feel you’re not valued because you are.” But I don’t feel valued. While I am not the loudest in the room, I never say things to fill the air and speak up when I find that I have something valuable to contribute. My coworkers from other departments that I frequently collaborate with were surprised as in their perspective, I am the one running the department.

1c1tek8,Change Great Job for More Money,"Hi everyone! 

I work in tech at a mid sized fintech company and I have a great manager, I love my team, my work and the company culture overall. However, I know that although I get paid a decent salary I could definitely be earning more (close to 1.3-2x) elsewhere, most likely at a larger company. 

I do know for a fact however (from personal experience and the experiences of others I’ve spoken to)  that very few jobs exist with the low level of stress and high level of satisfaction that my job currently offers me and I would most likely be sacrificing much more of my peace of mind and personal time if I were to get another job. 

I do feel stressed about this since I want to prioritize my personal health on one hand but also everything is so insanely expensive now and I don’t see myself owning a house or being able to have a family with my partner anytime soon (we are currently child free and we rent an apartment) if I don’t make more money (I’m 30y old). 

Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advice for this situation? Thank you in advance!

We are in a distribution team and work with local country sales teams to help mark sell his product.
He is a dick. We all know.

However my boss who has a big heart was nice enough to invite him to our Christmas Dinner event. Also to build good relationship with Mark. So yes this happened. 

So today i was working my ass off (actually the whole of this week ) because he again complained to the head of global ceo saying that our team is lousy and useless. Threw us under the bus. This is 3rd time. 

So my boss wanted me to work on something that prove that we actually did something for him. Worked my ass off this week. I always do this every time Mark complains. And it impacts my mental health and i question my work value and role. Why do I have to work for him if he is always complaining???

People who sit with me know my pain. They cautiously told me today (because I was struggling alot)  that during Christmas event mark told them that our team is useless. We were at that event just sitting on a diff table. He told them (and they were junior people who are 20 yrs younger than him) that my team is useless don't you agree.

I'm not sure how I can continue work for or with him at this stage. 

Also do I tell my boss about this?

1c1rvgq,Cannot choose between 2 jobs- PLEASE HELP!,"So I am in a fix and I need a third person's advice on this. 

I got a job offer and I joined a few weeks ago. It's a pretty well reputed organization. It pays well and has good benefits. However, I would have to relocate to a different city for it, as a result, most of my salary would go towards paying for rent, utilities and food. So, I wouldn't have a lot of money left to save or for my other expenses. 

Now, I might get another job offer. I'm not sure of it yet. However, the second job is remote so I'll be able to save most of my salary. However, it pays lesser than my current job and the organisation is not very reputed (in my country at least). The second organization is also in a different sector. 

In terms of the job in itself, I like both, however, I prefer the first job a bit more because it goes well with things that I believe I can do well and gels well with my skills and comfort zone. The second job is also suitable, but it might push me towards working in more unchartered zones that I might not be good at or interested in career wise. 

Now, in my personal life, my girlfriend works remotely, however she might have to move to the city where her company is based out of. It's not immediate, but there's a significant possibility of this happening. She is also looking for other jobs for which she might have to shift to other cities, which are different from the city I might have to shift to for my current job. All in all, the chances of us staying together in the long term (if I stay in my current job) are pretty low. She has agreed to move with me to the city where I would go to, but she won't be able to stay there with me for long. I have assured her that if she has to move, I'll look for jobs in her city so that we can be together. I love her very much, and I want to do what's best for us, as I want to marry this girl one day. 

Now, if I get the second job, and I choose to go ahead with it, I would work remotely and this relocation and long distance problem would be solved completely. However, I don't know if I would actually fit into the organization or the job well. Of course, it might be the case that I am overthinking this whole thing and I might actually enjoy the work. I am just scared of getting out there and getting out of my comfort zone. Also, I am apprehensive that if I resign, my manager would be bitchy towards me (of course, I shouldn't care about that, but I'm a pussy), and people will think lesser of me for leaving a reputed company to work for a less reputed one. 

I think I should clarify that this is my first real job after graduating so I am new to all of this. Also, another clarification, my girlfriend and I have done long distance before, albeit for a few months, and it was hell for us. We absolutely do not want that, if it's in our control. 

It would be great if I could get some advice for this. I do not have a lot of friends, and I don't know whom to turn to for advice. Thanks in advance.

1c1r94i,Sideways move into another team provides job security but will impact mental health ,"Im currently a year into a 2 year contracted temporary promotion (includes a pay rise) that ends April 2025. I’ve spoken with my teams leader and she said she isn’t sure if funding to continue the teams work will be agreed and doesn’t know if my promotion will be made permanent. She does know it definitely won’t happen during the agreed contract.

Another team I’ve been supporting has a permanent level role available and is offering it to me on Monday with no interview process. This teams work is incredibly interesting and will support my career growth. However, supporting this team has been the most stressful part of the past year as the leadership in the team is trash. They aren’t there when it gets tough and leans on super lower colleagues to make decisions. 

Getting the perm role in their team means I’m not at risk of dropping back down a level and pay in 12 months. But I’m concerned about my mental health and the impact it might have on it. I cried a couple of times when helping. 

Part of the department is also going through a restructuring luckily I’m not affected. Those who do have to reapply for same level jobs as they originally are people on temporary promotions have to go for jobs on their actual level and not the promotion level. As I’m technically a grade O I therefore wouldn’t be able to go for a HO role. I say this as it’s a concern if they restructure again and it hits my area, I’d have to go for a lower paying role. 

I’m wanting to leave this company soon anyway as I find it stifling and boring. Been doing it for 4 years and I’m ready for a change. 

Any thoughts are welcome. I’m contemplating and not sure on what I want to do yet. ",Adorallazon,1,1.0,0,1712871788,2024-04-11 21:43:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c1r94i/sideways_move_into_another_team_provides_job/,4,2024
1c1r5b7,Advice On Pivoting Into a New Career....and Quickly,"I am currently unemployed, and have been for the last two years. While I have do have some savings, and have done some gig work (UberEats) since, that has proven to be very unsustainable.  I really need to go back to full time work, immediately.  That said, I feel I have quite a few strikes against me: I'm 52 years old & live on my own without a stable support network. Most  (but not all) of my professional experience has been in customer service, or in a car dealership (again, customer service).  The thought of ever setting foot in a car dealership again as an employee gives me extreme anxiety, to say the least.  I need to do something else.  To compound things, I currently live in a very HCOL area.

I  need to get very creative with my job search, and need to brainstorm ideas/options for jobs that I should be qualified to do and would currently be hirable for.  In addition to my customer service background, some of the other jobs I have had, and interests include:

&#x200B;

* Delivery operations coordinator for a tech company; less than a year (contract role)
* Receptionist for the same tech company; less than a year (again, contract role)
* Intern in a commercial recording studio that did mostly audio for video post-production (projects the studio worked on were mostly advertisements, tv/film, and video games)
* I do have an interest in audio production, and have experience in doing that (mostly on my own, however many years ago I did work for an a/v company that provided support for conferences)
* I'm also a musician, and play several instruments
* I have a (relatively recent) degree in digital media arts; I had exposure to video production, graphic design, and video game design. However, most of my curriculum was video related.
* I have a strong interest in aviation. I did complete ground school, however have not gone any further with flight training due to the expense (I will pursue it, however due to the cost, it will have to be a long term goal)

With all of that info, can anyone make some suggestions regarding possible roles I could be hirable in, that would pay enough to live?  Thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have.

Note: previously well paid, but currently unemployed, which is clear on my resume, so don’t want to get taken advantage of, but flexible-ISH - as in, willing to take a role if it’s decent pay, but don’t want to price myself out by saying an amount too high because total comp and benefits matter to me, not only the base, plus other variables, like the working environment (WFH, Hybrid)…

Ultimately, most recruiters end up sharing, but I’d like some guidance on what to say when they don’t after a few rounds back and forth to avoid things getting (more) uncomfortable.

1c1nbsr,"2 offers from the same company, next steps? - early career","I have 1.5 years total of internship experience and graduating from undergrad in May and plan to start my CPA studies in July. I've received offers for two positions within the company I am currently interning at:  
  
Sales Analyst (New Graduate Position, 0 years Experience) in the Merchandise Department: Has focuses on analytics and modeling, providing opportunities to develop technical skills while maintaining a connection with the company. No progression related to CPA.  
  
Experienced Financial Analyst (3-5 years + designation or in progress) in the Accounting/Finance Department (my current team): My current manager has offered me this position due to my good performance during my co-op. However, I feel underqualified and worry about managing the workload alongside my CPA studies. We've discussed the transition, and I'm currently the sole analyst on the team. However, my manager is still looking to hire a Senior Analyst and another experienced FA. The workload will be heavy and I haven't mentioned my goal of studying for my CPA yet.  
  
I'm inclined towards the Sales Analyst role as it offers transferable skills and a less demanding schedule, allowing me to focus on my CPA. However, I don't want to burn bridges with my current department, as I do hope to transition back to accounting/finance in the future (which has been done by other Managers/VPs I have spoken to).  
  
**Questions:**  
Salary will also be a crucial consideration, what are the thoughts if pay are in the same range (+-$5K)?  
  
Any advice from those who have balanced full-time work with postgraduate studies?  
  
Also, how can I ensure I don't burn bridges with either department, as I want to keep both options open for the future?

1c1m8yp,More success on job hunting sites,"Background: 26 in the midwest with a BA in Sociology with an emphasis in Cultural Anthropology; minors in Spanish, Criminal justice & criminology, and psychology. I have spent 5+ years in the nonprofit world working with survivors of assault and human trafficking, but I left that sector behind a couple of months ago due to burnout and lack of benefits with there being no room for salary increases or promotions. I worked in food service/retail from age 15 to 23 before I got my first career job (the one I just left). Before that job when I was in my later years of college, I did spend a couple of years as an intern with a state human trafficking agency. In my jobs, I have been anywhere from food prep and cashier/barista/bartender to tour guide and trainings, to managing/supervising/ordering to educating preK-12 all the way to grown professionals, to designing/marketing, and more. I've worn many hats and it's both helpful and stressful. I'm young which is very helpful but also that means my experience isn't as extensive as I know some jobs would prefer.

My Question: I want to get away from the nonprofit world. I need a job that pays better with health benefits that doesn't feel heavy. I have lots of skills that can be applied in many ways but I'm having a hard time pinpointing what career paths I would be a good fit for especially on the job search websites I've been on. I'm not sure what keywords to type in to find the jobs/careers I would enjoy but that I would also be qualified for with my education and experience. I don't mind training programs or licensing programs but I do not want to go back for a master's unless it's absolutely necessary. I also have dyscalculia so I do have to keep that in mind when looking at careers with math-heavy aspects. I worked in food service and managed money/banking for numerous cafes so I don't struggle with math or numbers in my day to day, but more abstract math concepts are sometimes difficult for me. I have also tried contacting local staffing agencies but I have not heard back from those places, so I want to optimize my search terms/keywords/careers so I can find something longterm. Any suggestions on what terms to use or industries to look into would be helpful!

1c1luf1,Concerned with a WFH offer,"  
I recently received a job offer from a company for a data entry position. This will be my first fully WFH job and so far the experience has been strange, but I wouldn't say off putting.  I wanted to share some experiences to see how common they are.

* I haven't communicated with anyone over phone or voice chat, everything has been handled over text, email, and skype (not voice call). Is this normal? I feel like I should've communicated more directly with someone by now.
* I was originally told the position would be 20+ hours, which was preferable for me since I'm working another job and want the flexibility, however after the interview it was explained the position would be 30 hours a week. I thought it would be no more than 30, but it turns out they want 30. I can probably work around this, but it took me by surprise.
* I found out that I was scheduled for a training on Saturday. This isn't terrible, but I was originally planning on helping a friend move on that day. We rescheduled to move stuff the day after, but both of us felt that more warning should've been given ahead of time. Is this sort of thing normal?
* Recently they sent an e-check to deposit money into my bank account to use to buy office equipment from their vendor. I can be a little paranoid and requested they sent a normal check, but after discussing it would be several days for it to arrive and I would be asked to front the money myself then reimbursed via the check, I agreed to the e-check. However, it's pending now and will be several days before it clears, so I'm being asked to front the money for some of the equipment anyway. It's not a ton, and I could do it, but it still feels a bit off...

I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm being scammed, but it does feel unusual to me. Like I said, I can be a bit paranoid so I'm wondering if this is normal and I'm just overreacting? I thought I'd swing by here and see what insights you all could share.

1c1lkrj,Feels unwanted and out of place ,"23M here. Recently got a position for a company. For reference, I worked 3 years in retail during my college, and took a gap year and a half during my last semesters. 
This position first rejected me, saying they will go through with more suited candidates but thank you blah blah. Two weeks later, I was offered an offer letter if I was still looking for a position and like a desperate idiot, i took it.

 Now being here for three weeks, I don’t feel welcome here. The environment seems lowkey racist toward my kind. I sit alone for some reason (seems like an excuse to isolate me) so I have no real chance to socialize. They seem like they’re not very interested into putting a lot of effort into training me like they were supposed to. I have learnt everything myself and have been doing pretty well so far in terms of efficiency and speed.
 But it is not recognized by anyone, and I kind of feel like since I was a last minute hire, they’re not expecting much out of me and will fire me any moment regardless of my performance.
I kind of need the experience because it is relative to my field of study but this experience has been pretty miserable lately and is very boring work, with 0 communication in a corporate office setting.

I know others in my same position/with similar experience applied, and then I found out today that a senior manager applied (we're all senior associates).

I’ve been working in marketing for about 5 years now. It’s definitely not for me but I’ve felt stuck due to multiple promotions and raises during this time. I currently make almost $70k a year in a fairly easy WFH position. 

However, I hate corporate. I hate the ego that a lot of marketers have. I don’t feel like I make a difference in peoples life or that I do useful work. 

I’ve had multiple ideas for a career change but I’m scared to lose my decent salary. I would like something outside of a 8-5 with more flexibility. I would enjoy something more physical rather than a desk job. I’ve thought about:

Yoga instructor

Car detailing (eventually doing this from home would be ideal)

Massage therapy (again, could do from home if I had the space, love the holistic wellness side of this)

Sonography (always loved anatomy and healthcare, helping people)

Landscaping (love gardening and getting my hands dirty, love learning about plants and trees)

Ideally, I would like to not have to go back for another degree but I am open to a certification or associates degree. I’ve always gravitated towards healthcare and wellness, I’m fascinated by anatomy and physiology hence massage therapy and sonography.

I have been working in my current role in business intelligence for 3.5 years and got accepted in to a computer science program starting Fall. My current role is not super technical and I want to transition to a more computer sciency role. I am not just talking about coding as I understand there is more to computer science than that. I really feel that this is the right next step for me but I am afraid of quitting my job and I'm interested in the field.

I cannot do this alongside my current job as it is very demanding, with overtime and inflexible working conditions. In fact, I doubt they would even give me study leave so I am hesitant to ask. Even internal study programs are not available to me as they know that by doing this, the employee would basically leave.
Also, I am in Canada and the job market is not good right now and has not even for a while. My main fear is that I will have decent work experience and good education but when I finish my program, it would be years before I find a job.

Some other things to consider:
- I can do the program really slowly and do one course per semester but it would take ages to complete and I don't want to drag it on. I also don't want to work alongside as I would like to really focus on learning.
- Financially, I will be okay for the duration of the program, given that I am able to find something relatively quickly after graduating.
- In my current role, I worked my way up and got raises due to performance. I understand that somewhere else I would have to start from scratch but that's okay as long as the work is more meaningful and of course salary not less than what I'm making now. My current role is also task based and not project based so it's literally the same thing month after month with some interesting and hoc things I can work on but I never have enough time for that. In short, I need a new challenge and see no more growth in this role. In not learning new things anymore and I never have time to work on the interesting work projects that I create for myself.
- I have been applying for jobs since 2022( albeit not seriously) but have only got 2 screening interviews! This does not reassure me to leave my job to study. 
- I already have education in business analytics and when I was fresh graduate during covid with much less work experience, I was getting more call backs. This doesn't make sense to me...

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ",Stunning_Sound_3850,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1712852806,2024-04-11 16:26:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c1jdx1/should_i_quit_my_job_to_go_back_to_school/,4,2024
1c1j7a5,Am I being underpaid?,"Hi Reddit, 

   I feel like i'm being underpaid & overworked (story of my life), but can't tell if I'm expecting too much. I was hired on at a company that hadn't officially opened at $16/hr, no benefits, without a proper title other than ""Assistant/CFO"" in November of 2022. Let me preface this by saying, I have no college education & I only have a GED. I was told I would wear multiple hats, but I think I was underestimating the work that needed to be done. When I was hired, my boss told me that the business is too much for 1 person to handle. That he was drowning trying to keep everything in line & needed someone to help with everything. 

I've now been here over a year & feel like **i'm** drowning in work. I was given a $2 raise at the 1 year mark which I appreciate, but for what i'm doing, I feel like i'm being significantly underpaid at $18/hr. I am the purchasing manager, shipping manager, AP, AR, QC person, customer service, & everything in between. I am still the **only** employee. We are a company that sells parts & rebuilds/creates packaging machines for the likes of Frito Lay, Dole, Hersheys, ect. Not all of our customers are huge names, but we do have big ones. I feel like although i'm in charge of everything & the pay would be fine if that was the case, my boss micromanages things & doesn't trust me on simple things because i'm always getting double checked.  On top of that, he sees me **struggling** to keep up with things & instead of helping, adds to my list of things to do. I feel like I had the rug pulled from under me. I was under the impression we'd both be tackling all these things, but all my boss does is sales. 

For example, i'm currently having to purchase parts for stock as well as an ever changing parts lists of things for us to complete a project of rebuilding a machine, ship everything to customers, receive everything that we ordered, keep it organized & keep track of it, send out invoices, pay everything, & he'll forward me messages asking me to send invoices to customers that are already in our system that he could easily just send himself. I feel like because of my unofficial ""assistant"" title, I just have to do everything he asks, no matter how insignificant it is. 

I just feel like too much is being expected of me, & what I really struggle with is AP/AR. I have no finance background. I've **never** dealt with finances anywhere i've worked. But i'm being left in charge to pay all invoices, make sure we are being paid, prepare paperwork for taxes to save money on an accountant, ect. on top of all the other things I need to do. I feel like if I had any education all of these things would be significantly easier & I wouldn't feel like i'm being stretched so thin. But I don't, i'm struggling. Am I dealing w/normal startup company things & should I look for another job/ask to hire someone/ask for more pay, or is my lack of knowledge about how a company like this should operate being taken advantage of?

For context, I have been working in some form of customer service ever since I was 15, I've been a barista/fast food worker and even an IT customer service representative. After working in multiple random customers service jobs, I decided that I would like to get licensed in some sort of field to get higher pay. I started working for a local insurance agency who helped me obtain my property and casualty license and I worked as a insurance customer service rep for about 7 months. I ended up leaving this job without putting in my two weeks due to the owner sexually harrassing me and the women in the office. The HR dept was unhelpful and I had begin to have anxiety attacks and heart issues due to the stress of working with the owner. I found another job working for a company called TTEC  (working from home) for their USAA insurance project. This job has been a nightmare due to the strict script we have to stick to, the metrics that are required to be met, and the lack of help from upper management. There were even points to where some of us are getting written up for using the bathroom past 2 minutes. I love working from home but I don't think I can take any more of these customer service jobs, it is very draining to be verbally abused by customers every day.

Just looking for a quick spot of advice here. 

I applied for an internal transfer that was open, but the job posting was taken down a couple hours after I applied. I assume this means that they either filled the position and forgot to close the app, or I was just the very last person they wanted in their pool for review. I’m feeling like it’s rather unlikely that it’s the second case based on the timing, so I’m wondering if it’s worth it to wait a week and then reach out to the hiring manager to inquire about the status of the position. 

I’m *extremely* qualified based on the job description and the work they do is incredibly interesting, so I don’t want to let this chance slip through my fingers through inaction!

1c1bqov,How to handle making a massive F***up at work as a junior ,"I am a junior (8 months experience) and have spent most of my time doing field based surveying. I work for a tiny company, only 4 of us (my boss, and then three juniors). 

Because of a recent injury, I've spent the last two months solely in the office, trying to get my head around how to both do administration tasks and data entry/analysis, reports etc. 

I was given a project that my boss had taken on which was also collaborating with several outside parties. One of my tasks was to organise this humongous data set and then send it off to be interpreted and then analyise the results. I spent forever organising the data (talking thousands of files, into different locations, sites, deployment dates, recording devices, recording nights etc). I made a checklist as I went because I was really scared to make mistakes because there is so much data. I double-checked everything, boss said to send it off to the third party which I did.

We have the interpretation back now and I've started running my analysis (which has also involved learning on the go a lot about cleaning data, organising data and analysis), and after a week of more sorting and analysing, I've realised that I made a massive mistake and accidentally put some data into the wrong folders before I sent it off for interpretation. This is basically screwed up a large portion of the data. 

My boss is really pissed, He hasn't had much to do with the project himself because he's been so busy with other things, and I've been keeping him up to date with what I've been doing as much as I can as I go along. I feel like he trusted me to get this done and now that I've screwed up it's going to take so long to fix (I don't even know how to fix it at the moment). My boss sent a long email explaining the f*** up and then ended with "" it shouldn't take a week to sort the data and find this out"". I tried to explain how I try to be as careful as possible as I went along, and how how it might be taking me a bit longer because I've never dealt with a data set this big or complex before, but he basically ignored that and kept reiterating how I f***** up.

I'm really trying not to be too hard on myself, because I am still learning, but I always try to do a good job and because I've basically screwed up 2 months worth of work I am beyond stress and I don't know how to handle it. I feel like crying, and I feel like I'm not right for the job that I spent 4 years studying really hard to get.

A bit of background about me. I’m a very tech-savvy guy. I’m naturally good with tech, and it’s a big hobby of mine too. I’ve been tinkering with computers and smartphones since as far back as I can remember. 9 years ago, I failed out of college at 21 due to a lack of discipline and lack of interest in my degree of choice at the time (bachelor of arts in Politics). I’ve recently been given the opportunity to do a degree online via a scholarship, and I have to choose between the following degrees:

- Applied Artificial Intelligence
- Business & IT
- Computer Science
- Cyber Security
- Data Science
- Engineering
- Industrial Engineering & Management
- Robotics
- Software Development

I am trying to decide between Business&IT, CompSci, CyberSecurity, and Software Development. Which one would you guys go for, and why? The idea of working in Cyber Security intrigues me, as it sounds like quite impactful and interesting work,but I realise that this might be a glamourised perception on the job.

In charge  of shipping side  supply chain, sales guys projections for next quarter I help them calculate, work with owner based on projection numbers to see how much we need to buy, I’m the sales contract administrator too, I keep track of QTY fulfilled, left open, etc. , and most importantly: I keep major books for boss man:

Every week I give him that report. Takes into account EVERY. SINGLE. VARIABLE. that can effect price and profit except payroll(what he pays employees), what it costs to operate and own the facilities, and a couple other things. Takes me 8-12 hours on the weekend 

Look I’m grateful. I was in jail 16 months ago. And now I have an office. I’m not saying this out of arrogance, I’m worth way more than what I’m being paid. 

Should I stick it out, demand an insane increase? Or gain the experience for my resume in the above mentioned duties and move on?

1c19r9e,How can I delay accepting one offer while waiting to hear about another without pissing anyone off?,"How can I delay accepting one offer while I’m waiting to hear about another one?

TLDR: Been offered a role at one place in my current role, told them I’d inform them of my decision by early next week. Now have the chance to go through an interview process for an exciting new role (would know the result be the end of next week) but want to be able to accept this original offer if/when it comes to it. 

So recently I got laid off. All good. I don’t LOVE my current profession so when applying for new jobs I sent out applications to a bunch of companies in this industry as well as some random ones that would be quite a change up.

I’ve had an interview at a company which would be the same role that I’ve just been laid off from and they have basically verbally offered me a job. I told them I’d let them know by the end of this week or early next week at the latest. I was about to reach out to them today when I got a call from one of the random places. I could be asked to progress through an interview process next week and they would offer the successful candidate the job by weeks end. This sounds like a pretty cool opportunity and I wouldn’t even have to take a pay cut (which I was expecting if I were to switch roles completely) so I want to see what it’s about.

How can I buy myself more time with the original offer to go through this new interview process and try my luck, without making the original place feel like second best? I don’t want to piss them off because there’s still a really high chance I want to accept this original job after all, but I want to see where this new one goes.",PickledHotChocolate,2,1.0,7,1712823281,2024-04-11 08:14:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c19r9e/how_can_i_delay_accepting_one_offer_while_waiting/,4,2024
1c183fh,"Moved into a new job, but missing my old one.","M in the UK. I have a first class Marketing degree and 5 years of transactional finance experience (Banking/Treasury).  
  
After being in my last Treasury job for 3.5 years, I finally left into my first Assistant Management Accountant job. The main reason why I left is because in the past 1 year, a horrible new colleague and manager joined my team. My colleague found every possible way to mess everything on the system up for 8 straight months, every single day. I found myself fixing everything not only for them, but also for the various finance department (as I was the only one who knew how to sort specific things). The problem is my new manager was also very unsupportive and refused to help or step in to help with the problematic colleague.  
  
I had no pay rise for my whole stay at the company, despite always going above and beyond and being respected by a lot of people within the business. In the end, I was feeling miserable and decided to look elsewhere. I applied for 2 jobs (another Banking job and the AMA job) and to my shock, I got an offer for both of them, within the span of 10 mins. I went with the AMA job as it's the natural way for me to progress from Treasury and learn new things. The recruiter said that interview the business had with me (2 stages) was the best one they've had in years. I couldn't believe it as I was feeling very downgraded in my old job and was also doubting my self-worth.  
  
The thing is, the new job has a lot of Excel and some things are very difficult to me. I've been a month in and still learning, but can also do a lot of small things on my own without messing up. But the difficult Excel stuff worries me. I feel like I oversold myself on the interview and now have quite a huge upskill to do at the new job. They use a different accounting system and a lot of processes are not as simplified as they were in my previous position.  
  
I heavily miss my old company as I knew the people the system and what I was doing. It was also very easy compared to the new job (I only used Excel for 1 report during the month and that was it). At the same time, it had become a very toxic environment and I was feeling miserable every day. I realise I wasn't really learning anything or developing myself. I was spending more time to fix people's mistakes than doing my day-to-day tasks or finding new ways to automate/push forward things.  
  
I am very afraid of getting fired from the AMA job if they don't like me or if I don't get the hang of the Excel stuff and not sure if it was the right choice. I don't know anyone within the business either. At the same time however, my new team is much more supportive and nicer and I can see I can get the help I need to push myself forward. The new role is also a tremendous jump in experience due to the varied nature of things I am doing.  
  
Me and my partner are now on the mortgage ladder and I have to make sure we have financial stability. Because of that, I've made sure to save money for nearly 3 years ahead, as I am very worried what will happen if I don't pass my probation and have to look for another job.  
  
My partner says I will find something easy if it comes to that (she used the recent 2 offers as an example) due to my degree, experience and also the upskill in my new job, but I am always worried and overthinking things. What if I am left unemployed? Everywhere I read, people are saying the UK job market is really bad.  
  
Did I make the right move moving from my previous job or was it a risk that I shouldn't have taken? I basically left security and comfort because of a toxic team and jumped into the unknown.

1c17zhf,Dealing with career uncertainty in a creative background ,"Being around most of my friends who are geared towards medicine, finance, or engineering careers, I’ve always felt a bit “career insecure” as it feels like the path of comms/creative backgrounds is less structured and a little all over the place.

I’m 22 and have just been offered a role at a major record label doing marketing. Coming from a role in advertising, I’m excited to take it on but in the back of my head do have that feeling of “what’s next?” or “will this be the right fit?”

It’s unfair to generalize and say that most creative fields/pathways are more complex. Like the rest of us, we all go through varied changes in our career across the board. But I do think that on a financial scale at least, it takes more effort to find sustainable jobs as careers in medicine, finance, and engineering are overall more valued (which in many ways, I completely understand why because they are essential to our society).

I guess my point is that the pathway for me has been a bit awkward. I’m only about a year out of university now so I know there’s time to explore my options, but still sometimes feel uncertain for salary, longevity, and practical reasons.

1c178fo,I need some urgent opinion on making a decision on my student life,"Hello guys. I am a guy (17M) from India. I am preparing to give an exam called the IIT JEE. Now I have earned some medals in olympiads in the past as a result, I got invited to study at the coaching hub of the country KOTA in class 11. 

Now from class 9 onwards, my life has pretty much been derailed. I was completely ignored by my parents and have heard nothing but insults from them. My father is one of those quiet submissive guys but my mother is a completely selfish toxic bitch. They use to fill my head with regrets and dark thoughts like what if they died (still alive and well tho), kicked me in the face and beat me and I had no other friends (most were put off by my introvert attitude and others jealous from my intellect). As a result of losing my oldest and best friend and the constant toxicity from my parents along with being stuck forcibly at home with them due to COVID 19, I developed a severe gaming addiction.

It was very hard to get over and I moved over to Kota where I wanted to continue my studies in class XI. But I had so much trouble just catching up to the study, I was damn near broken at the time but the teachers and management were absolutely brutal. They threatened repercussions and penalties, and struggling through absolute depression I made my year through class XI tho I skipped more than half the topics and classes. But now I think I have caught up to their speed after so much effort and was feeling better but then I came back on vacation to my home. Now apparently my mother wants me to stay and continue my studies at my hometown coz they have ""run out of money"" and my dad's retirement is in a year. That stupid bitch apparently made my dad purchase an appartment when I needed the money to study after graduation and the coaching institute isn't helping any too. They don't wanna provide facilities like hostel anymore despite my good scores in test and are also suggesting me to stay in hometown since my mom talked to them.

But apparently I have to make a decision to study here or at KOTA and personally it's not like I like KOTA so much as much as it is that I absolutely hate it here. But KOTA imo has the better teachers who despite their arrogance are actually capable of covering everything and judging by their course plan, I don't think the local Allen institute can even cover all of the syllabus in time for the exam. I really don't think I can keep the study mindset in my hometown coz of depression.

So help me make a decision and pick a poison.",Professional_Sir6370,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1712813552,2024-04-11 05:32:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c178fo/i_need_some_urgent_opinion_on_making_a_decision/,4,2024

1c1710n,Marketer of 5 years but unsure of which bachelors degree to get ,"Hi! I’ve been working in marketing for 4-5 years now mostly for small companies since I don’t have a degree. Marketing in general is oversaturated and is a victim of having 7 roles lumped into 1. My brain is absolutely fried and I can’t continue working at small businesses wearing several hats for less than $20 an hour. 

I feel that I need a degree to make it anywhere. I’ve had probably 200 interviews over the past couple years and most of my feedback was that I didn’t have a degree. (Which is so annoying because with my work experience it’s just a piece of paper at this point that says I know how to follow instructions *eye roll*) 

So, I’d like to get a degree… but maybe not in client facing marketing. 

I’m considering a BS in data analytics, a BS in Human Resources or a BS in business management. (All of which I have work experience in) 

I’m open to other fields, preferably something kind of similar to my work experience so that my work experience doesn’t go to waste. I also need work from home because I use a wheelchair and it’s hard to get to work by myself. 

Thanks!

1c16q7c,Keep current position or take new job/promotion?," I am about 8 months into my first sales job, working as a sales development rep. My day to day is pretty flexible, and I can work from home or from the office. I'm still getting comfortable with our solution and how to pitch it to customers, but I've been doing fairly well. I don't mind the daily grind of cold calling and emailing. Recently marketing has been letting the SDRs handle inbound as well. This mean I can continue to do my normal outbound prospecting and hitting my KPIs while getting almost 50%+ of my booked meetings from easy inbound slam dunks. I have essentially no stress and can often work shorter days. I'm enjoying my day to day, have good rapport with my co workers, like the company culture, and have a good work life balance. 

Recently on of our AE's got laid off for a rough couple months. I was offered to fill his position, which is in a decent territory but not a great one. I like sales but am not sure if I want to be in a closer role. I enjoy booking meetings since I don't have to handle any of the post discovery call problems - nurturing the deal, using the CRM to move the deal through the pipeline, collaborating with sales support and operations daily, closing, etc. I know SDR to AE is the typical path and it would probably look bad if I declined. I just worry about my job security in the new position, and worry I may not be ready for the increased responsibilities, stress, and hours. 

Pros of current position - I enjoy my work, I enjoy my day to day, I am hitting quota,i am getting pretty good commission, no stress, good work life balance, 

Cons: nothing really other than it being a relatively low position in the company. 

Pros of AE role: higher base, potential for higher commission after ramp up, better/higher status position in the company 

Cons of AE: less job security, increased stress, increased work hours, feel slightly unprepared/not ready, worse work life balance, more time working in office compared to WFH.

I feel like declining would look bad on my part but on the other side of things I absolutely love my current role, make good enough money, and have a great work life balance with minimal stress. Ideally I would want to move into an AE role in 3-4 months when I feel more prepared, or try something like SDR manager for a more managerial/operations type position.

He depends on me and another coworker heavily, and I'm leaving at a bad time because that coworker is going on extended leave about the same week. I didn't plan on this, but the timing just worked out that way. My current company uses the services of my new company, and a former coworker who left on unfavorable terms is working there now and referred me to the position.

I think my boss will take my resignation personally (I saw this years ago when another coworker he liked a lot quit and didn't say where he was going). I'm worried if I don't tell him my new company, he'll hold a grudge and think I don't trust him. I don't want to burn this bridge in case I need him for a reference.

If it sounds like I don't have something lined up, it seems cruel of me to leave at a bad time and he may ask me to stay longer.

This feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity and is difficult to pass up.

On the other hand, given my family situation I am concerned about providing for my wife and kids.  We don’t have financial concerns at the moment but long term I need a good, stable job. Pretty much no PhD is a great decision from a financial perspective. 

I have also been accepted to an electrical apprenticeship with the union. I will likely be hired for a job in the next few weeks. This seems like the wise choice financially and will also provide stability for my family. I don’t think I would mind the work either. 

Ultimately I hope to be a pastor in the long run, but that is years down the line most likely. In the meantime, do you have any thoughts on which is the wiser course?

Now after the test I emailed the HR women and she said if successful the hiring manager will contact you within the week….this was 3 weeks ago. My application still says “in progress” on Workday.

Since then I had messaged some people on LinkedIn, and an HR rep offered to pass on my contact info to the HR rep responsible for this area and asked them to contact me this week. 

She said it is currently a busy time and if they don’t contact me then to try emailing the supervisor and she was kind enough to give me that email as well.

Additional context: A guy who works there hit me back on LinkedIn said that the hiring doesn’t seem to happen fast and I should stay patient and hope for the best. 

It’s a city Hydro company so I could imagine city positions take forever to process 

My question(s) is: 

Is it over? Should I wait some more? How long until I contact the supervisor? Is that too pushy and needy? Does the person who said within the week even know?

The new job is only 401k eligible after 1 year. There are 4 more PTO days with the new job but my current job is very flexible with needing days off (unpaid, of course) which is important for me as I am about to start applying to grad school and might need days off to attend interviews. My current job is also aware and very accommodating about my plans to go back to school. I am not sure if I should take the new job. On one hand, I am excited about working in a new field with more opportunity but I am not sure if I should take the new job given that financially it might not be much of a boost.

1c13iqc,Working in finance but want a change. What professional jobs don't have a boss?,"I'm a 27 year old with a B.S. in Political Science. I worked as a sales man for over a year before becoming what is basically an assistant to a group of financial advisors for the last 3 years. I have my Series 7 ""stock brokers"" license and my Series 66 Investment Advisors license. 


I've been spinning my wheels so hard on business ideas but can't make anything work (haven't yet even launched a business). All of my ideas are either things that I can't start due to my position, or things that are unethical or that I have zero real passion in. If I'm going to be an entrepreneur I want it to be something that i'm at least somewhat passionate about and something that I can tell my soon to be born son and have him be proud of me. Not be a cheater. 


I want to start working towards a career that would allow me to open up my own ""practice"" or at the very least have a great sense of autonomy. I'll put a list below of things that would fit into this category. 


1. Lawyer

2. Doctor

3. Accountant/CPA

4. Solo Financial Advisor 

5. Therapist


Can y'all help me come up with a bigger list? Out of this list, the ones that I am actually considering are Therapist and Lawyer.

1c13b7h,I am the least valued person at my company. Feeling incompetent and lost 1+ year into my first full-time job,"For context, I am 24M and started my first job as a support representative for a software company in march of 2023. I am looking for advice/guidance because I am feeling very discouraged, incompetent, and feel like the weakest link to my company. We are a small (30 total employee) accounting based software company with many, many issues.

My role consists of taking anywhere from 50+ calls on a bad day, and 5-10 on a good day. I’m not sure if I’m being self sabotaging, but I feel completely incompetent in my role. I frequently have no idea what’s going on when trying to assist a client. Daily, I’ll feel like the dumbest person in the world and my confidence is taking a massive hit. 

I came into this job with no experience, little technical skills, and absolutely zero prior knowledge of accounting, but got the job anyway. At first I was very grateful and excited to start a new job after over a year of applying (8+ months of seriously searching). I make $45k and was hired with 2 other people (both were offered $48k starting). 

By the end of my first week, I already noticed some red flags (2 people on my team left the company on the same week we were starting), and by the end of my first month, my attitude had changed a lot but I was just grateful to have a job and really had hope that things would start to get easier as I learned the system.

Long story short, things have not gotten easier. 1 of the 2 people that I was hired with quit about 4 months into the job because of very similar complaints/feelings that I have (we don’t feel like we were trained adequately and we feel like there is no help). After he quit, things got so much worse. The workload for 5+ months was ridiculous, I am not sure why I stuck around for that but I did. It has just now started to slow back down, but I was seriously struggling for months and my workload kept building and building.

We have little documentation and an almost non-existent escalations chain, so I get stuck feeling an immense amount of stress knowing full well that I don’t know how in the world I am going to figure an issue out and I just end up praying to god that the client will forget about it or figure it out on their own.

Despite feeling this for several months, I survived; and at times, I felt like I was learning a lot, and felt like this is something I might eventually get good at. Now, I sometimes get calls for things I was able to figure out 5+ months ago with little effort, and I’m completely lost. I feel like I don’t understand what’s happening or how anything works. It’s almost like I just forget everything I’ve learned over the past year. Then I feel dumb and get discouraged from asking for help because I feel like it’s something that I should know the answer to.

I feel like Benjamin button where I am losing knowledge as time goes on. I’m not sure if this is burnout or a complete loss of confidence.

I have internally decided that I do not want to grow with my current company and honestly want to quit so badly, but always just remind myself of how lucky I am to have a job and how miserable I was without one. I have been applying to other jobs for the past 4-5 months but have had no luck. I had 1 interview set up but I am SO busy on the day-to-day that I quite literally don’t have time to respond to personal texts, calls or emails. I strategically set up an interview for a Friday when I will be working from home, but of course I ended up getting thrown into a high priority issue and my manager had called me at the time of my scheduled interview so I had to deny the phone call. 

I don’t know what to do with my life because things are about to finally slow down, I should be getting a raise soon, and I am having trouble finding a new job. But on the other hand, I’m mentally exhausted and the thought of how I can get out of this situation overwhelms me everyday.

The last thing I want to do is quit and end up unemployed for the next year. But I’m not sure how much longer I can handle this. I feel incompetent in my current position and it is hurting my confidence when searching for new jobs or trying to think about what I want to do for a career. This is also my first full time job so I really don’t know if I’m being overdramatic and if this is really all that bad (but from conversations with coworkers I’m pretty confident the majority of my team feels similar to how I do except they understand the material much better than I do so they don’t have the factor of incompetence).

Lastly, everyone on my team knows I’m the weakest link and it’s uncomfortable. No one makes me feel bad about it and they always say things like “oh it gets easier” or “oh that took me so long to figure out” and things that give me a sense of momentary hope but ultimately I end up feeling stupid. I’m also pretty sure I make the least amount of money out of anyone in my entire company. I mean rightfully so after the details that I have disclosed here but it makes me feel like I’m lesser nonetheless.

This turned into a long therapeutic rant; but I’m looking for any type of feedback because I don’t think I can continue to feel like this daily. Has anyone had similar experiences in their job? What did you do to become more confident or comfortable? Thank you in advance and sorry for the long rant of mostly nothing but complaining haha.",throwaway23557718,1,1.0,0,1712800927,2024-04-11 02:02:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c13b7h/i_am_the_least_valued_person_at_my_company/,4,2024

1c12nyr,Seeking Advice: Should I Leave My Current Job for a New Opportunity?,"Hi everyone, I’m at a crossroads and could really use some outside perspectives. I’ve been with my current company for 3 years and it’s been quite a journey. We have 2 weeks of vacation, 12 holidays, and a bonus week and a half shutdown in winter that's paid. My commute is about an hour each way, but I get to work from home on Fridays. Benefits are comprehensive, including a 6% 401K match, health, dental, and vision insurance. The company is on a fast track, with lots of headcount additions and expansion plans. However, I’m in a new department that’s quite challenging with a heavy workload, and I’m unsure about my career growth prospects here despite having forged strong relationships and being familiar with the culture.  
I recently received a job offer from a much smaller company that’s markedly different. Here are the key points:  
Only 9 days of vacation and 10 holidays (no mention of any extended winter break).  
The benefits package includes 401K, dental, health, and vision insurance, but no specifics on the 401K match.  
A significantly shorter commute time of 15 minutes.  
The salary is enticing, offering a $30,000 increase from what I currently earn.  
Glassdoor rates the company at 3 out of 5, based on 5 reviews, which makes me a bit hesitant.  
I see a clear career path there, but I’m unsure about the company culture.  
It requires 100% on-site presence, with no work-from-home options.  
I’m torn between staying in a familiar environment where I’ve built strong relationships and stepping into a role with clear career progression but less vacation time and an uncertain culture. The salary bump is tempting, but I’m wondering if it’s worth the trade-offs.  
I’d appreciate any advice, especially from those who have made similar decisions. What factors should weigh the most in my decision? Is the significant salary increase enough to compensate for the lesser vacation days and the complete lack of remote work options? How much should I weigh the company culture and the potential for career growth in my decision?

1c113eo,I’m I doing more harm than good by taking this opportunity? ,"
I’m a creative who works with a core group of much more extroverted collaborators. My collaborators value me very highly, but are aware that I’m not the lost outgoing, so they tend to handle most of the networking in the name of our sort of trinity. Just an hour ago, one of them reached out and said that the other two were going on a creative retreat with a couple of industry folks they’ve been working with (I was already aware of this plan) and that there was an open spot and I could come if I want. I’m not sure what to do. 

On one hand, this could be valuable face time with some serious movers and shakers. On the other hand, I feel totally unprepared and will most certainly be the outsider. Everyone else there knows each other fairly well and everyone will be facilitating some sort of presentation on their specialty. If I went, I’d just be spectating. It’s also a huge task for me to ramp up the kind of energy required for a full weekend with industry people in a short amount of time. To top it all off, I have a fair few things planned already this weekend, including a date with a girl I quite like. I’m also a little concerned that this is an indirect invitation to what otherwise seems like an intimate gathering, and I don’t wanna be the quiet guy who’s just ____’s buddy along for the ride.

I started at $15 an hour and been there for three years. Guess what, I didn’t get a single penny raise. All I got was more responsibilities and bullshit. 

I told my boss that he would have to pay me $20-$25 an hour or I quit. He had the nerve to say “people would die for $15 an hour.” Even though, I make the same as a fast food employee while working a job that’s 100x more difficult. I would have to climb 24ft ladders with 100+lb units by myself. I also have to deal with him micromanaging the fuck out of me

After he made me do something very stupid and pointless, I’ve decided to walk off the job. He called angrily; but I ignored all his texts and phone calls. I am trying to get into the glazing union where my pay increases to $28 an hour with less bs and micromanagement. The union would also be safer because my old job violated OSHA regulations. 

At the job I quit, I would regularly work 50-60 hours a week with no 1.5x OT pay. In the union, I get extra OT pay. I hope for the best

I was told on thursday I was to be terminated effective friday, the next day. That was the ONLY info I was given. My SSO was deactivated minutes after I was given the news on thursday, which cut me off from accessing any of my work accounts, including email. Then my laptop was deactivated EOD Friday with no warning or notice whatsoever.

However in the exit package they sent me (after I had already been cut off from everything), it states I would have access to everything until Monday morning.  
  
So, they prematurely cut me off from everything AND failed to properly communicate any of this to me. I have important personal files on my laptop that I can no longer access.

1c0z5t6,My manager's f**king me over,"Hello, 
I am currently working as a IT contractor for a company who has a been working for their client for 15+ years. We work on site, when I got the job 8 months ago I was told I would have a pay rise in 6 months and I was allowed to go LTD but I had to be under umbrella for 6 months first. 

Fast forward 8 months and Ive not had a pay rise nor have I been allowed to go LTD. When I bring this up to my management they have told me and even sent us emails telling us we are lucky to have a job and they will fire people. 
Our 'second in command'  managers is a contractor, he has told me I am not able to be contractor as our company doesn't want LTD contractors anymore (something to do with IR35 and how we don't sit inside it). Our contracts are renewed every 6 months, all the other contractors have just had their contracts rewned and are allowed to be LTD. Surely if they are allowed to be LTD and do the same job as me we should be treated equally? 

When word came from top down that our company wanted to stop LTD contractors our manager (who's a contractor) told his superiors that If they did this there would be no workers.

1c0yunj,Career crossroads? Open to advice.,"Which direction 

Hi, I'm seeking some advice on a career crossroads I find myself coming to. Currently I'm employed as a Platform Engineer in the tech world in the UK. I switched careers from being a plumber because I lost any motivation for my job as a plumber. 

I'm approaching the 1 year mark in my new career but have found the change difficult and challenging which I knew it would be, I had been learning new skills during my job as a plumber. I learned cloud, iac and touched on programming languages before I gained employment. 

As I was a career switcher it meant that I had to start at the lower end of the pay scale, something I knew before I switched, however circumstances changed for me when my partner fell pregnant and we needed a new home. This put an added strain on to my decision to switch careers but we carried on with the change. 

I recently learned that a colleague of mine earning a lot more than I am with the same amount of experience, I'd say the only real difference is he has more knowledge of programming languages where I have more experience in cloud iac stuff. He also knows his salary will increase substantially come this summer, I should note my pay review is the same period. For reference I currently earn 26k per year and he is on around 32k. His increase is to around 42k. While I know my pay review is likely to be an increase from what I get currently it is unlikely to be towards the 40k mark. 

Now the crossroads. With the changes in circumstances in home life and also in the knowledge that I'm probably one of the lower paid platform engineers at the current company it's made me re-think my choice to change. I'm in a unique position where I probably don't have enough experience as a Platform Engineer, 1 year this summer, to switch company. However I have been offered a job back as a plumber at around 52k with the possibility of bonus and a chance at moving into a management position further down the line. 

My aim when changing career was to move away from the labourious job and into something a bit more forgiving on the body, I don't have any health issues but that's not to say they wouldn't begin to creep in with age. Also the tech world has more opportunity to grow into a better paying position, at my current career stage I'd say it's quite a significant time away before I reach what I could get right now as a plumber and then another substantial amount of time before I surpass that. 

My real question here is does anybody have any advice on my next steps? Is it worth riding out the hard times at the moment in terms of salary, I'm starting to feel it and if I didn't have savings this decision would be taken out of my hands already. Moving into the 2nd year I have a feeling ill still need to dip in. I have a few gripes with how this company operates like expectancy to take part in extra things outside of working hours but that is optional even if it is used as part of your pay review! You get gripes in every job though so it's not a deal breaker. The other option is move back into plumbing, something I can do with my eyes closed which would free up more time after work to figure out another stream of income if I wished to counteract the shortfall I may earn if I stuck out the platform engineer position. High levels of pay in the tech world isn't as prevelent as what is openly spoken about unless you have a lot of experience or have a niche tech stack.

1c0ylet,How do I deal with sexism at work?,"Unfortunately, this is not entirely a new area for me.. but the overall situation is, and i am hopeful some folks on here can provide advice. I want to note, i am an equal to the manager within the comapny, as i also run my own department separately from him. He is not my boss or above me in any way.

I am lucky enough to say I've found a job i love, in a field i never thought i would be passionate about, and the pay is good. I have no plans or desire to leave anytime soon, however there is one manager making my work life miserable as hell. To be fair, i am not alone on this claim, many of the staff have an issue with this manager as well. He makes a lot of mistakes but he will shame you to death if you make one, he has lost the company thousands upon thosands of dollars, lost us clients, etc. He has broken staff morale, and while no job placement is perfect, it is unnecessarily difficult due to this individual. There have been so many issues, over the year+ since he was hired, that i requested a meeting with both owners of the company, and the manager in question. I had originally planned for only one of the owners to be in attendance, however at his request, i called forth the other to join as well. It has been encouraged to come forth with these issues, and I took the initiative to do exactly that. Prior to the manager joining the meeting, which was just a timing issue, he wasnt asked to sit out, I had presented a list of issues that i wanted to address to him. A couple examples: Communication is non existant. A lot of my job relies on him doing his part, but i am the last to know what's going on through word of mouth from other staff. He likes to publicly call me out for literally nothing, and other staff have also made note of this. He doesn't grasp the concept of ""professionalism"". There has been animosity between us since we started working together, and i don't understand why (although i have assumptions). Every suggestion i bring to the table is always put down negatively by him, even though the owner approves my ideas. The list can go on... trust me. When he joined the meeting, we had already moved onto the topic of the workplace being negatively impacted by his actions, and how i have hopes it will change. By nature, this manager's entire personality is very somber, resulting in his complete silence for the entirety of the meeting. One of the owners suggested we should go out for lunch and approach concerns that way. I thought it was a great idea, and had agreed immediately to it, meanwhile he didn't seem too enthusiastic about it.

I approached one of the owners today to inform him that i would be asking the manager to go out for lunch tomorrow, to which i was informed he declined the meeting. The reason had me picking my jaw up off the floor... ""he is worried i will pull the me too movement"". Never have i EVER given this manager ANY reason to assume i would do something as vile as that. Respectfully, he is old enough to be my grandfather. I have never made any ""remark"" towards him (the thought honestly grosses me out). It is so uncalled for, and purely sexist to assume that. The owner who informed me of this had expressed his disagreement that i would ever make such an accusation, yet the manager stood by his claim. The other owner laughed at the absurdity of it. I personally see it as a way to get out of what would essentially be me discussing the issues he causes at work, and this situation truly speaks volumes to his character.

I am at a complete loss on how to move forward with this individual. The only thing i can think of is calling another meeting with the two owners and this manager, but i know nothing will come of it. Outside of a finger wave, no punishment is truly enforced at my workplace. I have had other jobs where he would have been fired x100 by now, and yet no matter how much damage he does, he remains within the company.
As i mentioned previously, i love my job. I dont want to leave because this individual is allowed to run wild. How should i proceed? ",AthenaTae,0,0.5,2,1712788083,2024-04-10 22:28:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0ylet/how_do_i_deal_with_sexism_at_work/,4,2024

Currently in customer service at an IT company. Answer the phone 70-90 times a day. I try to learn as much I can about IT, which is fine but my company is so small that even if I bust my ass I will likely only make 55k by 30. My current pay is 45k. I can tell my family is severely disappointed in me. Everyone else amongst my family makes six figures even my younger cousins who graduated after me. 

I just laugh at how much time I wasted doing nothing, granted mental issues are part of this most likely. Still though I am so lost. 

Degree in Econ and Minor in Data Analysis from 2019 but no experience. Did Bank Teller 1 year, Accounts Payable 1 year, and now customer service. My resume just seems extremely unappealing to me and can only imagine employers throw my resume in the trash bin. It lacks focus on anything and in this job market dont think anyone will take a chance on me.

I’ve recently been layed off by a big tech after 8 years in Marketing there. Im in my 30s an this was my first job after uni. I have to say my CV looks pretty good, I had a consistent career growth in a big corporate with a good salary 
Now after almost a month of searching I received an offer from a Start Up that seems solid and interesting, with a salary slightly higher than what I was getting. 
To be completely honest after years in the corporate world the Start Up ecosystem is something that scares me a lot, but on the other hand I appreciate the pros of trying something totally different and also the fact it seems to be a good chance to test. 

Plus, more than anything, I don’t have a job to loose at this stage.

Should I take the offer? Should I push back and continue looking for something more in my “safe zone”? Should I take the offer AND continue searching at the same time?

1c0xz37,Have I completely f***ed up?,"It's okay to say yes to the question in the title as I already feel like I've made a massive mistake.

I'm in UK fwiw. I was working in a job with good benefits (very good pay for the job, good pension and benefits) for past two and a bit years. It was admin related. Since last year I was looking for other roles - something a bit more interesting. The role was one I was good at but was pretty boring and no options to advance. 

I left in February to pursue a new role in a different industry. It was less money, but potentially longer term I might have had a career there or at least in wider industry which has lots of different roles etc. I had to do five weeks of training. I struggled with it - it wasn't what I expected (the job description had been really vague) and in the end I didn't pass the final exam. I've been told I may have to do the course again or if I can't (if I'm not allowed) then they'll let me go. Technically I'm still employed by then, but I have a meeting next Monday to discuss things. They have said that I could possibly do a bit of shadowing in the role for a day to see if I like it, and then do some or all of the training and exam again. (I also have a job interview on Tuesday for a six month position. I'm not sure I'm that qualified for it but I applied because it's six months FTC and thought maybe fewer people may apply. This is in admin in a different sector, but one I've worked in before).

It's dented my confidence a lot however and I'm questioning whether everything happened too quickly (I was offered the job on a Monday in January but had to start the training in February so handed my notice in the next day, finished my old job on the Friday and started my new one the following Monday). I feel like I made a massive mistake in leaving. Me and my colleague and friend were both looking to exit but they seem to have decided to stay now. 

The organisation I used to work for has openings with apps accepted until the end of the month. I really don't want to go back to the department I worked in, mostly for embarrassment sake. When I left I sent a nice farewell email, that implied it was final and I was off to do something exciting. Going back I'd feel like a failure. There are other openings in other departments, but I feel like I maybe wouldn't get those but would in my old one as they know me, I don't need security clearance (which often takes months) and I can just slot back in. I know how the database works etc. I'd probably need a refresher but nothing too bad. 

I have other applications in in other places for similar roles, but not heard back yet. I also have an application with the police, but have to do fitness test first which is coming up and it might not be six months before I start if that. (If I decide to go down that route). 

I guess I'm a bit lost as to whether to apply for my old job. I'm told someone else once left in a different department and then came back after a week as they didn't like it. But I had a lot of people come up to me before I left telling me how cool and exciting it was I was going and that the role sounds really interesting and it's good I'm leaving (as there's  zero progression opportunities). I already feel like a bit of failure - I had one interview before Easter and I thought it went well but usual thing, they came back and said no. Should I go back to what I did before or push on? It took me a good nine or ten months to have an interview for the role I'm currently in, then they came back and offered a different (better - supervisor ) role, but this seems just as bad and offered little in way of explanation as to what the role actually involved. 

I don't think I could see myself doing it long term. I'd just use it as a stepping stone, but the ideas I had about other opportunities don't seem to be an option either for the organisation. And it's made me reconsider whether I do actually want to work in the industry after all. I'm a bit conflicted. Any advice would be appreciated.

1c0x673,How do you enforce time boundaries as a new manager while I'm also begging for them to meet with me?,"I (31F) recently started a senior management role at the start of March and have encountered some concerning issues with the onboarding process and work expectations. The job is remote with the office in a location that is not realistic for me to show up at. Here's a breakdown:  
  
Lack of Onboarding: There has been absolutely no onboarding process. On my first day, I had to reach out to confirm if I was still employed. I've had 2 meetings all of which are scheduled randomly in the late evenings with last-minute notices.   
  
Unusual Work Hours: The job was pitched with regular work hours but flexibility for community engagements. However, I'm being asked to attend only meetings at 8 pm onwards with no more than a days prior notice, which conflicts with my personal commitments. I mentioned I'd be happy to adjust my schedule if the team had an unusual cadence but was given no direction. Its important to note I made it quite clear that last minute meetings at those hours will not be possible for me and will absolutely destroy my personal commitments.  
  
Communication Breakdown: Attempts to reach out to the team and department head have been futile. No one replies when I reach out - I've tried email, text, phone. HR's response was unhelpful, directing me to figure things out on my own. After 1 month of reminders, I finally met with someone, but they seemed disinterested, asked me what I wanted, and rushed out of the meeting after 15 minutes.   
  
Current Dilemma: I'm being paid but not contributing to anything. I'm currently on a 1 year contract and contemplating how long is reasonable to stay and see if the situation improves. I'm considering part-time gigs or consulting to stay productive during the week which would be nice both in terms of cash flow and variety. Do you think this might come to bite me later on when I've delivered nothing at the end of my term?  
  
Any advice on how to enforce time boundaries as a new manager while I'm also begging for them to meet with me so I can deliver on what they hired me to do?  
  
I have a meeting scheduled with the union tomorrow for guidance and am actively exploring other job opportunities, but I'm open to suggestions from the community. I recognize the red flags, but I'm not in a position to leave this role without something else as I just returned to working after taking 6 months off from a terribly toxic previous job where literally 37/40 employees had a mass exodus. Can't catch a break it seems.

1c0w825,What career advice would you give to a struggling 20 year old?,"I'll try to keep this sweet and simple. I completed my A Levels and was set on nursing because I've always wanted to be a nurse since I was very young. Got into nursing, did 6 months of it, left because I was getting £430 a month to live off and you need a car to drive to placements because they're so far apart (I do not have a car) I also decided to give my mum £200 of that because we were really struggling at the time (and still are). Plus the toxic culture of nursing was insane and my physical and mental health was plummeting. I then went into a few healthcare jobs just to try to reignite my passion and it only left me worse in a depression. Then I tried a sales job and that didn't last too long. Worked as a receptionist - I actually enjoyed this job but it was a temporary contract and it's rare to find admin jobs in my area without driving a good distance.

So, now we are here. I considered doing business because I used to run my own little business but stopped it because I needed to focus on school (big regret). Something still didn't sit quite right with me. Now I am realising that all of these jobs I wanted to do was to prove to people that I wasn't stupid and to find some self worth but I didn't in the end. That's okay though, I realise that now and I'm not focused on that anymore. 

I wrote down what I want to have in a job, and have noticed a pattern in the jobs I'm choosing and why I didn't enjoy them much. I really like the big picture jobs (like management) but I have a massive passion for creative freedom which nursing doesn't have, business kind of has but not enough - so now I'm trying to figure out what jobs are there that pays a decent wage but allows me to have this creative freedom while also running a team of people/management in general. I also really love teaching, teaching is a secret underlying passion of mine but selfishly, the money isn't great so I'm not considering it much. So, we have teaching, management, creative freedom and also I'm more project minded than ""job"" minded if you get me. 

I know I said I'd keep this short and sweet and managed somehow to do exactly the opposite but I would really appreciate some input such as job recommendations, life and career advice, possibly even your story. Thank you!

TL;DR I want a job with creative freedom but also has teaching and management aspects to it.

It's a small company that is expanding and they recruited me because of my top notch resume.

 I am starting a new project. In a weekly team meeting today another manager told me that my boss who was off ill had asked her to tell me to cc her and him on all emails I send.

Firstly, I am not happy my boss didn't even wait to tell me himself.

Secondly, I'm livid about being asked to do it. I've never had this in my career and feels like  mistrust and suffocating micromanaging.

Thirdly, I do not want to cc this other manager in as she's a pain (not just me who says it).  This comes after I pushed back to my boss about how the other manager's review of my work was largely inconsistent and non value add - changing a word sort of stuff.   My boss was supportive and said he would speak with her as he felt she was being overly harsh too.  

Is this normal and acceptable practice? I'm going to speak to my boss when he returns but was looking for views on this and guidance of what to do.  Thanks.

1c0ujrl,Leave my “secure” job and challenge myself or stay?,"I have no one else to turn to so I hope to get advice from you all on the matter: 

I 29M, have been working in the Postal Service for 9 years now. I really dislike it, the environment, structure and limitations on growth both skills and financial. While having a lot of short and varied experiences, I do not have any really hard skills nor degrees which makes it hard for me to just leave. This year I am finally able to afford to quit to actually try and develop hard skills but I have a very small window of opportunity to take the chance. I’ve been pretty excited about it but there has been a little wrench thrown into the plans and have been struggling to decide between two very different career decisions that will ultimately lead to the same ending: Blue collar trades for a few years> sales in that industry or dive directly into sales (which is what I planned on leaving for). As for the wrench in the plans, 5 days ago I took an exam that qualified me to be hired as Building Mechanic. (I have experience in both the trades and sales/customer service just to clarify)

In this position, I would learn about everything regarding a buildings mechanical features and as well as a decent pay increase (think handyman) as well as a ~$8k increase in salary. For me, this would only be a stepping stone before I leap into home-improvement, construction sales or wholesaling, as my intentions are to leave the postal service sooner or later. The caveat to this qualification is that there is no clear timeline of when I’d actually receive said position. It could be next week, next year, or even years— it feels like I’m chasing the carrot. I fear that on one hand, holding out and hoping for this opportunity will cause me to miss others if I don’t seize this moment. And on the other hand, id miss this opportunity by leaving when it could be closer than I realize.

My question is whether I should suck it up and play it safe, learn some technical skills before embarking on sales with no definitive timeline or am I crazy for leaving it and taking the shot I’ve been waiting for? (Btw, I do intend on still learning more handy skills on the side over time although I’d be working in Sales.)",This-Account-Burns,1,1.0,0,1712778210,2024-04-10 19:43:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0ujrl/leave_my_secure_job_and_challenge_myself_or_stay/,4,2024
1c0u9vs,My bestie is my work enemy ,"Last year my bestie texted me 'my boss asked do you wanna work here' and since I was unemployed at the moment I decided to give it a shot. My best friend was 3rd manager at that time, in next 3 months one of the manager quit and so my bestie upgraded and I got her position of manager really fast (because I did good job not because of her).
Jsut 4 months after another manager did leave so my bestie upgraded to the main manager and I was supposed to climb the ladder but she did hide things from me and some guy who was previous manager favorite did climb over me. Didn't take it to heart  I just took it to heart how she knew and kept everything as a secret from me & I lied me to my face and suddenly I got on bad side of manager who was leaving. Didn't do one single thing for us to be like that, we were actually really close but later on I was in situation where they cornered me about something 'I didn't do' (in 2 min after I proved work is done and they attacked me for no reason) and my bestie did stab me in my back like at least 5 times that month and yet I still was silent and helped her. 
Since she got position I was left to do every work, the work she did know and she didn't know, she actually did overwork me but was so nice  to the guy who got 2nd main position. I continued to swallow even when I was fixing problem she coudknt find and I tried to save her ass to director but she at that moment sold me like I wasn't even there. I still kept silent. I got calls on my free days, after 10pm before 6:30am to help her and thag guy for whole 5 months. They even called me on my vacation in another country to help them and I did miss bus because their thing was important but it was so easy and I did show them like 10 times at least. To not mention how she is hiding many things that expired and sell 2 months expired eggs and already made a debt of at least 5000€ in jsut 6 months and I did give her money from my payment even tho I had travel to do and was in need of every cent, also i was hiding from director everything so she doesn't get caught. 

Fast forward to my free days, whenever one has free day the other main fill their shift. Suddenly guy who's supposed to cover my shift is not doing it and I have free day so I don't have any obligations. Until I got call at 10:10pm with scream voice at me 'Where are U to close', I asked her 'on my free day?' and she said yes u asked me and I told u. I did ask her day before if I am still free because one coworker got sick. Then I said how things went and she screamed at me 'Who's gonna close tomorrow' and I responded 'Well Jackson is supposed to work second shift'. She just hang on me and all mad went to work close the store. Everyone at work agrees it's not me who's supposed to close on free day but she's even doing some messages to group chat where she is forbidding us many things and adding more work to me. 

I don't know what should I do? 
Please help me should I quit work?

The in person interview also went well and they said they would make an offer by Monday, April 8th. Monday comes and goes and there's no word from them despite me emailing them twice.

1c0t2b2,I fucked up by being too transparent about my raise.. What should I do now? ,"Our company has lots of negative talks because people are badly paid despite efforts of asking to raise salary globally so that it corresponds to the current living cost. Generally, the company pays is 10-20% lower than market rate, no other benefits or bonuses And no work from home possible. 

Company has a lot of managerial issues as well which was one of the reasons why I job hunted in the first place. And I got offered another job at a better city. The new job brings me up to a correct salary (3k per month compared to 2.5k now) with a day of working from home allowed. 

I told my manager that I am leaving, and he asked if they can counter propose something would I stay and I told them that I would at least consider if the salary is on par and I'm allowed to work from home 1 day per week. 
I told one of my colleagues about this and since she asked, I just blantly told her my request, thinking it would be refused anyway. 

They offered me 3.3k (a whopping 800 more while many others who's been here for more than 5 years were refused a 100 raise). The colleague asked how it go, and I told her I'm torn now bcz they accepted my request. That's when I saw the look on her face and I realised I've said too much. 

I have always believed that salary transparency is for the good of society even though it's sort of a taboo topic from where I am. But now I realised that giving such information only generates negativity among employees. 

To make things worse, my boss came to me and asked me to keep our salary discussion secret but I've already let the cat out of the bag.. So definitely burnt bridges there... 

To make things even worse than it is, I'm still changing my job. while I'm grateful for the raise and the fact that I know they want to keep me to the point of such high raise (for the company), I am more aware of the dysfunctionality of the company and the way it treats employees in general. So burning all the bridges at this point. 

What should I do now...? I am wondering if I would just stay now so that, although I set hell on fire, at least I stayed..........

1c0sz20,Ghosted by old boss who asked if i’d come back. Did i do something wrong?,"
For background, i was part of a mass layoff and have been at a new company for 8 months now. 

Previous manager rehired for my role 1 year after the layoff but didn’t approach me about it. It didn’t work out with that person so they contacted me recently asking if i’d consider and what it would take. 

I thought about it for a few days and provided a number that was much higher than i normally would, but the benefits at my current job are much much better than the old company.

Now it’s been almost 1 week and i’ve gotten no updates. I had a really good (or so I thought) relationship with this previous manager so i thought i’d get some update even if it wasn’t going to happen.  

Did i do something wrong? I’m confused by their silence bc they’re not like this (in my experience).

1c0spyk,Sales people make a lot more than me. They don't sell anything! Raise advice please.,"Been with this tech company about 2.5 years now as an IT/Infrastructure person. I work closely with the sales team since I am the current Salesforce Admin and I also admin some other tools they use. Other departments like customer service and marketing also use SF so I work with them too.

 Since I started working here the sales have been pretty steady, but only 4-5 of the sales people make any deals. We've run through probably 15 other sales guys in the 2.5 years that generally work for about 9-12 months before we terminate them. We give them a chance and that's typical of a lot of sales jobs. My last sales job I got base pay of 50k and then commission. I worked a year before the company was bought and decided to change my career path to a technical role. 

So I was talking with the head of sales today, whom I am quite close with, and he revealed to me one of the recently fired sales guys was getting paid 125k base and then commission. The guy sold 70k worth of stuff in a YEAR before he was let go. 

I made 85k last year on 75k plus bonus. I figured the failed sales guys were only making 50-60k and commission!? This company would make exactly zero sales and fall into disarray in many ways if I just up and left since I am the only one with a Salesforce Admin Cert. I frequently talk to recruiters on LI, but none of them are really blowing me away with a major pay raise right now. I like my job and it's remote and everything is great besides the pay. I'd probably need 100k remote to leave this since I really like the job itself. 

I was going to ask for a raise the traditional way by saying that I am important to the company and I have accomplished many things and all that. With this new information, I feel like I could get more out of the raise if I kinda trashed all these sales guys that have COST us money that I have to set up and train. I also feel this could be a risky move. 

How and/or SHOULD I use this info in a raise discussion? (for those wondering how this is a viable business, usually retain all of our customers once we get them.

1c0sb8a,Does anyone have suggestions for careers to pivot into as a Paralegal?,"I (F25) feel that I have been 'good' with money, however, this has been at the severe expense of the enjoyment of my youth. 

  
I started working at 14, and between the ages of 16 to 18 I was working 40-hour weeks in 'part-time' roles, at 18 I started an apprenticeship whilst continuing the part-time work and at around 22 I started to earn an average salary of around £30-£45k depending on the roles. I have an average amount of savings and investments, amounting to just over £100k.

  
I wasn't able to go to university for a few reasons and don't have anyone to fall back on if my finances aren't in good order, so work has always been a priority. I work in the legal sector, but do not enjoy this line of work due to the stress and impact it is having on my health- and most of all, as I am not in big law, the work I do is not reflected in my salary at all!

  
The reason for this post, is because I desperately need to increase my income as my quality of life is suffering due to my finances- I cannot escape work, I do not earn enough to live anywhere other than a small bedroom in London, and don't even earn enough to treat myself every once in a while. It is making me feel so hopeless that I fall within the category whereby I am not a high earner, but am not entitled to any benefits or social housing (which would make my life so much easier!)  
Does anybody have any suggestions of what I can do with my money; suggestions of high earning careers (side note: my patience with studying is wearing thin, as I have never had a break from studying); and other general tips to improve my finances.

I am afraid to say anything because our team is very small and most of them belong in a click (with me on the outside looking in), that I don’t want to become public enemy number one. At the same time, it seems like a weird moral dilemma (am I just as guilty letting them steal from our company)? Part of me also believes if management wanted to know who was truly stealing from them, that’s on them and they’d pay more attention to the cameras.

Interviews with jobs where I am actually interested in I turn into a deer in the headlights, black out, get physical symptoms of anxiety and I am worried about how it will affect interviews for jobs I am actually interested in for the future. I've even worked with therapists on performance anxiety, and while it has helped a bit, the anxiety still exists (I know there is no getting rid of it entirely).

1c0pm3n,Is being underpaid worth it in the long run? ,"Since 2016, I've worked in both government and the nonprofit sector doing public assistance. I am about 8 years into my career now. My most recent position was with a startup, where I continued the same type of work I've always done. I was recently put in lead positions and had really been advancing in my career. Unfortunately, I was part of a mass lay off in December 2023, which necessitated my relocation back to my home state.

Upon returning, I applied to various government entities in my field and received interview invitations from all of them, along with job offers from nearly all. I opted for one offer due to its exceptional hybrid model, unlike the others which required a substantial commute to the office several days a week. Remote is important to me right now for personal reasons. One day I’d like to be able to go into the office more often again, but currently it’s not the most beneficial thing for my situation. So this had to be considered in my decision. 

This particular entity had a highly competitive hiring process (4 interviews with 6-8 person panels each time). When they called to offer the position to me they were transparent that the choice was incredibly hard because they had narrowed down to 8 suited applicants that was then widdled down to 4 candidates that were a complete near perfectly matched toss up. While my experience just barely edged me ahead of other strong candidates, they offered me the minimum pay rate, equivalent to someone with no prior experience in the field. When I asked about compensation and negotiation, they flat out told me I can definitely ask for more but to know they do have those other qualified candidates lined up who would likely take the starting rate. 

Not wanting to miss out on this rare remote opportunity, I accepted the role at the starting rate. Regrettably, this meant passing up lead positions and higher-paying offers at other places. Now, I'm second-guessing my decision and contemplating my next move.

Although the job is part of a union and slated for significant raises over the next year, my contract only runs until the year's end. However, there's potential for a permanent position if one becomes available due to turnover. This entity has a good reputation as an employer and is unique in its hiring practice of this contract type situation. This paired with how difficult the interview process was makes me want to believe that even at a lower pay this opportunity is a good one. Hopefully a competitive one that will serve me well in the long run. 

Yet the situation also leaves me pondering whether to stay and await fair compensation or to seek greener pastures elsewhere. The only other comparable option offering remote benefits in a similar way is a non-union entity, which happens to be the highest-paying in the state. However, being unfamiliar with unions, I wonder if my new jobs long-term compensation through a union will ultimately surpass that of non-union counterparts.

As far as benefits go, most of the entities are very similarly matched which makes the decision harder. I feel like I am taking a step back in my career by allowing my experience to be disregarded in regards to my compensation like this. Knowing that I will never make the same amount as my coworkers with equivalent experience even after years of raises (because they will get those raises also) really frustrates me. I want to be paid what I’m worth, but I also don’t want to be so short-sighted that I throw away a good long term opportunity for immediate monetary gain that may or may  not materialize into a better situation in a few years. 

So what do you think?",Elsamarina,1,1.0,0,1712766120,2024-04-10 16:22:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0pm3n/is_being_underpaid_worth_it_in_the_long_run/,4,2024
1c0pbs4,Should I take a new job?,"Context: I’m a healthcare worker. Have been in a hospital setting for 5 years and have loved my job, and the people I work with. 

Fast forward to a few months ago our “manager” had to cover a couple night shifts and decided that can never happen again. First, the “manager” tried forcing us on more weekends and holidays as a punishment. When that bottomed out, the “manager” forced an on call policy that 1.) would require day shifters (and night shifters as well) to pick up night shift on call. 2.) They’re only willing to pay us something around $3/hr for 2.5 hours of being on call. The “manager” unsurprisingly does not have to pick up on call.

So o got pissed and applied to a bunch of jobs. I’m interviewing with an outpatient outfit now. My schedule would go from 3 twelve hr shifts/week and 3/4 weekends a month and holidays per year to m-f 8a-4p with every weekend and holiday off.

I would take a hit in PTO and retirement contributions but would likely see a decent pay increase.

Currently a Sophomore undergrad (biochemistry major) pursuing medicine in hopes to apply to medical school after I've repaired my GPA. Ive got C’s in both genchem 1 and 2 and a D in orgo 1, highest grade I can get this semester in orgo 2 is a B. My gpa is a 2.5 and I have 2 Fs on my transcript.

I'm really scared of regretting anything that could have changed now, so it's been constantly wracking my mind. I understand the commitment you have to make to med school and residency, and a part of me really wants to dedicate myself to that. Another part of me however wants to invest and build wealth and hold a reasonable income during my 20s so I can do so, which is why i have the PA track in my consideration.

1c0n34l,Shut down when I asked for a compensation increase,"Recently I had a yearly review with my boss. I asked for a compensation increase and was told, off bat, that there was a 1% chance of that happening. I was also told that I need to have a plan for when I receive an answer that I’m not happy with. In the 3 years that I’ve been with this organization I’ve increase my skills by receiving certifications for the work we do within our department and now I’m going to school for a masters degree. Here are my main issues: 

• I played the role of an executive assistant for a year with pay well below other exec assistants

• I’ve supported other exec assistants in their absence and I’m still expected to today 

• My boss told me that there is a 1% chance of me getting additional compensation without any explanation 

• I’m in a grant funded role, and I know there are additional funds for my position

I realize that I’m being scammed and I plan to leave in the near future because of these practices. However, I’m looking for insight for what can I do to get the pay I deserve while I’m still with the organization? I also think this organization needs to held accountable for their practices especially since I’m working in the department of DEI. 🫣",Fabulous-Jacket5376,2,1.0,3,1712759703,2024-04-10 14:35:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0n34l/shut_down_when_i_asked_for_a_compensation_increase/,4,2024

1c0lztn,I was promoted 2 months ago but I’m still doing my old job indefinitely ,"Two months ago I got promoted to a different department, which means new supervisor, new duties, and completely new title. Thankfully I got paid at my new rate right away, but they told me that until they hire someone to replace me I would be doing both jobs part time. In the mornings I work the old job, and after lunch I work the new job. When someone is out at the new job, I work there the whole day (or week) to cover for them. I have zero idea of when they’ll hire someone new, I don’t think they’ve even posted the job anywhere. 

It’s getting more stressful to do both jobs because I really don’t enjoy the old job at all, but I’m not doing the new job regularly enough to be learning much or getting projects I can really dig into. Both jobs also have very time sensitive duties, so they end up overlapping. This week I had to work the old job all day to cover for someone while also finishing up a presentation for the new job, and I wasn’t able to do complete the presentation because I was too busy doing the work of 2 people already. 

I’ve talked to my new supervisor and he said he wants me to prioritize the tasks he gives me, but he also doesn’t communicate with the old supervisor so it’s awkward every time I have to leave after lunch. It feels like they want me to ask permission to leave and I have to have everything wrapped up first. But when I told that to my new supervisor, he said he does owe it to the old department to make sure they’re in a good spot. It’s conflicting info and I feel like I end up letting both jobs down. I feel like I’m stuck in the middle of my parent’s custody battle again!

I should feel like I’m finally closer to doing the kind of work I wanted to do but instead I feel frustrated with the whole company. I was already considering quitting before the promotion and now I’m thinking about it again. Is this a red flag for the company? Is 2 months actually as long as it feels, or is that a normal timeline? At what point do I say this has been going on for way too long?

1c0lw1w,I was PIPped. My friend says I should hold my nerve because one or more people who are instigating this will resign soon. Is this plausible?,"I have been in my current job for 14 months. I was recently informed that I would be put on a PIP. Tomorrow is the initial meeting. From what I understand, the process is supposed to take 3 months according to company policy, potentially extendable by them for another 3 months.

I was about to throw in the towel, but my friend (working in a different field for a different company) says to stick it out, because higher ups do such things because their own job is in danger and this is a way to show their own bosses that they are handling the situation, but they are probably on their way out.

Some relevant circumstances, in no particular order:

- I am aware that I am the lowest performer on my team - but that's because both of my colleagues are extremely high performers, they were both managers before and this job is a massive demotion for them. 

- On the other hand, I'd think that they need me, at least for now, because our team is one person down, as someone left 4 months ago. The higher ups are claiming that they are actively looking for a replacement, and indeed there are adverts online, interviews set up in boss's calendar, etc. But nobody has been ""found"" yet.

- About 2 months ago I saw a meeting in my boss's calendar called ""The future of [the name of our department]"". I couldn't see the organizer/attendees, but me or my teammates were not invited.

- My boss has been looking like shit lately, and he just spent a week in hospital with an illness that sounds stress related (cardiovascular stuff)

My concern is that even if my boss quits/is fired/goes on sick leave during my PIP process, I have a feeling that the big boss wants me out. The reason I think that is because my boss informed me that the big boss wants to make it part of the PIP requirements that I have to come into the office 5 days a week - even though I live 1.5 hours away and all my colleagues (all of whom live 30-45 min away) are doing 50% home office. The big boss is well aware of how far away I live - in fact, it was her who warned me back during the third round of the job interview about the hellish commute.

Given these circumstances, is it really reasonable to expect that if I will survive this PIP and by the end of the process, all the higher ups will be gone from the company or they will lose interest in the process? I only survived a manager once under such circumstances, but I was let go very soon after she left the company.

1c0ldd3,How do I get out of hospitality (and unemployment)?,"I graduated university last year with a degree in life sciences, but because of poor grades/low motivation/""mental health"" didn't get a job in my field ended up working in a restaurant. The restaurant job was nice, paid the bills and gave me savings, but I was frustrated with myself and wanted more. In February of this year, I quit the job and moved to a big city.

I've been out of a job for a month and a half now and both my savings and self respect are running low. I want to eventually find a job in my field, but with my grades and level of knowledge, it will be a long time before I am employable (I've only just recently started bettering my professional skills, and even then there's not as many opportunities for a Bachelors grad as I thought so I may need to go back to uni for a Masters).

I need to get a job soon and my options seem to be as follows:

1) A restaurant/cafe/bar job - the most unfavourable of the bunch since I feel like I'd be doing the same thing I was before and wouldn't be progressing upwards;

2) A receptionist/office assistant job - I don't have experience in admin work but it would be a step up from hospitality and surely with my degree I can figure it out?

3) Some grad scheme in a random subject - you can tell from the way I described it it's a wishy washy hope;

4) Something degree-related (but I frankly think at this stage it would be a waste of time).

I am conflicted about which option to go with and keep on changing track because of my uncertainty.  It seems to me like getting an admin job (2) is the most ""acceptable"" option in terms of some progression skills and ""respectability"" wise (which will be important when applying for future jobs), but it also feels like it is a very ""generic"", gradual and safe step upwards, and that a person with more drive or shrewdness would be able to jump the career rungs faster and with more specificity. An example that comes to mind is this English Lit graduate I know who freaked out after finishing uni, applied to a bunch of weird places and ended up getting a job reading scientific papers for a biology laboratory, which may sound like an ""arbitrary"" choice for him but is still more tailored than just doing an office job. (So option 5: jobs that I'm not even privy to because I'm not using my brain power enough)

Basically I feel like I have no ""personal"" input in my job search anymore and have a very generic approach to what I could be doing, but in my defence this is because I am in desperate need of a job.

I am about to finish my Ph.D. in mathematics with a focus on convex optimization with slight connections to machine learning (but not deep learning). My Ph.D. was very successful in that I have several strong publications in excellent conferences (and things submitted to journals but that takes time). I enjoy designing and optimizing algorithms. I was planning to do a postdoc, but staying in academia forever has recently started to make me somewhat mortified. I would like to work on real-life problems, have a good work-life balance, and not constantly have to beg for money.   
I would like a job where I can continue to work on algorithms and ideally earn a ton of money. (I have found that I enjoy any type of work that allows me to optimize, so might as well just make cash.) I would be open to be a research scientist at one of the big tech firms, or work as a quant.  
My first question:  
1. what other roles could I look into?  
I also feel like I am, e.g., not that good at coding. I have mainly used code to corroborate my experiments, I have several larger research projects in Python and Julia, but I don't feel like I have, e.g., the know-how to pass leetcode questions or technical deep learning coding interviews.  
2. Do I have to start grinding leetcode to get the jobs I want?  
3. Do I have to read up on software development?  
Based on my above questions, I started thinking about just going for an internship, where I could, e.g., further develop my deep learning knowledge or improve my software engineering skills.  
4. Is that a dumb idea? Will it look bad on my CV?  
Thank you so much for helping me,

1c0kt88,Possible Career Change? ,"I currently work in the environmental regulatory sector for a local government with a B.S in Environmental Science. I have two years experience in my job but have varying experience in I.T and customer service (jobs I had in college and before my current job). I feel that I'm hitting a dead end with this job as there is no room for promotion, wages are relatively stagnant, and I still live with my parents. 

I feel that I am ready to move out and see this as an opportunity to change jobs and move to a different region of my state. Could I get some pointers on what to pursue?

1c0ks4m,New roles for 90 days with no pay??,"Looking for advice here on what to do and how hard I should be putting my foot down.

&#x200B;

I run a small department, 3 employees, of doing business development for a automotive dealer. Back in January, we adopted a couple new programs to start tracking work. We have to log every activity we do: calls, appointments, outbound stuff with customers like emails, chats etc. They had originally said we will just ""play around"" in the system for 60 days to get the hang of it then we can start discussing commission based pay plans, right now my 3 staff members are just paid hourly. We are expected to hit certain goals and my staff has been absolutely killing it and hitting well over the goals they set for 2 months now. 

&#x200B;

A couple weeks ago, I had a meeting with the 2 directors above me. As of April 15th, they are adding about 50-70 more tasks per day for each staff member to do. We discussed pay plans and they said they will need a full 90 days MORE to get more data. They have toured other dealerships in the area and explored the way they pay their staff. I asked if they had a plan B if for when they tell my staff they aren't getting paid for doing extra work, what if they quit? He said: ""if they quit, they quit."" This, to me, just shows they don't care and will never most likely.

&#x200B;

I don't agree with making us do more work that WILL and HAS BEEN producing the company more money, so how can I push back a little more? I 100% back my staff as I also have no received any compensation for all of the extra work and stress I and mt department has been under. I cant really afford to get a new job right now, I am 3.5 months pregnant and plan to take my 3 month paid leave at the end of the year. We are all underpaid compared to the trends of other dealers in our district. What are some talking points I can use to push back a little more to help our case. 

&#x200B;

TIA :)

1c0krsf,Looking for some advice on which major to choose for USC Masters Program,"So I got into USC Masters for Piano Performance and as well as Masters for Music Industry. Also got into other schools for Piano Performance as in NYU and Boston Conservatory. Received a 20,000 scholarship from USC and 27,000 scholarship from Boston Conservatory.  It all sounds fine and dandy but I decided that I want to choose USC simply because on paper it is the best ranked school out of all. Clearly, I have enough talent to get into these schools for Piano (classical music) however I have been struggling since I know that most likely I will become a private teacher for piano which was never really my intention however most people who go down the Piano route end up becoming a professor or private teacher or both. As for Music Industry I am not super clear on what to expect from that Masters Degree I would assume it is mainly about networking and connections. I think theres more risk involved choosing Music Industry. I do love music and I believe that is how I got this far. Been playing the piano since the age of five. Never really took it truly serious until recently, im 24. I am interested in other genres of music as well. So looking for any advice.

I finish my studies in June and I'm still waiting to hear back from a grad scheme I applied for, but in the meantime I applied for a full time position in my uni city. The job sounds pretty good and it would be around £25k per year, but after a preliminary phone call I found out that they'd want me to start in May. I told them I have exams and they said they'd let me reduce my hours for exam weeks but despite the fact that the job seems good and they seem impressed with me, I'm worried about taking it whilst I'm still essentially in uni, and to be honest there's a part of me which wonders if I should take a couple of months out after uni to rest or travel or something before going into work (maybe at the risk of having fewer jobs available to me).

1c0jpoa,My ‘manager’ won’t give me clear defined roles and our director keeps pestering ME - i’m so stressed,"I’ve started working for a consultancy firm that sends us out to other firms and charges for our services in our line of work: 

The client I have been put with is good. No real issues with the senior team and I am cracking on with the job I’ve been given. 

I have a manager who is also a consultant with my actual company. He is supposed to support me but any questions I have I get nothing back. Fortunately the clients senior team I report to as helpful and really nice. 

Now my manager was looking after one job and me another. Now our managing director wants us to split the jobs between us and share it as my manager said he had too much to do. He’s not shared this plan with me but my MD is saying how I’m now doing x y z. 

 I’ve asked my manager multiple times to tell me what we are doing. How we are splitting the jobs and what he is taking off me because I am already at full capacity. I’ve not gotten anything back. 

Now things are due next week! I’ve chased it up again highlighting things are due soon and I don’t know what I’m supposed to be helping with (even if I want to help I can’t as I have zero access to the job information. Nothing has been shared with me) 

I’m getting so stressed because I’m still covering my own project and worrying I’ll be lumped with having to do this other work with no notice (in our line of work we cannot miss deadlines).
 I don’t want to just assume that as he’s not shared anything with me we are just working as we have been because our MD seems to think we have a plan in place. WE DONT. 

I’m 2 months in on this job and I’m so stressed. What if I fail my probation because they think I’m just sitting back and waiting on things to happen.

 Ugh I’ve had zero training in how any of this works. Everything I’ve done on my current project I’ve figured out myself and getting the project in line. I dread going to work now. My bf has noticed my mood has changed. I am always down and tired. I just want to cry. I feel like a failure but what else do I do?

1c0jehk,Corporate Track at Lame Duck vs. New Oppertunity at Superpower,"Hello all,

Coming at you today with two possible roads ahead of me, and currently having a hard time picking which route to take. 

I'm a mid-career engineering professional, currently working at an energy industry equipment/services provider. It's a medium-sized company with a good legacy, but things have not been good in recent years. The company has struggled to post a profit, and has relied on new financing for survival at the worst of times. Leadership states there is a clear path back to profitability, but with my knowledge of how things are, I would say there is a 50% chance the company ceases operations within the next five years. 

My performance at this company has been stellar according to performance reviews, I've been given increased responsibility, and my salary has been increased satisfactorily in-line with that. I do believe I currently have a path to senior leadership if I continue with this company. I'm not foolish enough to believe any advancement is guaranteed, but things are looking as good as they could be. The problem is, is it worth sticking things out and grinding to climb, if there is a fair chance the company will not exist in 5-10 years time?

With this in mind, I have been completing a series of interviews at a company in a related but not identical industry. This company is much larger, with excellent financial performance and perceived security. I do believe my role in this new company would have reduced responsibility from my current role, with a potential small pay cut being offered. In joining this larger company, my competition for advancement would be greatly increased, and it is entirely possible I will never advance above mid-level. 

I'm currently weighing my options and just wondering what would your advice be in this situation?

Thanks!",brett649,1,1.0,0,1712748959,2024-04-10 11:35:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0jehk/corporate_track_at_lame_duck_vs_new_oppertunity/,4,2024
1c0iwqp,I asked for a raise,"So 3 years ago I graduated with a business degree and got an entry level role at my company just to get my foot in the door. 8 months ago I started an analyst role at the same company that they created for me and was/is super fluid and ambiguous. 

Over time I’ve gotten a lot closer with my boss and my role has a bit more form. Since they had no idea what this role would be they definitely low balled me going into it. Which was fine, but now I’ve proved myself, and I asked for a raise.

I’m expecting to hear back this week or next as it’s already been a while but there was no talk of numbers at all. I just said I feel that the value I add is worth more than I’m paid and he said I understand I’ll see what I can do!

So if he comes back with a number.. do I negotiate? My base salary is 57k after a recent annual raise, but I’m hourly and work overtime a lot so last year at my slightly lower salary (maybe 54k) I actually grossed 65k including bonus. 

I’m using power bi and making reports and dashboards this leadership team has never seen before. I’ve taught myself that as well as excel and only one other employee at my company even knows how to use Power BI. 

Do I negotiate? Is 65k base from 57k base too much of a jump even though i’ve been essentially under paid since i’ve worked here? 65k is really the lowest I feel I deserve, it’s closer to around 70k, but it feels so aggressive. but on the flip side i’ve felt underpaid my entire tenure so it’s really just playing catch up.",avanillakilla,2,0.6299999952316284,8,1712747172,2024-04-10 11:06:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0iwqp/i_asked_for_a_raise/,4,2024

1c0i7s0,What retraining can I do or career change can I make without going back to a starting wage?,"I was made redundant in November, and have struggled to find a job since. I’ve barely found suitable roles to apply to let alone got interviews etc. unemployment in the industry is apparently around 64% and it isn’t forecast to improve anytime soon. I’d come to terms with the fact that I’d likely have to take a pay cut, but I’m starting to think that I’m better off changing careers altogether.

So the question is, what should I do next?! I’ll go through my experience / skills to help:
The role I was in (Studio Manger) was very much an all-rounder role - I was customer facing and dealt with enquiries, bookings etc. I then looked after a lot of the operational side of things relating to the actual property of the studios. I did invoices and managed budgets, including for projects such as building a new studio. I did sales (although I’ll admit new business is not my strongest skill) and have previously done marketing (but don’t particularly enjoy it - I’m fine with event planning and social media, but hate SEO etc!). I managed a team and have therefore done recruitment as well as disciplinary procedures etc. whilst I’m happy to manage a team I don’t want a HR heavy role. The things I enjoyed most were managing projects (I particularly liked looking at areas in which the company could evolve, planning how to achieve that, setting that plan into motion and seeing the results - this is probably what gave me the most job satisfaction) and customer interaction. I’m incredibly organised, so generally have done well with administrative roles as a result.

Around this time last year I considered retraining (I was unhappy with my employer), and started a Python coding course, but really struggled with it. Therefore, whilst coding is something that I see recommended here often, it’s unfortunately not something I’m particularly good at!
 
Salary wise I was on mid 40s, and have been looking at roles £40k up, I’d ideally like to not drop too far below that, and if I do would like there to be a chance of progression back up to that which wouldn’t take more than a couple of years. 

Sorry for the long post (wasn’t expecting it to be) but I’d really appreciate it if someone could provide me with some advice cause I feel so lost at the moment! Thanks! Living in London in case it’s relevant.

1c0h9qa,"Vent post, but advice is welcome.","I started this job working direct care in a juvenile mental health facility in December. I work nights, and I love the job. I had every intention of riding it out until I complete my bachelors in August and even considered staying on until I get through a masters.

First, I had to complain to the labor board for my insurance and pay. No issues there since.

Half of the staff have quit since I started and I'm constantly being asked to work extra hours. I have been vocal and firm that I am a full time student and I have obligations to my family at home. I do not want overtime. The hostility I've received for this is ridiculous. When someone quits, no one makes an effort to fill gaps beforehand, just guilt and bully the remaining staff to stay for 16s when it's time for them to leave. I already commute 2 hours to get to this job.

My chief complaint now is the sexist bullshit. I have three male bosses. The top boss texted me to come in for a Friday night midnight shift after I worked my training week, having just worked 8-5 am. It was 9:30 pm. I missed the message, because I was asleep. I didnt bother to respond, and we've had no interaction since.

First interaction with my middle boss he told me he watches the cameras and he watches me stretch. (I dress conservatively and am conscious to not be sexual while attempting to stay active.) He made huge eyes and said, ""I was like what is she doing?!? I can't believe you do that in front of 'male coworker.'""This was said in front of a group of people I don't know and have never worked with before. I was embarrassed and angry, because I do some ballet between rounds for my benefit, not his. And now he's implying that I'm promiscuous and sexually inappropriate?

Second interaction, he berated me in front of the residents for not completing a task. My coworkers will tell you that I consistently outperform them and always do said task. (I thought he watched cameras). That night I was posted with a suicide watch, physically incapable of being in multiple places. The task was laundry. He said something about finding good help and women should be doing laundry.

Most recently, on only our third interaction, he came in in the morning excitedly telling me about his night hunting prostitutes on grand theft auto. He asked me if I knew what anal clapping was. I responded, ""I guess like twerking?"" Apparently I wasn't responding enthusiasticly enough because he said, ""I thought you were cool. You're not going to go to HR are you?"" I said, ""I just don't play grand theft auto."" On his way out of the door, in front of teen boys, he said, ""With your voice, you could make a lot of money on there.""

So yeah, for simply existing as a woman I am a promiscuous prostitute obligated to perform domestic tasks.

Tonight, I mentioned to my direct manager that I've never interacted with that I am uncomfortable working at max capacity with only me and a pregnant coworker later this week. Said coworker is dangerous and incompetent outside of the pregnancy, but that is another long post. She can't do restraints and we have a full house with muliple violent histories. He said he would switch me out and ""get a man up here."" It's simply unsafe for any one person, and most importantly, the kids.

I want to stay at this job. I have no problem sticking up for myself, but I am surrounded by nonsense and it's stressing me out. I'm not sure what I am going do at this point. I was looking forward to putting this on my resume.

1c0h5l2,Can I break out of my current industry to a better paying one just with skills developed within my industry?,"I'm currently employed in manufacturing, I am fortunate enough to have stable employment, and one of the best total compensation packages in the industry (at least state-locally), basically there's no reason for me to leave my manufacturing job to work at a *different* manufacturing job. While I have gotten one promotion working here (to Team Leader) I'm not really interested in going up to the next stage of promotion (which takes me from hourly to salary and isn't really worth it for the amount of extra work you have to do). I do however have the opportunity to go into many lateral moves such as safety, training, quality, project development, and so on, many of which I would be interested in.

My question then is could I potentially gain enough experience and skill just from within this industry doing these various positions to potentially break into a new industry at a close-to or better income (80,000+ Annual) without having to go to college or anything with a similar time investment (I also have a family I would like to spend time with when not working).

I guess I'm just curious if employers in other industries would even consider non-industry job experience over school accreditation for some of their better paying positions (for example I do have management experience leading a team and meeting quotas, as well as using various software suites).",sbourwest,1,1.0,0,1712740039,2024-04-10 09:07:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c0h5l2/can_i_break_out_of_my_current_industry_to_a/,4,2024

Firstly, I'm not confident in my abilities to secure a job within the 3-month OPT (Optional Practical Training) period after completing my master's degree. I don't consider myself exceptionally talented, and I worry about struggling to find employment within that timeframe.  
  
Additionally, there's the concern of not being able to obtain Permanent Residency (PR) due to backlogs. This adds another layer of uncertainty to my future prospects in the USA.

1c0f75r,Should I accept this position that's 10 hours away even though I'm pregnant?,"So I graduated with my BS last June, and I still haven't had any luck landing a job after college almost a year later. Well my brother works for a firm and he referred me. I applied, interviewed, and got an offer letter. 

For context, the position is 10 hours away from where I currently live. I'm also married, and my elderly sick mother lives with my husband and I. So by taking this position, I would be uprooting the three of us across the state. 

Well, I recently found out that I'm pregnant by doing an at home test. I'm excited, nervous, scared, and only my husband knows since I believe I'm about 7 weeks and I haven't even been to the doctor yet. 

I signed the offer letter, and my husband and I are starting to look for places and beginning to tell our family members. He also told his job that he will be leaving soon, and they wished him luck and told him he will always have a place there. For reference he works construction.

But now I'm starting to have second thoughts. I realize that my brother will be extremely upset with me because he went out of his way to help me, I mean he was constantly asking when they would be hiring and mentioning that I had recently graduated and was interested, and this will make him look bad in the eyes of his employer. 

I also realize that I still don't have any relevant professional experience related to my degree, and the more time that goes by, the less appealing that is to potential employers. 

Obviously I haven't told my future employer that I'm pregnant yet, not even my family members know, but I'm scared that my position will not be guaranteed after the baby comes. And since my husband will be following me, he will have to secure a job, which may just end up being a part time minimum wage job (worst case scenario). 

I don't want to make this big move and uproot my little family for something that may not be guaranteed 7 months from now. We would also continue to be responsible for a lease and all other living expenses if I were out of a job, and if my husband doesn't secure a good enough job by then, we may be in trouble. I will also be leaving my village behind and we would be entirely on our own with the baby.

The position also barely pays enough that I will be able to cover all expenses on my own (not including daycare), but we will be living check to check basically until my husband finds a job. It's also a position that requires traveling and site visits from time to time, and I know that once I get far enough along, I won't be able to fly, so I'll probably be disappointing them rather than making a good impression. 

I'm also currently fortunate enough that my dad is my landlord, and he is very fair when it comes to rent. So we technically don't have many expenses at the moment where we currently live. I would be giving that up if I were to take this job. And we would have to dig into our savings to make this move, something I'd really rather not do because of the baby on the way.

As I mentioned I already signed the offer letter. Can I get in trouble if I back out now? Should I come clean to my future employer and tell them of my situation? Should I talk to my brother and tell him I'm pregnant even though it's really early? Should I just suck it up and make the move and take the position, even if I may be let go once the baby comes and possibly be forced to move back? What would you do if you were in my situation? I'm really trying to do what's best, and I don't want to end up regretting my decision.

1c0eyyo,"Advice surviving a ""Right to work"" state","So I've experienced two jobs so far that fired me for poor work performance a week before my probationary period was finished.

The first job, a agricultural test facility, I didn't mind losing due to me quickly losing morale due to the lack of training and unprofessional coworkers.

The second job, at a brewery, had 2.5 months worth of training (1.5 in one area, 1 in second), professional workers, and a very good atmosphere. The only negative effect was being suddenly fired two hours after my shift was over with no explanation. I was actually surprised because I was making small improvements everyday with my trainer not having to give me negatives.

How am I supposed to keep peace of mind if companies are willing to drop me like a fly? Does anyone have any insight into what I can do better, because these jobs didn't give any context other than firing me for poor work performance. I feel used, honestly. I've bills to pay and I'd prefer not to have to job-hop by force.

1c0ekbk,Unemployment and lost,"I need any suggestions and recommendations, my current situation is really pulling me down and losing hope for my future self. 

I am currently a millennial mom and I have one kid, I basically have worked my whole life up until I had my child and a few on and off seasons when I went full time in college.

Backstory:
My degree is a Bachelor of Arts in biology and at the time I had no intention of going to medical school I just really enjoyed the subject and thought I worked my way into being a scientist of some sort. I found I really enjoy my labs and did really well and was one of the top students in my labs. I didn’t know at the time that there was a degree in medical science technology, if I had known I would have chosen that career.
Forward to now:
 But once I graduated in 2023, I have found no opportunities that would even allow me in entry level. The closest job I started was in Labcorp and it was the most toxic environment ever, I really tried to stick it out but I couldn’t stand how management went so I quit before i could land another job and if I tried to apply to similar companies like Quest they immediately overlook my application because I didn’t even stay atleast 6 months. I am so desperate at this point and now I just apply to anything I think I can get but it’s already been 4 month and all rejections. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I looked into certifications for med tech but found only a few schools offer it and none online unless some circumstances. I tried counseling and career counseling advice, I reached out to colleagues and friends. I don’t understand why I can’t land not one job. I get interviews and screening but never the offer.

I am grateful to have my husband support me in this time but I honestly need to get something soon and I’m just so lost now. I really feel like I won’t ever get out of this life and I just want to be able to support myself and family. 

Honestly anything helps, and if you have no career advice atleast words of encouragement are welcome too.

1c0efme,Is Taking on a Leadership Position the Right Move for Me?,"Hey guys,  


I've been working as a Data Analyst/Entry Specialist for a startup for over 3 years now. I started working for them part-time while I was still in college. When I graduated, they offered me a very flexible position in terms of schedule and reasonable pay, which I accepted.  
  
Fast forward to the present, we are in the midst of expanding our market to another country, and my boss (the business owner) wants me to take over his current role so he could focus on other things. We would then hire someone to eventually take over my current duties. He informed me that he's entrusting me with the responsibility to decide how the employees under me will work and we are expected to deliver the results. If someone on the team makes a mistake, the responsibility ultimately falls on me as the leader, which is understandable.  
  
I expressed my anxiety to him about this development due to my lack of prior leadership experience. However, he assured me that making mistakes is a normal part of growth, which I appreciate. Nevertheless, I'm unsure if accepting this role would be overreaching. While our team is currently small, we plan to expand into more markets, which would require me to manage employees in those markets as well.  
  
What are your thoughts? I know experience is the best teacher in this case, but any advice is greatly appreciated. 🙏

1c0csh3,Out of nowhere the requirements for promotion got changed. What should be the next move? ,"For a bit of background, I work for the government and one of the main requirements to become a senior and get a huge pay bump is to be there for two years and get 8 certificates through examination. For about the first year and a half, I worked very hard on getting my certifications and focused hard on my assigned programs that my boss wanted me to work on. Because of unprecedented influx of one programs workload, I got pulled out of some of my workload to play catch up. In this time, I created SOP's and gave continuously asked my boss what are the steps for becoming a senior. She told me since this program I'm in is so overloaded in work, that can be my senior ""expertise"". I understood what I meant as each of my senior has their own unique program that they only do. 

Fast forward to now, I have applied to the job and my application got accepted.  When asked my boss what the following procedure was to get pronoted or what more work needs to be done, she said she wanted me to become an expert on programs I got pulled out on and then a program I gave had zero training on. Due to governmental budgeting, they may have an answer for me by July but the budget cuts might prevent me getting promoted. 

I emailed my boss I'm excited to learn as much as I can to be a ""good asset to the team"", but truly I'm a bit upset that the additional workload that has been asked of me out of nowhere when I continuously have asked what more I can do to expedite the promotional procedure and my boss saying nothing to now this just sucks. 

Should I mention that to my boss? Truly, I'm excited to become a better employee and I love the atmosphere here. But I just feel a bit blindsided about this all last second.

1c0cqfg,Where is the greener grass?!?,"I’ve been involved in the AG business most of my life. Come from a generational family business, my dad sold out as I was completing post secondary (little to no discussion as to what was transpiring).

As a youngster (14) I started sweeping floors, helping mechanics, progressed to machinery setup and fixing/ repairing things as a grew up working thru the business in my late teens. 

I played college sport in NCAA, finished schooling in late 2010, moved home and began to manage multiple stores. I started at $66k in 2011 and by 2019 I was making over $200k managing multiple stores, now under a public company, zero nepotism, if I suck im gone. 

I still felt all the money was in the selling. 100% commission.  I loved dealing with customers and rather not babysit employees 

 Switched over in 2020 and have out-earned anything I made managing… easily. Last 2 years I netted just under $1M combined.  I am not a happy camper. 

Turned 40 recently, totally uninterested in work. I still feel somewhat compelled to be apart of the business as it stems from family but in the same breath… had I known my father was selling at the time I would have taken something totally different in school.  I’m too late to pursue commercial aviation, I was the only boy and somewhat “groomed” for this since birth. I would be 5th generation. Nowhere near retiring. 

Tossed around going into biz by ourselves. Limited market in a town of less than 5000, I’m not making $400k and my wife isn’t making $150k as an engineer running a typical restaurant or retail store. 

Just seems like a lot of work for nothing in Canada these days. I hate being here. I just need a spot to vent. I’m not a happy guy, I wish I was happier for my boys. I don’t get it.

My pay was originally $48k and some change, and it is now $49k and some change (Last person promoted was in Nov and went from 48k to 53k).

1c0c74f,Seeking advice: Should I take a role despite red flags? ,"So I've been job searching for the past 4 months since leaving my last full-time role. I've received a few offers but turned them down because the hours were long or the managers seemed difficult to work for. 

My savings provide enough of a buffer that I can go without an income for a year. Currently I have a flexible part-time job to help with finances and care for my 2-year-old twins, but the pay is low and the work unfulfilling. 

Now I've received another offer that seems alright role-wise, but I'm concerned about the potential manager. She seems very old school - being even a minute late is unacceptable, yet she expects employees to regularly work overtime (no one is leaving on time, according to her). She also badmouthed some of her teammates during our interview. 
Plus, with her inflexible attitude and focus on attendance, it would be hard to keep up my job search if I take this job. 

I'm hesitant to take the role with these red flags, but it's the only offer I've had in months of searching. With the current job market and economy, I'm wondering if I should compromise and accept an imperfect position for now, even though it would mean sacrificing more family time due to the long hours expected. Cause I can forsee it may be challenging to find an ideal role anytime soon given the current job market. 

Does it make sense to take a less than ideal job offer given my circumstances, just to have steady income and work while I continue my search?

Previously, I worked for 2 cities, a township, a country club, and a college, all in recreation positions, where I programmed a wide variety of events and activities for the respective communities, community outreach, cost recovery, grant writing, part time staff supervision, etc., etc. I also owned and ran a youth sports franchise for a year down in FL part-time up until my wife was involved in a car accident (even though it was PT, I was busy with it every weekend, non-stop.).

understanding, caring people ever. Their whole mentality is “as long as your work is done, I don’t care what you do. Your adults, I don’t need to manage you.” They made it very clear they want us to not feel like our lives revolve around work. We literally have all the freedom we could ask for. We come into work anytime we want from 7:30-9am, we all leave around 4:00. We can take however long of a break is needed. You need to run an errand during work hours? Do it, no questions asked. Need to call in? Absolutely not an issue. Work from home whenever it’s needed. I literally bring my dog to work with me a least once a week & they love it!  Literally anything you want to do, do it.

1c09r7p,pre-med student weighing their options,"I've been working as a medical assistant for almost a year now. I started as a volunteer and was only there on days that the PA worked - it's a small office so either the PA is working or the doctor is working and then one medical assistant is helping them out. I was offered a job and began working but was still only working for the PA as her med assistant bc of how my school schedule worked out.    
When the spring semester started, my schedule changed and I could only work on the doctor days. I had heard horror stories of this lady, and everyone always complained about her. I thought I'd be tough enough to make due and stick it out till summer & then I'd change my schedule back only working on the PA days. 

  
well fast forward, this woman is terrible. I get why she has not been able to keep a med assistant for more than a year, everyone quits on her. But now, since I have cut back on my hours bc of school and the other med assistant has had to pick up my hours since she's out of school - when I am free over the summer, the other med assistant is taking priority (which I get) and is not working on doctor day's and only on PA days. meaning I have to work the only doctor days every week. 

  
some more information; when I was first hired, it was because 3 med assistants quit at the same time, and I was their only option. I worked 12 hour shifts 6 days a week for a month straight to help this small practice stay operating. They hired two new people who, only after a month of working, I was responsible for training before I started school again. and of course I did it and it sucked and I worked heavy hours into the school year until they were good to work on their own. 

  
the worst part.... I was originally applying to medical school this cycle so I asked the doctor for a letter of recommendation. I am good at my job and thought this would be a good rec. Well, after 3 reminders the doctor has not written this letter. I feel as if that is the biggest slap in the face. it really pisses me off.

  
I am taking the mcat in august and spending my summer studying. I have a volunteer position set up at the local children's hospital and I work as a co-founder for a profit organization - so I have other things on my plate and schedule. 

  
The best part about the job is how flexible they are, I don't think I'd be able to find a new medical position job that would only let me work 1-2 days a week until august...and I am taking off a lot of time this summer to balance studying life and work. 

  
Do I quit now and just spend the summer focusing on what I already have? Or do I drag out the timeline and clinical hours for the summer and work two days a week until my MCAT. 

  
Are the couple months and extra hours worth it on the application?? ",Remarkable_Life7389,1,1.0,0,1712713669,2024-04-10 01:47:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c09r7p/premed_student_weighing_their_options/,4,2024

Cdn Citizen (this is imp, i'll explain later) . Work in a big 5 bank in Canada developing policies and strategies that directly affect the Retail Business of the bank. Make 110K base, WFH 3 days. Protected Weekends, Benefits and 20-25 vacation days a year.  
Recently, a prospective MBA Student was talking to me about choosing Rotman U or Booth U and they made really good points for both sides. Of course, what set apart Booth was the fact that Booth is more globally known but also that people who get out of both make like 150K to 175K base. I am also aware of how much my friend in IB makes.(alot, works for the same bank as me)  
I have recently been very dejected. I feel like I haven't done enough. It's been almost 5 years since I entered the professional world and almost all other people I know are making bank. I know I sound ungrateful but I am not. I just want to be in a position where I can provide for my families wishes. Like mum wants to travel sometimes and I don't want to not be able to buy her a ticket without thinking about money you know? I don't drink, go clubbing or socialize by going to clubs (i guess that helps me save up)  
What am I missing? Why does it feel like everyone else is doing better?  
\> Should I go find a job in the states? (the CDN citizen thing might help getting a TN visa?)  
\> Should I bite the bullet and try to pivot into IB or something like that? (Might have to do a certification or something since I didn't get into IB straight outta U of T).  
\> Should I ignore the above and keep trying other non-traditional pathways like fintech strategies or something? Not sure if I can make it

1c06ien,"Laid Off, But Still at the Company","I am an office worker at a large company in the US. During a regularly scheduled one on one meeting with my boss, he said my last day will be May 17th - The market the company I work for is in a lull and they need to make cuts; they did a ""last in, first out"" type of deal - or at least that's the explanation they gave me.

I am dealing with a wide array of emotions; sadness, anger, confusion, all under a layer of shock.

When my boss gave me the news, he said he was not dealing with it well himself. He said he gets compliments on my work often so the decision was not based off performance. He also said he didn't sleep last night as he knew he had to tell me today.
He added that he'll do whatever he can to find me an open position in one of the company's subsidiaries and if not, he'll write me a letter of recommendation and reach out to a recruiter he knows.

I think we were both in a weird headspace so we didn't have this discussion, and I know we should... But like, aside from all those emotions, it also just seems like an awkward situation to me. Like... I'm an employee, but there's a clear time limit. 

Advice needed: do I give full effort? Do I participate in the daily morning meetings with the team? How much (time, thought) do I invest in the job?

It's strange to me because it feels like the other employees have a reason to give their all, and now, I'm just a guy whose hanging out for a few weeks.

1c05oi2,Scared to turn down an internal promotion (that I did not ask for) - what can I do?,"*For context:*

*I am in my mid 20s, I work in the non-profit arts sector in Canada, and I am hoping to go back to school for a MA in September.*

I was recently accepted into Grad school and have been mentally preparing to leave my current position in just over 4 months. I have not given notice at this point since I have not officially enrolled in the program (still too early), and I want to be realistic in the fact that these plans could still fall through (if the program is cancelled, there is a university strike, there is natural disaster etc.). However, I am really not looking to advance my career at this point.

My workplace is a small organization, and I like the people I work with. I enjoy my job because it is typically low stress, but recently we have been understaffed due to budget cuts which has made the regular workload more tiring. I am also trying to balance this with moving house/applying for school funding outside of work - so just more stress than usual all round. I was called upon today and offered an ""addition to my portfolio"" which would come with a raise, but also more responsibilities in an area that I am not confident in; the new position would not be something I would have applied for based on my skills and interests.

I do not know if this is something I am even allowed to turn down? My current contract does stipulate ""additional responsibilities as required"". Seemingly they want me to take this project on so that they do not have to hire an additional staff member, but that makes me anxious to think that I would be easily replaceable if I do not agree to the new role, and they might try to have me leave sooner if they know I plan to leave in 4 months. If I do take the position, I would feel like I let them down if I end up leaving so soon after accepting it, or if I don't leave I would be stuck in a role I never wanted in the first place. I don't want to ruin any relationships, and would value references from this workplace for future job applications. I need to keep saving for my move, and can't afford to be unemployed before I go to school.

Should I be worried about job security? What is my best course of action here: To let them know I am not looking to advance my career at this time? OR take the promotion and suck it up?

TLDR: My boss wants me to take on a new position I would not enjoy, and offered a small pay increase/promotion. I want to lay low in my current position until I hopefully leave for school. Can I say no without fear of losing my job if they know I am leaving?

1c050sc,Feeling overwhelmed ,"Have I messed up my life? 

I ( M,24) live in Birmingham, and while I'm usually outgoing, good at networking and love socializing and being active. But lately, the irony is I have no one to talk to or hang out with.

My academic and work experiences suddenly feel irrelevant. During my bachelor's and masters in the UK (automotive field), I actively participated in Formula Student teams, launched a B2B/B2C business, and worked as a mechanical design and mechanical engineer. Yet, it feels useless right now. I still don't know what I will do with my existing experience and skills. I have been trying to find junior/entry level job positions where I can be a bridge between technical and business teams but since last April, I've applied to over 700 jobs with no luck. Even with experience, I haven't landed an interview. I've broadened my search beyond automotive, but things are going downhill.
I tried tailoring my CV, made cover letters but this entire process doesn't seem to help at all.

I'm feeling hopeless. My student loan repayments start in September, and I just lost my 11-hour/day supply chain supervisor job due to company administration. I stayed positive, wanting to prove myself and make my parents proud. Even while working daily-wage jobs, I meticulously planned my finances to steadily repay my student loans. 
Now, I'm on the verge of giving up and returning home.

At one point, I even felt like self-harm, but the isolation... it just sucks. All my efforts - learning, designing, manufacturing, securing sponsorships, and handling a business consultancy project during my dissertation - seem wasted.

I'm lost. This whole situation feels so heavy, it's hard to even recognize myself. There's more to say, but I'm overwhelmed. It feels like I've failed my parents and those who believed in me.

1c04w7g,Pushing 40 and still paycheck to paycheck,"\*\*throwaway account for anonymity\*\*

I just turned 37 and still live paycheck to paycheck. I never went to college and started working life in the restaurant industry. I bumbled around a couple industries after that, but currently I work in a junior management role for a local sign making company that is extremely successful and while I feel as if I’m well liked there, I don’t really foresee this place being my meal ticket and still make under $50k/yr. My wife has a degree and some extra certificates and makes considerably more than me but is still underpaid in her field and furiously looking for a new opportunity. My wife and I have a kid and we have a mound of debt we have not been able to squash for probably close to 7-8 years now.  
I have been trying to develop a side hustle by woodworking out of my garage, and have had inspiration on a number of products I could market and make money on but have not been able to put pen to paper on anything, so to speak. I’ve been living in my current house with my garage shop set up as such for 8 years and I don’t have an Etsy shop or have made a single sale on FB marketplace. My job has always required me to be on my feet and much more active than most other office jobs so more often than not I come home and crash as opposed to being productive in the shop. I have tried pumping energy drinks to stay up but caffeine sends my stomach into knots and makes me incredibly drowsy the next day, repeating the cycle over again. No matter what I try, 8:30-9pm rolls around and my eyes get super heavy.  
Due to this, life has been increasingly more overwhelming the past few years. Our work/home balance feels non existent. We have 48 short hours over the weekend to do chores and errands, none of which get completely done and typically is in sacrifice of something else on our social calendar, or vice versa. Our home is a decent sized home in a nice neighborhood but inside (and out) we have not been able to keep it properly maintained. We have unfurnished rooms, unless it’s an emergency things that get broken remain broken if it costs money to fix, and a finished basement that is so cluttered and messy you’d think we are Stage 5 Hoarders. (We are not, at least for the most part— but we are in dire need of organization and inventorying… all that takes time) We have overgrown and unruly bushes shadowing the house and weeded-over flower beds all summer long because we can barely spend the 90 minutes it takes to cut the grass every week.  
My wife and I tallied up everything and we are probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $50k in debt. We discussed dream scenarios where if we magically both got better paying (but still relatively reasonable) jobs tomorrow, we’d still be digging ourselves out for the next two years— while still retaining our daily routine (that is burning her and myself out).  
I struggled with putting this in r/lifeadvice or a financial sub or somewhere else entirely but ultimately since the majority of my issues would be solved with higher incomes I chose here. One of the biggest solutions that I continue to deliberate over is whether or not to quit my job and focus on being a SAHD. This would give me the freedom to focus on my son’s life and education, something that is an afterthought in our parenting style due to our life structure. This would give us the freedom to cut out expensive meal prep subscriptions and consolidate our grocery bill. And of course, allow more opportunity to make money making things in my shop.  
But then there’s the lack of steady, albeit not enough, income. A forever catch 22, and a point of contention between my wife and I for some time.  
Probing for any and all advice, TIA

1c04h5o,I screwed up the last 2 years..,"I messed up recently. I’ve gone through ALOT of jobs the past 2 years. I’m talking 8 or 9 at this point.. half of them I was let go, half of them I quit. Without going into too much detail, I’ve had a ton of personal and life problems. 

However, before all of that, my resume actually looks pretty good. My longest job was 4.5 years as a shift manager. Also 2.5 years at a respectable financial firm. Plus 2-3 years of sales experience(which I hated).

My question is- do I lie a little on my resume about the past 2 years? I’ve already been denied several jobs because of my resume. I don’t even have all of the jobs listed at this point. The first job that comes up is Amazon Flex for 2.5 years, even though it was mostly part time. I figured that looked better..

1c04d7n,Help Quitting Job,"Okay everyone I need HELP and please no judgment!!! 

So my fiancé got a job in a new city which means I will be moving at the end of the month. I am currently working an entry level admin/assistant position for a local company that is family owned. Majority of the employees have been here for 10+ years and are very old school. I’ve known I needed to tell my boss I’m leaving for about a week now but every time I’ve tried I’ve gotten extremely anxious and chickened out. (I am a highly anxious person so keep that in mind) I know what I need to do and I know this happens all the time but it’s been very hard to get over my anxiety about quitting. My boss is great and really likes me so it makes me feel guilty leaving. To make matters worse, I just had my annual review and he wants to move me up into a higher position. I know this leave will be extremely unexpected for him and I just need advice on how to go about it.

1c03jrf,"I love the work that I do, but I hate the freelance nature of it. Should I go a more traditional route and pursue my creative work as a hobby?","I work in the creative field as a freelancer. I love the work that I do, the problem is that the nature of freelance often puts me in two frustrating positions. 1) I'm billing appropriately for my projects, but there aren't enough projects 2) it sometimes feels like my job is finding the next job rather than the work I am actually contracted to do.  


Recently, I pitched a project to a company I freelance for that has the potential to turn into something huge (for me) and it was greenlit. The problem is that I have no certainty that the company will be comfortable either increasing my billable hours or hiring me as an employee as the project needs more of my attention. Either of those are reasonable, and I think they would eventually go for one of those options, but they like to move slowly and I can't be sure if my income will keep up with my needs in a timely manner.  


On the flip side, I was recently approached about a sales position in a field I'm familiar with. It's not exciting and the work itself would not likely be as fulfilling as the creative work, but it wouldn't be boring and it would pay the bills. My biggest draw to it is that I'll actually be able to turn off ""work mode"" when I clock out. Freelancing means I'm working against deadlines rather than a timeclock, so I've worked lots of late nights to turn in my work on time; not to mention, when I'm in between projects I'm constantly thinking about where the next job will come from.  


I feel like the \*rational\* decision is to pick the sales position and work on creative projects in my free time, but I'd be losing an opportunity to head up the project of a lifetime, one that would very likely push my creative career into a comfortable position... eventually.

1c03d9c,Better to stay in a stable hourly position at a small business for bad pay or take a short contract offer at a big company for more pay and a better title that will help my resume?,"TL;DR: On one hand, my current job pays terribly and isn't helping my resume anymore, but it's a stable full-time job with benefits and there's a good chance I'll be chosen to fill a desirable position that recently opened up. On the other hand, I have an offer from a larger company that would give me more/better experience than I'm getting in my current role and comes with a good title and a pay increase of nearly 70% my current hourly rate, but it's only a 6-month contract and they have no plan to hire me direct afterwards and no guarantee the headhunter will be able to find me more work. Do I use the offer to try to negotiate with my current company to move me up into the open position immediately and give me a respectable salary? Do I wait for something more stable to come up? Or do I take the new offer and run?

Context: I have a degree in a somewhat niche engineering field, and for 1.5 years I have been stuck in the “engineering support”-type hourly role I landed after college. The job is with a small business that was recently acquired by a global company, and since it isn't a true engineering title, the pay is abysmal for someone with my qualifications. I was promised opportunities to move up and have worked my ass off to learn and prove my worth (I already do typical entry-level engineer tasks) but they keep making excuses as to why they can’t even change my title. 

More than 6 months ago I found out I was severely underpaid even for my position and I had to make a fuss and fight for months just to be paid a fair wage which only just went into effect this month. I started job hunting again during this time, not believing they would correct the pay discrepancy. They obviously did end up doing so, but this shook my faith in the company so I kept interviewing elsewhere.

Out of the blue, an engineering position recently opened up at my current company and my boss agreed I would be a great fit, but they and the higher ups are dragging their feet to even get approval to backfill it. If I do get the offer to fill it, they will almost certainly try to lowball me again.

I also just found out that a company I interviewed with is making me an offer. This would be a real engineering job at an international company with good standing, within my niche field, at a nearly *70%* increase to my current pay rate. The catch is that it’s only a 6-month contract, and while the (very reputable) headhunter is confident he can get me another contract or position on another project/in another location or at another company since this would put actual engineering experience on my resume, there's no plans at the moment to hire me directly and no guarantee of another contract.

Having never done contract work before, I worry about having to figure out health insurance and such, and I worry that I won't be able to find work quickly enough after the contract ends. That said, the promotion at my current company also isn't guaranteed, and it's likely that the pay will still be bad unless I have some leverage to negotiate higher. 

Does anyone have advice or experience in this kind of situation? Should I take the offer letter to my current boss and try to negotiate for them to move me into the open role immediately at a respectable salary? Even if they agree, would the full-time position and decent pay be worth staying at a company that's treated me badly before, or is a short contract at a better company with wildly higher pay and a title/experience that looks good on my resume worth the instability?",spvce-cadet,3,1.0,0,1712697079,2024-04-09 21:11:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1c03d9c/better_to_stay_in_a_stable_hourly_position_at_a/,4,2024

1c01kaw,How do I tell my boss that I've been signed off work due to stress because of poor management?,"I've recently seen my doctor about work related stress and they've recommended that I take two weeks off and given a sick note for my boss. 

My stress has been around poor management - I've been there for 2 years with a revolving door of managers. There's been no induction, training or support. We often get blamed and thrown under the bus for things that aren't our fault. When we try and communicate with our managers at all, our messages are ignored, while higher up staff seem to be favoured.

My confidence is shot because we're getting reprimanded for things that aren't our fault, and they haven't been meeting Occupation Health's recommendations for reasonable adjustments for my disability, so it's been taking a toll on my health. Morale is low with my colleagues and I dread going in each day.

After been ignored for a while by my manager, they've finally talked to me now that I'm off sick. She's asking what's making me stressed. I'm not a confrontational person and my confidence in general is pretty low. How do I tell manager that I'm feeling stressed because of the way that they're managing myself and my teammates?

1c01hpf,How to talk to current manager before applying to an internal position elsewhere? ,"Hi, so my current manager is great. Current position is good. I’ve been here for 2 years, during that period probably around 100k has been spent on training for the position. I’m being encouraged to apply for a position as a trainer at our company HQ however, which is located in an area my wife and I love and are very much willing to move to. As soon as I apply, they would reach out to my current manager to ask him about me, or at least notify him I have applied to be a trainer. 

How do I go about approaching my current boss that I intend on applying to an internal position, and would accept it if offered contingent on the quality of the offer itself? I genuinely do like this manager, he’s great but this position doesn’t come up often and the area is amazing. One of the highest rated school districts, amazing quality of life, etc. Pay of course is a pretty big bump up over my current compensation.

Having me leave would be a major blow to the region, beyond the fact that the region has spent a lot of money and time training me. A replacement hire is not quick to find based on the required skill set nor is it fast to have someone up to speed. I do genuinely feel like I’m kinda screwing him over, and the general advice from the people at HQ is that it’s needed to notify your current manager first. Just unsure of how. Any advice?

1bzzc9t,Worried about career growth and building useful professional experience,"Seeking advice or anecdotes from those who've faced similar career dilemmas.   
  
I'm in my mid-30s with a bachelor’s in Electronic Engineering Technology and experience as an electrical technician and quality engineer, currently in a role handling material master data (engineering position and having zero computer coding knowledge anymore) Despite nearly 6 years with the company, I feel stagnant and lack motivation, concerned about developing transferable skills for other roles or career paths. My current position feels more like administration than engineering, leaving me feeling like I'm learning nothing and not enhancing my resume. Additionally, I've begun to forget much of my education and previous work experience due to lack of use.   
  
My dilemma lies in uncertainty about where to go next or what I truly want to do or what I am good at in terms of a professional career. I fear potential layoffs and the struggle to find new opportunities. On the upside, I have a decent salary ($90k), a flexible schedule, low stress (aside from self-reflection), and solid benefits. However, I worry about losing out on continuing to contribute to my retirement funding (401k, Roth IRA, HSA) if I transition to a different or lower-paying career. I’d love to find a role that allows me to build transferrable skill sets, increase my salary, and mitigate job loss worries. Being able to work remotely is another big reason why I keep staying put since I believe a lot of WFH roles keep decreasing or the pool for these are over-saturated. I really would prefer to never work in the office again with how much wasted time it takes to prepare for the day and commute, which directly limits me from finding any new/potential opportunities.   
  
Looking for recommendations for specific courses, tutorials, certifications, online training, or higher education (struggle with the thought of gaining new debt outside of a mortgage now) that could help boost my career potential and opportunities. I enjoy grinding and working towards something, but I feel like I am just lacking direction or what would be worth the time in the long run. Thanks in advance!

1bzyymg,Feel lost and don’t know what to do,"I am 20 years old, got into a well respected college (in my country) straight out of high school at 18. 

I already have a guaranteed well paying job from my internship once i graduate, but I don’t identify with nothing in my field at all. I don’t want to work in it and it wouldn’t lead me to where I want to be in life. 

I’ve talked to my parents a lot about switching degrees and they do support me, my father always said how he also couldn’t see me working in the field I’m studying right now. But they never really try to guide me into something else, since they probably don’t want to impose anything, but I want their opinion on my possible options - I have to decide if I’ll switch by the end of thee semester - and all they say is “do what you want”.

I had a field of engineering in mind since it gives good opportunities and I’d be able to get a master’s abroad which I really want, BUT… It takes 5 years to graduate, meaning i would be graduating at almost 26, instead of 23 if I stay in the path I’m in right now.

I feel like a failure for waiting so long to switch to something I like and it just feels like I wasted so many important years when I should be building my career. I dread the fact that I’d be graduating 3 years late, but also dread staying in the same path I’m in. I feel stuck. 

One important aspect is that my parents wish to move back to our home country once I graduate, and they’re really unhappy here and I don’t want to keep them here any longer. I suggested going with them and transferring to a uni there, but I don’t know the language (even though the degree is in English, what kind of internships would I get without knowing the language??). 

I wanted to spend a year traveling after graduation to meet my family members in my home country and in other countries some have immigrated to, before I start to actually work and enroll in a master’s, but graduating at 26 I wouldn’t have time to lose anymore. 

Please give me your opinions on this. Even though some people have told me it’s alright as long as i graduate before 30, I can’t help but see 25-26 year olds already working and having a good life and imagine myself still studying at that age, with nothing concrete built. Plus, I really wanted to take that year to meet my family, but that’s just not a possibility if i graduate at 26. 

Part of me thinks that when I’m 80 years old I won’t think about taking a year off even though I graduated at 26 to actually spend time with my family I only know from a phone calls before it’s too late, but part of me feels like a failure for wasting time and not building a career early.

1bzynz1,"I am considering a position at my old employer, but I can't tell if it is a good move for my career, or if I am making a big change due to grief.","I have been working as a data/financial analyst for seven years. Five years of my experience is from the gaming industry. I left about two years ago for the banking industry, and up until this last year, I enjoyed it.   
  
My salary is 20% higher than my last position ($80K), I get every holiday off, and I get to work remotely a few days per week. The days I have to go in, my commute is only two miles. To top it all off, the work is very low stress. I have been taking foundational classes for a master’s degree program that I intend to start this coming fall (Computer Science), and although the courses are challenging, it hasn’t interfered with work and I find that I can juggle both successfully.  
  
However, this last year has been incredibly challenging for me. My brother was first diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, I lost two grandmothers, and, a month ago, my brother’s cancer took a dramatic turn for the worse. In fact, I am about to take leave to help him.   
  
While my current boss has never challenged my requests for bereavement leave, he hasn’t exactly been understanding. Last year, I was told about my brother’s diagnosis while I was in the office and became upset. He asked about it, and I told him. He shrugged and said, “Huh. I haven’t talked to my brother in 25 years,” and carried on.  
  
My second grandmother to pass suffered from Alzheimer's, and it was difficult to witness, especially in her last few months. After her funeral, which I attended, we had our annual reviews. My current boss noted that I was disengaged, and my scores, and therefore raise, were lower because of it.   
  
Despite all this, I have continued to work for him, and I have a few reasons. Now that I have been employed for more than one year, I am eligible for the state’s paid family medical leave, which I intended to use for my brother and future family planning. Also, initially, I did not want to start a new job while starting my master’s program. I intended to continue with this job for now, and apply for paid internships in the second year. I thought it would look better on my resume to work someplace for 3 to 4 years and then an internship rather than 2 years here, 1 year there, and then an internship.  
  
About one month ago, my brother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and the tumor has been aggressive. I applied for state paid family leave immediately and informed HR about my intentions. I told my current boss about my brother’s diagnosis, but not yet the leave at the direction of HR. His initial reaction was kinder than I expected, given his history. But later in the week, our team noticed that he seemed crankier than usual. In one meeting he started ripping into me unnecessarily and someone else stepped in to defend me.   
  
Coincidentally, that same day, my old boss in the gaming industry reached out to me about a new position on his team that he wanted me to apply for - FP&A Manager at $110K.  
  
Here are the caveats: the gaming industry is challenging for a variety of reasons. It’s fast-paced, which part of me enjoys, and 24/7. There are few paid holidays, a 25-minute commute on a good day, and you can only work remotely for emergencies or if you are ill. Also, because it is on a reservation, they had the choice to opt into the state PFML program. They opted out. Once I take my five weeks of leave to help my brother, that's it. I won't be eligible to go back should he need me. The job is also far more stressful than my current role, which could pose a challenge once my master’s program begins.   
  
Finally, my old boss was part of the reason why I left in the first place, not that he is aware. I left on good terms. It was early COVID, election season, and he was the kind of person who believed that the vaccines were used for mind control. Jewish lasers in the sky, all that. I can tolerate different ideas, but at some point it becomes too much, especially if you are inundated with ten-minute harangues on a daily basis. I chatted with my old teammate recently, and they claim that my old boss has calmed down a lot since then. He had a major surgery after I left and it seemed to improve his general attitude.  
  
The benefits?  The pay is attractive, as it would enable me to pay for college and save for other goals. I still have friends at the workplace, and I am familiar with most C-suite folks there. Their health insurance is far better than the one my current employer provides. It would cost an additional $80 per month to add a spouse/child to the insurance as opposed to the extra $500-1,000 per month with my current plan. As a manager, I would get a 15% bonus at year-end if goals are met, which I know they have been met for six out of seven years. A minor plus is the free food at the employee cafeteria.  
  
Also, although I mentioned that my old boss was part of the reason why I left, he is also part of the reason why I am interested in returning. He is very empathetic to my situation, as his wife was diagnosed with cancer while I worked for him. Fortunately, she is now in remission. I also know that the CFO, and a lot of the team is excited at the prospect of me returning, and they have also been incredibly understanding.  
  
However, I worry that this position may interfere with my career goals in the future as it seems like a deviation from my experience with data and business intelligence, and I worry about most of my experience coming from one industry.  
  
I worry that my decision to return to my old workplace has more to do with my anticipatory grief than my career. I find myself craving familiarity and kindness that I am not getting from my current workplace.

I'm at a loss for what to do. I could use some advice if anyone has changed jobs while experiencing some major life changes or grief.

1bzymc0,DACA renewal not coming in time + PIP at work,"Advice?

getting nervous about DACA renewal time, mine is set to expire on 04/21

I sent my documents on 02/14

I have filed expedite requests, contacted white house, and representatives.

Currently going to be placed on a performance improvement plan at work, I have until this friday 04/12 to decide if i go through the plan (the metrics are reasonable i have confidence i can beat it)

If i choose to not go through with the plan I will receive 2 months of pay as severance. 

My concern is that I will not get my renewal + document in time and will have to be placed on a leave of absence during my PIP. Is this grounds for dismissal? or would my PIP simply continue until after I can come back?

 I have not informed management or HR of the renewal situation as I do not want them to revoke the 2 months pay offer if they find out I may not be eligible to work soon.

What should I do?

Take the 2 months pay and look for a new job? But even then would I be able to job search without valid EAD? or accept the PIP on friday, then go on a likely leave of absence when my status expires?",luisxo,1,1.0,0,1712685508,2024-04-09 17:58:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bzymc0/daca_renewal_not_coming_in_time_pip_at_work/,4,2024

1bzxxf6,Unsure if I should pivot my career. Any advice is appreciated ,"To provide some context, I am a 28-year-old male without a college degree and some debt that I am agressively working to repay. Before this, I worked as an Uber driver for over five years before joining my current company, which is a small business. I have been with this company for over a year, and about six months ago, my boss offered me the opportunity to take on a business administration role despite my lack of prior experience. The understanding was that I would learn everything from him and eventually take over the business as he gradually steps back. However, this has not been the case. The business is still relatively new, having only been in operation for five years, and there has not been a proper system in place for the admin side because up until 6 months ago my boss was the only person handling it all. I believe that my boss has not adequately prepared me for success in this role, and he has even threatened to reduce my salary and replace me with someone who can do the job better for half the cost due to the mistakes I have made. Additionally, I work seven days a week without any benefits and very limited time off. Essentially, I am handling the workload of two to sometimes three people without a proper work-life balance. I am in a bit of a cross road. I am very grateful for the opportunity that has been given to me, and I am passionate about the work that I am doing. However, I am not sure if the company is the best fit for me. I am experiencing a great deal of stress, and I am not sure if it is worth continuing in this position. I am wondering if it would be better to persevere and try to overcome the challenges (even though things might never change), or if I should look for another job that would make me happier while stepping down from my current role.

","Hey everyone :) I’m Tuan! I’m currently doing research for a project and I'm looking to interview ambitious, career driven, hard working, healthy & goal oriented professional women, who wants to walk into any gym alone and use the gym equipment confidently on their own and make meal plans on their own so that they can ultimately improve their health, feel confident in their bodies and get clarity on exactly how to create an exercise and meal plan without relying on others or investing hundreds of dollars each session for a personal trainer.

They don’t feel confident walking into the gym on their own and don't how to workout correctly and don't know what to eat to become confident in their bodies. They have tried for +3 years. They are not seeing results no matter what they do. When they walk into the gym they feel embarrassed or insecure and they don’t go to the gym alone. They enjoyed taking group classes but never tried working out solo and feel quite green to working out. They have leaned on friends to get help, but never felt confident enough to doing it for themselves.

Their urgency is that they are very social and they always felt confident in their personality, but it did not reflect in their looks. It often make them very critical of themselves and they think extremely about what other people think about them. It makes them feel like the clothes don’t fit right on them, which makes them feel very insecure, not confident, uncomfortable in their bodies. They hate looking themselves in the mirror and that also stopped them from going out. They have been unhappy with how they look for +3 years and it makes them sad looking at pictures of themselves.

It would mean so much to me if we could chat for 30-45 minutes, as I would like to know what topics are of importance to you.

If you are open to it, comment below

I am a graphic designer who just graduated with my master's degree in Italy (i'm from europe but not italy) and got this job through a 6 months internship (no pay during these 6 months okay, it's an internship) So when they communicate to me they want me to stay, i am joyful, only to discover a weird type of agreement with a monthly pay of 550€. I have two internships in past professional experience, so not much. 

I work 8h from mon-friday, one day every two weeks remote more or less. That's less than 4€ per hour. The thing is that my ""contract"" ends in December this year, and while i don't have any binding agreement to stay until then, I'm not sure if leaving the job early as a young professional is good for me right now. I also considered negotiating the salary with the director when the contract is 6 months, in summer, but i heard other co-workers try that and get nothing but awkwardness. 

Right now i can only pay my rent (a room in a shared apartment) with my salary, and my parents help me with groceries and other daily stuff, which i would like to cut out, so i could be fully independent. I'm 24 years old. 

I would appreciate some kind of advice on how to approach this situation.

In the meanwhile got 2 projects and they have taken me for billinng purpose and left me afterwards.

Last year in June I got my first real time project in SAP area and I am very much interested to learn as all of my friends getting real time work experience but here in having close to 2 years of bench experience.

After finally they took me into the project and said you are the only junior in our group and I feel it would be very useful as I could learn more from seniors.

After some days into the project we got to know we have to work in shifts and my lead convinced me that I should be in night shift 11Pm to 8 Am as I could learn something in free time and other 3 team members ( 2 senior resources and one mind level resource women) will be working in morning and afternoon shifts.

Even I'm convinced that I can have so much free time and that too for night shifts we are having exception to go to office so I can pull off.

But most of the work and issues are all will be happening in the morning and afternoon, to be honest there is 1% of work at night that I can do.so i asked them I'll join important meetings so that I could learn something.

So from last 3 - 4 months I'm logging in at 4 PM and will be attending meetings upto 7 pm and will be on and off and will login at 10 PM.

As I observed there were no messages and mails at midnight I thought I'll sleep at 1 am and put alarams for 1-2 hrs gap and survive and I'll logoff at  7 am .

Until now all good but now I cannot able to sleep properly during day and night.what I feel is i didn't have a proper work timings and even if I ask leave my team is saying you can do all your works in the morning and can join at 11 pm.

Now after 3 months of working I felt there is no use of doing this shift i cannot able to understand anything fully and I am not learning anything new.

I decided to ask my lead that I'm having health issues and I cannot able to learn anything so I want to change my shift.

But I'm getting panicked as how will he receive my request.

Can someone please help me !!!

1bzwa28,"Covering maternity leave on another team, seems like a ridiculous ask","Hi everyone,

I’ve been working in a corporate role at manager level but with no direct reports for about 8 months. I have a lot of long term projects that are expected for my role with additional tasks at regular intervals, mostly quarterly or monthly. 

My role has essentially been put on hold so that I can cover for another manager’s maternity leave. She has a team of four with one of those people already on maternity leave. She is also hiring a new person on her team this week, so in total it will be five people reporting to her (me) when they’re all there. I guess I’m expected to train him? I barely even know what is going on with her team, so hoping he’s not miserable. They sprung that part on me just last week. I’ve been told she’ll be out for 5 months, and during that time, I should expect an 80/20 split between her team’s work and my work. Essentially, I’ll keep things going for my role, but it’s unlikely any long term projects will get completed. 

The thing is, this other team is only somewhat tangential to my current role. It’s more operational strategy, while my current role, background, degree, and future progression desires are all in finance. Of the people in my broader department, I do have the most exposure to this other team I’m covering on, but it’s not anywhere close to the capacity needed to properly fill in for this role. 

It seems normal to have maternity coverage, but from the same team. I feel like this is really a stretch of an ask, and all I’m getting are some gift cards through work rewards points lol I know my superiors like me and see a future for me, but I have no desire to work on this team. I actually had the opportunity to work for this manager who will be out, and I didn’t want to. It feels like I’m being forced into something. Her last working day is 10 days from now, and I just don’t know how to handle it. 

I’ve already felt somewhat dissatisfied with my work as it has been a bit boring lately, but now I feel like this is pointless. Why learn her role when I have zero interest or desire to be part of it? Maybe I can leverage it to work on one cool project that is coming down the line, but that’s basically it. Idk. I feel lost. I’m always down to help, and I already have an optional/voluntold position to support recruiting that is above and beyond. (That work will not stop when I’m covering for this leave btw) I always enthusiastically participate, and help wherever I can. I train people, I have 1:1s with analysts. I know I could see it as an “opportunity”, but now it feels like I’m being used. This was not optional by the way. The only option I have is do it or find a new job. 

Should I wait it out for five months? Should I leave? Hoping someone has amazing advice that will change my mind and just make me not feel miserable about this lol

I have been applying to a lot of places and have a second round interview lined up this week at a job that in theory seems like it would be much better.

My first interview went really and I wouldnt have expected review's experience based on my conversation.

I am trying to ask better questions in interviews to get a feel for work/life balance such as company culture etc. I just am not sure how you are supposed to know what you are getting yourself into when taking a job. I dont want to ask too many questions and risk appearing lazy or someone not willing to work harder when needed. But i made the mistake of not researching my current role enough.

Should I directly ask about these glassdoor reviews? Should i care about glassdoor reviews? Reach out to a former employees? I just dont really know how to research a company to fully know what to expect you are getting yourself into.

1bzw4jv,Should I move abroad?,"Hello everyone, I am 19 years old, and I'm from Italy. I have been working as a developer for almost a year.

By looking with my own eyes and listening to other people's experiences, I've concluded that the job market here in Italy is pretty abnoxious.

Some things that I noticed are:

* Inefficient work culture. Working overtime is considered more valuable than being efficient during the day.
* Paycheck is significantly lower than in other developed countries (e.g., the UK, Germany, and France), considering that Italy's salaries are 2% lower than in the '90s.
* It is impossible to prove your value unless you have a degree. Also, HRs tend to expect lots of tools and technologies rather than technical and adapting skills.

I was considering moving out (still inside Europe, though), but I'm still indecisive. I have lots of practical skills; I'm good at my job and what I do, but I don't have a degree, and I don't know if experience alone is enough to get me out of there. 

Also, I don't know if the effort to move out and completely change life is worth it for a somewhat better quality of life, considering I'm still very young.

Issue 2: I have a ""contract manager"", who handles contracting and is separate from the department where I work, telling me that growth opportunities are limited in my department so I should be aware of other opportunities (outside of my department and company). He guaranteed job security, but he said he wanted to have an honest conversation about growth prospects and conversion. It feels like he also has an ""ulterior"" motive with the contract gig -- which I am unaware of. However, the department where I work acknowledges my importance and growth ambitions. Some team members (with some decision-making power) said that they might push for my conversion. Again I dont have trust.

1bzus94,Create work to do in the office,"    Hi everyone,
    
    I would like to start by saying that I have been working in administration in the commercial sector for about 13 years for an industrial material resale company (family-run business).
    
    Dealing with my direct manager is practically impossible in terms of work, she is always right about everything and everyone and is totally closed to innovating/modifying the way of working, we still work like 20 years ago.
    
    Until now, for better or worse, I have always managed to move forward without problems but for several months now we have been asked to do, only me and my colleague from the administration (out of a total of more than 30 employees), a report of the activities carried out daily. He has a control freak and must know what is and isn't done in the office, but my thought is that he wants to shout/call out to us that we are stealing our salary by doing nothing during the day. (which has already happened to my colleague in the past)
    
    The problem is that during the day I actually have gaps, more or less large, in which I basically have little or nothing to do.
    Aside from resigning (which is under evaluation), how can I ""create"" some work to do and in the meantime fill this blessed timesheet without seeming like I'm really doing nothing.

1bztvux,"Non-profit I previously applied to reached out for a ""discovery call""","So I applied to work for this non-profit in an educational programming role a few months ago. I was told at that time that they went with a different candidate. Yesterday the ED reached out via email asking if I wanted to have a ""discovery call"" about the educational position I previously applied to as well as a new leadership position they are creating. I've scoured the Internet trying to find out what a discovery call is but all I've seen relate to sales calls. Has anyone heard this term? If so, how is this different than other phases of the job search process? I plan on treating it like an informational interview but I don't want to ruin my chances if that's too cavalier.

Also, would it be inappropriate to ask which of the two positions I'm best suited for? They have my resume and I think I could be a good fit for the leadership position because my experiences are all relevant and I'm working on a graduate certificate that literally matches the work I'll be doing to a T. Plus it's higher pay and salaried like I want.

But - and maybe it's imposter syndrome - I'm afraid that I'm too young to apply for leadership. But then again I think, why would she reach out about a position I'm unqualified for?

1bzt0ln,Undergrad career advice,"Hi. Thanks for reading this. I'm an undergrad junior looking for some career advice here. I'm finishing up a degree in econ (chose it more for its usefulness rather than actual interest although I don't hate it) and kinda have been feeling lost about what I want to do after graduation. Did consider going into banking but realized I liked the idea of it more than the actual thing which happens to me too often. Did research last summer and really didn't like it (would prefer working with people in a more dynamic environment). I have a background in the arts and would love something to do with creative process/innovation and have a career growth prospect. Recently took a few psych courses at my uni and enjoyed it so much I even started considering psych masters programs (even though I've decided long ago I want to work after graduation + can't afford it really). About a year ago, started looking into marketing/advertising + consulting but not sure. I've tried to keep trying different things but keep getting disappointed. And I guess I'm also worried on missing out on the thing that would suit me best but which I haven't tried yet. If anyone here comes from a similar background/has similar preferences and has found what they want to do in life, please feel free to share. I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

1bzsuf9,Should I leave my technical role for a supervisor role even if my first impression is that I don't like it?,"At my current job I do lots of technical and physics based analysis. I have a PhD in physics and love working on what I've heard referred to as ""engineering problems"". However, lately my supervisors have been wanting to put me in more of a team lead position and spend more time directing other people's work while coming up with budgets, schedules, level of effort, and attending meetings. I hate this kind of work, it takes me away from the actual math and physics while filling my day with endless emails and administrative tasks. Also it seems to be a much higher anxiety role and I find myself busying myself with other stuff as a distraction. I've been considering talking to my supervisor about it to ask to be returned to my previous tasking.

When I brought this up to some friends they were kinda baffled. They all want the supervisor role. Some said because the pay is better, but my pay is already great plus where I work raises are determined by your years of experience and performance (basically I'm not worried about how this will effect my pay). Others like being higher up in the company as they can have a higher impact. Others say the effort required for the job is lower. 

I don't want to dismiss their take out of hand just because my first impression of this work is that it's boring, tedious, and I'm bad at it. Has anyone else had this experience? Did you go back to more technical work? Did you tough it out?

1bzscwq,What is a valueable certificate / degree  nowadays?,"What is a valuable certificate / degree , nowadays ?


I apologize in advance for rambling, I just feeling very confused with the state of the job market.

I am 24 , living in Montreal. 

I want to get better education to get a better chance at life since my industry collapsed, but I'm struggling to make a choice. I feel like everytime I think I would like a field, I find out the industry is already oversaturated , doomed , or pays really badly. I have the financial means to study, and I am very lucky to have a strong network of friends and family to help me through these difficult times , but their advice has not really helped me so far, as they don't really know what they are doing either (hahaha..). 

 I am just wondering if there is an obvious path someone should follow or if we are all kind of choosing careers at random and hoping for the best..  

 I followed my dream in the past and got a 3D animation degree, actually managed to work in my field and make good money, and I felt like I had succeeded at life, and making plans for my future.  It was all taken from me as the industry experienced mass layoffs and is in danger due to AI and other factors.  I am not trying to repeat this mistake again and would like to follow a more traditional, safe path this time around... 


 I was considering residential painter, which I figure I could enjoy as it seems fun. (I am worried about the long term feasability of such a career though), a cybersecurity certificate, because I thought it was in demand (I was told it's  a bad idea as I have no prior IT experience or degrees) or animal health technician , after a friend working in the field told me she absolutely loves it, and I do love animals quite a lot also (college degree). 

 I am leaning on the last one , as It's the one I would have passion for.. But it's not the most well paid career. I suppose I have to decide if that matters to me at this point. 


I am also not against desk jobs but I struggle to understand what most administrative jobs actually require, and if getting a bachelor is necessary for every position.. 


Does anyone have any advice as to what is a feasable career path in this modern age ?

1bzrlyb,Should I stay in this field or take a chance and move on?,"I’ve worked at chain daycares as an assistant teacher from preschool to pre-k age students for 8 years and did full-time nannying too. Though I love working with children, I am very burnt out. Last September my grandmother passed away and I still haven’t felt like myself. She was like my mother and since I was 18 I became her caretaker (30 now). Before her passing, I just could not find a job and take care of her fully so I was not working for a year. 

I’ve lost that passion and patience for children and now I’m not sure what to do. My last job was in October and I only stayed 2 months. It was a pre-k teacher position at another typical chain. One of the worst places I worked at and management was always money hungry. I had children with horrible behavioral issues who would get physical with me and especially other children. The pay was horrible as well. And it seemed like management did not care. So I ended up giving my 2 weeks. 

Recently I got a call back for a position at a Montessori school that is privately owned that is well known in my county. I’m not sure how I feel about going back into this field again especially with how I feel so burnt out, but I need money so bad. 

I would like to advance in my life and about to graduate at the end of this month with a bachelor’s of psychology. I thought of maybe doing a transition into a different field. I heard of temp agencies and hoping maybe I can do a temp desk job at a university that is know for placing people there. I applied before a while back but got no response back and am not sure if it’s worth it to do it again. The pay and hours are much better compared to daycare work. Anyways, my ultimate career goal I would like to be a UX researcher. I love it and have been practicing/learning since 2022. I was hoping that if I got a temp desk job at that university that I can build connections with the HCI department and see if they can help in any way. Chances of happening would be slim, but who knows. What are your thoughts on my situation? Thank you.

1bzq78h,Microsoft internship issue ,"TLDR: Suspicious of rejection and team managers
Hi guys, so I'm a female (23 years) in my final year MBA and about to graduate. Cleared 4 rounds of interviews and then interned at Microsoft as a product manager during the summer. Did a bunch of preparation before the internship began and felt quite skilled. During the internship the first week was a little rough but I copped up easily and completed A BUNCH of work... YES A LOT AND I'M PROUD which none of my co interns could do (for example multiple feature requirements and mockups, customer interviews and product testing and at the end of 3 months, one of the features was launched to public which was a really HUGE deal). Many of seniors and managers as well as one India level Partner had posted about the feature on LinkedIn. All this made me really happy and i expected a pre placement offer for sure because of the quality and quantity of work. But alas everyone except 2-3 out of 18 got rejected and I was one of the rejected ones. All this baffled me and I still haven't gotten any closure here. I want to understand what could be the reasons for this. I had a few in my mind:
1. Less number of work experience years (other peers had higher number of years although a couple were fake home business and others had irrelevant experience in manufacturing etc domains) could be an HR rejection here
2. Age factor (I was the youngest in the whole bunch of people although I thought it didn't matter because my education was from top tier colleges unlike rest) I did feel this a lot on the lunch table where people were shocked after hearing my age and I felt discriminated at that point.
3. I had an incident where one of the partner level engineering managers had been creeping me out by sending me too many texts on LinkedIn and follow requests on Instagram and finally asking me for my WhatsApp number despite him and I having no work connection across teams. I had finally ghosted him and ig he was offended.
4. Team review: the team's review was scheduled after a couple months which was the review of my mentors and managers and that was one of the OKRs which were important. This company never launched features in such a short time without changes but this time they did. 
A few days back I reached out to someone in the managers for a referral here and it seemed they were being fake and felt like they didn't want to give a refferal to me.
All this is extremely suspicious to me, please help me figure out what to do and what do you think is the reason here.",Nice-Dirt-link,1,1.0,4,1712663522,2024-04-09 11:52:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bzq78h/microsoft_internship_issue/,4,2024

1bzphnp,Study/Internship advice,"Hi,  


Thank you for reading this.

  
Im an engineering student, third bachelor (23m). During the following summer I will do an internship. I have applied for 2 internships that I thought were interesting and got accepted for both, but I don't know which one to choose now. Here's my though process: Initially I applied for internship x at a company that I like and know, and I visited the company and had a good talk with some of the company engineers, I have quite a good insight of what they do and it really interests me. Furthermore, the company told me that I could even continue as a student (job) trough the following academic year, after the internship, and then even start working there after I graduate (my master program is one year). This really sparked my interest for the company.  
However, I really have a desire to go away from the place I have been living all my life, the internship x is only 30 min away from my home. I always say to myself that I have to get away and go out there explore other places, cultures etc.  
In addition, I really don't enjoy living at home and I have quite a hard time to stay positive there, whilst im quite a positive person from nature . I am living with my mother and sister, I really love them. I have a very good relation with my mother, we understand each other very well. My sister on the other hand is very difficult to live with, both my mother and I have difficulties dealing with her behaviour and life style, but myself especially. She has some mental difficulties and is home a lot (my mom as well), and is just very unpleasing to live with and do things with. She is very easy upset and carries negative energy, gives a bad feeling etc. I know that I don't want to live in such an environment, I can't stay there all my life right? Im also someone who likes to organize this, build things, make progress etc, while my sister has been doing nothing actually for the past four years (no work or study), I have a hard time seeing that and I have often tried to help here starting something, helping with her driving exam, anything, but she never continues anything she begins with, she just stays at home 'wandering' around. Furthermore, both my sister and mother smoke (tobacco and weed, weed only in the evening), and I don't. They smoke in the house and I really don't like it, of course this is my mother's right as it's her house but I simply don't like it, can't help it. I just can't see living there in the future, and I have no house of my own. Anyway, that's that.  
Since company from internship x does not have international internships I have applied for another one with company y for internship y. They have offered me an internship in another continent for a month and a half. Now that I have both internships and have to cancel one, I really don't know what to do. on the one hand I really want to get out of here, but on the other hand I think that im more interested in company x. Im really excited to go abroad and do internship y, explore that, but maybe it won't be for me or it won't be nice and then im sitting there, for 1,5 month. Whilst if its company x, and it would not be great, im still just going home at the end of the day, having my weekend home etc. I also just prefer company x over company y (based on the information that I have received). In addition, when I choose internship y, I will lose the opportunity to work there as a student next year. Im really stuck because I believe this is quite an important choice, for my study and personal life. But both internships would still be of value for my personal and academic growth I believe.  
I would greatly appreciate any advice, please don't hold back on your opinion. It would be really nice to hear someone's external opinion om my situation, as I never really speak with anyone about this.

It doesn't really use my mech engineering expertise, but plenty of data analysis, process development, and some programming capability.

There are issues though, overall the company is disinterested in improving its operational efficiency and it's struggling with debt. It isn't providing any development for me and I'm struggling to see where to from here career wise.

I could transition into a supply chain role (study a CPIM?), or go more into operational systems and programming (study python/ERP?).  

With a young family and the cost of living crisis I need to expand my earning potential, and am open to advice.",Exact-Catch6890,1,1.0,0,1712651816,2024-04-09 08:36:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bzn574/mech_engineer_in_manufacturing_operations/,4,2024
1bzmyia,Considering quitting university and pursuing experience instead,"Hi,  


I'm currently considering dropping out of my bachelors, after being kicked out once, and now still struggling to study enough / efficiently enough to feel like I am keeping up for the exams this summer.  


I'm on my bachelors for economics and business administration, and from what I hear from professionals (and partially think myself), 75% of our courses are not that applicable in real life, or at least limited to very specific positions - which is why I think it might make more sense to try and land a job in that specific field.

&#x200B;

I am currently working as a Business Intelligence consultant, and my boss joked around saying that if I wasn't in university, I could just join them full-time. I asked him if this was just a joke or if there was some truth to it, and he said that if I wanted to, he would be happy to hire me full-time. That would be about 70.000 USD yearly, as I would be starting on the same level as the other employees.

&#x200B;

This enforced my feeling of ""wasting"" time in university, or at least being able to spend my time differently, and I am looking for any and all advice I can get.",FoldagerJR,1,1.0,1,1712650952,2024-04-09 08:22:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bzmyia/considering_quitting_university_and_pursuing/,4,2024
1bzm8pw,Essential Life Hacks for Young Professionals,"Are you navigating the world of adulthood, trying to balance work, personal life, and maybe even some self-care? Well, fear not! I've compiled a list of life hacks to help make your journey smoother and more efficient.  
  
Master the Art of Meal Prep: Spend a little time each week preparing meals in advance. Not only does this save you money, but it also ensures you have healthy options readily available when you're too busy to cook.  
  
Create a Morning Routine: Start your day off right by establishing a morning routine. Whether it's meditation, exercise, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee, having a consistent ritual can set a positive tone for the day ahead.  
  
Utilize Time Blocking: Organize your schedule by blocking out specific periods of time for different tasks. This helps prevent procrastination and ensures you stay focused and productive throughout the day.  
  
Embrace Technology: Take advantage of apps and tools designed to streamline your life. From task management apps like Trello or Asana to budgeting apps like Mint or YNAB, technology can be a powerful ally in helping you stay organized and on top of your game.  
  
Read Good Newsletter: Instead or spending time reading many books, try to build a new habit of reading newsletter while having breakfast or before sleep. It will save you so much time if you just want to learn enough of every topics to talk with people. One of my favourite is Insight Trunk Newsletter. Turn it into a 10 mins daily habit helps you become more confident about your general knowledge.  
  
Invest in Self-Care: Don't neglect your physical and mental well-being. Make time for activities that help you relax and recharge, whether it's going for a walk, practicing yoga, or indulging in a hobby you love.  
  
Network Like a Pro: Building connections is key to success in the professional world. Attend networking events, join industry-related groups, and don't be afraid to reach out to professionals you admire for advice or mentorship.  
  
Continuous Learning: Never stop learning and growing. Take advantage of online courses, workshops, and seminars to expand your skills and knowledge in your field.  
  
Automate Your Finances: Set up automatic bill payments and savings transfers to avoid late fees and ensure you're consistently putting money aside for your future goals.  
  
Life as a young professional can be challenging, but with the right tools and mindset, you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your goals.

1bzm58x,What truly helped you to stop being overly nervous before the meetings?,"Hi, sorry for my english, as it is not my first language.

I have a meeting approaching, not a job interview, but with a very successful, quite important person who is a fan of my work. I shouldn't worry because I'm normally a pretty confident person and always have something to say. However, as the meeting approaches, I find myself getting nervous when I think about it. I definitely admire this person and I don't want to appear lost in my thoughts or shy.

I'm worried that my voice will become shaky due to nervousness, or that I will start talking too fast out of excitement, or that my mind will go blank and I will only manage to say 3% of what I actually intend to say when I'm not nervous.

Does anyone have a good solution, something that helped them stay calm and naturally confident when meeting someone? Especially when there's nothing really to be nervous about, but in your mind, you admire that person and it puts you in a more nervous state?",BrightSherbet,2,0.7599999904632568,6,1712647398,2024-04-09 07:23:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bzm58x/what_truly_helped_you_to_stop_being_overly/,4,2024

I initially chose medical assisting but I was then told that it wasn’t worth doing it as MAs are overworked and underpaid. I was told to look into something else that would be a better choice long term, but tbh I don’t know what else to do. I’m now stuck figuring out what I should pursue, nothing else really comes in mind. I’d obviously want a job that will be good long term but I just don’t know.

1bzlh3f,Would you choose more money or working fewer hours?,"I’ve got a pay review coming up.  I work for a not for profit and manage a team of 20.   I’m the only person working full time and feeling more and more burnt out.

More money is possible but it would be a small percentage increase.  My employer is also open to me working fewer hours at the same rate (so an effective pay increase).

I’d use the extra time to work on cool artsy side projects and general life admin like medical appointments/dentist etc that I put off cause I’m always at work.

I’d love to work remotely so I can travel more, but that’s off the cards for now.

1bzkida,"I feel like my career is over due to back to back short term jobs, how long should I apply to jobs in my field before giving up and doing something else?","For context, I have almost 7 years of marketing experience and have held leadership positions. I graduated about a year before Covid started, which turned my career pretty much upside down. This is what it looked like:  


2 years at a small marketing agency while going to school. Got promoted to a leadership position within a year. Left after graduating because I got a job offer at a higher paying company.  


Worked there for a year, then covid hit, so they could no longer afford to do traditional marketing anymore because ad costs had skyrocketed and email became saturated. So they decided to make me do cold calls. I did that for a year and got a new job after being miserable.  


Worked at the next place for 6 months before they found out I did freelancing on the side and were looking to get rid of me ( I had to do it in order to pay bills). So I got another job at a company that was rumored to be a sinking ship, but they said everyone's jobs were safe until 2025. Well low and behold they let go of nearly 200 people and my entire department got cut last month so now I'm on the hunt again.  


 So this is what my past work life looks like:  


Job 1: 2.5 years  
Job 2: 2.5 years  
Job 3: 6 months  
Job 4: 11 months  


  
I worry that because my last 2 jobs were so short that recruiters with throw out my resume. I also worry that because my experience is almost 7 years that I will look overqualified for entry level positions and will also be thrown out automatically.   


I have a decent sized severance, so I'm not hurting for money currently.

  
However, in the past I got 3 job offers before I took the one that I was at for 6 months. Now however I've been unemployed for about a month and have gotten nothing but rejections after applying to over 30 jobs. I used to at least make multiple interview rounds but right now I'm not even getting interviewed.  


I have heard that the market is tougher now, but I worry that my last employment lengths are causing a problem.   


So is this normal to get rejected so soon or is it because of those last 2 positions being so short that recruiters aren't even bothering to look at me?  


Finally, how long should I go with applying before giving up and taking a job at a warehouse, fast food, retail etc.? Are the back to back job stints basically a guarantee that I'm never going to get a job in marketing again?

1bzjwx7,Colleagues had a change in attitude after finding out I am promoted,"For context, the promotion decision was made by the director, and not a nomination from my manager. 
To be fair I do admit that I am lucky when it comes to promotions, as I have been promoted twice within less than 3 years.
Used to have a few colleagues whom I am close with and hang out on a daily basis, but none of them congratulated me when I was promoted.

Colleague A was from the same batch as me, and we started from the same level/position. Currently, colleague A is still stuck at the same position. As I do speak with my manager often for work related reasons, my manager did share with me points that they found upsetting in colleague A.

As I am close with colleague A, I would speak to colleague A and give some advice on how to handle things. I would also answer their enquiries and help them draft email replies. (I do admit maybe I am doing too much but we started off as friends and I am willing to help out should I have the bandwidth to do so)

After my manager mentioned points that colleague A could improve on, I subtly prompt colleague A and inform them that they can be proactive and inform manager that they would like to learn and take on more new tasks (as colleague A is rather passive and very comfortable with their current position, and their job scope is rather consistent for the past 2 years. They are not willing to take up additional tasks and is not a very vocal person as well)

One day, colleague A was covering for colleague B during colleague B's absence.
Colleague A went to the manager to check on some issues as colleague A noticed something is wrong. The manager mentioned to colleague A to assist on behalf of colleague B to work on the issue. 

But colleague A mentioned to the manager if they could wait for colleague B to be back, so colleague B can resolve the issue instead.

The manager obviously did not take it well, and colleague A was too naive and didn't think too much into implications of saying that to the manager.

It's pretty obvious that the manager does not have a good impression on colleague A, and I subtly spoke to colleague A about the situation indirectly, advising colleague A to speak out about their thoughts with the manager, and also advising/coaching colleague A on how to speak to the manager in regards to that matter.

Turns out, colleague A wanted to wait for colleague B to resolve the issue, as colleague A is not sure how to assist, and is unclear on the procedures.

The misunderstanding has been cleared, and the manager finally understands that colleague A is unclear on the procedures, hence colleague A did not step in to assist. 
Although the air has been cleared, the manager is still not impressed as they think that colleague A is staying in their comfort zone and not willing to learn/take up new tasks.

Fast forward to a few days later, it is finally appraisal review month, and I was feeling glad that I prompted colleague A to speak to the manager to clear the air between them.
As we were from the same batch, I genuinely want us both to rise up together in the ranks.

During appraisal review month, I was confirmed to have a promotion during my 1-on-1 talks with my manager, and after the confirmation, there was an internal newsletter email from the HR department, announcing of my promotion and change of rank.

After the email announcement was out, everyone came to extend their congrats to me privately, but a few of the colleagues whom I worked closely with, all of them fell silent and acted like nothing happened. (Before this we have a good relationship, we even hangout after work/during the weekends, so you can consider us as friends outside of work too)

Colleague C is one of the colleague whom I closely worked with, and we both managed a few people under our wing. 

Colleague C is also a rather passive person, and they will check in with me for advice and also things that the juniors under them were asking. As we are the same position and handling same tasks (just in charge of taking care different juniors under our wing), I would not hesitate to answer colleague C, and also keep them in the loop whenever there are updates or anything new.

As I am the cover for colleague C and vice versa, I would make sure before my absence, I will inform colleague C on the things that they will need to keep in mind, and things to be followed up on, so it makes it easier for them to track back my progress. So far colleague C does not do the same for me when they are absent, and its only recently did I come to realise that fact.

As I am someone with an extroverted nature, I am very vocal and would speak up to the higher ups if I think that there are things that could be improved on (such as processes/workflow) or resolve issues when it arises, dealing with both internal/external parties.

Hence, all these while I have been the person to plan on the workflow/processes for the team and lead a few new projects from the start till now. I also presented in front of our big group of internal stakeholders frequently. (Thus, I come in contact with the higher ups/management quite frequently for work related matters)

On the other hand, colleague C is usually just silent, listening to my ideas.
Despite me checking with colleague C if they have anything they would like to add on, they would usually dismiss me and just go along with my suggestions.
As both of us are holding the same position, I would get their opinion on things, but it gradually got to a point whereby colleague C would just follow what I have proposed/planned, and go along with the flow.
Colleague C is an introverted person by nature, and is unable to handle confrontations and speak in front of huge crowds.
Most of the times that I have looped colleague C in the call/meeting, colleague C would stay silent throughout the whole session, and did not contribute anything to the meeting.

I did not realise that it got to this point for colleague C, its my mistake for coddling colleague C and handling most tasks myself.
It got to the point where colleague C will wait for me to answer our manager, and again, wait for me to initiate what needs to be done next.

I am feeling more like a sub leader in between colleague C and the manager, when in fact I share the same position as colleague C. Didn't really mind all that as I thought of colleague C as my close friend.

I guess my hard work got noticed by the director, hence the director suggested to the higher management that they would like to promote me to the next level.
I am very grateful for the recognition and the support that my manager and director has provided me.

But I still can't shake off the disappointment that the colleagues I used to be close with, are all radio silent when my promotion news broke.
I really wanted for us to go up together, and if there is a chance, I would try to help colleague A and colleague C to grow and increase in ranks.
All my thoughts were for vain though, none of them are happy for my success.
I know that work ""friends"" are not real friends, but it really sucks knowing that we used to be a close knit tight group.
Just because news of my promotion broke, their attitude towards me changed so much its kinda depressing.
At the moment, colleague C is letting go of the tasks that she is supposed to do, and not responding to manager's message in the group chat (the group chat consists of me, the manager and colleague C)
(Would like to add on that both colleague A and colleague C does not make the effort to get to know the manager well, and would keep their distance with other colleagues, they do not network and mingle around with others as well)

Not too sure how to get colleague C to assist me with future tasks, as colleague C is assigned to be working under me moving forth.

1bzjnfo,Non-profit job offered 10k higher than expected without asking,"After months of freelancing, I decided to start applying for full time jobs. Luckily, I had the hiring manager reached out directly with interviews. Did 2 rounds and they were transparent with me that the position is for 85k, for a non-profit organization. 

Without benefits and two years of unstable income, I was more than ready to accept. When the HR reach out with the offer, I was stunned that it was for 95k instead of expected 85k. Of course, I didn't even hesitate and signed right away. 

What I am curious is for non-profit, I had always assumed that they have allocated specific amount with their budget from government funding and from fundraiser. With the 10k increase, do I acknowledge and reach out to the hiring manager to thank them? Or is that HR's doing? Basically, who should I send thank you too?

1bzjfnd,Being targeted by my coworker,"Over the last few months, I have a coworker who has been on my back and has no intention of leaving me alone.

However, we share a meeting with the client because it’s easier.

The client was totally fine with it and I presented the finished version the following week. After about 3 weeks, my manager asked me to meet with them to talk about something. They said someone told them that I was showing a document to a client with a bunch of errors and it wasn’t ready to show. I was confused because no one had a problem with it and I prefaced the conversation with letting them know it’s still in draft form. My manager said, “someone from X client team told me this” but didn’t give me name.

1bzhaoa,At the Crossroads: Push for an MBA or Pause for Personal Growth?,"  
Hey everyone, hoping to gather some insights from the collective wisdom here. I'm a 28-year-old dude who's made Canada his home for the past 6 years. My life's been a whirlwind of engineering and robotics, working with a startup where I've managed to climb the ladder pretty swiftly. Last year was a beast though - ended up feeling burnt out despite earning a promotion and giving it my all.  
  
Here's where it gets interesting - I'm in a pretty solid spot career-wise. Good salary, respect at work, and my voice matters. But, there's this itch for something more. The plan was to dive into MBA applications or aim for a big tech gig in the US this year. However, I'm hitting a wall of exhaustion and questioning if I've sacrificed too much personal life in the process.  
  
To add another layer, I've got the support of our CEO, who's not only a Harvard MBA alum but also a massive advocate for me taking the plunge into further education. He's a brilliant mind and someone whose respect I've earned, making his encouragement hard to ignore.  
  
Yet, here I am, wrestling with whether to forge ahead with the MBA and job hunt or to take a step back for some much-needed personal time. It's been a hot minute since I've been in a relationship, and the solitude is starting to weigh on me. Despite my career strides, I can't help but feel a tad behind, especially when I see friends embarking on their MBA paths.  
  
So, the big question - do I barrel through the fatigue and seize the MBA and US job opportunities, or do I hit the brakes, focus on myself, and possibly reconsider my industry and life's direction?  
  
Would love to hear your take, especially if you've been in a similar boat. Should the drive for professional advancement take precedence, or is it time to prioritize personal well-being and reevaluation of goals?",Underdog_Charles,1,1.0,5,1712630611,2024-04-09 02:43:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bzhaoa/at_the_crossroads_push_for_an_mba_or_pause_for/,4,2024

1bzgc1i,Unhappy in new position. Is going back to old job bad? ,"I am looking for some career advice as I'm honestly not sure what it is I want or am looking for.

I am located in the USA. I work in vet med as a CVT. I do not have to work but choose to - thanks to my amazing husband.

I used to work 40- 50 hours/wk before I had children. I then worked 10hrs a week for 3 years while staying home the rest of the time.

I stepped away from vet med due to burnout and lack of passion. I decided to do landscape design which is profitable and I could set my own schedule. I worked with my husband's company on other projects too.

I have now gone back into vet med since November 2023. I work at a veterinary teaching hospital/university. I have been with them for 5 months. Receive pro rated benefits like health and PTO based on 27.5hrs/wk work.

I'm not really challenged at this job. And I'm on my phone at least 50% of my shift scrolling. The students are doing the work that I would normally do in a regular practice.

I was offered a job at my old clinic. I am fully utilized there but don't get any benefits.

I have been contemplating asking my current job for less hours. Ideally 24hrs would be best. I am struggling to find balance between the job, still doing landscape design and family time/home chores.

I'm nervous to ask and unsure of how. They created the position for me.

I know people are amazing and do it all...work 40/wk, chores, family time and leisure. I am not this person.

I have also been contemplating going back to my old clinic.

Would I be backtracking?

Should I push through and see if things get better at the new job?

How do you know if it's just the puppy love stage is over and reality has kicked in?

Is it just that I'm over vet med?

1bzg38u,Pursuing a UX/UI career in Dublin,"I'm an European 22M with a Bachelor's in Advertising and quite a bit of freelancing experience in graphic design. After graduating in January, I came to Dublin for an internship opportunity that my uni offered with a salary which has barely covered my expenses, since Ireland has a massive housing problem. But then, I met a girl and now I'd like to stay here, and my internship is ending at the end of May. 

My vision since I graduated was to delve into the UX/UI field, I don't exactly know how worth it Master's degrees are in general but I've seen some at Trinity and TUD which fit what I'm looking for. Thing is, everything here is so expensive. I'd need to work during the summer and definitely work a part time job while doing my Master's to barely afford living here, and then hopefully find a job after graduating. 

I know it's not too far fetched, I just wonder if a UX/UI career is worth all of this, or if a Master's is even the way to go. I do have a decent graphic design portfolio, but no skills remotely linked to development/product design which I figure is much more sought after, and the jobs in Dublin are well paid.

1bzbg4m,Experience with switching to a job with more travelling ,"I work as a C-level manager at a consultancy with around 100 employees. Been there since I finished school 7 years ago. Currently enrolled in part time education which my employer pays for. So there's lots of perks, great people, but I'm a bit bored.  

Got a new offer from a big company as a coach /in house consultant for part of the org. Seems interesting. New boss seems like a good guy and sponsor for further growth. Lots of room to grow. Better terms and conditions.

The drawback is that there will be a lot of traveling, at least for the first year. The gig will basically be focused in another city in the beginning so I'm expecting three days a week there for a while. It's 1h away by plane, so I'm guessing at least 3 hours travel time each way. 

Anyway, has anyone made a transition to a job with more travelling, but also more interesting tasks? How was it and were you happy about it? 

Thanks.

1bzbc3t,3 day work week. Best use of time?,"I have a 3 day work schedule, full time and it pays the bills fine. There is a ton of opportunity for advancement, but will be looking 20+ years down the line before I would be making BANK at senior management or corporate roles. The next position up would be 10\~ more hours a week and the increase in compensation wouldn't really scale to account for that. I'm hourly now, and would make more money if I worked those hours than the salary at that position. Also, you kind of have to be willing to relocate or getting a promotion at every stage will be 10x harder, and I'm not willing to relocate.  
  
I'm not opposed to a career where I'm at, but I feel like I could be using my 4 day weekend to develop a skill or something to just get a better paying job without the 20 year grind and skipping the long hours stage.. Only thing is, I definitely don't want to go to college for a typical 4 year degree or anything like that. I have taken a coding bootcamp, and did well but I wasn't really in love with it, and definitely wasn't in love with the lack of job security, especially for non college graduates.  
  
I've considered a second job, but I don't think that working more is really a solution. I wont have the 4 days off forever, and I don't necessarily NEED to make more money. Plus, I can always get overtime.. I'm currently just trying to use it as an opportunity to visit with my family and get out to do things more, but I feel like I could be using this time to get myself a job that will always allow me to have the time to do those things.. I understand that not wanting to go to college is limiting, but I just don't want the student loan debt when I have a career that I can advance in and make enough money, and I would more than likely be promoted before I graduated and have less time to be in class.

I pulled them aside today to clarify because I often misunderstand text and even in person tones so I asked them privately in their office if they were upset that I was unable to make the schedule switch work?

1bzb77w,Payroll Errors Going Back Almost a Year,"Hello. I have gotten into a stupid pickle because I am a stupid idiot.

I am not someone who checks their paycheck. I get direct deposit, and if I check my bank account on payday and the money looks about right, I'm cool. I don't even open the envelope with the stub half the time.

I've been at my job for almost a year (at a town hall), and I'm on my way out the door. Good work experience, but a pretty shitty work environment. I'm in the process of arranging another job and tying up loose ends. I started reviewing my paystubs just for hahas and holy shit, they are JACKED UP. 

I was responsible for keeping track of my comp hours on the bottom of my paysheets. As I understood it, I was not supposed to be getting paid overtime--Instead, I was supposed to be given an hour and a half of comp time (floating paid time off). If I worked 1 hour overtime, I would accrue an hour and a half of comp. I was not to be paid overtime. The treasurer, responsible for payroll, would randomly pay me overtime at time and a half pay, give or take $150 on a paycheck here or there. Once or twice, he paid me a couple of hours on top of paying me for 80 hours (bi-weekly pay). It didn't happen many times, but enough over the year for me to wft at it upon review.

Additionally, he didn't deduct my sick days or personal time as I took it, and he also didn't record the sick time I was supposed to accrue from month to month.  

Its just a mess, really. I want to straighten everything out before I leave. The Treasurer was known for messing up pay, and he has recently been fired, and I'm not entirely sure how to move forward.

I have a copy of most of my time sheets, and a few less of the paystubs. I have already gone through the stack and matched everything up, and began flagging errors as I caught them. I have not completed this, but when I do I was wondering if our Union Rep would be an appropriate person to talk to about this. We have a new administration in our office and (loooong story short) I don't trust anyone in charge of me to try and help me through this. I want to go to them prepared.

Ultimately, I think I have accrued more sick time and worked more overtime than I owe (he did make errors in paying me extra, but not \*that\* many of them) and I want to be sure that I get paid what I'm owed out the door.

What should be my next move?

TL; DR - ALWAYS CHECK UR STUBS. ALWAYS. CHECK. YOUR. STUBS.

1bzahmb,Coworkers who control the schedule are sleeping together and one of them is very jealous.,"I’m considering getting a new part time job because I’ve been informed (against my will) by one of my co-workers F (25) that she is sleeping with my other co worker M (36). She went into graphic detail when I didn’t ask any questions of the sort and tells me they have sex in the back office room after every shift they work together. She explained the reason for the table in the back office is broken because they have sex on it. Some things unfortunately just can’t be unheard. She also told me she is having sex with multiple other men at the same time because she is ""mature"" and that ""it’s just sex"". Again, I’m being hyperbolic, but this was all told me  against my will. It seems like she needs constant validation from men, and is constantly talking about how men love her and love to have sex with her. They are not dating apparently just sleeping with one another. I am in a long term commited relationship so I could care less.

However, I personally don’t think it’s fair for people that are hooking up to have full control over other peoples shifts, as they are frequently working together and I have explained I would prefer to work the days they are working. I have another job and would love to have some extra time on the weekends to get my work done.

Any opinions on this would be appreciated. I realize co workers hooking up is nothing  out of the ordinary, although she gets very apprehensive when I even talk to my other co worker, let alone make innocuous comments. She seems to be a very jealous and extremely insecure person in general. 

I’m sensitive to this situation I suppose because in the past I had a boss make sexual advances toward me and when I rejected him, my shifts were changed and were subsequently taken away.

I'm worried that mentioning his name or even being friendly with him could make her angry and a similar situation could occur. I’ve already asked my shifts to be changed and she’s denied it, opting for me to take her other shifts that’s doesn’t interfere with them working together.

1bza2yb,"To me, it seems like people at  companies of less than 1,000 employees are more tight knit in terms of their connections. Do you think that's true?","I feel like if I go work at a company of about 500 employees without knowing anyone that that things like this would happen: 

- certain groups at the company would socialize just with each other 

- promotions are given out mostly because you know and/or like the people you've worked with for a long time

- a lot of people would secretly be friends with each other outside of work

If I worked at a company of 100,000 employees instead, I feel like the things above would be much less common. Do you think so?

I've come into a new company and I feel like I'm failing on the basics... because they are the basics. Over the years I worked my way up and I'm now being asked to do things I haven't needed to do in 15 years. I'm not good at anymore. Without giving too much detail, it's like being the head of a call center and being sent back on the phones. I did my time, but now I would suck and my call handling times would be terrible.

It's clear they think I'm terrible, but I don't know to tell how them that I feel im being mis-used and that's the reason why. I spent 10 years in a really nice place and now I'm somewhere where no one says hello, let alone offers to show me the ropes. 

I spoke to my boss a couple of weeks ago and whatever way I articulated got his back up. I feel like they want to put me in a little box and it's making me feel like I can't even do the basic shit. I don't feel respected or like I can make an impact. 

Id like to be able to turn things around and make it successful, but I don't know how articulate that I'm shit because of how they're using me, how it's demotivating me and how much of a confidence knock it is to have someone constantly at me.

1bz4m7x,I´m miserable at my new job,"Hey, so as the title says, I joined a new company a month or so ago and it has made me miserable every single day. The job is very well paid for my age (25) but the workload is extremely heavy, I'm working 13-14 hous per work day and 5-6 on weekends. 

I'm used to the heavy workload, but in this case, the handover has been non existent, people just CC me in email chains or meetings and expect me to assist and understand while leading the conversations. That methodology sucks for a position like the one I´m in, as I'm in charge of approving spend and making financial choices and reports, that no one is caring enough to explain to me how they are created (I come from a different industry). 

Also, I have a pretty introverted personality, and it is a huge discomfort for me to chase people around so they can explain to me what I'm supposed to do. The team is very ""family like"" and I'm not really used to share a lot with coworkers, and not doing so is seen as bad in this company. 

What would you do on my position? I'm financially stable enough to quit for a couple of months, but I don't know if it's the right call. Have you been in this position? Does it get better?

1bz3jey,I don't know what to do with my career. Please advise.,"I have no idea where to go with my career. Or what I can do, if anything, with my experience.

Here are the details:  
Age: 46  
College: Associates degree in Mechanical Design  
Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota.  
Current line of work: Senior Mechanical Designer

Details:  
I am a hands on guy, totally into anything automotive. I graduated with my degree in 2004. I have 20 years of experience in Mechanical Design. I am at the top of my career, now a Senior Designer. And my salary at the top end of this title ($80,000).

I have become very unsatisfied with this line of work. To see if my problem was the company I worked for I have changed jobs every 3 years to see if I can be happy somewhere else. I am still not satisfied, so I know it is not the company that is the problem.

The last time I was actually satisfied with my career was when I did Automotive Service Writing while I was in college. I would go back to this line of work, but my experience is 20+ years out of date. This line of work does not pay enough. And I am not willing to work evenings and weekends.

In my next career I am not willing to:  
Get paid less that $75,000  
Work nights and weekends  
Work in sales  
Go back to college  
Physical labor (depending on the type)

What are my options?  
Is this degree of any use in a different career path?  
Are there any other 9-5 jobs out there that my type of experience can be useful?

1bz3e75,Was rejected at job interview for my dream job by wife of my current boss,"I work at my current company for about 7 years now. It's my first job. For a few months now I feel like I'm ready for something new, so I applied for some jobs, always got into the last round, rejected 3 offers because I didn't feel right or the offer was too low, and 2 times I got rejected in the last round. This is ok for me: I like my colleagues, I am good at my job and certainly don't hate it, so I don't feel rushed at all.

There's this company I really want to work for, so I'm regularly checking the job vacancies at their website. 3 weeks ago I saw a vacancy that really felt like it was made for me: right job experience, someone with a lot of SAP and Excel experience, an analytical mindset, hands on mentality,... It was like the job description was describing me. So I applied and got asked for a job interview. I met a HR person and the woman who was going to be my superior (if I got the job). The interview went quite good (although I had a bit of a cold), I could answer all their questions and had a good feeling about my (potential) new boss. At the end of the interview they said they were going to discuss my interview internally and then reach out to me before the end of the month (which was in 3 weeks, so very late, but ok).

They didn't wait that long - I just got a call (by a HR Person not present on the interview) that they didn't want to go through with me, based on the following 2 reasons:

- They felt like I wasn't hands on enough, not someone who takes things into his own hands. This was based on the fact that I said that I didn't know what I wanted to study and in the end decided my studies on a friend convincing me to study business. Stupid of me being honest, I know, but I clarified in my application letter and in the interview that I feel I've gotten a very clear picture of what I want to do now and have become a real goal-getter in regards of taking my career path in my own hands. Hence why I applied for this job.

- When asked what the most frustrating part of my job is, I answered: having to beg marketing/sales/R&D guys to meet their deadline, so I could reach mine, when doing cost calculations. I explained I generated templates and set up standard meetings to help me in this. They think working together with sales guys is one of the most important aspects of this job, and that I wouldn't be able to endure the chaos this brings. I feel like everything what I would have answered on this questions would be turned into something against me.

Ok, I got rejected and it sucks, and the fact that I don't agree with it, is not their problem.

The thing is, last night I discovered - by mere coincidence by scrolling on facebook and clicking on my current boss' profile - that my (potential) new boss is the wife of my current boss! I almost couldn't believe the coincidence. I didn't really know what to do with this information, if my boss knew I applied for something new and what this all meant.

I really like my boss and we get along really well. He is also by coincidence (again) the best friend of my cousin (who I only see maybe once every 3-4 years), not really a strong connection). Last week, when I had my interview, he was on leave and said he (+wife and 2 kids) was going to visit my cousin for 3 days in a vacation cabin my cousin owns. I just can't imagine my name and me applying for her company wasn't mentioned. My boss is not the owner of the company, he is the manager of the production site, but he sure would have a hard time replacing me. My resume and cover letter clearly mentions my current employer and it was also mentioned many times during the interview.

I just really felt like the professional, ethical and deontologically correct thing to do for her was to begin the interview by saying she was married to my boss and ensured that my application was completely confidential and objective.

I'm kind of wondering what to do now. Things will feel a bit awkward now with my boss, I'll keep wondering if he knew + I'll keep wondering if he told HR at our company and if it would have consequences for me. Now I really feel like I have to leave. I think I just have to accept, but part of me wants her to know that I know. Everything I do is either going to escalate things with either my current boss or my (potential) new boss, probably both, and I don't think I even want to work at this dream company of my if I have to kind of force it a bit like this. I was thinking of maybe directly writing her an email trying to convince her - because it would show a hands-on-mentality. I'm also tempted to add that 'I could give her a reference at my company, because a reference says so much more than 1 interview' - kind of let her be guessing if I know or not. But maybe this is too dangerous and I should not trying to put her on a though spot.

Do I talk to my boss or someone else? Try to convince them without mentioning it that I know? Should I just suck it up? Is this really a professional error made against me, or just an unfortunate coincidence?

**TL;DR** - I applied for a job where my new boss is the wife of my current boss. Only discovered this afterwards, they don't know I know. Got rejected. Now things feel awkward at my current job and I feel the reason of my rejection wasn't objective.

I am reaching out on behalf of a friend who currently needs some urgent help. My friend is a kindhearted individual with a basic understanding of computers, and he only has a CompTIA A+ certificate.

Unfortunately, my friend is currently unemployed and without any family business to fall back on, he has to find his first job on his own.

He’s looking for IT help kinds of jobs, or anything else that can work too, if there’s anything I need to mention, please kindly let me know.

He previously enjoyed a comfortable lifestyle due to family wealth. However, a poor financial decision by his father resulted in the loss of those resources. This unexpected setback, coupled with a lack of prior work experience, has left him feeling overwhelmed and unsure of his next steps. I think one can understand how frustrating it can be when your family’s dumb mistakes take away everything from you, your dream of having a livable life, if not a luxurious life.

Due to a few more unfortunate events in life, he’s at this stage in life, where he can’t see a foreseeable future, he’s unable to find himself his first job, support himself and his family, he tried LinkedIn to no avail, college degree could be one problem I think, however, I believe he’s a capable guy, just have no degree to prove that with.

So, in the end, I just want to convey this, please help us if you guys know any openings which could be suitable for him, any office job, clerical work, or just guide us, I don’t myself know how to help him even when I badly want to. Looking forward to your suggestions and advice/feedback.

I'm saying that because I live in South America and most jobs don't pay enough, even if you're experienced. I'd like to get a job in Canada or another English-speaking country, but I understand that's nearly impossible.

I've considered Product Management, but the problem is that it doesn't seem to be entry-level-friendly, there aren't that many openings, and the worst part, I just can't seem to find an opening that I'm a good fit for industry-wise. It's all some very specific B2B stuff that I have no knowledge of, like networks, cloud, cybersec, financial stuff, etc. I'd like to work with B2C.

I've worked at a startup accelerator before but wasn't a fan of it, then studied software development, but that's super hard to get into right now, and I'm thinking I might not have a good fit with it, which makes it harder to sell myself to get a job.

I've also considered Community Management as I have started a community that went very well, but every opening I see has ""social media"" as part of the job, and I don't like that, so apparently it doesn't work for me...

I'm looking for flexible remote side hustles that I can do to increase my earning. I currently WFH full-time but I finish my work in about 2-4 hours for the day and would like to take up a second fully remote work/side hustle that I can do to increase my earning. I don't mind doing anything as a second job as my main job is a permanent position where I work in a company but because I have so much spare time I would like to invest my free time into earning money instead of wasting it scrolling through tiktok everyday.

1. If a job candidate waits a while to get a Master's after their Bachelor's it shows they lack motivation 

2. If a person is a Software Developer and then becomes a Software Quality person it shows they wanted to try to get an easier job

3. If a job candidate doesn't have a LinkedIn with many connections it shows they aren't well connected in their industry

4. I could look at someone's Facebook and tell a lot about what type of person they are just from that

1byzllv,Should I take the higher position vs my free time due to pay cut?,"i’ll try to make this short.

i’m currently an hourly employee who is used to gettingt overtime and they recently just cut overtime hours because we are fully staffed at work. I work in healthcare administration and I’m never checked on because I work very independently so to say the least I honestly don’t even work the full 40 hours I kind of just clocked in and out whenever I feel like it but now since overtime has been cut, I can’t work any excess hours so that is definitely taking a dip into my pay and a lifestyle that I want to upkeep. this new position would be salaried and it would match what I would make back when overtime was allowed. However, it will also include more workload, of course, and they would be checking in on me more on this position, as it would be now considered a finance analyst, but still in healthcare administration. 

so I guess what I am asking is should I just downgrade my lifestyle to my current pay without the overtime hours and maybe look into getting a part-time job ? or should I go ahead and take this new position which would be beneficial as I am still in school for a finance degree and it would look really good in my résumé.

I am a single parent and in school while working this job. If that backstory helps the decision..

I've had a career in global/public health for nearly 10years but recently had enough. I thought this career choice would be great as I've always had a passion for improving people's health and wellbeing. None of my roles have been rewarding but rather stressful and full of company politics.

I am keen to pivot and get into something more exciting with higher pay but everything requires either going back to school or paying an arm and a leg for a short course. Besides, I have very active kids and my husband leaves almost all the responsibilities of them, our home and our lives to me so I dnt even know where I would get the time/childcare to even develop myself.

1byxi3f,Need Guidance. Very Sad. ,"Last year around this time, I left my company of 7.5 years  for a promotion in both title, responsibility and pay at another company in a completely different industry. They sold me on the fact that there was so much opportunity to build my team out, shape the role and expand the function across the organization. Fast forward a few months, and I realized I had  been duped. There is no money for marketing (which is what I do), I was not given the budget I understood the role to manage and the team I inherited has no marketing experience. Then a role of comparable title and pay became available at my old company, and I spoke to my former manager/VP about it in February, interviewed in March and haven’t heard a word since. After the interview several panelists reached out to me to tell me how well I did and they told me in the interview they wanted me back. It’s been 2.5 weeks though and I haven’t heard anything. I’m trying to be respectful of my previous manager/who would be my current manager again and not reach out to her directly, so I contacted the recruiter last week and she did not respond. 

What do you make of this? Should I just call it a loss and look for other opportunities? I really miss my friends/coworkers, the industry and the type of work I was doing is the problem.

1bywbmw,I am concerned about my brother’s future.,"I'm kinda worried about my brother's future. He's 40 and has pretty much always worked in our family business, which was all about fast food and then a mini-market. He's been in this game since high school, through uni (where he got some kind of business degree), until we sold our last shop about a year back. Since then, he's been selling cars to past the time, but lately, he's been super into the idea of moving into cybersecurity, even starting some government courses on it.  
  
I'm all for supporting family, but I've got to say, I'm worried. My own background's in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and I'm currently working as a Traffic Infrastructure Engineer, so I've seen how tough the job market can be, especially for newbies in cybersecurity. And, while my brother's got the business side of things down, he's not exactly a tech wizard. He's the type to stick to printed notes and binders rather than going digital with everything, which feels a bit out of step with where things are at.  
  
He's got some serious skills in managing people and projects – I saw that firsthand when we worked together. I've tried nudging him towards something like tech management or engineering management, where I think he'd kill it, but he's set on doing the technical stuff, even though he's not all that comfortable with the more complex techy tasks.  
  
Honestly, he's a bit stuck in his ways, and I'm not sure he can cut it in cybersecurity. He's good with basic computer stuff, like admin and documents, but anything more technical than that, and he's asking for help. I want to help him out, but I'm not sure how to make him see that maybe he needs to rethink his plan or at least approach it differently.  
  
What do you guys think? Any advice on how to support him or insights into making a shift into the tech world, especially cybersecurity? Would love to hear your thoughts.

1byu05j,"Feeling Lost in the Tech Job Hunt Despite a Master's Degree in IT. In need of guidance and encouragement 
","Hey everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I'm reaching out to this community because I'm feeling a bit lost in my journey to find a fulfilling tech job in the US. Despite my efforts, I'm struggling to find my footing, and I could really use some guidance and encouragement.

 I studied in France as an international student for four years to earn my bachelor's and Master's degree in IT, which I completed in October 2023. During those years, I faced significant mental struggles that impacted my education. I found myself just studying enough to avoid failing, and looking back, I regret not fully investing in my learning during that time. It feels like I wasted precious time to expand my knowledge and skills.

Shortly after graduating, I moved to the US as a permanent resident in December 2023, eager to kickstart my career in the tech industry.

During my last year of university, I had the opportunity to dive into the tech world through an internship as an Assistant Product Owner. While the experience was valuable, it left me feeling like something was missing. It lacked the technical depth that truly excites me.

 My degree is quite general, which has left me uncertain about which path to pursue within the vast field of IT. However, I'm particularly drawn to data science, software engineering, cloud computing, and AI. These areas spark my interest and align with my long-term career goals.

On top of that, imposter syndrome has been creeping in, making me doubt my abilities and feeling like I'm not good enough for the positions I'm aiming for. It's been a real struggle to keep pushing forward when these feelings weigh heavily on me.

Another challenge I've encountered is the lack of projects in my portfolio. While I know the importance of showcasing my skills through personal projects, I've been struggling to find the discipline to work on them consistently. It's frustrating because I know that having a strong portfolio could significantly improve my chances of landing a job in the tech industry.

I know that in the US certifications are important, however, I'm unsure about which certifications to pursue. Without a clear direction in my career path, it's difficult to pinpoint which certifications would be most beneficial. I don't want to invest time and resources into certifications that may not align with my future goals.

I've been actively searching and applying for tech positions but unfortunately I got alot of rejections.
If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any insights on navigating the  job market, especially in the fields of data science, software engineering, cloud computing, or AI, I would truly appreciate your input. Whether it's sharing your own experiences, offering advice on alternative job search strategies, or simply providing words of encouragement, I'm all ears.

Thank you all in advance for your support. ",Ill-Donkey7278,0,0.5,0,1712570251,2024-04-08 09:57:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byu05j/feeling_lost_in_the_tech_job_hunt_despite_a/,4,2024

Hope Monday is kicking of well! Mine is (on a busy-ness aspect), or is not (on a fun aspect) so I am here making this post.  
  
I am a consultant in a large organisitional consulting firm, prob one of the largest in our field. I am in my 30s, and coming from an enterpreneurship background, while academically I am an economist according to my undergrad.  
I have been in the consulting world for 3 years now, and while I am still not sure, I am getting the feeling this won't be my forever career.  
I am looking for ways/ ideas to transition into the product development side, without losing too much career capital and salary. (I am willing to go as low as 40K GBP for outside London, or mid-40s for London, if there is potential).  
I have my own side-hustle in hospitality, and I woud like to be in a place where I can grow towards that too, so any places where I can build career capital for the hospitality/hotel industry would be my ideal goal.

I am not against the idea of further study either, if that would make a difference. I am against working 50+ hours in the hospo advisory department of a Big4 type advisory.

So far, I have thought of:

1. Doing an Econ masters, and going for an economic consulting company in the Cities/Tourism department (not good on the prod dev aspect of my wants)
2. Finding boutique hotel advisory firms and working there (large salary paycut, and pay cap)

1byt63f,Need advice on how to approach my manager about new changes im unhappy with,"I work in hospitality at a zoo as the head barista / general foh. Normally we close the coffee machine at 3, allowing me to finish at 330. My boss told me today that we have to keep coffee open until 4 because our brochure says we serve coffee, snacks, and drinks until then. This means I now finish at 430. I am in the process of getting a raise and my boss has mentioned the possibility of me going full time. I want to solve this without being accusatory (as it is coming from the owner of the zoo, my boss just has to relay the information). These are the details, how can I go about this in a way that everyone is happy?

-All of my shifts have been changed to end at 430 instead of 330. My manager also says we are meant to 'share the closes' but consistently rosters the same 3/15 people to close. The 2IC closes once a fortnight and the manager currently has no rostered closes.

-I am expected to close the cafe, coffee and the dishwasher before I leave. 

-Most shifts we have two people to close but there's so much to do already (without having to close coffee) that there have been numerous complaints about things not getting done. 

-When I explained to my manager that it's too much, she said people could stay later than their rostered time to help. I am being trained as a team leader but am expected to train people (how to close the till and pack down the coffee machine), and tell people what needs to be done in the minimal amount of time we have to close. 

-Keeping coffee open later is essentially losing money because we don't sell any after 3, the only reason they want to keep it open is because the brochure says.

-I also worry that setting this time limit will have people rushing to close coffee, and we will have people who don't know how to close the machine packing it down, meaning it won't be cleaned thoroughly. 

-As I am head barista I feel I should have been asked about this personally, rather than how I was told - in a group meeting saying this is how it is.

1byso23,MBA or MHA,"Hey guys! I'm trying to decide if I should do MBA or MHA after getting my undergrad. I'm currently a junior at USC majoring in Business Administration. I plan to do my master's right after I get my undergrad degree. I've been reading as much as I can about each program and I'm slightly leaning more towards an MHA. If anyone has any experience about either programs, pls feel free and chime in. Also, do you guys have any recommendations about specific jobs/internships I should be doing to gain more experience as I've read that experience is what really matters in the field. And as far as experience goes, does that mean I can work any medical/hospital job and that would count as experience?  
  
A little bit about me:  
  
I was a Navy Corpsman for 6 years. The first 2 years, I worked in the cardiology ward at Naval Hospital in San Diego and the rest of my career was spent with the Marines providing Trauma care. My goal is to become a hospital administrator in the near future.

1bysnko,Needs your Advice - Toxic Work Environment,"I'm reaching out for your advice as an IT professional based in a developing country. I've been managing two jobs since 2020 to support myself and my household - one onsite, which I've been doing since 2020, and the other remote, essentially freelancing, which I began in 2022.  
  
Initially, I worked as the sole IT personnel for a reputable retail company in my city, where I handled various responsibilities related to cloud computing, server management, and firewalls. While I found the work fulfilling, the absence of health insurance and the demanding schedule of six days a week, ten hours a day were significant drawbacks.  
  
In my search for better opportunities, I came across an offer from a respected educational institution in my country. This offer came with a 40% salary increase, health insurance coverage, and a more manageable work schedule of five days a week and nine hours a day as compare to my previous onsite job. Although the position was for an IT Coordinator and lacked the technical depth and growth potential I was accustomed to, the benefits seemed promising, leading me to accept the offer.  
  
However, after four months in this new role, I encountered unexpected challenges. Instead of reporting to an IT Manager, I now report to a non-technical Regional Director. This change has led to a toxic work environment characterized by micromanagement and menial tasks, such as setting up projectors for meetings and arranging printer repairs. I deeply miss the technical aspects of my previous role, including tasks related to servers and firewalls. Furthermore, my supervisor occasionally reprimands me publicly, worsening the situation.  
  
Consequently, I no longer wish to continue working for this company. Additionally, I still maintain my remote job at night to make ends meet. I'm actively seeking new opportunities and have attended interviews, with results pending. While I received an offer from one, I had to decline due to conflicting schedules with my remote job.  
  
I'm feeling overwhelmed, disheartened and disrespected by the current circumstances and would appreciate your advice on how to proceed. If you have any opportunities or insights that could help me navigate this situation, please do let me know.",Limp_Remote_4755,1,1.0,0,1712564726,2024-04-08 08:25:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bysnko/needs_your_advice_toxic_work_environment/,4,2024
1byry4p,Is commenting to correct something unfair or inaccurate on a performance review worth it?,"TLDR

I just had a review that includes areas to improve that are not accurate or very fair. This is a negative work environment so not surprising, but never happened to me before. I want to add a few factual comments or evidence. Is this something that is worth doing or just a way to make things worse?   


The issues (described verbally)  
1 - Need to improve management of stakeholders / relationships because a partner in another team felt I 'dropped' a project that i was directly told to drop.  
2 - Need in future to spend time on business critical work over self-initiated work. We do not have any written targets, roadmap or priorities - everything is ad hoc. I have never not taken on or completed a project on time except for during surgery. I put in extra effort over thanksgiving, did work during downtime on side-projects that are small and come at no cost to the business.  
3 - Something incomprehensible about answering a question during a training exercise, possibly saying I should have handled someone being rude to me better since there is a reference to handling difficult personalities.   
I know that perceptions can vary but it feels very off. I mentored junior colleagues and delivered several projects this year that were successful despite the surgery and being hospitalized for complications and home care. I had a feeding tube in my nose for a couple of months and honored a commitment to help deliver training for someone in another team while I had that.   
I plan to talk to my manager once to clarify a couple of things, but my question is whether responding in writing is worth it or just going to make my work life worse? I'm told improving in these areas could lead to a promotion (to a role that doesn't exist yet, might take a long time to materialize and may not be better than my current job besides a bump in pay). I can't afford to quit or be let go right now.",Educational_Army2037,1,1.0,0,1712561756,2024-04-08 07:35:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byry4p/is_commenting_to_correct_something_unfair_or/,4,2024

1byreve,should I leave my cool af job at a cool af company?,"

need your opinion on something 
i feel I should love my job but I'm neutral about it. i feel I'm wasting my 20s and I wanna travel and enjoy but I don't have money for it plus no savings literally because I get intern money. 

also I want to get into ux design idk how to I'm confused bout a lot of things. should I work on my ux design skills and get a job or should I leave this one and get a higher paying one so I can focus on other things w money 

so I (23,f)work as a copywriter for an agency and my agency is very chill and I get to work w cool af clients across the globe 

the work is pretty chill compared to other agencies and there's not much pressure to deliver it like it happens in other Indian agencies 

although I'm not sure if copywriting is for me I'm still exploring. literally everything I write gets rejected by manager. even creative strategies I come up w for decks gets modified and completely changed by them.

I used to think my manager is sweet initially but not sure anymore. I've never met them and we only chat. they work remotely and I rarely get on calls w them.

Things were pretty chill for first 6 months but then I messed up a deck and they were on leave. When they came back and saw it they were furious at me and shouted at me. i take full responsibility for it but I was going thru shit at that time personally and also recently got done an eye surgery then. my was not up to the mark even till EOD and they told me to send the final deck to the team lead anyhow by today. doesn't matter how late but it should be sent today itself. I obviously didn't do it and sent it next morning but her behaviour was super weird. since then I started noticing the red flags like tgey micro manages me a lot 

id try to come up with copy ideas and sometimes she'd say it doesn't work and she'd give feedback on it later and next day I see they sent their own copy in the grp.

sometimes she'd like my copy and tell me to modify it according to the designers visual and next day I'd see they sent their own copy without informing me. i felt undervalued due to these instances so I ended up being super honest in their review.

i regret it now because I think they are pretty nice and sweet and encourage me in grp calls because I'm shy.

do u think I did the right thing? pls lmk. im not sure if they went through the review it. because they might be disappointed in me  because I never mentioned these things to  them. communication is really hard tbh cuz they work remotely. 

also I see other ppls manager in my company and they are super chill work wise including my team lead. but I don't work directly w any of them. seeing all this I get jealous and I feel this micro managing is too much I'm not a child


also I feel I get paid in peanuts. literally intern money for this company and I work full time and I feel I put a lot of work out than I get paid for. 

i started having an attitude after the deck incident and I was like I'd only put out work I'm getting paid for but recently I started feeling grateful for this job again and I don't have any issues w the manager. like I'm back at being nice now. but income is def an issue. also I'm not sure how she'd react after reading my review ",dumbandwittyy,2,0.75,0,1712559586,2024-04-08 06:59:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byreve/should_i_leave_my_cool_af_job_at_a_cool_af_company/,4,2024
1byrek8,Is giving up a prestigious fellowship for a high-paying job a bad idea?,"Hi everyone, I’m honestly super distraught about a crossroads I’m experiencing right now and I’m hoping for some affirmation/advice!

I am a college senior about to graduate from a semi-prestigious liberal arts school. I studied a mix of Art & Anthropology. 

My school has a big reputation for producing Fulbright winners. For those who don’t know, the Fulbright fellowship is a program funded by the State Department that (in part) allows US students to do research or teach English in another country. With the help and advice of my professors, I put a lot of effort into my application to do anthropology research in a South American country. I was lucky enough to be named a semifinalist for the fellowship and my professors have told me that my application is strong enough to likely be awarded the fellowship, however, I am still waiting on the final results. I do not mean to be presumptuous at all and I do not assume that I will get the award, I am honestly just basing this off the (very flattering) support I got from my school’s fellowship program.

While waiting to hear back last fall, I applied for corporate jobs and ended up being offered a job at a well known bank. Because I majored in anthropology/art I honestly was super surprised to see this offer come through. The salary is significantly higher than anything I could make working in academia/the art world - the 1st year salary for my 2 year rotational program is around $110k, which is around the same salary as a junior professor or a full curator in my city.

I recently found out that the Fulbright funding is pretty shockingly low for my proposed country, at around $1000/month (my country is one of the more expensive countries in South America.) I would have to basically ask my parents for money lol to make ends meet - money they don’t really have to spare, and they expressed to me that they would be (rightfully, imo) pretty fed up with me asking for their support when I got lucky enough to get a high-paying offer elsewhere.

I ultimately do want to do cultural work long term and I hope to go to grad school in the Arts or Anthropology in the future. My thought is, if because this path has low earning potential, isn’t it smarter to work the 2 year program and save as much as I can before pivoting back to grad school? But then I am hesitant because people always say Fulbright is so special and opens doors, and it’s what all my professors are pushing me towards. I am honestly almost 100% certain that if I get lucky enough to have both options on the table, I will choose the corporate job because of the savings opportunity and because it will be better for my relationship with the family - allowing me to be independent financially which I feel like will allow me to strengthen my relationship with my parents as their young adult son. But it still hurts to “sell out” and work so far away from my major… i honestly don’t know what to do!",Tiny_Bookkeeper_3290,1,1.0,3,1712559552,2024-04-08 06:59:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byrek8/is_giving_up_a_prestigious_fellowship_for_a/,4,2024
1byr9vv,Professional rut,"A little backstory:
I am a 30yo woman living in the EU with no degree and a few physical ailments that won't let me make a lot of physical effort and require some daily care. I was a highly ambitious person that built a business in digital entertainment until 2020. I raised enough money from my business to build myself a house and I am still in that process. I am also in a happy and healthy 5y relationship and have enough savings to sustain myself and my healthcare for 1-2 more years.

The problem: 
The industry I had the business in(I wont disclose that since it is a very niched one and I don't want to be identified) was eaten by the big corps because of some tech changes so I am not able to go back to that, everyone went out of business except 3 big investment groups that ate everything. My self confidence was shattered, I fell into deep depression and just lifted myself up  a year ago to come off of meds and start rebuilding life.

I learned a bit of coding last year, made a few personal projects (just in time for AI to hit my dreams). I am fairly good at photoshop and illustration, not only photo manipulations. I did SEO more than a decade ago and was fairly good at it.  I am passionate about psychology, personal development, medicine and dance.

I think my strong areas are leadership (I am good at understanding people and helping them achieve deadlines), independent fast learning, diplomacy (i am a bit of a people pleaser though) and visual creativity (i imagine things very easily, check alignments just by looking at things, estimating measurements and so on). My weak areas are rigid deadlines (i am somewhat of a procrastinator) and risk taking, I am pretty risk averse / neurotic.

I am fearful for my future, don't know how to approach my career and how to start making some money again, I need something to do that will generate me 3-4k a month in a year from now and that is somewhat steady, I need predictability because of my health issues. Please advise, I am willing to take courses and learn new skills if needed.",meah_probably,4,1.0,5,1712559015,2024-04-08 06:50:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byr9vv/professional_rut/,4,2024
1byr8aq,New job hasn't gotten any better after 10 months,"Joined a new job 10 months ago with the goal of expanding my knowledge and expertise, came from a job of 3 years that started to feel limiting for my growth so I left.

It's my first time in a corporte role after being in start-ups, I expected a steep learning curve but I still feel as clueless as I did when I started. So many terms and jargons that I'm trying to learn at my own time, but not fast enough. Projects with SOPs i'm not familiar with that are moving faster than my learning speed.

Overall, I come to work feeling like the ""dumb"" one who makes mistakes, tried working on weekends but started to feel burnt out so I stopped. It feels like I cannot keep up with how fast everyone is working and workload. At this point, my brain is just fried.

It doesn't help that I have no friends, I eat with my coworkers but struggle to really form a casual friendship with them (wasn't this hard in my previous job, I was more jovial but am super shy now and timid). 

My boyfriend tells me that this is normal, to give it a year, wanted to know if it really gets better haha. Idk to be honest, I don't think if it's a matter of me not being qualified or smart enough for the job or this being something normal that everyone goes through.

2. In the 18 months that I didn't work, I actually tried my hands on having a business mainly consulting work. Did courses as well as I love learning. My worry is that wouldn't they see me as a flight risk? Or someone who is flippant? How do I navigate that?

1bypybe,Performance review after submitting resignation,"I've been at the hands of a toxic micromanaging boss for two years now and finally had enough. I asked to have a conversation about my future at the company and after being told my wants were unrealistic, I said I'd like to leave. After a few weeks of figuring out the details, I finally submitted my resignation, which is an official form that was accepted by HR.

Now, I suddenly have my annual performance review on my calendar, which my boss has been pushing off since January.

I've had multiple discussions with HR about my manager. They very obviously meet with me either in person or via zoom call to degrade my work and have hostile conversations with nobody around to witness. About 1 in 4 of these conversations end with me in tears. This person is truly awful.

My last conversation with HR was a request to no longer have face to face meetings during my final weeks, which they said they couldn't enforce because as a manager ""they're within their rights to request that things are done the way they want them to be done"". Which yeah sure, but why can't they just put their feedback in an email? 

What are my options here? Unfortunately I have to stay through the final date for financial/health insurance reasons, but the thought of having to sit through a performance review just the two of us makes me want to vomit. I really just want to attend the meeting and put it on mute the whole time, or not attend at all, but want to make sure I consider all repercussions.

My plan is to complete the ACCA skill level papers and CFA lvl 2 along with my graduation and will sit for placements, then after getting a job will complete the remaining leftovers in both. By the time I complete these two, will use this work ex (3 yrs) to show my PER in both and will get both designations. Then after all these, will prepare for CAT, to get into top b school for MBA finance. The confusion I have is that what field should I work in? And also should I do CFA? Will it complement my ACCA? I have no idea is this plan right or wrong. [Now my mindset is to learn as many things as possible to increase my value and knowledge to get competitive in the job market.] And I also don't want to complete my programs one by one, cause it will take lot more time. I want to finish off things as quick as possible. So, give me some advice for the following questions please,                                    1, Should I pursue CFA? I heard it is valuable and golden standard certification. On the other side some say that it has narrow scope and not valuable without a MBA.                            2, If yes to CFA, should I pursue it along my ACCA and will it be relevant to CFA and add value?                                                                             3,If no to both questions, is there any qualifications to consider to get valuable and lucrative career overall?                                                                  4, If yes to both questions, is there any jobs that I can target to complete my PER in both at the same time, as because these programs require experience in (relevant) areas.                   5, Is MBA still be a need to get valuable and to get high compensation, if yes, then is it ok to go for MBA after having 3 yrs workex?

1bypaoi,Contemplating my career and life choices and I need advice. Should I leave the job I just started last week? Should I change my career?,"Background: I (26F) went to college and received a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. While still in school I gained internship experience in Social Media. I graduated in May of 2020 and had a difficult time finding a job but was finally able to land one as a Social Media Coordinator for $30k at a small Marketing agency. I enjoyed my work and during my time there are was able to move into a managerial role in the company overseeing all of the accounts $40k. After a little over a year and a half, I chose to actively look for new roles as I had spent all of my time and effort to go above and beyond in my role only to not receive benefits or be able to make ends meet with such a low salary. After about 6 months of searching, I received an offer from another digital marketing agency as a Social Media Team Lead for $55k and took it. I quickly learned that this was not a good environment for me. I was given tasks and responsibilities I wasn’t initially aware of, had little to no guidance, and was given a large workload. I would have to work through lunches and was clocking in 10-hour days while only getting paid for 8. Fast forward to about 8 months later, the company went through layoffs and I was one of the employees affected. It took me about a month to receive an offer for a new role as a Social Media Manager $55k for a chain of cafes. Honestly, when I took this offer I chose not to see all of the red flags from the interview experience I was just desperate for work. The “office” was a space in the production center which was a warehouse with an industrial kitchen, there were bugs, dirty bathrooms, no cleaning of the space whatsoever, there were no benefits, and only 5 PTO days after a year of working there. The marketing department of the company was a complete disaster. There was no structure, no organization, no strategy or plan. I created a plan for the social media account and started the business's brand creation from scratch. The Marketing Manager left about 6 months in and I took over the whole department. I started an intern program, planned events for the brand to attend, set up influencer campaigns, and more. I did everything in my power to help sales, but the business was struggling. Long story short the whole company went under and as I was being laid off the owner told me they were $1M in debt. At this point, it is February of 2024 and I’ve been laid off twice in two years from jobs that I didn’t enjoy. I was seriously starting to contemplate if this career was for me. I was tired of uncertainty and shitty positions with little to no pay and benefits. Throughout my time in both of those roles, I was always looking for better opportunities but was always met high competition and never had any luck. After about a month and a half I received an offer as a Marketing & Social Media Manager $70k with benefits and PTO and I accepted. I have now been at the position for a week and I’m seriously contemplating leaving. Within the first week, I have seen many many signs of a toxic work environment, extreme micromanaging, poor attitudes, bullying, and a very cliquey environment. The employees rarely take their lunch breaks and are always there after the clock. Plus, once again the role is not what I expected and honestly I don’t enjoy what I’m doing. So now I’m at the point where my gut feeling is to quit this role and be done with this career. I just keep second-guessing myself thinking maybe I’m not giving it a fair shot and that I should have something else before I leave. But the fact is that I am seriously unhappy and am tired of wasting many years in my life in a career where I have had shitty job after shitty job.",Melodic-Guitar-9666,2,1.0,1,1712551663,2024-04-08 04:47:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bypaoi/contemplating_my_career_and_life_choices_and_i/,4,2024

Misleading Job.. feeling uncomfortable

I’ve been in social media marketing for about 4 years now. I’ve recently found a new job as a part time content creator/sales advisor for a fine jewellery engagement boutique. It all seemed perfect, I nailed the interviews and ended up getting the position. The first red flag was that they weren’t completely truthful with the salary that was listed (this is a whole different story). I stood my ground and negotiated, ending up getting the amount that was listed in first place. This was just before I started and I got a bad gut feeling. Mind you, the people that own the business are located in Florence, Italy while I’m in Australia

So, on my first day I went into the boutique and my new bosses dad is showing me around (it’s a family run jewellery business) he didn’t have any of the answers to my questions because he said he doesn’t actually work there. The co worked that was supposed to me with me for day was two hours late and I was there by myself because the dad had to leave. Finally the “co worker” arrives and he has no clue what’s going on. He said he never comes in to the boutique and he designs jewellery for them on the side (it’s not even his full time job) he was there for an hour then left. For the rest of my first day and the whole of my second day I was completely alone - The job description was listed as mainly a social media manager and occasionally being a sales advisor for clients in store but they have literally no one else in this boutique. They want me to do everything from clearing, ordering, customer service, full social media management (4 platforms), editing and content creation. I’m feeling really overwhelmed and unsupported. 

The worst part is they have been asking me to do work on my first few days off. I got an email at 8pm last night asking me to set up my work email outside of work hours PLUS requesting I ask a “well presenting” girlfriend + her partner to come into the boutique on my next day of work and get them to create engagement content for free. This seems SO inappropriate, especially for my third day. I’ve just started but I’m really feeling like I need to quit asap. 

Should I get out of there asap? Any advice is greatly appreciated ",Historical-Walrus938,1,1.0,2,1712551369,2024-04-08 04:42:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byp7nl/would_you_quit_if_your_job_asked_you_this/,4,2024

1byorwh,LLM vs. MBA for sustainability career,"Hi Reddit,

I’m currently working in a corporate sustainability role and am considering a postgraduate degree in either LLM or MBA.

Background
I have 2 years of experience in the corporate sustainability field and have an undergraduate degree in economics and finance. 

Would it add value if I have already done most of what typical MBA curriculums cover in my undergrad (ie economics, finance, accounting and management)?

Should I consider a LLM in business law or environmental law instead for my case?

I aim to advance my career in the corporate sustainability field rather than an environmental lawyer. However, ESG itself is becoming more of a regulatory issue than just a branding initiative.

Any thoughts or comments are much appreciated.

1byorrc,What are my options??? Feeling so hopeless,"I'm having a late-night life crisis so here goes: 

I want to go back to a career that is more aligned to my degree. I have no idea how, feeling hopeless, and I don't know what to do. 

For context I am mid-20's, F. I recently moved to the US (no need for visa sponsorship). I have a degree in Engineering. For what it's worth, my degree is WES certified (meaning it's acceptable as a US university equivalent). 

I started my career as a Quality Engineer for a small US-based company. I was picked for the H1B visa lottery back then, but they needed to close down the overseas office due to COVID.  I stayed in the company for 3-ish years. 

It's a little bit rough during COVID, but I was able to secure an admin job for another US-based company. It wasn't much but it helped pay the bills and is a remote job (needed back then because I had a high risk family member). 

It is not challenging at all so once things were a little bit smoother, I took another admin role in a US-based startup. I liked what I do here, it's a startup so I get to dabble on many things. I am very lucky that I have a compassionate boss and am able to continue this job after I got my work permit here in the US, but unfortunately, even with a salary adjustment, it's just not enough and I just don't see any lateral or upward movement. 

I want to go back to an engineering based job but I don't know how to break through. I am thinking of taking the FE exam if it can help (just to show that I still have the basics of engineering covered) and applying to entry-level roles but with the job market right now, I don't know how to get back in. I am not sure if taking debt for a master's degree will help. Any thoughts?

Idk how to describe this dumpster fire so please bear with me. Im a current PhD student and I've been taking on contract/freelance work for a while since my university pays like shit. I live in the U.S. but I mainly apply for companies in the EU since they usually seem to not do LC or other recruiting bs, so the interview and hiring process is smoother (at least it has been from my experience). I got hired by a Polish startup that was doing SaaS, and the owner of the company basically had a few products in mind. I was doing cheap labor for resume experience, and I ended up doing most of the work, from full stack to devops. Now and then we'd get desperate undergrads doing unpaid internships, and very rarely other paid contractors. The company made almost no money and he eventually shut down. I'm still in contact with the guy and he even said I could use him as a reference if needed, but since the product(s) were basically flopped and the company shut down, idk if this would seem like I'm lying on my resume or not. I'm mainly worried I'll list it down in my work experience and then it'll get flagged by background checks or such. Should I add this to my resume at all?

1bynty0,"26F, feeling lost and need advice ","Hi, reaching out because I feel lost in terms of my career path. I'm 26 with a bachelor's degree in life sciences from a university in Canada. After I graduated, the pandemic hit and I feel like my life went on pause. Towards the end of the pandemic, I found a program at Queen's that led to licensing as an immigration consultant. Because I had some previous experience in international student services, I thought I wanted to work in that field. However, I've been struggling to find any relevant jobs for a year. Since then, I've just been working part-time in an unrelated job at a college as I continue to search for jobs. I'm honestly at my wit's end applying for jobs and really need advice on what to do. 

Here are some options I've been considering:

1. I continue volunteering with refugees and continue looking for work in the immigration consulting field. 

2. I go back to a field that is relevant to my bachelor's degree and look to get into grad school for a master's in health sciences. 

3. I move to the US temporarily and look for work there. I have some friends I can stay with. 

Unfortunately, I don't really have a network to rely on or mentors to speak to where I am currently. I'd really appreciate some help or advice on the situation. Thank you!

1bynd6a,Am I handing this correctly?,"I’ve been getting recruited from multiple companies in the last couple of weeks. I’ve had multiple unofficial offers on pay and job functions but have ultimately turned them down due to the flexibility in my current position. Also, the pay bump is fine but washes out due to fringe benefits and bonuses throughout the year.

I’ve recently been solicited by a high ranking individual within the industry that I work for; not a direct competitor but would need the green light from my current employer. It’s tough to get any salary commitments from them but I’ve been recruited hard from them. 

Is it fine since I’m not getting any salary commitments before an interview and disclosure to my employer, to say no due to being in the crosshairs of a non competitive offer and being identified as a flight risk at my current employer.

Should I first get an offer before before going through an interview? Or am I wrong in this assumption?

I am also considering being a PTs assistant as it requires little schooling and I do like watching being get better over time.

1byj9a8,Just going out I make 25-30k less than my peers at my job. What can I do?,"Let me preface by saying that we now have salary transparency ranges that are provided to us annually when we have our review. Last year I saw that I was 80% below the midpoint range. At that time midpoint was 18k more than what I was making. I asked my managers what I can do to hit midpoint. They gave me the list of suggestions. I worked and busted my butt of and when annual reviews came around last month, I achieved a higher rating, but only got a 5 percent raise. I looked at the range again and saw that it went up to 21k more than what I was now making. My manager said that my raise was dependent on the salary I came in with. I have been the same title for 5 years. I was like wow this is very underwhelming. As we know, the market is not the best so it’s hard to find anything. I really love my job, but my salary is becoming more and more unsustainable to pay the bills. The 5 percent helped a bit but not really. To make things even more discouraging, I found out that my peers of the same level of experience and title are over 20k more than I am. So they are hitting beyond that midpoint range that I saw. Which is what that midpoint range is based off of. It’s based off of the average market value as well as others in that title. I even found out that people more entry level than me are making the same amount as me. I feel so discouraged as my performance was good and I keep getting acknowledged by my bosses, yet nothing was done to give me a higher raise? I want to go in and speak to them, but what steps can I take without causing a scene? I uck at confrontations but I know this is what I need to do and I feel duped lol. How do I even go in asking for 20-30k increase? I do a lot of work and I have made it clear to them last year that I wanted a raise and grow but it wasn’t enough. I get along well with my boss but I wonder if he should have recognized this? I want to get better at advocating myself and challenge myself to ask. Any advice would be appreciated. Also this company makes a ton of money as it’s a large organization.

1byg8zs,My boss (seemingly) hates me - should I quit?,"(throwaway account)

This is really new territory for me. In college, my bosses at the jobs I worked and the professors I had all pretty much loved me. I was a hard worker, was willing to go the extra mile on things, am friendly and enjoying helping others, will take up tasks without being asked, etc. I even got praised for stuff like motivating a previous slacker on a project to care and put in effort, and doing extracurricular community service and contests (even placing in a paid reward contest, making the school look very good).

I graduated in Dec ‘22 and started my first job out of college in spring ‘23. Training for this job was extensive and mostly wfh, and lasted about 9 months. It involved passing industry exams that I passed first try. When I started my job, there were two managers, and they both liked me; one of them was the person who made the decision to hire me, actually.

However, right as I finished training, someone who was in a hybrid role but who mostly wfh in my office became promoted to management, and I was assigned to be one of her direct reports. She has technically worked my role, but only for 6 months during the lockdown. At that time my role was to be a benchwarmer, because it largely involves face-to-face client interaction which company covid policy had made nonexistent.

My boss has been getting promoted quickly ever since, and so despite sharing the management role with people much more experienced than her, she’s only a little older than me. I honestly thought it was impressive originally, but after being under her, I’m starting to think it was undeserved.

Anyway, my first month under her, things seemed fine. She tried to teach me a few useful skills to help me with my career development, and things were going great.

But then things very suddenly soured after that. I’m not sure why.* I haven’t gossiped about anyone in my office (the people are all really nice and there’s just not really anything to gossip about—not to mention that’s just not my thing). I’ve been nothing but nice and complementary to her. I’ve done nice little things for the other people in my office. Etc. But since the relationship inexplicably went sour, I’ve dealt with all sorts of petty bs from my boss.

For example, she:
* Writes me up for needing to be “reminded” to do a task I was never assigned (and have been without fail reliably doing since actually being formally assigned it)
* Remembered me as making a specific mistake *twice* recently, when one of the occurrences was a more experienced fellow colleague in my role - I also recently caught a major, worse mistake made by this same colleague, but she gave no credit to me for catching that
* Criticized my socks - my office has a typical dry corporate dress code, but many of the guys in the office wear fun socks with goofy stuff on them which you can see when they sit down. Yet when I did the same thing (socks with simple cats on them) it’s a problem? Mine are honestly tame compared to some of the guys’ - one of them even wears socks that say “f*ck you” if you look closely.
* Says I’m a “baby” at my role so she’s not going to try to coach and develop me**
* Literally moments later, says I need to remind the other, more experienced people in my role to do some of our role tasks (despite them not being specifically assigned to me) if I don’t do them personally. Previously had sent a petty email about one of these tasks being done by me at noon “when half the day is over”) on a morning I was dealing with a problem no one in my office had *ever* seen before. That particular morning my colleagues in my same role were unburdened with tasks and had been spending the morning socializing and eating bagels - and so could have and should have done it themselves.
* Wrote me up for making a mistake ""several times before"" that has happened *once* before
* Also has said she wants to put me in a role I’m overqualified for and already got to dabble in (and did not like) as part of my training. I specifically said I enjoy my current (in-person) work over that part of my training, which was wfh. I would 100% quit in an instant if she pushed this transfer because the role absolutely sucks booty—both the work itself, and the complete lack of career growth. It’s a career dead-end, while my current job leads directly to the career I want. Fortunately, she’s been seemingly too busy to do it so far. But she really wants to for some reason.

*My best guess is the dislike started after she was asked for referral for a job in a different part of the company. She referred me, not knowing (because she didn’t look into it at all) that the role typically requires 3-5 years industry experience which I of course don’t have. Despite that, I still did well in the interviews, but the manager for this other role basically said I seemed like good fit, but ultimately not experienced enough, particularly because they needed people in it ASAP.

Things soured right after that went down, but despite the timing, I don’t know if that’s the cause, because it’d be such a silly thing to dislike me for. I didn’t get the role she referred me for that I was unqualified for from the get-go. That’s pretty normal I’d think—most people don’t get roles they lack the experience for.

**There are three managers at my office, and the head manager is very big on the philosophy that managers are coaches and should always be developing their employees. For example, while teaching me something, this manager said “you know more than you give yourself credit for” and “you should have more confidence.” This manager has also explained he’s gotten flak from corporate for his desire to keep coaching beyond KPIs. This managers’ philosophy though is probably why my office is generally a top-performing location in the company. So, I don’t think he’d appreciate her telling me there’s no reason to develop me. Also worth noting: my role doesn’t have KPIs. It’s very hard to measure our performance that way.

Anyway, the other day my manger really escalated the pettiness with a subtly accusatory email after our most recent meeting. The email basically said “I’m assigning you these specific tasks in writing so that’s there’s no “miscommunication,” with the pretty clear subtext being that there had been previous “miscommunication” and that I was already assigned those tasks.

Firstly, I had already been doing the assigned tasks (and some she didn’t assign but probably forgot because she didn’t really experience my role), and secondly, before now, this weird singling out of tasks had never occurred.

Not that it’s bad thing in itself—I think ownership goes a long way to efficiency in the workplace—but when only one person, and the least experienced person, is expected to take ownership of role tasks, I think it’s weird, especially when it comes with passive aggressive implications.

And ofc she’s written me up for needing to “reminded” to do a task that belongs to all the people in my role that I was never assigned. Never mind that I have been voluntarily taking on many tasks without being asked, and already was reminding others in my role to do tasks!

Anyway, this is new territory for me like I said, so I’m not sure how to react. My gut says she doesn’t like me, there’s no changing her mind, and I need to get out before she transfers me to that sucky, dead-end role. This would beat her to the punch of pushing me into a bad spot, and give me relief from her petty bs.

Although I’ve never been bullied in college or work before, I was bullied by some teachers in k-12. Obviously with the power dynamics there, a kid is just screwed. Currently the power dynamics are again not in my favor, but the difference now is I’m an adult and have the freedom to just leave. I need to pay my bills, so I’d do so by getting another job lined up, but at least I *can,* even if it’s a pain in the current job market.

But part of me wonders: is this just my emotions talking?

After all, by most measures, my current role is awesome—great colleagues, great career track, really, really great benefits. All ~40 of my colleagues save for my boss and one guy (who has issues with everyone, he’s just abrasive) like me. Due to my background in tech, I’ve even taken to fixing people’s minor tech issues so they don’t have sit on hold with our official, corporate tech team. This, and things like my friendliness, my willingness to help, and my eagerness to learn have earned me a positive reputation. Worst thing is probably the pay—it is mediocre for the cost of living. I can’t afford a car for example, and the others in my role either are getting by with double income from being married, or live at their parents with a car that is parent-provided. However, the pay would improve radically after the first promotion.

I also don’t want to burn bridges—my company is large and often considered one of the better employers in my industry, with locations everywhere. I’m afraid quitting would burn bridges, especially because I’d find it very, very hard not to rip into my boss’s behavior in an exit interview.",B0ssDrivesMeCrazy,1,0.6700000166893005,15,1712525987,2024-04-07 21:39:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1byg8zs/my_boss_seemingly_hates_me_should_i_quit/,4,2024
1byfzvb,Hitting a wall in IT,"Good afternoon all,

To cut to the chase I work an entry level helpdesk role, have been for the last 2 years. I know how to use Azure, 365, and have all basics down of IT all around. I also have A+, Network +, and Security +. As well as CCNA and CCNP.

I want to do cloud network security. 

Recently I graduated university with a BS in cybersecurity and my manager met with me for an evaluation. I got a raise but when I asked if there was opportunity to grow or move up in the company he told me flat out ""your position is a one time only position"". Meaning i hit a ceiling. 

I was thinking of commissioning to the military as an officer, Space Force primarily to take my IT skills to the next level within the next two years.

Would this be a good transition? I am still below $50k/yearly. 

I'm 26 and my gf is down to go with me if i do. I just need to know if there's anyone who did the cyber route in the military, officer wise. Any advice is welcomed.

If you were in my shoes trying to push your career forward, what would you advise?

1bydi2o,Seeking for career advice in tech,"So, I'm 30 and I've graduated in Marketing and Advertising. In the middle of college I decided I didn't want to follow a career in Advertising in the ""traditional"" model of agencies or in marketing departments of big enterprises. 

I started studying programming and got a job as an intern in a startup. I knew from the beginning I didn't want to be a full-time developer, but I understood I had to ""speak the language of technology"" if I wanted to do anything meaningful. 

So, I work as a developer for 2 and a half years, then tried to start a business with some friends but we were to young an naive and focused on the ""I want to change the world"" romantic view of it. So of course it didn't workout as planned. Then I had to find a job because I ran out of the money I saved to work in my company.  I tried to mix the marketing graduation with the tech skills I've acquired, and got a job as a product owner in a big company, than went to work in a digital product design agency for some years and now I'm working in the a perfect intersection of marketing and technology, in the growth area of a big fintech, in a product manager position. I manage a team in building chatbots with AI and all the supposedly cool stuff. It seems perfect at times, and when I say it out loud, people usually think I don't have anything to complain about. 

The problems I'm facing right now:

- I'm can't stand working in finance. I can't see the value created for people. I miss the times when I believed in myself as someone who could change the world a little for the better.

- I'm not technical enough right now so I can bootstrap my own company and I ain't got the resources to do so. I'm studying a lot of statistics, a little bit of python and so on, but sometimes I just feel I will never get good enough to build something my own. I feel that as a PM I don't have any ""crafts"" and that need a lot of ""company structure"" to perform. I'm lacking in confidence.

- Every other job I think of trying to go for, gets me thinking that in a few years I'll be feeling the same as I am right now, specially about the ""political"" part, of wanting to do something that makes peoples' lives better, and only being able to focus on profits. I also don't really believe in non-profit as a real source of change (maybe I'm just bitter, I know).

I know there's a lot of stuff mixed up in there, I'm already working this in therapy, but I just feel stuck right now.",Electronic_Acadia_12,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1712519464,2024-04-07 19:51:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bydi2o/seeking_for_career_advice_in_tech/,4,2024

1byd5gq,Should I rise up my voice and ask them,"Hello All,

I am currently working in an MNC and having 2 years of exp and among this 1 year of bench.
So basically I am working in my current project from last 8-9 months and we are all working in shifts.

My team is total of 4 members (1 women)

As a junior they asked me to do the night shifts and I don't know i didn't ask any questions and told yes.

But from Jan 2024 all shift timings got changed and my shift was from 11pm to 8 am in the morning.

But the only problem is we didn't have any work at that time as most activities and work will happen during the morning and afternoon.

So my team asked me if I want to learn anything strech yourself to attend calls and important tasks in the afternoon.


So from the past 2 months my typical work schedule will be 
Joining at 3pm-6:30Pm and attend calls and work tasks and after I will be on and off until 10 pm in that if my lead calls if it's urgent I'll login in that time also.

I cannot able to say no to them as from one side I wanted to learn something and on the other side my health is affecting.

And I'll login at 10 pm and will be awake until 2 am and I'm keeping the alarms for every 2 hrs and I woke up and check mails and I reply back to the mails.

So in the initial days I thought I could have more time to learn and if it's night shifts I'm having allowance and wfh added advantage.

But now after doing this for 2 months I am feeling exhausted and even I'm not having proper work life balance is what I feel.

I'm infront of the system for more than 10+ hrs doing 2-3 hrs of work.

I wanted to tell my lead that I'm not able to do this as it's affecting my sleep cycle and health.

But I'm not sure how to convey.
 

Need some inputs here!!!

\- I heard about the above afterwards in our 1:1 and they asked some interesting questions like: what does your day-to-day look like? etc -- they  also noted that the senior leadership from the leadership call seemed skeptical of my manager's overall efforts in standing up this team (our team is pretty new, only a year old and has had trouble convincing senior leadership of the team's relevance and use of budget, which this incident dealing with my deliverable seems to have given ammo to the naysayers and doubters on senior leadership)

  
\- about a week later, she sent an email outlining my specific expectations: what time I should be on, what responsibilities I should be doing and other projects/asks that I am accountable for -- essentially a list of all my current responsibilities and projects 

  
\- I did not meet expectations for one powerpoint last week and so she sent out an email documenting that I did not meet expectations for the powerpoint and outlined step by step future expectations

1by9no7,Can you offer suggestions/advice?,"Seeking help with career path

Hello all. I am a 24 year old male, currently residing in Michigan. I’ve been working as a straight truck driver under a FedEx contractor for about a year, previously working for my family’s cement company out of high school (I have a Class A CDL) I’m married with 3 children, 2 being from a previous relationship (partial parenting time) my youngest under 1 y/o (full time; current relationship). My wife and I have recently decided that since parenting time will need to be adjusted when my oldest children start school this fall (they will be with their mother) we would like to make a move, away from the stress of our abundantly interjecting families and create a life of our own. I’ve been searching for possible career paths, preferably with relocation assistance (though I understand this is a difficult find for an entry level position and no current degree). I’ve applied for a position at Total Quality Logistics (entry level with relocation to Cincinnati) but upon extensive research I’ve found a lot of negative reviews from employees; and I haven’t even secured the job yet. I’m open to any and all fields, so long as it has career potential. If anyone has any helpful advice or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it (Please keep rudeness/ignorance to yourselves). 

Thanks in advance,

Making Changes.

1by9ber,Work gossip?,"I am 23 and am in my second professional job after graduating college and am just looking for advice from people who have been working a long time. I left my last job for many reasons, but one of the reasons why was because my boss was constantly gossiping about people in a negative manner-as in “why was she wearing those heels?” Or something catty like that. I always hated it and found it unnecessary of her. 

In my new job, people started talking about each other to me my second day in, but it wasn’t catty. It was more just “this person did this to me, so I don’t like her now.” Trying to warn me about people I guess? And I had multiple coworkers do this with me my first couple of weeks into the job. Then, I had a coworker who snapped at me for asking a question out of nowhere during my third week on the job. I told a couple of people she snapped at me and then people started telling me stories about how she has been rude to them too and to hold her at arm’s length. 

It got back to my boss that this person snapped at me, and the person who snapped at me used to work with my boss and was recruited by her to work at this new job. Everyone told me that they never expect promotions because it will just go to this person who used to work with my boss. Ever since this girl snapped at me, my boss has been micromanaging everything I do, putting multiple meetings with just me on my calendar 15 minutes beforehand, she has been upset with me for things like getting sick and has been aggressive with me for no reason. I feel very singled out. Even my coworkers and other members of management have noticed this and have apologized to me on her behalf. I obviously don’t know what my coworker(s) told her about me, and this is just speculation, but it seems like someone flipped the situation and told her something bad about me. 

I think I was wrong for telling anyone this girl snapped at me-I probably should have kept it to myself. But if everyone else talks about each other, it seems normal? Is it best to not talk about anyone in anyway at a job? Or just listen to other people doing it, but don’t engage? I don’t know how to handle office politics, and my goal anyway is to go back to school-I just thought I’d get work experience first. But now I’m thinking I just want to do something mindless while I try to go back to school and focus on that instead.

1by99j8,"Trying to switch jobs, not sure  what's suitable (mental health challenge)","I was a lawyer prior to this and it made my depression and anxiety shoot to the sky. I work late nights with demanding clients, feeling unfulfilled. I then jumped into tech as a programme manager (more to managing partnershipss). Stayed about 3 years now but im starting to lose my passion, especially when my bosses dont seem to care when my mom died suddenly and im dealing with so much grief. I broke down so hard when im told that it's been over a month and I shouldn't be feeling so sad anymore. My mom had covid and i watched her fight for her life for 2 weeks. I didn't even get to attend her funeral. I missed her last birthday because i had to work for a vain project. My boss just throws whatever work he gets even if it means telling half truths to it. I can't do it anymore. 

Problem is, I've developed social anxiety and I can no longer deal with clients as much. I dont know what my skillsets can do and maintain my salary to continue being in middle class as im the sole bread winner and i need to maintain this salary for rent, utilities, my mental medication and bring food to the table. I'm a female with adhd, depression and anxiety and im masking real hard so i dont get told im too emotional.

What kind of work would be suitable? I have some commercial and tech law background, i can do project management, but i dont have hard skills for low-human-interaction jobs with good pay like hardcore tech. I dont enjoy legal work. I am more creative in nature.

What sort of work can I aim for? I'm really at my wits end and i even therapy doesn't help. Im just crying every night and feeling like screaming at work.

1by97r7,"I hate my job after six months and decided to give myself six more months to make it work or move on. Am I being reasonable, and who at work do I tell to improve my chances of fixing it?","I’ve been working in a project management role for a government contractor (non-military, for a national laboratory) for six months, and I hate it. I came from a position doing project work and feel like I waste a lot of my time doing work that is unfulfilling. Additionally, the company pays according to seniority rather than experience, so I’m making considerably less than I’d make elsewhere.

Initially I was fine with these things. I recognized that I lacked experience in a pure project management role, and was assured I would receive training and mentorship from peers and educational resources. 

After some unexpected events, none of this has come to pass.

Frankly, I hate the job now. 

After a month of things going sideways, my days are mostly sprinting from one fire to the next and being insulted/accused of not getting things right instantly. No one knows how the job works or what the requirements are, but everyone feels the need to say I’m doing it wrong without any advice on how to do it right.

I feel more burnt out now than I ever did in graduate school or any other job, and my work feels far less consequential than either of those did.

With this in mind, I decided to give it six months. If it’s better by then, I stay. If not, I move on. I’m also going to be applying to jobs during that time just to field offers.

Am I reasonable for this? Can I tell my boss this is my plan? They all assure me my role is essential and they need me, so I’ve been hesitant to mention anything for fear of feeling like I’m forcing their hand. However, I’m at the end of my rope. If this job is anything close to what it is right now in six months, I’ll lose my mind. 

I’ve thought about going to my manager and saying I need a timeline on career development and educational opportunities, but I want to make sure I have the conversation correctly. If I make it the full year I’ll have immense job security, but I don’t know if I want that at this point.

1by7pcv,I have dyscalculia. But I want to pursuit a degree.,"Hello everyone! I’m currently desperately seeking for help/advice on completing my degree. I want to get a degree at my local community college but I have to take specific math courses in order to apply to the programs there or any degree. I’m very disappointed in myself because I took the math class required for the program and immediately dropped it, I was doing terrible at it. In that specific math class I had ‘extra help’ with a extra tutor during the class but she didn’t help at all. When I attended her office hours it seemed like she belittled me and she didn’t understand my disability (she also had a strong ass accent). So I dropped the math class and changed my major into becoming a OTA. The OTA program doesn’t require math pre-requisites. With my degree options I want to do something in health care. I love to help people. I’m currently taking A&P but I’m having low grades in that class even tho I’m still trying my best studying. I’m thinking that dyscalculia has to do something with me doing bad in A&P.  I don’t want to fail that class because it will drop my gpa score. I’m a very anxious person and sometimes I think that I’m just not meant to have a degree. I’m thinking in just becoming a RDA and drop college all together. Even tho I don’t want to drop college at all because I want to get a degree and a degree will help me in the long run it will have to be my last option. I’m terrible at math. I don’t know if I will have to use math to be a RDA but I know that OTAS don’t need math at all. I’m also panicking because in order to apply to the OTA program at my local community college I have to take something that is called a TEAS exam and have a specific score in order to be accepted into the program. I’m unsure if I will be able to complete it because there is a math section on it and that stresses me out. There is no such thing as a readiness class to prepare me for the TEAS exam. Although my very last option is to become a RDA. My main goal is to become a OTA. I got advice from my BF and he advised me to change my major into a BBA degree ( he has that degree) but I don’t know if I will be needing to take a lot of math courses for that degree and I don’t know if the job itself needs math. I will be open to it but I have not done my full research on that degree. I also don’t want to tell him about my disability. I’m willing to change my major into something that is not health care but I’ve gone this far already into completing my pre-requisites into applying to the ota program so that will be set me back a lot. I’m currently 21 and I feel like I need to complete my degree before I turn 30. Has anyone else gone through something like this? What is the best advice?

1by7jb9,Toxic Former Employee Reference ,"I let go a toxic employee a few months ago.  This employee was late to work daily, sabotaging the team's work, lying about co-workers to HR, the list goes on.  We did a round of layoffs and this employee made the list.  I legit think this employee was a con man.  

Anyways, Ive been contacted by two employers since he left.  Each of them asked for a reference for him, to which I responded vaguely the dates he worked here.  When asked if I would hire him again, I said no. 

I'm not sure if I'm being contacted via a backdoor reference or I'm actually listed as a reference.  I have documented performance issues with this person and I refuse to give them a positive reference.  This is also a litigious person.

1by6ga2,"Switched jobs, but not sure if it was the right decision.","M in the UK. I have a first class Marketing degree and 5 years of transactional finance experience (Banking/Treasury - transactional finance).

After being in my last Treasury job for 3.5 years, I finally left into my first Assistant Management Accountant job. The main reason why I left is because in the past 1 year, a horrible new colleague and manager joined my team. My colleague found every possible way to mess everything on the system up for 8 straight months, every single day. I found myself fixing everything not only for them, but also for the various finance department (as I was the only one who knew how to sort specific things). The problem is my new manager was also very unsupportive and refused to help or step in to help with the problematic colleague.

I had no pay rise for my whole stay at the company, despite always going above and beyond and being respected by a lot of people within the business. In the end, I was feeling miserable and decided to look elsewhere. I applied for 2 jobs (another Banking job and the AMA job) and to my shock, I got an offer for both of them, within the span of 10 mins. I went with the AMA job as it's the natural way for me to progress from Treasury and learn new things.

The thing is, the new job has **a lot** of Excel and some things are very difficult to me. I've been a month in and still learning, but can also do a lot of small things on my own without messing up. But the difficult Excel stuff worries me. I feel like I oversold myself on the interview and now have quite a huge upskill to do at the new job. I heavily miss my old company as I knew the people the system and what I was doing. It was also very easy compared to the new job. At the same time, it had become a very toxic environment and I was feeling miserable every day.

I am very afraid of getting fired from the AMA job if they don't like me and not sure if it was the right choice. Me and my partner are now on the mortgage ladder and I have to make sure we have financial stability. Because of that, I've made sure to save money for nearly 3 years ahead, as I am very worried what will happen if I don't pass my probation and have to look for another job. My partner says I will find something easy if it comes to that (they used the recent 2 offers example), due to my degree, experience and also the upskill in my new job, but I am always worried and overthinking things. What if I am left unemployed? Everywhere I read, people are saying the UK job market is really bad.

What do you think?

Thanks.

1by681l,Help me with a resignation situation ,"Tl;dr - I want to quit from my toxic workplace (which used to be good). Should I resign the professional way or just stop going after receiving the salary?

Context - I've been working at this marketing agency for over an year now. It used to be good, the policies were okayish, until they started targeting me for no fucking reason. Well, I stood up for myself on various occasions, that too infront of the founder. Not even like in a way that I argued with her. Just that she told me to do some changes which I did and the next day she flipped and I just presented the proof of me being right. I don't know how that's wrong. 

I was denied any appraisal and is being judged on the kind of work I was never even briefed about. 

There's obviously more to it. I feel cornered now. It's impacting me, my ability to work in the office, and even my personal life. 

I know that they're going to fire me sooner or later. So the question is *should I resign by sending the professional email saying I want to resign and stating my reasons, serving only a week's notice period (I can't stand this place anymore so serving a month's notice period isn't possible) or just stop going to office after the salary day without telling anyone?*

1by60et,Boss assigned more work with no additional pay. What would you do?,"So over the past few months the person I work with has had major attendance issues which has led to a lot of their work not getting done. Rather than my boss reprimanding the employee or firing them and hiring someone else, he reassigns a lot of their work to me. Well, I've already got a lot on my plate. At any other company, my job would be divvied into at least 3 jobs. This company is extremely cheap and will do whatever it takes to save a buck and fifty. When he talked to me about it, I told him I wouldn't mind doing it temporarily (mainly because I knew there was no other option), but that I would like to receive additional compensation since I would be spending more of my time working. I am salaried btw so any time I work over 40 hours is lost/unpaid. He told me there was nothing he could do, but that he would talk to his boss (the cfo) about it. Well a few days later he tells me that his boss said no and that there's nothing more he can do. All of this happened a few months ago. Long story short, I ended up taking on the additional work. My boss conned me into it. Said that it would be the perfect opportunitity for me to really show the value I can add yada yada. Mind you prior to all of this happening, l had already saved this company at least 60k over the past 3 months. I'm at a point where I've had enough. The workload has been crippling and I'm tired of doing someone else's job with no additional pay. I'm always anxious and stressed. I don't like the person I've become. I've gained weight and am a lot less social than I used to be. All over a job that couldn't pay me hundreds or thousands more after I've saved them tens of thousands! I plan on quitting this week without notice. My main job is essential. If it's not done timely, it can cost the company at least 300k per month. My salary isn't even a fourth of that, btw. There's no one that works there that could do my job. Definitely not my boss. He can barely do his own job. They've had major turnover issues with my role in the past. At one point the position was vacant for 5 months.

1by3ewl,Looking to leave “dream job”after 6 months?,"Hi all! I (29) am looking for advice. In October I took what I felt to be my dream job with a non-profit based several states away. It was my dream job in my field (non-profit arts work), but there were some catches, the most glaring of which is having to travel three days a month (6 hours away from me) for in-office days AT MY OWN EXPENSE despite the job being remote.

It’s been six months. I am realizing the cost of these in-office days. Both the financial cost and family cost. I can’t afford the $600-$700 a month expense associated with the in-office week so my supervisor lets me stay at her house. And I have a young daughter who has not been adjusting well to me being gone 3-4 days a month and it’s been hard on my husband and hard to find childcare for her when I’m gone.

I also am realizing my salary ($55k) is horrible for someone with a Master’s degree. I didn’t do research beforehand because I felt that it was “just a stepping stone” and it didn’t matter because I’m a few years out from grad school and it’s the most I’ve ever made. Not to mention I don’t think my salary is fair for the amount of work I do AND I pay my own travel…

I knew some of these difficult things *on paper* before I accepted so I accepted for the sake of *dreams coming true*, however, it’s only the lived experience of being there that has made me realize how it is not sustainable. 

What makes this hard is I do ADORE my supervisor. She has become like an aunt to me. I’ve had some health issues since I was hired and with that and other things she’s been so supportive and gone above and beyond and I think she would be devastated as she jokes she hopes I stay until she retires in a few years. 

I think if it weren’t for her I would’ve looked for jobs already… This job IS in my desired field and I don’t want anyone in the field to think I’m fickle for leaving after 6 months, though. 

I grew up in a family where you worked the same job for 40 years so I’m needing advice from non-relatives! Thank you!

1by26fq,"23 yo, Plumber and Tin Knocker, need some advice","Hello all, so as the title suggests I need some advice. For context I live in an area where construction is sort of booming and should be for the next 5-10 years or so, because of a lot of huge commercial projects are going on in the area. I'm currently in the second year of my formal plumbing apprenticeship with my current company, my qualms with that are that while I am enrolled in the program i have to remain with my ""sponsor"" or company for 4 years while I finish my journeyman. This doesn't really sit right with me because my pay rate has not really reflected the degree to which I work, or the amount of work I get done at the jobsite. Basically I am doing the same job or more than 90% of the journeyman plumbers and hvac guys who work for my company, which pisses me off because I know a lot of people my age or doing the same job who make 10$+ more an hour, I was just wondering if I could get some advice on whether i should bite the bullet and keep staying where I'm at until I'm a journeyman/ master in my field? Or if I should try and search around a bit and keep my options open, maybe even pick up more side work. Another factor that I want to consider is company loyalty, I know if I quit they'd replace me in an instant and probably be offering more that's just how corporate America works, but the way you leave your employer tends to follow you in construction.

1by1u4z,UX/UI or Frontend Development?,"Hello there! 
Having a hard time choosing my career path. Let me explain.

For context, I am 22(M) and I live in the western part of Ukraine, due to the peculiarities of the IT market right now, thoughts from Ukrainians are especially welcome. 

For the past six months, I have been learning front-end development. At least, trying to learn it :) One day I decided to give it a try and started, bought a course, and dived into learning.

The problem is I found it extremely frustrating for some reason, but sometimes I’m also having a fulfillment stage. Due to the full-time work I have now (I work as a data annotator) I don’t have much time for learning constantly and that is the problem. I get extremely upset, stressed, frustrated, and unmotivated after finding out that I can’t even apply all I’ve learned for 6 months into code. Then, I give myself a rest and start again, but I think I’ve just burnt out. I am forcing myself to learn it.

A few days ago I discovered UX / UI roles and found them more suitable (maybe) for me. I’ve always been more of a creative guy than a practical one. Also, I liked that UX/UI has more of a “people empathetic factor” when you need to analyze and think about the “big picture”.

The most concerning aspect of my story is the financial income and fulfillment I get from the job. Probably, UX/UI earn less than developers, and theoretically thinking the best choice for the FUTURE will be frontend, but I have so many doubts.

My girlfriend advised me to always choose the hardest when you have to choose cause it’s more rewarding in the end. 

I have been thinking and doubting about my decision since the first day of learning, maybe some of you guys had a similar situation and will be able to share some thoughts. I’d be extremely grateful for that :)",Hanikn,1,1.0,0,1712487791,2024-04-07 11:03:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1by1u4z/uxui_or_frontend_development/,4,2024

1by064j,College Student looking for job: autism and adhd,"Hello I am 21 male and a college student who doesn't own a car. This makes my schedule rather tight. I have classes all day until 4PM on T/Th. Wednesday I have therapy at 12 PM and Psychiatrist at 2 PM every other week or once a month. Then at 6 PM I have a class. Friday I am Muslim so must go to prayers at 1:30 PM. 

So with these I can only work Saturday to Monday. Maybe Friday if it is an evening shift. I have applied to many jobs. Had a few interviews but never was hired. I have struggled with employment a lot and was diagnosed with autism and ADHD in the past month or so. I think this is a major contributor to my employment difficulties.

Unfortunately my employment history is horrible. I have held 11 jobs in my three years of working. Quit them all only two with notice. Only two were longer than 6 months (10 months each). Both of these jobs made me severely depressed and chronically s__cidal. The second one caused me burnout which I haven't recovered from. At that job I would frequently cry and would go to the bathroom to cut my wrist. I have made four actual s__cide attempts since March 2023. 

A lot of my difficulties with employment have been related to the following:

* Sensory issues
* Anxiety
* Social deficits
* Bullying regarding Social Deficits
* Attention to detail
* Inability to read between lines when given instructions (and often feeling depressed/anxious because I would get called an idiot, stupid, and sometimes even r--arded at many jobs because of this)
* Executive dysfunction across my life. It was hard for me to be consistently at work due to depression/burnout. This isn't just work either. I struggle with hygiene, cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, and other basic life skills. Part of this is improving with Adderall and part I think could be helped by doing PT work and therapy. 
* Impulsivity (I've skipped a total of maybe 50 days of work with intent to end my self that day)

At my jobs I did do a good job at I was definitely a hard worker. However I question whether working is a reality for me right now. Unfortunately that is not a choice though. I must work part time to put myself through school. My parents kicked me out when I was 18 due to my religion. This helped me get Pell grant. With therapy I think I can manage 2-3 days working a week.

But the problem is that I don't think I am capable of getting a job. No one will hire me between my history, my social skills, and my schedule. I don't think I am employable. How can I alleviate my struggles and find a job. I don't expect much. I don't care minimum wage. I don't need a ton of money and part of the issue is I want to become productive and contribute again. I haven't held consistent work since July 2022. I have starved many days and have been homeless. I want to become a worker again. Even something like a store or gas station even though the customers will call me stupid/r3t@rded/strange. I want a job not only for money to improve too.

1bxxf6u,Advice,"As it stands right now, I am a single 28M currently just an associate banker at a big bank pursuing an MBA with business analytics concentration. My undergraduate background was in Sciences/Pre-Med. I actually matriculated into Medical School. However, due to personal circumstances in life, I decided for a career change during the process and withdrew. 

In terms of current career performance, I am currently looking for a possible promotion as i am a high performer for the past one year. I have a couple of interviews but nothing landed so far. My current goal is to stay within the company and move up as fast and as much as I can. However, it is difficult to do so due to a multitude of reasons not in my control (office politics). A fast career mobility is very important to me and I do not believe I can accomplish that in my current company but I will try (I am a go-getter with the right mindset - willing to improve). I do not mind retiring with my current company but I anticipate that the career mobility is not according to my timeline and it bothers me a lot. 

I am currently in an unranked
MBA program, I am completing my MBA by July 2024 and immediately start on possibly MS in Applied Economics, ETC 1.2 years. The firm is currently paying for them and I am currently trying to take advantage of the benefits so as long as i stay for two years. I explored other degrees but this is what my current passion and focus is heading me towards to.

I know school reputation and experience matters but due to financial and time constraints, i don’t have the flexibility to choose and move around. i am doing my best with the tools available that i have. Not only that, i have to generate income to survive.

My philosophy is to be very flexible in the industry I am working in, which is why I chose an MBA and possibly a MS in Applied Economics because to my understanding I can switch industries if needed because they are general degrees. I do not want to be specialized into one industry/company just in case if I am ""bottlenecked"" into a position but also specifically with the rise of ""AI"" and the current economic environment our country is in. I am trying to be proactive rather than be reactive. Additionally, to my understanding having a masters degree raises my baseline income level when being offered and opens more opportunities. 

My goal is to make close to 100k and evaluate my situation from there on, i am very frugal and do not go out (at all) and gladly stay at home. I do not need the money to indulge in luxuries but just need it to be stable. I am ambitious at least right now as i am struggling to get out of this rut but i know at the end of the day it’s just money and personal happiness/work-life balance is what’s more important to me.

Right now, I just wanted some career guidance in what I can do to leverage myself across many industries with my background and anticipated plan as I presented to you right now. Any advice or insight is great, it gives me something to look at and explore. I've been researching this for a couple of months now but I have hit a wall and just looking for some assistance.

1bxx07m,Found out I was being lied to and actively set up for failure at work. What now?,"27M. I have a Master’s degree in a combined business/tech discipline. My boss only has an associate’s from a community college for business. This is my first job out of uni, I started January of last year.

To paint the entire picture would take too long, but to boil it down as much as possible, I found out my boss actively set me up for failure. It may have been complete and utter incompetence but he did it. I found out he got a meeting invitation for one week out regarding something he lied to other teams about. It’s a technical concept far beyond his understanding that he pretends he’s an expert at. He didn’t tell anyone there’s a meeting, but instead he informally handed me an impossible task to build out said thing he lied about and gave me basically nothing to go off of and shrugged off all my concerns I raised to him. No explanation that there’s a due date either. One week later he then informally called me into the meeting where he asked me to demo it, I explain that I had concerns he never answered and then he proceeded to yell at me in front of the entire office. I find out it was a formal meeting afterwards. I got completely blindsided, betrayed, set up for failure.

He’s been getting worse and worse as time goes along, but this is the first time he actively set me up and made me look like a chump. The entire department and company is very corrupt and I don’t want to try to jump to a different team, department, etc. I’m not learning any new skills anymore either, just stagnating. Horribly underpaid as well. I have lingering headaches that I’ve learned are job related as well.

So needless to say I’m basically done here and all my goodwill is gone. The real question though is how do I proceed? I have about 4-5 grand saved at the moment. No debt whatsoever, but the job market is brutal right now. It’s been draining me mentally dealing with him and his antics so I don’t wanna stay too much longer. No matter what I think I wanna be gone by sometime this summer. Should I just do nothing til I get fired? Should I pretend I’m working? What would you do in my shoes?",GammaDoomO,2,0.75,5,1712469159,2024-04-07 05:52:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxx07m/found_out_i_was_being_lied_to_and_actively_set_up/,4,2024
1bxwukn,Customers keep calling my department because they can't get through to the department they want. How to handle it?,"Inspired by a discussion I just saw on Reddit - the department they want has long hold times because there's one person to answer phones and this person is often dealing with a line of people out the door. I hold no resentment to this person (people), this is no shade on them, they are doing everything they can. 

I have no control over the amount of staff the other department handles and they're actually pretty pissed because neither do they. 

I often get people calling my department complaining about long hold times and trying to get me to solve their problem. I used to just get their number and run it up to the other department but I'm sick of doing it and I'm pretty sure that they're sick of me doing it too. I tell customers that I can't answer their questions because I'm (insert my department) and they get mad because ""I know!"" but still get pissed I can't fix their problem. Of course I can't fix their problem, they've called the wrong department. 

(No, me complaining about this to management will not magically make the company hire more staff.) They actually cut back even more recently and people are PISSED.) 

For the record, while I'm annoyed that they expect other departments to magically know how to help them, I know it's completely reasonable for the callers to be pissed about long hold times. Please understand my annoyance isn't because they're annoyed. I would be too, I'm furious a lot of companies have seriously cut down on customer service. 

How should I handle this going forward? Would I be out of line to suggest that customers unhappy with call wait times should file a complaint? Management is much more likely to listen to pissed customers than me, but I don't want a target on my back.",Halospite,6,0.800000011920929,18,1712468582,2024-04-07 05:43:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxwukn/customers_keep_calling_my_department_because_they/,4,2024
1bxwoo6,Swimming in Circles,"Last June, I graduated from one of the two big UCs with my major in business economics, and don't have any meaningful work experience. My time in college wasn't only studying; I joined student government and was an officer for a well-known club. Both positions lasted 1 year and were not overlapping. Also, I just passed the CFA level 1 exam.  
  
For the summers between school, I applied online with no references to internships but didn't get any responses back. To substitute, I worked a summer job I had since high school. Since graduating, I got a job at a small clothing store to not rely on my summer job. My primary mistake was that I didn't find work using a network, all of my online applications only used my name and my GPA (3.5) from my resume to try to get me in. Also, I didn't place as much weight on work experience because I thought some classes would at least indicate my competence and trust for a position.  
  
I feel weird asking for work because I would assume if someone wanted to extend an offer, they would do it voluntarily and not after my request for someone to help me find work. (I have heard asking for a job is normal but putting someone on the spot when all I do is receive and all they do is give seems like a bad combination.) Each day I fall behind the curve and feel like at some point I won't be worth hiring because newer, fresher students will provide greater value and investment.  
  
This past year, I have been trying to correct my mistake by meeting with family friends, and references from those friends, and am now trying to search for other CFAs who are connected with friends and references on Linkedin. (Please tell me if searching for people who I might want to talk to using Linkedin is weird, I don't know how to make things easier than asking someone if I can meet with a specific person.)  
  
I am hoping someone can tell me what they did or would do if they over-relied on credentials for work instead of using a network. Also, I am hoping to at least find an internship even if it is after my graduation. I would like to know if you think this is a good or bad idea.  
  
Please save me the ""you will be able to pick your career if you have a CFA."" I have heard plenty of it and it never helps. It's not productive and I am not in a position to pick my career.",sshweatty,0,0.5,0,1712468012,2024-04-07 05:33:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxwoo6/swimming_in_circles/,4,2024
1bxwbgw,SW Path / Career guidance and advice,"Alright reddit, so here I go..ever since I was 16 (I am 21 now, almost done with my junior yr of undergrad) I knew I wanted to be a therapist, preferably with a LCSW liscense. As someone who has always dealt with anxiety I have always understood deep concept thinking, the bigger picture, analyzing and psychology. Which I knew to be a strength of mine. I have always been the go to person to help my friends and family through things, and help them articulate their feelings and needs. And I have always felt good about it, I felt good helping others, It was nice finding out this is my purpose. And having my own therapist who is an LCSW, also inspired me and all that combined convinced me that being a therapist is my calling and is what I am meant to do. I knew I wanted to help people with their mental health issues, (specifically anxiety, ocd, depression, everyday challenges and struggles emotionally) specifically adolescents, but I fear now maybe I was looking at all this with a rose colored lens (Which I tend to do in a lot of contexts) It was not until this year I have been met with fear that maybe becoming a therapist may be too hard for me, which is scary to think about considering it's been my goal and I am getting closer and closer. But I have always been an anxious person, looking back to when I was younger seeing traumatic or morbid things in the news would always stick with me, and I would end up having intrusive thoughts about it for days or weeks. Why did I think I could do this for a living.. I ask myself suddenly, it's heartbreaking to me, because I know I could be so helpful but I am so terrified for myself and burn out and facing vicarious trauma and I can be a sensitive person. And I am coming to slowly realize regardless no one is immune to trauma, everyone has it. I know I could talk to someone who has had minimal or a maximum amount. I specifically fear severe disorders like schizophrenia, or type of psychotic disorders, which I know I won't always be able to avoid.I fear I may get depressed or it would affect my own. I know it's still too early to know but I started second guessing a few months ago when I went to a mindfulness and community building workshop for a class and I saw someone have a PTSD traumatic breakdown, during the group circle and I have been doubtful ever since. That was hard to watch, there was also many people who shared traumatic stories, which I guess hearing about it never affected me too much but then to see the terror in someone mannerisms and face was anxiety provoking, and hard to watch, I began to feel a little detached. I only have a year left, than I plan on going to grad school and getting my MSW in a year only! Due to advanced standing options. Which is nice. I am just so close yet so conflicted. And I know if I need to make a change it has to be soon or I need to start planning. I do ABA therapy, and have curiosity about maybe doing SLP with children, as I can make a difference. But it feels like a restart since i'd have to spend more money and time which is so discouraging. As far as other possible careers options..I am not quite sure. The only reason I got into social work was to be an eventual therapist, have more range of opportunities for practicing therapy. I know I don't want to work in a school and do school counseling or anything. I think I am a very empathetic and creative person who would love to bring clinical or social / mental awareness to normal organizations or businesses to be a more human and clinical conscience for an organization. Im just not sure what that would look like, what jobs for that would even be called. Regardless I want to make a decent living and don't want to settle. I also have a passion for social policy and advocacy, but never had enough passion to do it career wise. Sorry this is so long. Would love some guidance, insight, experience.

I enjoy most aspects of managing, but I feel I’ve hit a ceiling and that I’m stuck. I want to move forward and go back to school to get a job that will support me and my future family. But I don’t know if I should get a masters in an art related field or go back to school for something like finance or accounting because it seems like that’s where the money is. Also, health care is not for me, before anyone suggests it. 

Avenues I’m thinking about are project management, finance, historic preservation, accounting. I just want to be able to get a graduate degree that will open a few more doors for me. Because I’m having no luck applying for other jobs since everything else requires experience/a degree that I don’t have. I apologize if this is a little longer than anticipated and I appreciate whoever took the time to read through. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as far as moving forward in art history? Or changing careers after getting an undergrad in art history?",shlumpy_shloop,2,1.0,5,1712453701,2024-04-07 01:35:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxs7np/art_history_undergrad_grad_school_suggestions_for/,4,2024
1bxrjed,Career Change at 33,"I’m a 33(F) with simple aspirations. I want to make money, as much as possible. In an ideal world, I’d be making six figures and my husband would be a stay at home dad to our (as yet unborn) children. 

A little background: I lived in general isolation until I was almost 24 and ran away from the cult I grew up in, with zero traditional job experience and a homeschooled education. I could not pursue college and knew practically nothing about the world. (Think Amish.) 

I went into retail and was with one company for five years, making less than 30k per year and working my butt off. Not really interested in the college route at the time, I became a truck driver. My husband and I both drive. The money is adequate but he wants to be done with this career and it isn’t one I’d do without him. 

I went the life experience route instead of the educational one and now I’m wondering if I wasted my time. My passions include writing, proofreading, typing, art, etc. - all things that are great if one wishes to be poor. I was forced to study almost nonstop growing up and subjects I wasn’t particularly interested in. As a result, I was burnt out and wary of school. That was nine years ago and I’m starting to reconsider. 

I am adamantly against debt. I HATE it. I don’t really want student loans but realize they may be unavoidable. Importantly, mathematics is my weakest subject. I barely passed high school math - I know because I decided to get my GED at 27.  Math and science were VERY weak, but all other subjects I did quite well with.  

I have extreme social anxiety. Being around people-even minimally-takes a huge toll. I most enjoy repetitive tasks. 

Am I being hopelessly ridiculous? Is it too late to start again? I really don’t want to be in school for the next several years of my life without a guarantee of a decent salary. I’m at my wit’s end.

1bxrfqs,Data Analyst to Data Scientist at the same company,"Hello! 
For some context I have a masters in Data Science and straight out of graduation went for a job 1.5 yrs back. 
So I have been working at this company as a data analyst for the past 1.5 yrs and 6 months into the job I started the initiative with my boss to show the executive team the capabilities of ML/AI. With some changes in our executive team and more focus on ML/AI, the past 7-8 months have kept me quite busy with data science initiatives. I had been promised I will be an official data scientist soon but that never happened. Our company recently hired a lead data scientist who has been working on some POCs with temporary resources and has met me and acknowledged my initiatives and efforts even though i am not directly developing any models for him right now. My boss said that i will be more involved in data science efforts (leading these efforts in our segment) going forward. I ended up asking my boss if I will be redesignated since my responsibilities are officially expanding beyond my data analyst responsibilities. I was just wondering what do i officially talk to him about in our meeting where we want to discuss this redesignation. Please let me know if anyone has any suggestions. I have really been looking forward to getting full time into data science and can see it happening soon hopefully! My boss has asked me to discuss in the meeting what is the thought process behind asking for this redesignation and why am i asking for it since roles can’t just be given out like that. I would also like to ask for a salary match to market rate. 

TLDR; Need tips on what i should discuss with my boss to ask for a redesignation from data analyst to data scientist and market rate match based on expanded responsibilities.

1bxpvdj,Urgent - Need career advice (unemployment dried up).,"Context: I’m a 39 year old graphic designer who has worked in high-level advertising agencies. I have over 15 years experience in graphic arts and 10 in an agency-setting. I’m a hard worker and have been the corporate “rockstar” who always goes above and beyond, even if it means sacrificing your personal time, way too many times to count. 

I lost my job last year due to performance issues which was due to poor mental health (TLDR; meds made sick almost daily, recently divorced, only real friend I had moved overseas, car wrecked after a girl in flip flops ran a red light and smashed into me). I couldn’t focus on my work and kept missing small changes on jobs and was eventually let go. They told me it wasn’t malicious and they hoped I’d find something that “fits me better”. Ugh. 

I used my unemployment time to do everything right (at least I thought so). I worked on my portfolio and resume. I wrote it plain text so that AI can find the keywords it’s looking for on job sites like Indeed or LinkedIn. I made looking for a job my full time job. I applied to jobs on all the big job boards every day for almost 3 months. In that time the only thing close to an interview turned out to be a scam that almost got ahold of my bank info via forged ADP retirement forms if I hadn’t put 2+2 together sooner. Thank goodness I did at all. 

I had budgeted my unemployment plan until the end of April before realizing I miscalculated way too late and everything ended April 1. (Happy April Fools lol). I was told by my family not to get a part time job until my UI was closer to running out and focus on finding a career in my field. So I waited…. And kept applying… And then before I knew it 6 months passed. 

Over the last month expanded my search and even thought of relocating if necessary, but I love my home and don’t want to leave. I was even willing to take jobs at less than half my old salary (I was always willing to take a pay cut if need be, but within reason). I picked up some freelance web design work to float me this month but then that’s it. 

In the past three weeks I even applied to Starbucks, Target, etc. and STILL NOT ONE CALL. 

That’s a partial lie, but it ties into my next point. I was thinking of getting into sales. I was warned by my banker uncle that it’s too demanding and little sharks won’t make it next to seasoned sales people. I recently received my very first callback in 6 months. It’s at a Mazda dealership. I’m familiar with the brand and mostly JDM cars as I’m a bit of a gear head. Plus I dished at length about Mazdas with the recruiting person who must also work at that dealership. It must have impressed because I’m scheduled for a call back interview. Could this be my way out?

I’m desperate at this point. If this job doesn’t work out I might opt for plan B: Sell my overvalued house and build my dream house in bumble-eff nowhere. 

—

TLDR;

I effed up, my unemployment is gone, I need a job ASAP, and it seems like graphic design is way to competitive at this time. Is sales worth it if I work hard or am I getting in over my head and swallow my pride and take a fast food gig. 

Additionally: What are some good paying, no-experience jobs that are always hiring??

1bxpr37,20% Pay differences between coworkers with same job and duties - advice ,"Early last year my department created two new job positions . One of which my coworker was automatically given ( note was in the same position as I was) and the other one was posted internally and externally and I ended up getting the position after extensive interviews. Upon negotiations of salary I was told that the offer given was the highest they would go. I accepted the position as it was a 10% pay bump from the role prior. Both of us were doing the same like job. 

Two months later my boss resigned and I became the interim director over the coworker mentioned above and the entire team. When I asked why the other individual did not get it I was told because I was the most qualified for the position.

Fast forward nine months. The permenant role for the Director position opened up and I ended up being selected. I tried to negotiate my salary and was told again that due to the increase they would not offer me anymore money due to the amount difference from my previous base salary, but could get a bonus based on company performance, but it is not guarenteed. The day before my transition my boss calls me to tell me my coworker mentioned above will still be making more money than me at my base salary. 

Come to find out when we both received a promotion last year, they were paying him 20% higher than me and he is still making more for his base pay.

1bxoc8n,Received a better job offer one week into my new job,"For some background, lost my job in software in November and was unemployed for 4.5 months before landing an IT job which I just started on the 1st. Then on Thursday I received another job offer for a county job in IT, which I had interviewed for a few days after my current job.

Under other circumstances, I would’ve just declined the offer since I already started my new job and have been really enjoying it so far. However, this new offer is for significantly more money than my current one (nearly $20k/year more), and obviously my currently financial situation is pretty rough after being unemployed for so long. 

I guess I’m looking for advice for how to go about telling my new boss about this. I feel extremely guilty leaving so soon. The new position wouldn’t start for probably 2 weeks, so I’d certainly offer to stay those 2 weeks so they have time to find someone new. I’m just not exactly sure how to go about this, and I certainly don’t want to burn any bridges anywhere. I’m also worried that my current job may not want me to stay for the next two weeks if I tell them right away, so I’m not sure when the best time would be to tell them.

The people at the facility REALLLLY want me to move there. They flew me out to the city for a long weekend and did an onsite interview with me to get to know me first. I already felt unsure just about moving. We had a couple of days in the city before the interview and really fell in love with it in a really short time. 

Then….

The interview happened. 

It went really well at first then the manager of the facility took me to lunch where they criticized (good & bad) answers to all the questions they asked me. They also went on to talk absolute trash about the person I would be replacing. Told me without saying it I would have to fire one of my employees in the coming months because they wanted to downsize the group. Also told me about the legit drama that was going on with the group itself. 

The whole thing was so unconventional and in my opinion unprofessional. I’ve had a million interviews but none like this and made me super uncomfortable to the point I feel like I am going to decline the offer they give me. Am I overreacting at all?? Looking for some advice and even seeking some affirmation in how I’m feeling right now.

1bxnagi,Career Advice,"Hi! Going to post this as I am feeling stuck and need some advice. I am a 24yr old female and currently working as a nurse. Lets, just say nursing wasnt my first option as a career but somehow it was the only one I could choose when I was around 18-19. I wanted to become a doctor for the longest time, yet now that I work in a hospital and have a realistic image of the hours and stress that they go through, Im not so sure anymore. I have recently transferred from bed side nursing to the operating theaters because the latter is really not for me. I worked in a vascular ward and it was really really stressful to the point where Im exhausted and everyday I would cry because Im heading to work. 

Now that Ive been in theaters for about a month now, I still dont feel like Im 'at home'. I feel pretty useless here in the sense that doctors usually give off the feeling that they can manage everything by themselves, whether I am there or not. 

I have been looking for different career options for the past 2 yrs (since graduating from nursing school) and Im still in this limbo. I have taken into consideration becoming a translator since I like to learn languages, however, my parents brought up the issue of money and that they dont usually make much. I have also considered aviation- more speciafically becoming an airline pilot, but I have no one to turn to for questions and I dont want to go blindly into a career now that I am growing older. 

I also like to draw (if that helps) and considered going into animation or maybe graphic design, but again the topic of money always comes up. 

I do not wish to seem ungrateful for this career, I just dont think it matches my personality well and also I do not feel like I am achieving much, Unfortuantely, here where I like career progression is very limited for nurses - we cannot specialise, we wither go inti management or just remain staff nurses- so Im really stuck and I wish to move on

1bxnac5,Strength and conditioning coach looking to switch careers.,"I’ve worked as strength coach over the last eight years. I enjoy coaching quite a bit. I’m married in the last two years, and have a seven month old daughter. About 20k in school debt between my wife and myself.

My experience includes working as an assistant HS SCC coach, selling training as a training director at a large commercial facility, heading a national team as a SCC coach, heading a division 3 professional sports club as director of performance, and running my own LLC training kids up to professional athletes.

I’m looking to transitioning out of coaching(might be a bit burnt because my current employer is a terrible environment that lacks leadership and structure). With an undergraduate education it doesn’t pay the bills. There’s a notable pay increase for someone with a PhD, but I’m an average student at best and don’t think I’d want to invest the time. I’ve considered a masters but the pay increase isn’t significant and my undergrad has opened up some incredible opportunities that I see more advantageous than studying more exercise.

I’ve thought about medical sales or going back to school to become a physical therapist. My wife thinks I should open a facility because I’ve made a solid reputation for myself where we live. Physical therapy is 150k of debt with a 20-40k bump in salary for outpatient. I’d be interested in a higher level of athletics as director of performance medicine.

1bxmovl,What to do with my Sonic?,"Hi All, new to this kinda thing so I’ll try and keep it short and simple. 

I have a 2014 Chevy Sonic LT. It’s my first car and has severed me over these past 8 years very well. I bought the car (with help from my dad) for $7,500 with ~55,000 miles on it. Fully paid off since the moment I took it off the lot. Over the years I’ve had 3 accidents (all fender benders) and general maintenance repairs that’s I’ve paid for out of pocket. The car is now at ~160,000 miles and has damage to the front passenger headlight chamber/bumper (headlights still work great), a crack in the back bumper, and a dent in the rear driver side door. She doesn’t look pretty, but she still runs fantastic. Never had an issue with performance and the damages are purely cosmetic. I’m at a point now where I’m torn between spending +$3,000 to fix all the repairs, or buy a new car. I’m not gonna lie, I love my baby, but I think it’s time to get a new car. Where I’m having a problem is, how can I get the most return out of my car? Do I sell it for parts/junk to someone? Or do I try to trade it in to go towards the payment of a car at a lot? I don’t want to deal with FB marketplace because people are sketchy… but sometimes car dealerships are sketchy… I don’t foresee myself going to a big car lot, more like a small business car salesman. What’s the best course of action? In my mind I feel like it’s probably worth about 1K-2K, but I’m scared I’m gonna be so disappointed with the amount.

Keep in mind I’m in my mid 20s and don’t have a lot of disposable income. I have about 5K that I can put towards a car. I know that’s not a lot, but I want to make sure I make the right decision. I know I’ll probably have to get a loan and deal with car payments and increased insurance, so that’s why I want to make sure I make the right choice. Any tips, advice, or leads would be great.

1bxkblf,Need an advice on a situation,"Hi everyone. I work in a small company, and I'm the only female staff member there. I always mind my own business and stay fully focused on my work. I only speak when spoken to because I don't like engaging in side conversations. In my office, there's a guy who literally does nothing and often throws half of his tasks at me. I also dislike his attitude; he acts nonchalantly, makes fun of me when I tell him to focus on work, and calls me sentimental when I choose not to respond to his daily inquiries about why I seem sad and quiet. He's really frustrating me, and I don't even want to talk to him. Moreover, I find his behavior around me unprofessional. Just today, he was scratching his belly in front of me, pulling up his shirt and continuing to scratch. The exposed skin made me uncomfortable, so I left the office to find another place to sit.

Today, another coworker bothered me the most. He has only been here for a month, and he always talks a lot with everyone. I've been tolerating him because I don't want to be rude, so most of my replies to him are generic, like ""that's good to hear"" or ""that's great."" I never engage in personal matters. So you can imagine how shocked I was when he approached me today to discuss something personal. However, he didn't confess his feelings or ask me out—he straight up proposed marriage to me. My mind went blank because I don't even know his last name or where he is from. I'm still in shock about the whole thing. I'm here solely for work, and I never indicated any interest in personal relationships. I have never shared anything personal or exchanged contact information with any of my coworkers. Additionally, I am much younger than them; I recently graduated, and this is my first job, while all the men are in their forties. Unfortunately, we don't have an HR department. The manager is the only person I feel comfortable talking to without feeling uneasy.

I genuinely enjoy the job, and the pay is good, but the work environment is suffocating due to these incidents.

I want to approach the manager about these matters. There's a camera in the office, so the manager will eventually see the proposal incident, and I don't want anyone to think that I'm here to date or marry my coworkers. I also need to address the issue with my lazy coworker who annoys me.

Could you please advise me on the most professional way to deal with this situation when approaching the manager? I don't want to appear as if I'm creating problems for the company. I fear that if I report these incidents, the manager might overreact and fire the individuals involved, and I don't want to be held responsible for that.",tesadorah,1,1.0,0,1712432680,2024-04-06 19:44:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxkblf/need_an_advice_on_a_situation/,4,2024

The issue I’m having is that I have a prior vacation coming up from May 15-30 (was approved at my prior job before layoff). 

In the (hypothetical) case I do get hired, do I bring up the vacation during the last interview or once I sign the papers? How should I go about it? I’m going to try negotiating my start date to be June 3.

1bxiwa8,What can help me settle on a career path after a near-decade long rut?,"I am turning 27 this month. I graduated university later than most students, just before turning 25. I have a BA in Political Science. Due to mental health and financial issues, it took me 6 years to graduate. I struggled academically and meandered professionally. After 500+ applications over the past two years, I have not managed to land any higher paying jobs since graduating. Throughout this time I think I lost touch with who I am, what I want and how to get there. I have, however, made tremendous strides in improving my relationships and discovering hobbies. 

If I could snap my fingers to guarantee myself any successful career path, I would choose to be a writer and voice actor in some artistic medium. It could be animation, video games, cinema, etc.
I am an incredibly gifted orator and (so I have been told) a good poet/author. 

Sadly, my aforementioned interests do not guarantee an income and have a high barrier to entry. I am seeking advice on how to find an occupation that can help make ends meet while I pursue my 'dreams'. I have been stuck hopping between service and manufacturing jobs, and for myriad reasons I can't keep up with that indefinitely. I foresee it leading to chronic underemployment in areas where I am overqualified. Does anyone have suggestions on an occupation, perhaps something I can get certified/licensed for within a year-ish, that would allow me to have a bit more autonomy in my professional life?

I am greatly interested in visual arts, music, beauty/cosmetics, animals, yoga, and much more. I really like working with my hands and having 'projects' to accomplish. Any advice or encouragement would be deeply appreciated. I can tell I am not living up to my potential, and I have fallen behind all of my friends and family professionally. It is made all the more painful due to the fact I was told by everyone who knew me that I was 'going to do great things' (I come from a small rural town in the midwest).

1bxiv7t,Navigating the world of IT,"Hello everyone I hope everyone’s doing well.

For the last two years I’ve had two jobs that are IT related. Basic desktop support for the first and for the second, I would say I’ve done more tier 1 to tier two support for a MSP. Managing all clients phone systems, basic Microsoft and Google Admin Management, Configuration and installation of network equipment( at a basic level) and have even been in charge of administering security awareness training. Unfortunately now I feel like my job has kind of run its course a lot more responsibility for not a lot of pay and I’m wanting to move onto the next thing whatever that is. 

I primarily got into IT from being interested in cyber security which I still don’t really have any experience with although I do have a Security+ certification. It interests me, but I also like the idea of being on the business side of things more than the technical aspect. From conversations with friends they’ve recommended getting more base certs some maybe cloud related and AI. I’m not expecting overnight change and I’m fine with putting in the work for the ones that will help me the most and interest me. It’s always just a little overwhelming navigating all the possibilities that IT has to offer. If anyone has any suggestions that would be very helpful. I wish everyone the best of luck.

1bxg7ex,Advice on Navigating Interest in a Senior Role Shortly After Accepting an Intermediate Position,"Hi everyone,

  
I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. I've recently accepted an intermediate SWE role in a machine learning team at a mid-sized tech company, with a start date just around the corner. However, I've stumbled upon a job listing for a Senior MLE position within the same company that seems to be a better match for my past experience.

  
A bit about my background: I have 2-4 YOE of experience as a MLE. I was also on the verge of a promotion at my previous job. During my negotiation for the current role, it was acknowledged that there would be a transition to a Senior SWE position within 6-9 months, and my compensation was adjusted accordingly.

  
Given the closer alignment of the Senior MLE role with my expertise, I'm considering reaching out to HR to express my interest. However, I'm conscious of the timing and my recent commitment to the new role.

  
I'm looking for advice on how best to handle this situation. Should I express my interest in the Senior MLE role now or focus on my upcoming role and look for future opportunities? If I do reach out, how can I do so in a manner that is both respectful and professional?

  
I'd really appreciate any insights or experiences you might have to share. Thanks in advance for your help!",YOLOBOT666,1,1.0,0,1712422277,2024-04-06 16:51:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxg7ex/advice_on_navigating_interest_in_a_senior_role/,4,2024

1bxf37k,Worth finishing psychology degree? (Canada),"I dropped out of college about 6 years ago in my final year after falling on academic warning due to mental health issues and undiagnosed ADHD which are resolved now. I currently work as a truck driver and make a decent living, however, the hours are becoming too much for me and I find the job extremely boring and isolating. I'm looking to go back to university to finish up my final year. I met with an academic advisor and found out that my programs requirements have changed since I was last in school which does not allow me to finish the schooling online (added new courses to the program that are required to graduate and unfortunately these new courses are the only courses I need to graduate). I'm stuck with the decision of moving back to the town where my school is and quitting my job to finish the degree, or to continue working in an industry I am not particularly fond of. Commuting is not an option as I live quite far away from my school at my current location. I am also unable to take these courses at a different institution as they are courses specific to my schools program. My options on completing it are quite slim which makes me question whether it is worth it or not as it would cost around 15k to finish.

  
I don't have a solid plan on what I want to do following the degree. It constantly bothers me not finishing it and I really want the piece of mind of completing it. I have about 50k in saving at the moment and live in Canada, which offers an interest free student loan that I could take advantage of.  


I guess my general question is do you think finishing the degree is worth it given my situation? If I finish it I will mostly likely have to go back to truck driving for a bit, but at least it will open the door to future online programs and increase my options for when I do have a better idea of what I want to do. It will also give me the piece of mind of completing it. I'm just not sure if its really worth investing more money into.

  
Any advice would be great thanks.

1bxe3nr,Thinking of quitting for a potentially better opportunity,"I've been working a the same company for around 7 years now. we are a construction company. I really enjoyed my time here until I moved projects and started working under new managers. A lot of times, moving projects in construction can almost feel like changing jobs altogether. I was promoted about 2 years ago to replace an employee who was leaving. 2 years on, I feel like I was handed a mess and our managers have not supported, mentored, or really advocated for me. They have expectations for people but don't express them. I just feel lost and really ineffective at my job. The nail in the coffin was finding out my raise a couple weeks ago. It tracks with the national average but to me, compared to my raises historically, it doesn't feel like a message of ""you are valued."" I also found out what it was by seeing my next paycheck before my manager even bothered to verbally tell me. I'm also very concerned I will be asked to move as we have no major work in the area I live in. This company very much values people who are willing to do anything for the company, including moving. 

At the same time of all this, I have a former colleague who is wanting to hire me SO bad. I worked with this person on another project and they are so kind and always mentored me, so I already know what I'm getting. I met with them last week to hear them out and it just felt like a breath of fresh air. The role I'd be in aligns perfectly with my current skill set, and he has a whole five year plan to mentor me into higher roles.  
The only thing I'm nervous about is the pay. I know they could pay me at least $20-$25k more, but the benefits package is not nearly as good. I would say it's pretty average for most similar companies though. So I told him I need to understand the full compensation package before I can really negotiate a number. But at the same time, I'm so miserable where I'm at, that maybe it would be worth it to take a small hit in my overall compensation just to be happy again. The other positive is they are very local, so the chance of me ever moving is pretty non existent, and they don't expect their people to want to move all over. 
I guess without having all the info yet, I still kind of feel like happiness wise, quality of life wise, this could be so much better for me. Has anyone here ever taken a job that was slightly less in compensation just to be happier and was it worth it?",Responsible_Lynx_139,2,1.0,0,1712416865,2024-04-06 15:21:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxe3nr/thinking_of_quitting_for_a_potentially_better/,4,2024

1bxd11t,A life changing decision,"Thank you in advance for reading (the long post) and responses everyone. 

I am a 33-year-old male (British by naturalisation and Pakistani by birth). I studied Mechanical Engineering (Masters) and then Management (a second Masters) from a prestigious UK University. I then worked in Engineering and Management Consulting in top companies and saw the corporate city life. I didn't find any passion in any of the office jobs and think i also didn't really fit into the office culture either (always felt i was so different to everyone else there, grew up in a village in Pakistan). Joining a military force and being a professional soldier always haunted me since I was a child and I was really passionate about it, many factors (mostly parents) pushed me in to the white collar job life and I think i couldn't fit in even after trying a lot. I had realised this some time ago and tried joining the UK military but they wouldn't let me because of immigration etc. 

I am not at a stage of my life where i really want to settle into a profession, not do 'jobs' to pay the bills but a 'career' to dedicate my life to and become good at. The only military force that will take me now is the French Foreign Legion. The other option I have is joining the London Metropolitan Police. 

The Legion:  
Its an extreme place, and controversial with a hell of a reputation - very dangerous too. It will cut me off from society but the flip side of that is that, it will be a seriously fresh start (sometimes a good thing). I'll live in France and Africa and in a completely different group. Travel a lot and learn absolutely insane number of skills (soldiering). I could be deployed (which I will embrace if I am) and that could give me a v good perspective and experience too. I wont be allowed to get married and I wont be able to quit the Legion before 5 years of service. I wont be networking a lot or learning about the 'outside' world

I will probably make v good friends and spend the 5 years VERY busy. 

The Met:  
I will start from Zero with ppl much younger than me. 2 years doing menial work and jobs and then i can go in to a specialist role (armed response, close protection etc.) when I am older i can look into the detective roles and go that way. Will be able to get married have a family and also make connections etc. Of course I wont be the man the Legion will make me or see the things i will otherwise see with the Legion. 

My long term goal is to start my own private security firm and for that both the occupations are good. but I think the police allows to make connections and still learn about the world more than the legion. 

I would really love to hear people's thoughts on any angles i am not looking at.

My last boss was terrible (passive aggressive, hostile, raised voice often, etc) and I submitted an official complaint about his behavior when I moved to another department. They documented it, but ultimately nothing happened. They did confirm others have complained as well. 

My current boss sucks, but isn’t terrible. He’s taking advantage of being remote to where he’s only working 2-3 hour bursts a few days a week. He’ll accept/join meetings and stay muted, even when I’m jumping through hoops to match his availability. I can’t remember the last time he actually screen shared and presented work. It has always been me doing it for him. 

I haven’t said anything but heard that management has noticed his lack of availability and response time. They’re afraid to do or say anything or he’ll claim discrimination (he did this briefly when they considered a hybrid schedule). 

What’s actually pissing me off is that now I’m getting responses days later or right before a deadline. I can’t work on about 60% of my tasks without data from him and he’s the only one with access. I don’t need his input or guidance. I just need him to export data and send it over. I'm constantly working through lunch and/or after hours to get shit out because it comes in last minute. 

I had to include his boss recently on an email because it was time sensitive (his boss needs to know when it gets this serious) and he responded within 10 minutes. I had sent multiple emails about this over the past 2 weeks to just him. He just ignored them…

That was my breaking point and I want to leave. I’m realizing my issues weren’t limited to crappy supervisors, but the entire management team.

My dilemma is that my husband and I are trying to start a family. I will likely need IVF, which is partially covered with my benefits. I’ve seen coworkers go on maternity leave (6) and the company jumps through hoops to support them, plus they offer flexibility when returning to work. 

My husband wants me to leave. He obviously doesn’t like how I’m treated and now that he’s WFH too, he’s realizing how bad it really is. He wants to wait on a baby for another 1-2 years. 

I think it’s stupid to walk away knowing all the benefits. With what I do, I’ll be able to find a job easily, but there’s no guarantee I’ll find another fully remote position that pays me above market value with so much flexibility. 

I need unbiased opinions. I didn’t grow up financially stable and think it’s crazy to walk away. I’m seeing a psychiatrist and therapist, but I’m stressed and overwhelmed daily. I know this will catch up to me, so my plan is to leave as soon as I’m back from maternity leave. If I’m unable to get pregnant, then I’ll be out the door immediately.

1bxco49,2 things I did to instantly raise my interview rate,"It's not uncommon to see job posts with thousands of applicants these days, the job market has become very competitive to say the least. Here are two hacks that gave me a huge advantage when I was job hunting last year and that I think everyone should be implementing.  
**1-Customize your resume for each job application, add important keywords and skills from the job description**  
This can feel tedious at times but totally worth it. Most recruiters use software that automatically rejects your application when your resume doesn’t contain certain keywords or skills from the job description. If the job description has a skill or program that you kind of know you should still include it in your resume. If you end up getting an interview just review that skill online (read about it, watch YouTube videos) a few days before the interview in case you get asked about it. It’s widely known that the majority of job posts exaggerate the skills/experience you actually need for the job anyways. For example in programming many job posts “require” years of experience for tools or frameworks that came out last year 😂. So before applying, look at the job description and see if there’s anything important you should add/replace in your resume. Download the new version of your resume and send that one. I was doing this manually at the beginning of my job hunt and started using [jobSyncAI](https://jobsyncai.co) once I started applying to more jobs to automate the process.  
**2- Write a short email to anyone in the company (can be the CEO if the company is small, or anyone in the team where you would be working).**  
The email should be concise, let the person know that you’re interested in the company and why, but more importantly mention how your skills will bring value to the company. You’ll be surprised by how many people reply, sometimes they’ll ask you for more information, like a portfolio and in turns into a back and forth conversation. This is how I was able to get a remote job last year.  
How to get anyone’s email  
Some people recommend sending this type of messages on LinkedIn direct messages, but this wasn't very effective in my experience. Almost no one replied/saw the messages. I think a lot of people get spammed on LinkedIn messages which is why most don’t even check them.  
But if you’re able to reach out via someone's email inbox, that's a different story. Here’s how you can get anyone’s email:  
First search for the company you’re applying for in linkedIn. In their LinkedIn page you’ll be able to see who works there. Look up their name on [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co), they’ll usually give you 2-3 email addresses. Send the email to all of those to maximize the chances of your email getting seen.  
Besides those two things try to apply to 10+ jobs per day. Don’t get discouraged by rejections or if you get ghosted. Once you start landing interviews you’ll build up momentum. Good luck with your job hunt, I know it can be a stressful time but you’ll get there if you put in the time 💪.",Volunder_22,2,0.6600000262260437,0,1712413105,2024-04-06 14:18:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bxco49/2_things_i_did_to_instantly_raise_my_interview/,4,2024
1bxcev9,Undervalued Web Developer - Stuck Between Loyalty and Fair Pay (Advice Needed!),"I (1.6 years experience) am a web developer for a well-known Indian insurance company (consultancy payroll). The starting salary (₹15,000) was extremely low, especially considering frequent overtime and my skillset (government minimum wage for skilled labor is around ₹15,000).

Despite the low pay, I thrived! I quickly became a dependable asset, exceeding expectations and even surpassing some senior colleagues. I loved the work environment, the friendly team, and the recognition from managers and leadership. I built strong relationships across departments, which is why leaving is a tough call.

However, research revealed I was significantly underpaid. To address this, I secured a job offer for ₹30,000 and aimed for a ₹40,000 counteroffer. Unfortunately, HR and my manager cited ""bucket issues"" and limited budget due to my experience (< 2 years). They offered to match the ₹30,000, but only after my next raise cycle (4-5 months).

When I expressed leaving, they played the ""loyalty"" card, implying those who left for more money regretted it (a well-known tactic in our department). I even proposed a higher salary with a bond, but they declined.

Here's where I need your help, Reddit! How can I effectively negotiate in this situation? Ideally, I'd like ₹40,000, but I'm open to suggestions.

Once in mid 2021, another in mid 2022, and another in 2023. In 2021, I applied on Zip Recruiter and got an invitation to interview. In  2022 they reached out on LinkedIn. Both times they said I was a strong candidate but never received an offer.  In late 2023, I was invited to apply on Indeed. Instead of applying I sent them an email directly to the hiring manager that I have already been interviewed by them but each time I don’t hear anything from them. Then crickets. 

Now last week a 3rd party recruiter reached out with job opportunities and one of them is the same company that I’ve had interviews with. I told him about it and that I’ve been disappointed with not hearing from them. So I’m not sure if I should even approach it.

I met someone through this job, real, credible, the real deal, who started their own company and is offering me a position with the new company and to be my mentor. It’s a more niche skill in the industry I dream of being a master in.

1bx4p2h,Advice for teenagers who don't know what to do with their life-from a teenager (career advice),"Junior high school student here. Here are some thing i learned from experience and research, volunteering, participating in programs and talking with certain career professionals. 

  
This is my rough plan during and after HS and i hope i can give some people a little insight like they did for me. The plan is to get as much exposure to different fields of interest while young. Good habits and mindset are important skills to learn, as well (be open to trying thing you won't usually do).

  
So, phase 1 (exposure) means volunteering, researching, youth programs, apprenticeship etc. Go to career fairs and talk to people who are in those fields and gauge if this lifestyle will fit you. Think of what you want your life to be like in (1, 5, 10 years). Think of your passions and how you can contribute to the community. This will give you a little experience and insight. 

  
Phase 2 (Exploring/saving money), work a temporary job w average pay job (if minor 15-16) for a couple years. Also, keep an eye out for scholarships. Once 18 apply for something with a higher salary (you might have take a course/training) and take a gap year (try to make the most out of this year and hone into a field of interest).

  
Phase 3 (training, financial stability) Look into the career you want and pick a job that will give you a step up with lower commitment. Example: field of interest is dentistry, apply for a dentist assistant. This way you get the extra experience, watching and aiding a dentist, and you see what you're getting into. Spend a few years in this position, achieving financial stability (in case you decide to upgrade to dentistry) you can do so freely.

  
Picking something lower rank saves you time and money, in my opinion, and adds a level of reassurance. Being a dentist is a longer commitment and going to uni straight on with years ahead of you with no clear path is tough. What if at the end of it, you don't act want it? 

  
The idea is actually good financial management and spending your youth (time) wisely. 

  
p.s. if you just want to be rich go into trades and get an apprenticeship :)",y4n4h_,2,1.0,0,1712384763,2024-04-06 06:26:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bx4p2h/advice_for_teenagers_who_dont_know_what_to_do/,4,2024
1bx4l6a,Pivoting to finance from a non-finance background,"As title says, I’m considering pivoting to finance, however I don’t have a finance or quantitative background. I graduated from 2 marketing degrees (bachelor’s and master’s). Quantitative experience is limited but I did do a quantitative research project for my master’s, and performed basic statistical analysis for it. 

I’ve worked in marketing/business development at commercial law firms before and have a brief understanding of the financial industry since we were involved in a lot of M&A deals and had lots of clients in the finance industry. Currently working in fundraising at a non-profit/charity organisation. My scope of work does involve communicating with the finance team and having a brief understanding of financial statements, though not to a large extent. I’m in my second month and am thinking of transitioning (been experiencing some challenges at this company which led to the push, but I’m trying to hold it off for a year if possible).

My question is, how realistic would this transition be, and where do I start from? What type of firms should I be applying to that would give me a good opportunity to leverage on, and which lines of work should I be looking into? I’ve only ever attended an interview at an asset management company, for an assistant role to the managers. However the interview did not go well as my interviewer had some doubts due to my lack of quantitative experience.

Also, for someone who is very new to finance and is interested in learning as much as possible in a short period of time, where should I start from? In terms of actual technical knowledge, I honestly barely know much. Some advice on useful tips and tricks in Excel, programs to learn (I only have very brief understanding of how Stata and SPSS works, but it appears that Python is much more highly valued), and which finance topics/trends/news I should be looking into would be greatly appreciated.

1bx2s9v,Houston to Bay Area - Salary Adjustment Needed?!?,"Some backstory:
My (40F) grandmother passed away recently leaving my self-sufficient but mentally disabled uncle (70M) alone. We’re each others only remaining family so I’ve been debating moving out there to help him get the house sold and moved to a new one (he wants to move).

He lived on his own but very close to my grandmother for maybe 3-4 years sporadically over the years. With her the entire rest of his life. 

My issue:
I’m employed but have a sporadic schedule and travel a ton. As such, I’ve started looking at jobs in the Bay Area this past week. My current gig just wouldn’t allow me to “be there” enough to help him. 

I’ve started to have some phone screenings that they’re moving me forward on. At present one is for about 20% more (145k) the other is 50% more(175k).

The 2nd one is a big ask on my part but I’m oddly uniquely qualified for it with my mix of education and experience - the HR person contacted me within 3 hours of submitting my application and it’s a large global company. 

I’m not entirely sure what a “good” adjustment up from my current base or total compensation package should be. 

I won’t have a rent expense until we get the current house sold since I’ll be staying there with him (already talked to him about that) but I know overall expenses in the Bay Area are higher. 

Should I be looking at a 20%, 30%, or what type of higher package would be the minimum to really survive or even be a bump up factoring in the expense difference once I have to get my own place out there?",Gunner_411,1,1.0,4,1712377975,2024-04-06 04:32:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bx2s9v/houston_to_bay_area_salary_adjustment_needed/,4,2024

1bx0l0z,Needing some guidance for my career choices. ,"23 years old, I’m currently working at a warehouse under a work agency. It’s been 2 months since I’ve been here and I’ve improved in a few ways including passing my forklift test (no raise unfortunately since I’m employed by my agency still). I like the guys that I’m working with but a few of them plan on moving on to a better job, going for their degree, something better for themselves and I’ve been wanting to do the same. Plus since I’m under an agency I can be out of the job for almost anything even if I didn’t do anything wrong.

My uncle who’s been helping me a lot since high school, he wants me to go back to school to get a degree but the thing is I don’t like studying, but I do like working with my hands so he recommended I take a look at technical schools like UTI. I’ve always been interested in working with cars but I’m also interested in doing electrical work or hvac. Now I’ve heard a large amount of cons about uti, and I don’t even think they offer flexible schedules so I’m still looking around online. 

What I’m thinking is stick to my job for the rest of this year, have some money in my savings account to keep myself above water (since I’m still living with my parents) before I give my two weeks notice and focus on technical school. Unless I can find an online program or something that I can do while I’m still working? Any advice is appreciated.

1bwywgt,Want to quit a “dream opportunity “ though I’ve only been here for a few months,"Recently hired at what most in my field would consider a dream opportunity. I’m incredibly bored but making more than I ever imagined I would. I’m a mid level designer who was poached with the understanding there would be a lot of opportunity for leadership and scope. 

Either I was duped or our understanding of scope and responsibility is fundamentally different. I come from a much, much flatter mid-size company where I excelled. My work still gets accolades even though I’m gone. Now the work is driven by 5 layers of “leadership” and I can’t really do much but try to act inspired, like I didn’t sacrifice deep working relationships, high credibility, and a ton of scope by jumping here. All for a $50k pay bump. Quite literally feel like I’ve stepped back into a junior role.

Manager has also noticed my body language is becoming distant and I’m dulled.

I’m going to try and stick with it for one year so my resume doesn’t look weird, then go start up even if it eats my pay

1bwyhgs,Trouble deciding between jobs ,"

Dads I need help. Right now I work for a Coop that pays me 23 dollars an hour. The job I was offered is 19 an hour. The hard choices being the pay and the pension. To the the explaining of both job 1 will be the 23 an hour and job 2 will be there other. On a side note my monthly bills not including groceries is around 2100 a month. 

Job 1. Minimum 45 hour weeks. Depending on the farming season can range to 70-90 hour weeks 6 months out of the year. This job offers a pension which I am now vested In. However lately over the past 6 years I have seen 36 people go from a location that handles 9. The workload is becoming to much for myself it seems and I go home angry all the time. Right now I'm averaging 4-5 grand a month by myself. Take home mind you. I also work outside during the year and breath in a lot of grain dust and harsh chemical. 

Job 2. 40-45 hours a week. Completely indoors as a parts specialist at a dealer. No weekends. The pay is 2400-2800 a month max. Take home mind you. However it falls in a small town dealership and I'm worried about the reliability of it. It'd been open since 2017 or so but still. 

I have a hard time deciding what is right or wrong. Job 1 gives me hardly any time to myself or my family anymore. But gives me more than enough money for my family. My pension is nice as it builds over the years. Both jobs still offer a 401k though. 

Now my wife makes 800 take home pay after her expenses. We have 3 children and relatively cheap living. I'm in such distraught that I'll make a wrong decision and destroy what I have made for us.

1bwya1e,Switching from a library job into recruiting,"I have spent 10 years working a large, urban, public library system. The last 8, I have coordinated and administered the largest children's program of the system- delivering 7,000+ books to 4,500 children monthly. This services over 60+ sites and 200+ classrooms. About 2 years ago I realized it was a dead end job. I had asked for a promotion to a grade up, which would have been a whopping $3,000 raise. (this year they opted to not do pay for performance raises, and gave everyone a flat 2.5% raise). My boss laughed it off and said they didn't see it. They said after the completion of an ongoing project we would talk. This project was in progress, and by the time we got to the 90% completion mark- after spending years of effort and tens of thousands of dollars, it was cancelled leaving me with no results to show for the work. Around this same time, I also took a position on an internal working group to improve patron/customer experience. I learned about CX, UX, and Service Design. The chairperson of this group stepped down, and I was elected chair. I became fascinated by UX, and how the concepts didn't just apply to digital products but really anything experiential. I pursued a UX certificate from Google, became active on/with ADPlist, and met with designers from all over the world. After getting deep into the certification program, I realized I did not enjoy Figma as much as I would- more like a good hobby, but not enough for 8-10 hours a day every day. But I did love the community, the projects, the work. The group I was chairing was taken over by a director who wasn't really interested in doing anything with it, kept redirecting our efforts, and they eventually put it on hiatus. Again, years of output but few outcomes.  
  
I've been doing a lot of ""what color is my parachute"" searching/work to figure out my next step. I had some interviews for a few account management positions at ad agencies, but no bites. I'm not really passionate about marketing, but I am passionate about building and developing relationships and creating value with win-win scenarios. This led me to recruiting. It's a good blend of my interest in tech, my soft skills, and my bias towards service. I also want to be in an earning environment where my work translates to pay. I've done some hiring and sat on a ton of hiring committees over the years. I'm just not sure where to start. On the one hand, some entry level positions I've looked at pay more than I make now, but many don't. I'm not in a financial position to make less (43% of my income goes to rent), but I don't feel like I can be confident to land a second tier position. I don't mind getting a certification if that helps make my resume more attractive or gets me a better start. But if it's not necessary at this point, I don't want to put off getting out of this awful job. I'm pushing 40 and fight having a breakdown every morning before I clock in to another day of being surrounded by comfortable people who talk down to me and don't value or even understand my work/effort. I'm hungry. I'm motivated. I'm looking for just a little direction/advice.

1bwvxvl,Self conscious of my experience,"Hi. I’ve been looking for a job for some months now, the constant reviewing of my experience has made me question myself and my decisions. I worked around 1.5 years on the most important jobs I’ve had, meaning that I was aiming to stay there for a while, the first one from 2017 to 2019 and the second one from 2019 to 2021. In the first one what happened was that my employer was having a lot on his plate personally which affected the company and had to pause operations. I was laid off from the second one bc of COVID, the company stayed afloat the first year of it but on 2021 I was let go along with 2 more people, then I freelanced for a little over a year and, formany reasons, I had to stop working for a couple of years. So now that I’m trying to find a job I feel self conscious of my career path and experience, bc without knowing what happened with my previous jobs it seems like I flake easily at jobs. Do you think this could be a reason for me not be getting interviews? so far I’ve had just one.

1bwuayl,Career change/No degree,"Hello. I am currently working as a biller at a large company. I absolutely hate my job. I have been put on a performance improvement plan in the past because I was going through a lot in my marriage. This year, they’re really scrutinizing all my work. Almost monthly/weekly. I know billing is not what I should be doing because of my ADHD. But I only got this job because the pay is pretty good for someone without a degree. All I have is an associate’s in general studies. 

Anyway, I started medication to improve my performance here and I really forced myself to focus on my work this week and it’s like they’re just waiting for any mistake to point it out to me. I know I make mistakes but, at this point I can’t control it. If I leave I would be taking a massive pay cut. And idk if I can afford that. I am a single mother of two kids and I receive no child support. I have a house that I’m renting out and the tenant keeps making extremely late payments. 
I am in a lot of debt thanks to my ex husband and his shenanigans.

1bwu5or,"I want to internally move positions but I dont know how to bring it up, need advice","For some context, I've had a total of 3 jobs in 2 1/2 years. 2 of them were pretty client-facing and required a lot of analytical research focusing on global economies/companies and different markets. My first job was in software, the second in finance, and my current job is in fintech. I really enjoyed working in finance but had to quit because of unrelated circumstances. I was given the opportunity to work at a big fintech firm but in a more back-end position (mainly coding, processing, tech design, etc.). I thought I'd give it a shot since I had never worked in that area and I was open to learning something different.
Well, now I'm about 9 months in, and I'm not liking it; it has become a bit boring. I realized I liked working more in finance & strategy, diving into market research and all that good stuff.
Now, that's where my dilemma comes in. I really like my team and the company (great benefits), so ideally, I want to switch internally to another team that better aligns with my interests. Thankfully, my company seems to be pretty accepting of internal transfers, where internal transfers take priority over outside applicants. My only issue here is, I'm getting a lot more responsibilities within the team. On one side, this is a good thing since my directors are happy with my progression, but it's also a bad thing if I want to switch. My team would have to find someone to take over my current role and onboard them all over again… not to mention I've only been in my position for a short period of time. So, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to bring up this topic to my manager. I don’t want to get fired, but I also don't want to get stuck in this position long-term. I'm willing to wait a bit longer to bring this up (maybe until I hit my year) to my manager, but the longer I wait, the harder it'll be for everyone.

1bwu4fe,"Coworker taking on supervisor role, but not a supervisor","So I started a new job about 3 months ago. Their processes are pretty hard to learn, but I'm getting them slowly. A big part of my job involves many steps. I was trained by this person who is not really friendly. She seemingly knows everything and everybody.

So after she dumped this giant task on me with a quickie 30 minute training, I had a lot of questions. At first, she answered them quickly. Then, she seemed to not like answering questions anymore and even started snarkily answering them. We are remote, she's a millennial and I'm a GenX. I tried and tried to find answers on my own before asking her again, for fear of more snarkiness. Then, I realized, hey, I have a backup in this role and she's super nice! So I asked her questions. That's been working out great.

One day, I had a question about a one-off item. Not a usual task. No one was in but my lead, a manager. I asked her, and she gave me the answer. Turns out it wasn't right. So now this issue is coming up by snarky coworker. I explained that I had asked the manager about it and this was the solution I was provided. Said snarky coworker came back saying - please see me for future questions about this task.

BUT, I really don't want to ask her and can't I ask whoever I want? She's not the boss of me!! And I have a perfectly willing friendly coworker who is my actual back up on this task. Honestly, I really dislike this person and have been avoiding her. I mean, I haven't asked her because she's short and kind of rude and acts like I'm a pain in her rear. She kind of makes my job really unfun.

1bwttj7,Switching industries advice,"So some background is that I use to work on cellphone towers and did electrical work pretty much the majority of my adult life (I'm 31). However I had to stop because I was traveling 5 weeks on, 5 days off and it was pretty miserable. I ended up finding a company that builds cellphone tower shelters in a warehouse facility, so my title became a warehouse supervisor.

I left that position cause I was working nights, I mean I was home everyday so it was a step in the right direction but I barely saw my family. I ended up leaving that position to go to my current position because it was advertised as better salary, and it was day shift, but it's ended up being 12 hours a day instead of 8ish  hours a day and it's Thursday through Sunday, I can live with it but my weekends are essentially gone and the days I do work I have to be in bed by 7 to be up by 3am to get to work on time then Im there until around 4pm. I ended up having a seizure out of nowhere and I'm going through tests now to see if I have Multiple Scelrosis as I'm having issues walking and issues with my hands (and other things but those are the most limiting.)

I can't really fall back on finding a local electrical company or tower company to work for with my issues and I don't have the education to really get into the office side of construction companies but I feel like going remote is my best option with the health issues I'm experiencing, or even just a day shift white collar job.

I've only worked for McDonalds in High School, then the tower company up until I became a warehouse supervisor working nights, and I've been at this current position for a little over a year and a half now. I've not really jumped between jobs unless it's necessary for my family, so I've got no idea where to look, how to sell my experience, or even draft a decent resume for a different sector.

I have been also looking at cost of living as a big factor, I am from the Chicago area, but would still need to relocate to be closer to Company A's location. At this point it more or less comes down to figuring out how big the gap might be and whether or not I'm willing to take that much of a cut, or have a better work/life balance.

I was put in through their internship program, and that's how they get their year 1 employees for the most part (the 4 other past new hires were through this internship program, too).

Context: after the second year of your contract, you are given the option to stay in your division or move to another division.

His position wasn't reopened, and he's forced to either move to another division or leave the bank.

They were asking for someone who is under 22 years old, knows English (I live in the middle east) and lives near the store (Asked to be in the same neighborhood of sth.) and I qualify for all that.

So I chatted with them in WhatsApp and the conversation was a bit off. The woman I was talking to seemed a bit “unhappy” that I was 16 (maybe because legal age here is 18, but they said they wanted someone under 22 in the story.) And she asked if I had access to a car and I answered that I live less than 10 mins away from them (which I truly am) and then she said that “they’ll contact me.” But I replied asking what the job was about, and she said that I should introduce people to the place, tell them the cats’ names, guide them through and provide food constantly so customers can treat the cats. 

This job really suits me as I’m near the cafe and I really like cats. So I wanna know if I should go there and act like I’ve never contacted them and ask about the job, noting that I have a beard and even look older than what I am.

1bwre6d,Homesick and confused PhD student in need of advice. Should I stay or should I go?,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Thanks a lot to those who will read until the end.  
  
I am a 1st-year European PhD student at a North American university. Every day I ask myself why I'm here. My main challenges: geography, finances, motivation. My options: staying in my current program, moving to a different uni, or leaving academia. I come to you for advice.  
  
1. Geography and finances

Why I am here: This is the best place I could reasonably have aspired to when applying to PhDs in my field (humanities). It's a good school and I have a great supervisor. Our interests align really well. If I graduated from this university, I would have a decent shot at getting an academic job afterwards.

Why I am not happy here: This feels like an exile to me. My partner, family, and friends are in Europe. I cannot wait to go back to them and I cannot wait to get my lifestyle back. I really dislike living here.

I could stay here for another 12 months (to finish coursework and advance to candidacy) and then move back to Europe or visit other universities during the dissertation phase (year 3 on). My funding would be cut in half (I'd be left with 13000 USD/year), so finances would be a problem, although I guess I could get a random job to support myself.

For context, I've been here for 8 months so far. I spent the first 5 severely depressed, two feeling a little better, and the last month moderately depressed. This is not a new feeling for me but the situation has clearly worsened since moving to NA.

2. The other program.

It's a PhD program in Europe, in a city I really like living in, reasonably close to my loved ones. The university is respectable but not as strong with placement, and the supervisor (whom I have already worked with in the past) does not give much feedback (in fact, his students often feel completely alone). Funding is guaranteed for 36 months: no coursework or comps, just dissertation. PhD students are encouraged to spend time at other institutions (scholarship stays the same) and work with external co-supervisors.

Why I'm not sure it would be a good idea: I have worries about supervision, quality of my dissertation, usefulness of the degree.

3. Is a PhD a good idea for me?

I am an insecure and anxious person and I struggle with class discussions, Q&As, and talking to professors. Presentations at conferences terrify me. I tend to do very well in written work. I enjoy reading papers.

I appreciate the freedom in organizing my schedule and I think (but cannot know for sure) that a 9-5 job would kill me. Still, I am not sure I would enjoy teaching a class or being a professor (because of all the anxiety and exposure that comes with it). I have never worked before and have no idea what kind of non-academic job I would enjoy given my strengths and weaknesses.

4. (TL;DR:) My options.

I can stay here and try to finish, or move to the other program and finish there faster (but with worse job prospects). Dropping out altogether would feel like a failure. I would like to get my degree. However, I am not convinced I will use it for academic jobs. I have no idea if that life would suit me given my anxiety. Here are the three thoughts I keep juggling in my head:

* If you want to do a PhD, do it well at the place that will give you good career prospects, even if it's terribly hard.
* Just move to the other program, get the degree quickly and in a situation that is more comfortable for you, and figure it out from there.
* If you move to the other program where you have worse supervision and career prospects, you won't even be motivated to finish; better to drop out altogether and spend this time retraining for a different job.

I am stuck. Based on all the information above, (1) what would you do and (2) what questions should I ask myself to figure out what to do?

1bwr7p7,"Interested in finance, but my two degrees are useless...","Hi, I (36M) appreciate any advice as I am lost at the moment, but I feel like I should preface the current situation I am in:  

I have been unemployed for about 9 months now (yikes I know) by choice.  I held a position as a senior materials process engineer for a company that I LOVED but the constant traveling was unbearable for a functioning family life.  My wife is a breadwinner and carries our household so she was ok with me taking some time off to help out with our toddler and get me out of my traveling gig (love her).

I have had trouble finding work based on my education (BS in chem, MBA with focus in Leadership)  in my geographic area of central OH.  As far as I'm concerned, my chemistry degree is somewhat useless at this point - I have no passion to be in science and the jobs at a BS level are pitiful with salary.  I have no business experience yet, so no companies will hire me on the MBA side.  Additionally, my work experience over the past 14 years has been in mostly material development of composites, and process engineering.  I have applied to everything around here within my industry but the industry is largely based in Michigan or Texas and companies will easily overlook you if you don't have an official degree in engineering for an engineering role.  I've had my resume reviewed, applied to probably >200 jobs and have had the worst luck.  My wife's job is solid and she does not want to leave the ""village"" we have established here of friends so central OH is where we will stay for the foreseeable future.  

NOW, at this point I am ok with a complete career pivot and have had my sights on a career in finance, but I'm not quite sure where to go.  In my current role in our family, I do not think I will have time to pursue an entirely new Bachelor's degree but I do like the SIE, Series 7, etc. licenses that require less time to study and are more affordable.  I understand these limit me to only certain careers (e.g. private client banker), but I am ok with that.  My trouble is that you need to have a ""sponsor"" for some of these licenses and I'm not sure how to go about it.  Moreover, I'd love to just talk to some professionals in finance backgrounds to give me some guidance on how to pursue this.  Thanks in advance to reading this all, and any constructive criticism or advice you can provide.

1bwqfse,Is this legally allowed? Need some advice,"I recently got a good job offer since I am moving to a new area in a few months. This new job is in the area I will be moving to.

They were always done on time and I’m really the only one who knew how to do them the right way to stay up with compliance standards. I told them they only take me roughly 10 hours a month to do, which is true. I told him I could still do them on the weekends/ evenings for $100 an hour (extra $1000 a month) and they happily agreed.

1bwpmqi,Should I warn my coworker he's being thrown under the bus?,"I am pretty close with two guys at my work. They work in another department but I sit by them. One reports to the other. I feel closer to the less senior one, mostly because we have an actual friendship but the other guy has a crush on me. I recently helped the newer boy apply for his visa (I've done it at other jobs) when hr told him it was approved, his natural reaction was to hug me which is fine but the other kid got oddly jealous this is for context.

Because of where I sit, I hear a lot of conversations. I just overheard their boss talking about them (they wfh on Friday). Their boss was talking bad about the less senior guy, saying things the more senior guy said (lies) to make him look bad. The upsetting thing is the project they are doing, I've helped them on and what the boss said he loved the most was actually my idea but the senior guy played off as his idea (which is mostly fine my job in no way relates to theirs but it bothered me). The senior guy is also taking credit for the other guy's work.

The senior guy is a douche. He hits in all the girls the office, he brags about money, he lies about everything. One of the most ridiculous lies is that he visibly in his appearance is not white which is ok but his appearance indicates he's from a certain country. He has a very very thick accent as well and speaks the language of that country. He insists he's never lived there is 100% American, but his Facebook is in another language and it says that he went to school (high school and college) that country. Like why lie? The other boy is clearly from that country (hence the visa.) 

I'm really bothered by what I overheard especially since their boss was saying he's unsure about the less senior boy. So my question is, do I tell him? The two boys are personal friends outside of work. I feel like maybe I should stay out of it but I really like that less senior boy both as a person and for his job because he has a very high level of education and is extremely intelligent and he's taught me things about his job so I can see he's very good at it. And I'm pretty sure his visa is dependent on him working here and it seems the other guy is trying to get rid of him due to jealousy.

If any of this matters- I'm significantly older than these boys, I'm in a relationship and the less senior boy is engaged so our relationship is 100% platonic. The other boy asks me frequently on dates and tells me I'm beautiful etc. I obviously don't indulge him but I do mostly enjoy having him as work friend.

I've received an offer from a great company, doubling my salary, with plans to start on April 20th. They called a few hours ago, saying they'll send a formal offer on Monday.

I've asked for a month's delay (until May) to cool things down. I know I've been emotional and should have secured a job before resigning. Now, I'm considering resigning again.

I don't want to upset my manager or team; they've been great. But I feel stuck and want to move on.

Considerations for staying:
Decent salary.
Study time if no pending tasks.
Great colleagues.
Taking things slow. l

Considerations for the new job:
Exposure to new skills.
Double salary.
Enhancing my resume with the company's name.

1bwo0jm,What am I supposed to do to make a decent living?,"TLDR: Don't want career, only want to art, what do?


I've been a photographer for the past 10 years. Shooting cars for dealerships is my bread and butter and in my free time I shoot bands for fun. The last few years I've also been doing a little graphic design making gig posters. 

Creativity is my passion. I love making stuff and I frequently try out new things and lean into new inspirations.  

I've heard that you should find something you're good at that you can do for a living that will fund your passions instead of pursuing those passions as a career because that will lead to burnout.

All of the things I'm good at hardly pay a decent living.
I'm good at shooting cars for dealerships, and it's gotten me by for 10 years, but it doesn't pay enough to save up or have a family or live anywhere decent. 

Shooting bands and making gig posters is really hard to make a living doing. I don't mind putting in the effort to get there, and I don't even mind it being a slow journey, in fact I enjoy doing the things I love at my own pace instead of trying to grind my way into making it a career. 

I feel like I really need to start doing something that earns more money though. I'm 32 and I need to start saving.

All I have is a high school education. I've thought about going to school for graphic design, but after frequenting the graphic design sub I can tell it's a minefield, especially right now with mass tech layoffs. I don't want to climb a corporate ladder or any of that bs.

In my area the most common way to make a decent living without a degree is by working in the plants. My cousin started doing it right out highschool and makes nearly $40/hr. But that's all he does. He has to work an insane amount of hours, nightshifts, dangerous environments, etc. No life outside of work.
Definitely not for me.

I've been told to look into other blue collar trades, but the whole thing about that is that I'm just sinking time and energy into something I don't care about so I can hopefully do something I'm passionate about. Like, I don't think going to a trade school to learn how to be an electrician means that when I'm done with school I don't need to learn anymore and boom I just land a job that lets me mentally separate my job from my pursuit of passions. I'd have to put in effort off the clock to become a better electrician. I'd have to go all in on my trade the same way I do my creative outlets and I don't want my life to revolve around my blue collar trade. 

What should I think about doing that lets me live a creative life while making a decent living?

Should I just keep sticking it out and hoping I can break through into the group of creative people that make a decent living from their craft? 

I feel like my creative work is good enough to make a living doing, other people of various comparable skill level do it. Am I doing something wrong?

1bwnmtp,How to deal with someone that mimics/copies you,"I just recently switched employers. I know a guy that worked with me in my previous firm, same department. I know the guy very well - in terms of what he's capable of and what he is not. I know his weaknesses properly.

I know that the guy is relatively new to our line of work and honestly has no character/personality. It's so obvious when you see him at work. I know I'm by a milestone better than him. My issue though is that he always wants to mimic me. He mimics my style of work. He mimics the way I talk. He even fkin mimics my suits lol. 

Up until now, that was my previous work. I left that place that recently to pursue growth in another firm. I didnt tell anyone where I went. So what this guy did is stalk my linkedin and looked at my recent connections (which is obviously from my new work). He then went and messaged one of them to get a job in the same place and same department. It seriously pissed me off. The problem is he doesnt event want to admit it. He literally thinks just bcz I've been quiet about it I wont notice. Anyways he's set for an interview now and all that stuff. So there's big possibility that the guy joins us. Why is he like that. Just why. Find your own path in life and stop copying me.

And please dont tell me to be flattered by it bcz I'm not. And I'll tell u why. I taught him almost everything we do in our previous work and he used to get credit for it behind my back. And I kept quiet. He doesnt even say that he learned from me or something. At least give credit where it's due so people know. So his entire skillset is based on mimicking his coworker.

How do I deal with a guy like that? I'm seriously considering blocking him on linkedin.",AT_16,1,0.6000000238418579,4,1712337606,2024-04-05 17:20:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bwnmtp/how_to_deal_with_someone_that_mimicscopies_you/,4,2024

1bwmits,Should I take the job?,"I started a job as a financial assistance at the end of February. It was completely new to me so I’ve had a lot to learn. I spent weeks studying terms and learning everything. I finally feel like i’m doing good. This job is less than 10 minutes from my house, so that means i can check on my dog at lunch (he is older so i hate leaving him all day). I only have to work 7 hours a day and I truly feel this has been great for my mental health.

So I interviewed for a position back in January before accepting this job. I was told by the recruiter i was working with that it would be a bit of a long process as the company was going through some changes. 

Recently the recruiter contacted me saying they really wanted me and changed their offer to $26 an hour. This would be about a $9000 raise (yearly) and about $400 extra each month.
The downside is, it’s a customer service position. Which is what I just got out of. It’s a growing company so I know there would be different positions in the future I could try to apply for. 
Also the job is about a 30 drive back and forth plus an extra hour of work everyday. So this means i wouldn’t have time to go home and check on my dog. I would be paying for my lunch everyday since i can’t go home (unless i meal prep) & i would be spending more money on gas. I would have to wake up 2 hours earlier as well. 

Basically is the money worth taking the job? I’m happy at my new job but will be getting a new apartment in a few months without a roommate so this could cause some financial issues down the road.

1bwmdac,Feel like a job hopper ,"Not going to use actually company names in this post so I just labeled them A, B, and C companies

I graduated from college in 2019 with my engineering degree and started working Jan 2020 with ‘A’ company. Pandemic hit in March 2020 so we (along with the rest of the world) went remote. Was in that position with A company for roughly 2.5 years and I got burnt out on the detailed engineering I was doing. I decided to make a pivot and step away from engineering and switch to ‘B’ company in hopes of getting into sales—the job was going fine but the company itself was miserable.   (5 days a week in office, everyone took lunch at the exact same time everyday, if you left 1 minute early management would come talk to you, and many other things.  I said heck no,). I was only there for 6 months and in my desperation to get away from ‘B’ company as quickly as possible, I switched back to ‘A’ company. I went back to a different group doing different engineering work but luckily it way less technical than my first position with ‘A’ so I have been relatively content. I have been in this position for a year and a half now but for the last 6-9 months my boss has been driving me absolutely insane, I can hardly stand to talk to him. I expressed interest to him at the end of 2023 that I was ready to move on to a non engineering role and get into a more business suited role because engineering is just not for me . His response back to me was “you really need to stay in a role for more than a year, because people won’t want to hire you if they see you have moved this much” (keep in mind I was trying to move internally). My boss is 65+ so he comes from a generation where people worked the same job for 35+ years and didn’t move and found contentment in that). 

At the end of 2023 I ended up interviewing internally for a position at ‘A’ company but they decided to go with someone else, nbd. I was then encouraged to apply to this other internal position (it was met with a lot of push back from boss) but I did it anyways. Two days before my scheduled interview our company decided to go on a hiring/internal transfer freeze and also they were increasing our days in the office from 2 to 3 days. The hiring freezewas suppose to be for 90 days and we are going on 120 days now. Then I got word this week the freeze isn’t up till the end of the year or end of Q1 2025. Now I am literally stuck. 

However another job opportunity from ‘C’ company came up but I feel so bad leaving after having already left once and only being back 1.5 years. 

The pay with ‘C’ company is more and it’s fully remote. But would require 2-3 days a month at a job site which is out of town.  The only really big difference and why I am on the fence still is maternity leave (I’m not expecting atm but my husband and I hope to start having kids in the next year or so). 

‘A’ company has 12 weeks paid mat.  leave 
‘C’ company only offers FMLA job protection for 12 weeks but unpaid. I can use my vacation and sick days for mat. leave but that is 2.5 weeks at most. 

1) should I care about leaving? 

2) would you leave a company that had paid maternity leave to go to one that didn’t?

I am currently working in digital health/public health arena with social impact (over 3years now) in India but recently got an offer from a big4 consultancy for financial risk advisory. This worked out solely based on my Stats and ML, communication skills.

The pay hike in Stat consultant role would be more than 60% right now and hence wondering about the situation. Another organisation has shown interest in taking me as a senior associate in digital health.

So while I am a bit aware about the future roles in public health ( like senior associate, program manager etc), I am not aware how Stat consultant career shape out to be. 

Any ideas from you guys would be wonderful. Cheers.

1bwm0s9,Asking for promotion into job I'm already doing ,"Promotion Into Job I'm Actually Doing

First some background: I've been at my company for 2 years. I joined my company as an HR Associate, worked that role for 10 months until they promoted me into my current role of Talent Acquisition Coordinator (we were growing so much and I was already good at my job so the promotion just made sense even after only 10 montjs). My salary increased from 45k to 52k. In the TAC role I also was making bonus, 13k last year, and it was that high because out Talent Acquisition Specialist left 4 months into me starting the role. 

But here's my problem. It's about to be my annual review, and I want to be promoted into the role I actually have been doing since my coworker left. I've been functioning as the TAS for 10 months with 0 of the increase in pay. Literally doing that job description to a T. When the coworker left my boss called this a ""trial period""...but then it went on for 10 months. Our recruiting is better than ever now. The only other person on my team is our assistant. I'm the one running the department with minimal oversight from the rest of HR. 

But what I want to know is...how much of a salary increase do yall think is feasible to ask for? And also considering bonus? I'm on track to make at least 20k in bonus this year. But I also know that the old TAS had a base salary of 70k. Asking for 70k when I'm only at 52k base seems a little crazy to me, but is it? Also I'm worried they'll come back to me with the line of ""oh well you're already on track to make 72k this year already, you don't need a base raise."" But then it's not a promotion. And I do not want to continue to be working a role I'm not being paid for. The TAS role is also 12 pay grades higher than mine...I feel I deserve to have that increase in base for the job I'm already doing. 

Also -- I feel I should mention that our 2 person team functions just fine as it is. Unless growth completely explodes, they have no need to pay a third person and are saving money even if they give me a huge raise.

I hope these ramblings make sense. I'm wondering of anyone has advice on how to approach asking for this promotion/raise for the role I've already been doing. TIA!

Even if your job isnt able to give you a raise you can take what you learn and use it to land a job with a higher salary. Negotiating is like a muscle the more you practice the better you get.

1bwk10z,Should I quit or push through?,"Last year I changed my job and started in a new place with more challenging work, more benefits and higher pay.

However, after one year I realize I am way behind in the knowledge I need to perform my tasks well and need to ask my colleagues for advice all the time. I don't ask the same thing twice and have a large note where I wrote down what I learn but they codebase and workload is so large that I keep encountering problems every day. Also, my colleagues have a very limited time that they can can spend helping me.

I had a chat with my manager and told her that I am unable to perform at the expected level and now she personally assigns me tasks one by one, unlike the other colleagues. But I feel under constant supervision and it's affecting my mental health.

In the past month I have started taxing anxiety pills because I would get panic attacks thinking what task would follow (followed by questions of will I even be capable of completing it or will I fail again and have it reasigned to a more experienced colleague) and lately I have trouble even sleeping because of the worries. I go to sleep agitated and I wake up agitated during the night from the stress. I feel I am an incapable of doing this job and that it might be just too difficult for me but I'm also afraid of changing jobs as I might end up in a similar siatation, with difficult work and maybe even less perks.

Do you have any advice or relatable story? I don't know how to approach this issue, I'll probably start by seeing a therapist and going to a doctor so that I a least could sleep better but this won't change the situation itself. Should I quit or push though in the hope that I will eventually reach a decent level (which right now seems to be nowhere in sight).

1bwitbv,Do I unaccept an offer so late or break-ties with the company that did everything it could to bring me back?,"2 months ago I accepted an offer to join a semi-start-up company as a 'Head of Analysis'' position back in Europe (this is why the long period). The company seems great, I would have a very capable employee reporting into me and the role would have me working directly with C-suite and investors. The role obviously comes with a ton of responsibility and I'm questioning the work-life balance aspect after hearing from the CFO that once I join ""he'll get his life back"" and has already planned a number of projects for me. The people do seem super nice and even offered me relocation assistance and other perks which werent expected.

Now the company I'm planning to leave (or better yet the parent in Europe, same country as above) has offered me a 'Group Analysis Manager' title. For me this would be the easiest transition. I've worked in this group for 6 years and 4 of them was in Europe so I know everyone very well (including the people that would be in my team who are close personal friends). Pay is 10% less than what the start-up offered so not a deal breaker at all. They did open this new role just for me which took a lot of time.

These past couple of years have not been the easiest on me and maybe I'm doubting myself if I want to take on a massive new challenge or just scared. 

The start up is expecting me to start in 2 weeks and the group have no idea about the start up. They offered me the role so as to not lose me as circumstances here in the US are not positive.

I am overworked and constantly being assigned to work on extra-budgetary projects and initiatives; to put it simply, things that are not in my line of duty. I wake up one day to find I have been nominated to do a bunch of stuff that’s out of my line of work. They hold me to very strict and rigid standards and always have an issue with me taking leave. In fact I had to work during my last leave. I see other employees late to work everyday by an hour or even more! They slack off, and do just unacceptable things that I know I could never get away with. If I apply for other UN jobs (as a current UN employee) I am required to submit something called a performance evaluation report which summarizes my performance overall.

1bwgahe,Just put in my notice and considering reaching out to the CEO this morning. Any advice welcome,"So I have been working at a very small startup since summer 2022. I was recruited by them directly as they were working for an old boss of mine and asked him for recommendations with my expertise. I have made a lot of big sacrifices for the company because I believed in the mission (relocating to a remote area for training for 6 weeks, moving states, ect). For the first year, I was working directly with the CEO and the founder as I was their only full time salaried employee (a few other contractors and such).

Last year around this time, they hired a new CSO who was to be my direct boss because of the nature of my position (science focused). She is the reason I had to move states because she wanted the science team all in her area. Under her, I have had a lot of the original responsibilities that made me like the job removed (not due to error or anything, just that she thinks someone with a PhD has to do anything not in the lab). I have basically been reduced to lab tasks only and also put in charge of maintaining an unrelated department single handedly (no change in title though). 

I went through hell with the relocation in September as this boss did not think I needed a cost of living adjustment despite moving from a low cost of living city to one of the most expensive in the US. She has basically severed my ties to the CEO and founder by telling me not to come to the company weekly meetings, not allowing me to email them directly (findings from my experiments or lab updates). She just wants these things sent to her and then she presents them herself. She has told me to my face I have no skills outside the lab (when the possibility of working remotely instead of relocating was discussed), despite me basically performing all of her job tasks prior to her arrival. 

Lately, there has been conflict in the lab due to a new hire she picked for a position. He has caused extensive problems due to lack of communication, lies frequently to cover himself on mistakes, and he forces the lab to have new excessive policies due to these conflicts that he then refuses to follow. The CSO has illustrated her terrible leadership through this situation, and has not taken any real action despite many complaints from the lab manager. I have only brought up a few issues for clarification on policies and lab dynamics, and each time was interrogated and treated as if I did something wrong.

I put my notice in this week after a particularly stupid situation (I have been job hunting for a while and had some offers/interviews bur was waiting for a good fit). It got to the point that I am willing to work on a part time side gig and live off of savings until I find something because my stress and anxiety around work was unmanageable. My boss acted all nice and said I was “so qualified and too good for the position I was in and work I was doing” and wants to have a lunch with the other science staff to say goodbye. There are only two people on the team I consider friends, then one other person besides the CSO and new guy who I don’t know that much. My plan is to politely turn down the lunch as I don’t want to sit at a table with her for any amount of time on top of what I have to do in the coming week.

Okay, so my issue is I want to go to the CEO this morning (he has virtual office hours) to say thanks for the opportunities and goodbye face-to-face. I am considering asking him for an exit interview to talk about my reasons for leaving (such a small company right now so there is no HR structures in place). I feel like it is not inappropriate since I worked with him directly for nearly a year, but I don’t know how much I should really say about things. I found out that the CSO has tried to have me fired twice, so I don’t know how much he will listen to my opinions at this point. I just want to get this off my chest and tell him how things are being run by this woman, but I am conflicted on how to do it or if I should. My boyfriend was trying to talk me out of it saying it wouldnt make a difference and would just make me look bad, but others in my life have said to do it cause I don’t have much to lose. My lab manager has already said she would be a reference for me at the company, so I don’t think I am concerned about burning the bridge with CSO.

Any advice would be very much appreciated. The office hour is in 3 hours so I am kind of last minute scrambling on what to do.

1bwfhwa,CISSP or AWS Solutions Architect for a SysAdmin Transitioning to System Architect?,"
Hi everyone,

I’ve been in the IT field for over 17 years, primarily as a SysAdmin, managing everything from VMware infrastructure to Windows/Linux server farms. My role has evolved to include responsibilities akin to a System Architect, but without the formal title. In my small company, titles are more functional labels than career descriptors. As I aim to officially transition into a System Architect role, I'm at a crossroads regarding certifications to pursue next.

Given my background and the desire to enhance my career (with a keen interest in cybersecurity but also recognizing the growing importance of cloud computing), I'm debating between pursuing the CISSP certification to solidify my cybersecurity knowledge or a cloud certification like AWS Solutions Architect to gain more cloud-oriented skills.

- **CISSP**: Appeals due to my interest in cybersecurity, potentially strengthening my foundational knowledge.
- **AWS Solutions Architect**: Seems practical given cloud computing's ubiquity and its direct relevance to many System Architect roles.

Considering the blend of management and technical duties in a System Architect role, which certification path would you recommend to best position myself for success in this transition? Any insights, especially from those who’ve navigated similar paths or hired for these roles, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your guidance!

1bwcyze,Teacher in crisis,"Good morning,

I am living in a situation of deep discouragement, I would like an honest opinion from someone who may have had similar experience.

So, as a background I have a degree in a scientific discipline, I have a doctorate, potentially expendable in companies with research interests.

From the university I left because I did not get along well with my supervisor. I liked the research activity, but the servant-master relationship was really brazen. Daily lies and manipulation.

While I was doing my doctorate, I participated in the faculty competition.

I won a professorship.

This year I started working at the school.

I work with many classes (nine...). Let's say I ""work"" with five. 

I don't know if it is normal for everyone to have class management problems at the beginning of their career. Let's say I did not expect this difficulty. For this job I spend my soul, prepare lessons and correct exercises on classrooms daily. But I really don't know what I'm doing wrong at certain times and with certain classes, and realizing that I'm not working really makes me sick.

In addition to this difficulty, the relationship with some parents is terrible. They don't realize that an insufficiency is not the ultimate punishment, it's just telling their son look you did wrong here, do better. I have been told that before I put a failing grade, I have to think a hundred times, because the risk of appeal is around the corner. For me who is just starting out, to think that doing my job seriously can lead me to being sued makes me feel terrible. They tell me, ""put your papers in order,"" but what do I know if I've made any mistakes this year? Is it ever possible to work like this?

Finally.

Since December I have had serious problems with my voice. Always hoarse, sore throat in speaking.

In February I decide to go to the ENT: I have a polyp in my throat.

He prescribes 10 days of stop and tells me that then surgery should be considered.

I reply that I don't want to take the 10-day stop because it means slowing down too much in school.

I realized today that I have made a serious mistake.

As of today I have completely lost the use of my voice. I think I will be forced, at this point, to the stop days, and tomorrow I will find out if I will have to have surgery.

Absenting myself from school now, without giving the opportunities to make up insufficiencies, exposes me even more to the risk of being sued if I put in debt.

And yet the dilemma arises for me: but if I have a student who has consistently gotten me a 3 on the written tests, and at the end of the year I have to put a 6 on him.... To the one who gets a 6 because he struggled, how much should I put instead? Seventy?

All this really rots my soul. Because I believed so much in this profession. Maybe I don't have the right character that is needed here.

For a while now I've been fantasizing about changing jobs in September.

Maybe looking for a serious company with a nice research and development department.

This idea, however, scares me a little. I have never worked in the private sector, yet I am someone who has never spared myself in the pace of work. I am afraid, however, to find myself again in the master servant dynamics (which are nonexistent in school), and to find myself dealing very closely with manipulative liars.

I don't even know where to start looking for good company. I don't know from what one can tell the quality of the work I would go into. Personally, I'm content with modest pay but satisfying work where they treat you decently. But how can you tell in advance?

Finally, leaving the permanent teaching position also feels like a step into the dark. Yet, I realize that I am currently in very serious difficulties. Mental health wise but also physical.

Any observations from you reading will be helpful to me.

1bwcx0q,Data Engineer to Sales Engineer,"Hi all, 
I've got two years experience and am in my late 20s.
I currently work for a large organisation doing data engineering. The current job is very cruisey and a good work life balance but I feel like I'm close to reaching my ceiling in terms of technical work and technical growth in this company (promotion would be management). It is not a tech company and many of my colleagues are less techy giving me the big fish small pond expertise and the company is slow to adapt as I implement new technology but otherwise it's a good role and can be done fully remotely. On a day to day basis I only have one or two meetings and most of the other time is developing and what I do or how I do it is very autonomous.

I have been offered a role as sales engineer at a ""soon to IPO"" tech platform.. this role would require a lot more people and contact hours than my current role and I haven't done sales in the past. It would be remote but visiting client site and likely more demoing/selling the product and less technical building. This job would give me huge growth in people skills, sales and presenting but would likely be highly demanding. The take home pay is similar but RSU (pre-IPO) is additional in the sales Engineer role (~50,000 extra). I must have the potential skills to do it given the offer but that sales side of the role is making me nervous.

Has anyone moved from a non-tech technical role to a tech sales role and what are your views on this as a career move?",spicyworm,1,1.0,1,1712305914,2024-04-05 08:31:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bwcx0q/data_engineer_to_sales_engineer/,4,2024

1bwc1qr,"My Mom is my manager, how do I ask for a raise?","I (23M) work in an office where my mom is my direct boss, and my stepdad is the division manager. I was hired on as a helper for $18/h and became the jack of all trades. Over time I have done many important jobs for many employees there. I learned how to do billing, coding checks, I personally went through thousands of files and digitized our office, trained people, and even worked in our warehouse. I did all this once I graduated college with a Bachelors in Film, as I want to pursue acting. I work on my acting hustle when I’m not at work, which was why this was just a part time just until recently, when our Payroll employee was fired.

My mom has gone through multiple payroll employees and has had no luck. She was frustrated and desperate because she would have to once again take on that workload on top of her job. She asked if I could step up and do that job. I was not stoked and she knew this. It would require me to double my hours, take on a lot of important responsibilities, and it most importantly, it would make it harder for me to pursue acting. Knowing how desperate my mom was I accepted. Months later I am doing great at the job. I did what I needed to and gave my mom a breath of fresh air. I now have to work 40 hours plus usually another 5-15 hours at home on my acting work. It’s exhausting.

Knowing this was going to be difficult for me to manage, my mom and step dad offered me a raise to fairly compensate me when I initially became the Payroll person. Being that everyone in the office with important jobs get salary pay of $22+ hour, it was the finally piece that convinced me to take the job. After I accepted they told me they could give me a $1 raise. One dollar. Honestly it would have been less disrespectful if they just didn’t give me a raise at all. Unbelievable. Here I am spreading myself thin to make my mom and stepdad’s lives easier and they give me a dollar as compensation. I took it on the chin, but now months later it still left a sour taste in my mouth. I’m starting to resent working there. My mom feels it and now gets mad at me quite often for not wanting to above and beyond for this job. Why would I. My job is just as important as everyone else’s now, and I’m one of the few employees that even have a degree. Why am I the only employee still paid hourly? Am I getting shorted because I’m her son? Please give me advice on what to do. I don’t want to come off as begging but I don’t feel like this is a fair trade at all anymore.

TL//DR: I feel taken advantage of since I am the boss’ kid. My job is just as important as everyone else’s but I am paid the least.

1bw9bzv,Keep losing my job to company layoffs and looking to switch careers. What is a career where I can transfer my skills that has better job security?,"So I first started in sales which was ALWAYS prone to firing/layoffs (jobs where they lay you off after a month if you don't sell, or they lay you off if you've been there 10 years but have a few bad months in a row).   


High stress, low pay (mostly commission based work) had me looking to switch careers. So I got my degree in business and switched over to marketing as a lot of the skills were transferable, I liked the work, and I could finally get paid a guaranteed salary vs having it fluctuate so much do to commission only work (I swear, it should be illegal).  


Only now it seems that every marketing job I have either tries to get me to make cold calls after covid (marketing costs soared so they couldn't afford to run ads and email stopped working as well) or they lie about job expectations (they hire you for SEO but then tell you you need to do web design, and video, and basically everything outside of building guides) or they work you to the bone only to outsource your entire department after you already brought in a bunch of customers.  


So now I'm thinking I will need to pivot again but I'm struggling with what I should focus on. I thought about becoming a data analyst but with my severe ADHD it marks it hard to learn to code (seriously, I tried learn basic SQL and I could only remember maybe 5% of it because my brain just couldn't retain the information). I think if it's so hard for me just to learn SQL then I stand no chance of learning Python or Stats.  


I'm really frustrated because I know I am most likely going to also have to take a major dip in pay and basically start over (I was making 80k on my way to finally make 6 figures after 7 years of experience) and all the entry level data analyst jobs near me pay $15 an hour.  


TLDR - What career can I shift to out of marketing that has better job security that won't require me to take a massive dip in salary and experience?",Live_Profile843,5,1.0,8,1712292057,2024-04-05 04:40:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bw9bzv/keep_losing_my_job_to_company_layoffs_and_looking/,4,2024

1bw926t,Career Crossroads: Need advice,"TL;DR: Offered two paths at work: a promotion to Manager of Process Improvement or leading a new AI project in finance, which aligns with my interests but starts as a lateral move. Seeking advice on choosing immediate advancement vs. potential long-term growth and personal fulfillment.

Hey everyone,I'm at a significant turning point in my career and could really use some of your insights. 

Background: Houston, TX 37 yr old accounting major with public accounting background - moved to an oil and gas company 10 years ago and have moved around within org taking on various roles. Never been a supervisor. 1.5 years ago moved to the process improvement team within acct / finance as a senior analyst. 

Here's the situation:

Option 1: Promotion to Manager of Process Improvement

This would be a step up into my former manager's role, overseeing the process improvements within our accounting and finance department

Option 2: Project Manager for a New AI Initiative

Alternatively, I have the chance to spearhead a pioneering AI project. It's a lateral move initially but could evolve into a major leadership role given the project's success. The AI role excites me due to my interest in the field, but the managerial promotion offers immediate advancement and recognition.


My Dilemma:

Do I choose the clear career advancement now, or pursue my passion in AI with a role that promises significant impact and aligns with my long-term goals but lacks immediate certainty in terms of promotion? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences if you’ve faced a similar choice.

1bw8vx9,Career advice for an engineer,"I’m (27M) having a career crisis as an engineer. This year I was promoted to a new role where I am now considered a mid to senior level engineer. Something definitely more established than an entry level or early career role. Even though I have this new title I feel both ahead and behind of figuring out what the hell I should do next and where I want to end up. 

I graduated with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. A couple years later while working full time, I obtained my masters in Mechanical Engineering. 

Currently I have 5 YOE and work at a well known aerospace company. I truly enjoy my job, perform very well in my role, and work on really cool stuff! At the end of the day though I still wonder about what’s next for me. 

I sometimes feel like I pigeonholed myself into a technical role because I got an MSE, while other times I could see myself pivoting to management. I often question if pivoting to management could happen naturally or would require getting an MBA. I know many engineers that have done so, but am unsure if it’s something suitable for me.

I believe the next 3-5 years of my career can be very pivotal and Im hoping to gain more insight on what others have done. I feel like many engineers face the same career questions as they gain more experience.

1bw8omu,ready to leave,"I just started a kennel job on Monday. It's quite literally my dream job, but alas i've already found issues. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the work itself. It's my co-workers. I shadowed about 2-3 weeks before my start date. In that time, I was given basic training. I have worked three days this week and in those three days, I have received no further training. No elaboration. I am upset by this because I feel very unhelpful because there are periods of time in which dogs don't need to be tended to so I'm trying to scramble to find things to do so I don't look like a slacker. But I have no clue what I can be doing in this time. Every day, Ive just ended up cleaning stuff up. The guy I am supposed to be training with (according to a text my boss sent me) always disappears into the front receiving room where dogs are brought in and out. Only one of us can go in there at a time so I can't follow. Speaking of the receiving room, nobody has taught me the names of the dogs and their owners when they're receiving. I can't do anything because I don't know the people. But anyways, for the last two days, there's been a third person with us so they've been talking and leaving me by myself. I feel really left out. I know it's only been three days but nobody has tried to talk to me, or even learn who i am. I'm insanely introverted so I have no clue how to approach introducing and befriending these people. It's a small business so everyone is friends with each other except me, because I'm new. But I feel like it's somehow my fault. 

The only other issue I have is my hours. I was told i'd be hired on as full time (which they consider as 40 hours). This week I work 23 hours over 3 days and next week I work 18 hours over 2 days. I have no clue if it's some sort of a training schedule but if i was hired full time i want the correct hours.

I haven't even been at this place a full week. But am I already so wrong for starting to create a list of places to apply to? I feel like this place of work just isn't for me.

1bw8m16,Bosses keep increasing workload and not compensating for the extra work.,"Hey I'm not sure what to do with this situation at work. I work in a department with around 80-90 people, and specifically in a subdepartment with two other individuals. We have in the past been given extra work and not been compensated for it immediately, or at all. We are currently being given about 2-3 times the work we already have without compensation because of a job skill we voluntarily took upon ourselves three years ago in order to avoid staying an hour or so late every night. Three years ago we were getting in trouble for staying late, then that stopped when we picked up the ""voluntary"" skill (we asked for compensation at the time, they said no). Fast forward to now, we were given some of the work of another department (not the 80-90 person department we already are a subdepartment of, a separate department completely, not related, different supervisors and all), and then also we recently expanded and were given the 2-3 times our normal workload on top of the stuff we individually do and the stuff the three of us do together. Anyway, they keep telling us that we don't need a raise because it's ""temporary"" however the won't let us clock in as a ""lead"" temporarily until they have someone to do the job full time, they won't increase our bonus since we have an extra workload (another temporary form of compensation), and they said that there isn't enough work for us to do so. However we disagree since we went from receiving, registering, and processing stuff from our location and 45 or so other locations in the area, to processing and registering those as well as the rest of our state, and two neighboring states as well. So it is a LOT. One half of the corner of our state was a lot, now we get stuff from all of the state, and two others?! And they keep telling me specifically that I can't have lead position pay, or a pay increase for the ""voluntary"" skill I took on three years ago, because it's not unique enough to me, but then won't let me change my schedule because ""only I can do this job"" on those days. It is my two coworkers who have asked for raises or temporary compensation last week when it started, and this week, and I haven't asked since that started because they talked to our bosses on my days off. But our bosses are saying that the discussion is closed and not to discuss it further. Anyway, I don't know what to do, because the pay me just under $15/hour, started at $13, and I am so exhausted and ar capacity, yet new coworkers I get are started above my pay, around $16-$17/hour. Out of the three of us, the highest paid gets $16.75, and has been here 4 years.

1bw81kg,Need advice on prospective company but am unsure about what to do?,"
So I’m in the AEC industry. In 2021, I was working for Company A for 7 months and I wasn’t happy there. Then a construction company posted a job on Zip Recruiter for a PM position. Pay was in 110k-135k which was way more than I was making at Company A (85k and office every day). I applied, and then got a notification from the prospective company that wanted to interview me. So I went for the interview by the Lead PM which lasted about an hour. It felt good and their benefits are awesome and was told that I was a strong candidate. 

I sent them a thank you email message for time and opportunity blah blah. Then I didn’t hear from them for a week or two. After reaching out a 2nd and 3rd time, I come to find out they hired someone via LinkedIn. Well that’s fine. I kept looking while working for Company A. 

Then I found an opportunity with Company B for 100k 2-3 months later with a hybrid position. Accepted it and was a bit happier there. 

Then in mid 2022 one of their managers from the same prospective construction company reached out to me via LinkedIn for an interview with the founder if I was interested. And since it has been a while, I said sure why not. However I wanted to know why they reached out, and it turns out the Lead PM left.. so I guess they were looking to fill his position. I went there and we spoke for about an hour as well. But higher pay (140k) and benefits. Interview went pretty good. Said he’ll reach out once he gets back from his vacay. 

I did the same thing with a thank you email blah blah blah. I haven’t heard back in 2-3 weeks. Then finally I did hear back from one of the supervisors saying that the founder went with someone else. I’m like well he’ll but at least I’m just updating my interview skills. 

Then in last year around July one of the managers reached out to invite to apply via Indeed. I just decided to just send them an email saying that I’ve already had been interviewed twice. Although I’m sure the invite from Indeed was automated, still I felt the need to write them a message, but this time with a desired salary of $150k. Bc I felt like it was a waste of my time. And I haven’t heard anything. 

Now it’s 2024, I get a message from a 3rd party recruiter for job opportunities with certain positions and companies. Turns out one of the companies he’s representing is the same construction company. I told him that I have already been interviewed with them 2 times with the 3rd being an indeed invite. So that I don’t waste his time. He mentions that I should just go ahead and send him an updated résumé. And that he’ll recommend at $165k. But in the back of my mind, I’m wondering, is the company looking bc they’re growing or is it bc there’s turnovers? 

So what you think I should do? Or what do y’all think? ",Silent_Glass,1,1.0,0,1712288098,2024-04-05 03:34:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bw81kg/need_advice_on_prospective_company_but_am_unsure/,4,2024

How can a candidate w operations background and culinary stand out in interview especially in roles that aren’t in food service industry?",janinereyes,1,1.0,4,1712284896,2024-04-05 02:41:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bw6xno/why_do_you_want_to_transition_your_career/,4,2024
1bw6bgw,"Stepping down , how to talk to my boss","I work at a startup company and I am a director of all things data and report to the CIO. small company , so not many layers. We maintain a data warehouse for our company and their subsidiaries. We also provide all reporting, very small team but highly productive. I talk to my team everyday and stay on top of day to day operational things and also strategic initiatives. That is causing professional burnout. 

I also have a healthy dose of stress in my personal life. My almost 20 year old is a 7 time cancer survivor and fighting an active cancer currently. Too emotionally draining and i have a myriad of health issues too. Nothing too serious, but a good number of uterine fibroids that makes my days painful , high Cholesterol, hypertension, acid reflux and such. 

Now , for a few months ive been thinking about stepping down from my role to an individual contributor role. I have 20+ years of experience in the industry that i am working in and good at what i do. I am not into the newest technology , but I do ok. I want to have this conversation with my boss on Monday. i am drained out, i need to give my 100% at home so dont want to manage people anymore and want to be an individual contributor. How can i go about this ? Will they cut my pay by a substantial amount? What do i tell them ? How can i make this seem like i am not thinking about slacking but only thinking about getting away from management responsibilities ? Any help is appreciated.

1bw65l9,Supervisor wants me to write my own performance report ,"I’ve been working on a team for more than 6 months now and it’s been great so far. I know I am doing well and my supervisor has told me more than once via teams chat that I go above and beyond. He’s been very verbally supportive of my growth and has explained that he is very impressed with my performance so far. 

Fast forward to this week and we need to put in feedback and performance reviews for people who might be up for promotion. My supervisor previously explained that he would be more than willing to give me a review and so I sent him a request via email.

The next morning he sent me his “review” which was very obviously constructed by ChatGPT with buzzwords and generic language. I felt so disappointed but then I asked him if he could include specific examples as that would strengthen my case for promotion.

A couple days later he said he unfortunately won’t have time to revise it due to the timelines and he would just send it like that, I told him that he can take a few days, since he is my direct supervisor, his feedback counts the most. 

Eventually he said I should just write what I want him to write and he can review it before he sends it off. I understand the timelines are tight and that people are busy but for me personally, writing a good feedback for someone you know has been doing a great job should be a top priority especially if you’re their direct supervisor.

I feel so disappointed and I hate that I have to write my own feedback. Like on top of doing all the work, the least someone can do is proactively support me to get a promotion. It’s so disappointing that people will say they want to support you but are not ready to walk the walk. I’m stuck now and I don’t even know what to write. It feels extremely odd having to write about myself in third person and pretend like I’m seeing myself from another person’s lens. It feels very unfair.

TLDR: supervisor who has given me great verbal feedback suddenly doesn’t have time to document a positive performance appraisal.

1bw5c11,What Is the Best Job (In Terms of Total Lifetime Income and Wealth) That You Can Get as an Accounting Major?,"**What is the most lucrative job one can have with an accounting major at the:**

1. *AAS*
2. *BS*
3. *Masters*
4. *PHD*
5. *Post PHD*

**levels?**

I'm hoping I can do something in finance one day, I'm good with useful, business based math, I'm no quant, but I can hold my own in general math. I remember that when I was in High School, instead of talking with friends, I would calculate GDP per capita and I would always get the answers right even without a calculator. I also used to watch Bloomberg in my elementary school days.

I'm sure Accounting and Bookkeeping are much more difficult as studies go further in depth, but this math is vastly easier for me than reading lots of material in a major like History or English and definitely more lucrative. Since I have reading disabilities, and I realize that's a huge setback, I now have a reading machine that lets me read even print books and newspapers as text-to-speech programs. I can read just as fast as other people now, I'm just not used to it yet.

If I read papers like the Wall Street Journal in full every day I can get a hold of the investment game well, and as I get formal education and acquire the right degrees I should be set in a career in finance if they take accounting degrees from cheap schools.

Is there any very advanced math I need to know for investment banking? I realize this question may seem stupid, but I can learn pretty much any math on my own and go for the degree just for credentials. Bookkeeping and accounting are really quite interesting for me, it shows how money circulates within and around a company, and what data needs addressing corresponds to an actual need in the business.

If investment banking doesn't work out, I can always go for being a CPA and be a consultant to companies and make good money, or I could be an auditor, which I'm sure my family would be proud of given our law and order sort of attitude and history.

I'm grateful that this community exists, and I'm grateful for any answers I get. If there is any rule that states that this cannot be said that's ok.",White_Quetzal1,1,0.6000000238418579,2,1712280473,2024-04-05 01:27:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bw5c11/what_is_the_best_job_in_terms_of_total_lifetime/,4,2024

1bw53wn,I caught my manager talking about me to another employee through teams chat … what do i do? ,"So this is my first “big girl” job after graduating college. I have been here for about a month now and I have been running into a few issues with management and I don’t know if they are normal or not. 

For context: this is a hybrid position so I come in to office 2 days and i work remotely 3 days. On my first week i was given some trainings to complete and it took me about 3-4 days to finish. I was also given a training book to go through but I was told it is mainly for reference for when I start doing the work. Once I was finished with those trainings (videos and quizzes) , I would ask what I needed to do next and i was told to “read over my material”. I have been “reading over my material” for weeks now. There have been multiple days that I am commuting to the office and sitting in a cubicle where no one (including my manager) checks in or talks to me all day and I am reading through this training book from 9-5. Even when I am remote, I have been just reading over the training book. Last week, I got 2 tasks, I completed them and sent over what I needed and I was starting to feel better.

Well yesterday, I was in office and my manager was finally there. (She’s been out of office for two weeks but most of our communication is through teams) She brings me over to her desk to look at a few things on her computer, Well as I am looking, I catch glance of messages of her and another person in the office from weeks ago where she is telling them to “Please speak to her (instead of “her” it said my name) and talk about her outfit today” the person responds “what does she have on” she replies with “a tennis skirt and tights”. 

I did not have on a tennis skirt. I had on a black dress skirt (there are frills at the bottom of it) with a turtleneck and stockings. But that’s besides the point. I was never told by either my manager or the person she was talking to about my outfit that day. I am just now figuring out about issues with my outfit. I am assuming she knows I saw it because immediately following me being at her desk I get a message from her sending me a “dress code” training that was supposed to be sent to me on my first week but she missed it. 

Then today, I received a call from her asking where I was. I was working remotely today (Thursday) . As my choice of days in office were Tuesday and Wednesday. (She confirmed this with me through email my first week) she said that she “thought we discussed coming in when she came in” she was out of office for two weeks and did not let me know. I probably should have asked what to do and that’s my fault. I could tell she was annoyed and she said that she was going to send an email for confirmation? She sends an email with ANOTHER manager cc on it discussing my days in office and states the days being Tuesday and Wednesday (the days i literally chose) and adding that the way I was sitting at my desk the day prior was unprofessional and that I need to have professional decorum. She was in office with me all day and never once let me know that how I was sitting was not okay. Which is very frustrating. 

For context, i was rewatching training videos from my first week and I was resting my head on my hand while watching. 

I’d like to add that the head of the department I am in is related to me. I haven’t said anything yet to her about any of this. Also no one in the office is supposed to know that I am related to her. 

I just don’t know how I should move forward. I like the job itself but … how am i supposed to deal with a manager that does not speak to me directly about issues.

1bw4son,How to deal with difficult co-worker?,"Ive been working at this job for almost 3 years. Recently ive considered whether how much ive loved this job. The area in tech i work in is interesting but its definetely not something i find passionate. Recently ive been considering how long i want to stay here. The pay is amazing, benefits are even better and the work is remote but the work can be alot. The dynamic of the company is to work 10+ hours it feels like. My mentor complains that the project is difficult and they dont do a good job helping newer and younger employees. At times i have difficulty keeping up. 

What’s worse one worker who has been there for years, and probably the smartest person I’ve ever worked with can be very difficult. The dynamic of the team from when i got there was this guy basically knows everything and everyone goes to him for questions. He is very smart but what makes him difficult is he can get pretty stern and combatitive the way my manager puts it he has a vision and expects others to follow it and when they dont he gets annoyed. He is very my way or the highway even for little things. He does give credit where credit is due but when he’a annoyed he will speak in a stern voice, the company promotes a non screaming culture so i can tell he is really holding it in. But when he cant he will make passive aggressive comments. 

Like one time i was presenting my screen in a latge document with many paragraphs and he made a comment about one of the paragraphs. I couldnt see the paragraph he was referring to so i asked where the paragraph was and his response was, “on your screen”. I mentioned something like this to my mentor and i could tell my mentor has had runins similsr to this with him as well. 

Even without this guy ive been debating how long i want to stay. His difficulty feels like icing on the cake for me. Im not sure if this is just a rough patch so im not giving up but ill admit ive refreshed my resume recently. If i do decide to stick it outnfor years i know im going to have to learn how to work with this guy. He is basically at the center of alot of things in this project so avoiding him is almost impossible and i do understand its part of life to work with difficult people. He’s not the first difficult person ive worked with, just the first ive had issues getting on the same page with (i think remote has something to do with it).

1bw4k7q,New job wants a Manager reference ,"So my new job wants a Manager reference, after offering me a job 

A little background, because my resume is a bit of a lie. After a motorcycle accident I was unable to return to my physical labour job at a warehouse. After a year off and not recovering, I started applying to new jobs, mostly desk jobs as my back is fucked. For 6 months, crickets.

I was called into work for light duties for 3 months, making phone call and doing customer service work, before being put back on LTD. 

After more crickets in the job market, I started fibbing, saying I was doing customer service work for a year after my accident, and it worked. Many job interviews and now a good offer in entry level sales. 

They want a manager reference after the offer was made, and another coworker reference. The problem is I would not feel comfortable using my manager, as he is a two faced dick who has definitely given bad references before, and now that I’m lying about my experience, cannot use him so I’m not sure what to do.

-tell my new employer management doesn’t allowed being used at a reference? 

-have a coworker pretend to be manager? 

I have no idea how to Navigate this road bump, and advice is appreciated

1bw3xi7,What is Leadership? Women in Leadership tips,"https://getmorecustomers9.wordpress.com/
I wanted to share this particular blog article on career building❤️
What is Leadership? And why are women so good at certain aspects of it, yet struggle to excel at others?

Question: What women leader has impressed you throughout your career and why?  What recommendations do you have to help women leaders be more effective?

In my view, Leadership is a catch all for what it takes to be just human enough to be liked and just divine/mysterious enough to be revered.  If a camera followed your most respected leader 24/7, you would lose most of the reverence because of all the base mundane activities all humans partake in.  On the contrary, to have no access to that leader, you will lose a human connection completely.  Ever heard a group of staff members saying a leader is Out Of Touch?  They have focused too much energy on being revered vs sharing humanity and allowing themselves to be liked.

Women Leaders are fighting 2 battles, to combat the imagery and expectations that historical male leaders have emblazoned in the mind of corporate America and to blaze a new unique path instilled with very feminine energy.  To add to the conundrum, within the modern day woman's femininity there are aspects of masculinity, a clearly defined pathway for women leaders is more of a zigzag maze.  In practice, the day to day of being a woman leader feels like a hodgepodge mishmash of both traditional and cutting edge.

For example,
Women are more apt to hug versus shaking hands.
Tradition calls for a firm masculine handshake amongst leaders
Cutting Edge Practices are to base the type of contact on how well you know the Individual and what you are trying to convey
Whereas a male may be more comfortable taking off for vacation and knowing the work will still be there, women fear loss of their leadership via an easy subterfuge by a male or female leader when absent.
Tradition dictates that leaders must take time off to refuel and also allow their absence to be felt by the staff and encourage self direction and inner-team leadership growth.
Cutting Edge Practices are to stay in tune with the political climate of the company and individual department and be ready to adjust schedules as needed.  There may be an Implementation or Merger, etc that requires a leader's time.
Men are expected to have family support at home and for leadership to be his most ardent focus, women are expected to talk about their family but don't burden the staff with too many details, being that she is carrying a lot of family responsibility aside.
Tradition calls for men to have wives and children or if unmarried not to be responsible for the day to day of caring for children.
Cutting Edge Practices are still slowly being integrated into corporate America.  But, onsite daycare and extended maternity leave are a big help for women leaders.  
Thus, effective women leaders use a hodgepodge and do what works.  The beauty of great women leaders is being able to make a casserole (hodgepodge) taste like filet mignon to the staff, coworkers, and superiors.  How?
Back to the examples given above,
Greeting Contact Type- Great women leaders know that every opportunity for human contact is a chance to demonstrate concern, even for someone you're not a fan of.  Women can shake a hand, hug, smile or whatever she wishes in that moment and push feminine energy towards someone leaving an indelible impression.  It's hodgepodge and not clearly defined, but it's so filled with an energy that you forget the rules of etiquette and enjoy being in the presence of a great woman leader.
Out Of Office- Ever get an email from a woman leader as she is on vacation demonstrating concern for how your work tasks are progressing and seeing if there is anything she can do? Do you recall caring about if a male leader does the same or not? Are you so taken by her even THINKING of you that you are motivated and energized?
Family and Leadership- Women leaders have made it popular for men to feel safe to share their family life at work, this is one of the best aspects of being a woman leader.  She makes it okay not to have to check humanity at the door along with hanging up your coat.  Great women leaders take all of your personal baggage, bring their own, and create memorable moments throughout the work day for male and females alike.

Where women struggle is knowing when and more importantly HOW to shut off innate compassion and empathy and transition into Yes/No mode.
That is where Male Leaders succeed due to a nature-based predisposition to be a provider for the family.  In prehistoric times, if there was just 1 animal to be hunted, a man had to fight to get it or die.  Kill or be killed.
It is a very unnatural feeling for a woman to get to the point of transitioning into a Kill or be killed mode.
No matter how many books read or seminars attended, it is not within a woman's core nature to Dust The Floor with anyone that is a competitor, every day, all the time.  To do so causes a major change to her innate composition and breeds health and life issues - speedily, and causes her staff/co workers/superiors to both Fear and Hate her.  A human anomaly of this magnitude is not well suited for a shared corporate environment.  She may do best in entrepreneurship, but then she will have what she needs to safely transition back to her core feminine self- secure in knowing she doesn't always have to Kill or Be Killed, she can manage her own company as she wishes.

So, what are women leaders to do if their Male counterparts are in Kill or Be Killed mode? Create strategies such as below.
Hold male leaders accountable, they have a social responsibility to allow enough of a professional environment to allow women to thrive.  Escalate to their superiors for behavior that is mean spirited and ruthless.  You cannot make yourself into a caveman, so they may not be allowed to act like a caveman in a work setting.
Defuse and Confuse- this is a woman's specialty.  Using terms like 'Okay, let's settle down', 'Share the floor, everyone gets a turn' gets men to transition from Go Mode to Thinking Mode.  Mainly because they will have no idea what you're talking about.  Men in Go mode are blissfully blind to how others perceive them.  They are in ‘The Hunter’ mode.  
Learn some sports positioning, particularly how to Punt.  [This is a football term defined as the act of kicking the ball in a similar manner to a drop-kick, except a punt occurs before the ball hits the ground. The punter catches the ball and drops it towards their foot in order to kick it down the field to the other team.]  Smile, ease the ball out of his hand, and get ready to punt it.  It won't be his turn anymore and he will have to wait his turn.  Say, 'I've got the ball, I'm going to punt it'.  He cannot begin an offensive until you punt.  By then, have your defensive strategy and team in place.
Cajole Him with coffee, treats, or volunteer to do some work assigned to his team.
This list is Hodgepodge and endless, and what it takes to be a successful woman leader.

Then, after earning a spot at the top, keep it by continuing to do what it took to get there knowing that YOU deserve it and YOU are worth it (Getting superiors to give you the title and associated salary increase for what you actually do, is a separate subject and a particularly difficult challenge of its own).  The greatest women leaders have found the right hodgepodge that works for them, and make it look seamless.

I (24M) am a survivor of the Club Q mass shooting - it happened on my birthday, I was a performer in the show, it was my home bar, and my soon to be fiancé was killed that night. Lots of loss. Lots of things to deal with as a 23yo in a nightclub…

Since then, I’ve dedicated my time and work to community organizing, creating safe spaces, and working on legislation to keep my communities safer… it’s been amazing work. I’ve seen so many beautiful faces become inspired, held so many young trans kids close- it’s life changing, don’t get me wrong… it’s been wonderful for me….life changing! And it’s created so many wonderful opportunities for me to show up, grow, make friends… It just hasn’t payed.

The last year and a half, I’ve worked in spaces that should pay me close to $8k, but I’ve never seen it. My savings are disappearing on living costs, and I am worrying about how I’ll pay my rent soon, as this Drag Queen Life™️ (which was paying my bills successfully before the mass shooting) is not lucrative anymore.

On top of the financial drag {pardon the pun}, I’ve lost passion all but completely for the craft. It was my passion for my whole life almost, but the joy in it has faded exponentially this past year since loosing my partner. Drag was my everything, It’s what I’ve poured money, time and dedication into for 11 years, it’s been a full time career for nearly 6 - I don’t have any other “skills” for the workforce, necessarily (lip-syncing isn’t super hireable, lol), so here I am…….

      Lost.

1bw1efl,Growing pains in role on a difficult project?,"I’ve been at the same job 2 years post graduation. My job is project based and the project I’m on now is a challenge. It’s taking a toll on me and my mental health. 

Description:

* 40 person team, my work stream is 5 people. 
* My work steam's work requires input from the other work streams.
* Work is in an area I have some familiarity with, but am not stellar at and do not love. 
* Project is constantly changing, quick turnaround items with pressure from leadership come up.

Current Challenges:

* Coordination with other work streams and a large team:
   * In the past, I’ve only worked on smaller projects without dependencies from other work streams. Mid-level managers channeled the information I’ve needed to me or set up that process. They've always led meetings and helped put guardrails in place for what has needed to be done to complete our work. I've always only coordinated with my direct manager. 
   * On this project, I’m moving up into a higher role. Every task I’ve been given has been ambiguous and required input from senior leaders across the project. I’ve never worked in an environment like this, and I’ve never been the one to take the steps we need to get information. It may sound stupid, but as the most junior one on the team, I've always felt like I shouldn't be the one to set up meetings, send messages to leadership asking for information, etc. I really don't even know where to start here or the etiquette for this. We need a lot of information to do our work. Because of my hesitations with how to get information, I end up working with what I know and it's far off from what we need. On several occasions, our main main manager has had to send our work to the broader team at the last minute for sign off and it's been a mess. I really want to do what I can to fix this, but I don't know how or the etiquette. 
* Working with new team members on my work stream:
   * I’ve been on this project for a few months. We recently got a few new team members. One new team member is my level (so they aren't a manager by level), but they seem to be positioning  themself as a manager. I'm used to working directly with managers at this point so it feels weird to have someone who is technically at my level giving me direction/instruction. They've done a few things that have been off putting/even insulting like ask me for status updates on work they weren't even working with me on, ask me to send them meeting notes, etc. 

I am very concerned about my performance on this project. In the past and on other projects, I have done well but I feel like I am screwing this one up left and right. I have always been available, even on weekends, at midnight. I am trying so hard but I know my approach is just wrong. There are underlying problems I have on not knowing what to do to communicate with our broader team and not confirming things with my manager that I need to figure out how to fix. 

I used to be really happy, always approach these situations with a can-do attitude and I've done a 180 on this project. I am lost on how to fix any of this and approach my manager.

1bw15i0,Is it expected to have a 2 year gap in your resume while doing an MBA?,"Hi!

I'm currently 26 years old, been working in the Oil & Gas/Procurement industry for the last 5 years, I hold a BBA degree. I've been in three different positions, but even when my performance assessments were great (ranked among the top performers), I haven't been rewarded enough and started to feel stuck in low skill positions. I believe that to achieve a management position I'd require an MBA. 

My company offers great funding (almost 90%)  in local private institutions. But I'm from a 3rd world country and the few universities offering MBAs aren't that great, their rank is low or unknown. 

So I was thinking of moving abroad to pursue the degree in Japan with a scholarship, since they allow you to apply in good business universities like Keio or Waseda.  However, I don't think I could spend my time working full-time and at the same time attend the uni. Is this normal? Or I'm throwing away my career, leaving my job for this degree that might not guarantee any success?

I know Japanese MBAs are no game changer, and that I should go a USA top school if I want to have a nice resume. But I don't have near the 10% of funding to afford a career in the US or EU schools.

Thanks for reading and I'm hoping you can help me with your own experience on this. I feel lost and not sure what to do. ",0III,1,1.0,0,1712269940,2024-04-04 22:32:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bw15i0/is_it_expected_to_have_a_2_year_gap_in_your/,4,2024
1bw0v9u,"I took an executive job and six months in, it isn't for me ","Hi all! Long story short i have been a pretty high performer most of my career. I took an executive level job six months ago. Me and my family moved cities after deciding we wanted to be closer to family and live in a more affordable place. Took a job with some great benefits (some others not so great) and under the idea that the company was on its way to making all of these progressive changes, which suited me great. We get here and the company is way in need of an overhaul - the culture is horrendous and they are bleeding people out because of it. They have also put me in a lot of weird positions where I am asked to make decisions that are later on not backed up (despite multiple conversations). In a recent evaluation I found that my direct reports and colleagues think i am amazing, and just what the company needs. My boss seems to feel ""meh"" about me, despite giving me permanency (after 6 months probation) and I just spend my days helping my direct reports navigate a horrible culture more than doing actual executive work. In addition, we have found the city not to be for us. The political environment is super polarized, me and my husband have been treated so poorly (being racialized people) and we know this is not where we want to live. I have been putting my resume out there and i am getting a few calls. I have no concerns explaining that the city isn't for us and such. Just can't help feeling guilty that this happened in the first place...

1bw0f79,Career Recommendations for an Unfulfilled Software Engineer?,"TL/DR: engineering doesn’t feel right. Should I switch to a different career, maybe even something alternative but creative like an artist?

I am in my mid twenties and am working my first “real job” out of college where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I have had many prior technical internships.

On paper this should be my dream job, but after over a year of working, I am feeling quite unhappy about my career choices in general. I don’t have a good relationship with my coworkers (I work in a separate location from them anyway, so I never see them), I don’t like my project anymore (it is boring, I spend all day at my desk alone, I dread using hardware or debugging issues because it stresses me out and I don’t find it fun, and the technology and processes we use feel outdated but can’t be changed right now).

I feel like I’m missing out on the world. This job has benefits and good pay, but everyday is unfulfilling, boring and many are stressful. I’m really wondering if engineering is even right for me at this point, because I’m not very passionate about the technology and I want to get out and make experiences or find a passion.

What seems way better would be a career that lets me get out into the world and create something I want to. I would love if I could turn my hobbies into a career - music, or photography, or art, or something but really I’m not good enough at any of them to make it right now. I’ve considered something like UX design as a compromise, but I have no experience, and I’m honestly worried about AI taking over that field.

Any suggestions, advice, or commiseration would be helpful. Thank you.",perplexed_jam,1,0.6700000166893005,9,1712268189,2024-04-04 22:03:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bw0f79/career_recommendations_for_an_unfulfilled/,4,2024
1bw0bgi,I want to get out of operations but don't think I'm qualified for any job listing I see. ,"I work as a supervisor in natural gas operations and have worked at the same company for 9 years since interning for them in college. I have come to the realization that I no longer want to work directly in operations due to high stress and unpredictable (though rare) work days. 

I have tried to look at other roles within my company but the engineering or analyst roles I could get are 20-30k pay cuts. I feel like I'm too early in my career for a significant pay cut. 

I look at job listings online and feel like I don't qualify for all the specific experience they are asking for and a lot of the pay scales seem to be significantly lower than what I make now. 

As of right now I have 27 direct reports and service 6 counties totaling to 70k customers. I am also in a rotational on call schedule for after hours emergency for half the state, and am on the hook for any emergency that occurs during the day in my area that may not be resolved until late night or possibly even the next morning. Though it's rare to happen it can still be stressful because you never know when it's going to happen. I feel like I am always on edge. 

At this point I have been looking into engineering, analyst, and scheduling roles but I don't feel like I have relevant experience for any of these roles.

It just feels like I'm the only person I know with such a demanding job and even though I'm paid well (100k) I don't think it's enough for the amount of responsibility. Especially when I know people with the same degree as me making more money with less stressful jobs. 

Anybody have any advice on a possible career path I could look into? Any remote roles since I live somewhere without a lot of job opportunities in general? Any advice would really be helpful!

I just dont really know where to start. Ive been looking online and some resources say to get a bachelors in psychology while others say it may be possible to go straight to a masters in psychology with a undergrad in something else such as exercise science.

1bvy8r9,Thought on a fair salary ,"I've been with my current company for close to 8 years. They're an electric distribution equipment manufacturer in the southeastern US. When I started I was a field installer, worked my way to managing field operations and now I've been moved into a training role. My main role is to travel to train utility workers how to install, operate, and troubleshoot our equipment. 
I also travel to 3-4 shows per year and teach classes on electric distribution. 

When I'm in office, I assist with support calls, assist salesmen with their customers questions, assist with sales demo's, and do lab testing of unreleased equipment and software updates to find bugs and issues. 

I believe my current salary is too low for the amount of tasks I handle day to day. Especially traveling 1-2 weeks per month, sometimes internationally as well. 

Our CEO is the live or die by the numbers type. So on a spreadsheet he sees my salary going out, and not much coming in directly from me. We charge a daily rate for training but it's essentially a break even amount. 
Now, in the real world, assisting our sales team with customer questions and demo's I have had a hand in quite a few sales. I've taken several trips specifically to find out how to make our equipment work for a customer. Once I figured it out they purchased our equipment. 
The commission and credit for the sales from those trips as well as the demo's I've done have gone only to the salesman, while I get a hearty thumbs up.

So with the duties and information, what would you think would be acceptable so I can compare with what I'm actually making?

1bvy6no,What should I choose?,"Hi there,   
  
I am writing this post to ask for your advice on career development.  
  
 I work in a high tech international corporation where my job is strongly linked with web development. My main responsibilities are:   
   
 \- Webpage maintenance using CMS,  
 \- Analytics using third party solutions,  
 \- Working with third party vendors to implement new solutions into our system (this includes some web development work as well as testing),   
 \- Maintaining and improving the e-commerce part of our business,  
 \- Take care of in-page search engine, reporting etc.  
  
 My work requires me to have knowledge of standard web-dev technologies: HTML, CSS, JS as well as SEO, Search Engines, CMS and general UI/UX knowledge. I have backend programming background (I started my adventure with backend working with C, Python, Django, API's management with Postman - but now I have 2 years break, so I'm out of latest trends).  In my daily tasks there is also a good amount of project management - the tasks I work on with third parties need to be driven and executed on time, and it is my responsibility to get it done. I like everything I do. I know my job very well, I try to keep up with new trends and I know that I have to keep learning to keep up. I am aware, that I have to learn new things to be competent and valuable employee.  
  
Recently I've been asked to choose areas in which I want to excel, I can choose courses I want to take, etc.   
  
**Here is my question** \- I am really struggling with choosing areas to learn. I'm thinking about (so freakin popular lately) Artificial Intelligence, but I don't know how to approach it. There are a lot of 'prompt engineering courses' but I don't really see the benefits of learning it. On the other hand, it's obvious that I won't learn it from the basics, how to write algorithms etc, as I don't even have a degree in related fields. I wonder what I can learn from AI to be able to make good use of it.  
   
**My second question** \- maybe my approach is wrong? From your experience, what would you suggest I should choose? Which way or which topics should I choose to develop myself and become a more valuable person in my field, company and whole web-dev market?   


Yes, I did asked gpt about advices but they it is a general answer which brings nothing to the topic.

1bvy54i,Is my boss trying to take credit for my work?,"Hi All,

A year or so ago I decided to take a job that most would consider a step back in my career. At the time it made sense as I was working on standing up a business, so I needed something with a lot of flexibility that I could manage without a ton of effort. 

Unfortunately the business was not successful and I'm now focusing all of my energy on my full-time gig. I enjoy the company I work for, and the work that I do, but over the past several months I've started to notice a trend in how my boss manages that has me a bit concerned. 

First, I'd like to say that my boss is a really good person. In our 1:1 interactions and conversations he treats me very much like an equal, allows me space to operate, and consistently tells me that I'm exceeding the expectations of my role. 

However, there have been numerous occasions where projects that I've been leading have gotten noticed by more senior individuals in the organization, at that point he decides to parachute in trying to put his ""stamp"" on things. Normally I wouldn't mind this, but the insight he provides isn't useful or necessary. Especially when he doesn't have any of the details on how the project has been implemented. 

In addition, I've had to fight to be able to submit work that had my name on it. Given that our leadership reviews our output quarterly, I thought it made sense that MY NAME should be on the submissions, rather than his, even though technically we're all on the same team. 

My gut tells me that he's not doing this maliciously, but he's a somewhat insecure leader and is struggling to find ways to contribute in that respect. However, it's still frustrating that I'm likely not getting the recognition I deserve for the projects that I've implemented from end to end. 

Is there anything here to be worried about? Or am I just being a little too competitive? ",Kac03032012,2,1.0,0,1712263083,2024-04-04 20:38:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bvy54i/is_my_boss_trying_to_take_credit_for_my_work/,4,2024

1bvxdwi,How to exit from a deadend-job situation,"Hi, EU here. Need some support and advice (long post sorry). 

8 yrs exp, now (1.5) in my 4th different company, working with IT (I have tech background and exp) in a financial company. 

I started working with a team, with the midterm goal of managing an IT tool. Due mostly to budget reduction, I had to do personally some activities regarding this tool, so I'm not a manager at all. The bad part is that I could get PTO or whatever only in one week per month ideally, otherwise everything could be blocked and (the few) internal customers blame on me and our service.

I started hating all of this after a few months and convinced myself to ask for a team reallocation after 1.5 years. However, starting from Dec I was reallocated in a newborn workteam for company reasons (so not my decision), leaving my prev team (and people who could help me) and having the complete knowledge and total internal effort on this.

Everyone in this new team told me to be patient, but 4 months passed: none in the company is interested in this tool as it is and CxO areas are asking unofficially to dismiss (or redo) it while I need to maintain this s**t, there's only one team using it but they are completely jeopardizing all attempts to reduce any (of my) manual effort, even though they know the end. 

I can't find any sense in my job. I feel I'm wasting my time and have no chance to have a stable career path, even though I love the company and have a good feeling with my colleagues. I tried talking with my (new) boss and telling I wanna change my internal role in the team, he appreciates my proposal but he cannot know when it could happen. Additionally, I asked for a promotion for next year, but he could only promise to include me in a promotion assessment path, and, if successful, the company will choose who to promote.

I feel totally drained and confused, my sleeping quality dropped in the last 2 months and I feel quite near to a burnout. IDK how to mention my personal feelings to my boss without appearing as fragile as I am (due to prev working Experiences, working a lot but with 0 career expectations), I would ask also for a company/group relocation in a position better fitting my experience but I have 0 courage to do it...

Or is that perfectly fine?,"Basically, I have a year of Software Development experience but my current job isn't supposed to be a Software Developer.

1bvx1pl,Subordinate on my team made some advances/comments -- should I report it to HR just in case?,"Anna (not real name) is on my team and the team (about 8 of us) went out for HH drinks earlier this week. Everyone was doing fine and Anna and I live off the same train in NYC so we planned on taking the train together. She wasn't drunk but I guess she had just one too many before the end of the night and on the train ride home we were chatting and she just mentioned she is ""very attracted"" to me said ""i know you're married but do you want to come over for a night cap at my apartment? its the next stop."" she wasnt visibility drunk or slurring her words or anything, just said it very casually too. shes a very confident woman so it wasnt really even out of character for her to be so bold in her statement. 

i was a little shocked by it but i tried to ignore the ""attractive"" part and any potential assumptions so i pretended as if she asked to go to another bar and simply said ""ah no thanks, ive had a lot to drink and its getting late, i dont think i can hit up another spot. my wife wouldnt be so happy about me being so late, i said id be home an hour ago. ""

its been two days and we haven't spoken about the incident. I have my 1 on 1 with her tomorrow and i dont know if i should bring it up or just completely sweep it under the rug and erase it from my memory. 

for context, if its helpful, anna is a great employee. super professional. very hard working. one of my best hires ever. i do not wish to harm our working relationship and i dont want her to be in trouble but i also dont want to be blamed for anything in the future and get myself in trouble. 

Should i just mention it to HR to document the situation and just from now on always leave alone from company outings to ensure this doesnt happen? will HR do some sort of investigation where we might both get into some trouble?",LogMeln,3,1.0,16,1712260592,2024-04-04 19:56:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bvx1pl/subordinate_on_my_team_made_some_advancescomments/,4,2024
1bvwwia,I think my workplace is toxic and don't know what to do... It's my first real job. Advice?,"Hi all! I (22 f) graduated college last June with a B.S. in Biology. I had a decent GPA (3.5) and a decent resume leaving college. My coursework was comprehensive, and I had a fair bit of lab experience under my belt (though I definitely suffered in the practical application sense of my lab education since we were online for just about 2 years due to the pandemic). I applied and was so thrilled when I was finally hired in October in a research tech roll for my first real job. I was very optimistic and so proud of myself, even though I worried that the skills I might've missed out on developing a bit more due to COVID would pose a challenge. I reasoned that anything I didn't know how to do I would be thrilled to learn. 

Starting work was intimidating. My boss (PI)  was particularly intimidating. It only took a few weeks to get a sense that there seemed to be a lot of friction (to put it nicely) between him and many others in the lab. As time went on I got an even better sense of why. The condescending tone and attitude that he treats others with is incredibly disheartening and discouraging. There is little to no sense of mutual respect. I know others feel the same and I am just about 6 months in now and the pressure that I feel is weighing on me terribly. It's affecting my personal life as well. I was recently put on anti anxiety medication and sent for a stress test (I've always been healthy until now). I am constantly irritable and miserable. I never thought I was the smartest person in the world, but I used to think I was at least competent, my self esteem has taken a massive hit. I have started to hate the field altogether, which I know isn't fair at all. I don't want to leave this job before I have been here a full year, because I know that doesn't look good on a resume, but I'm at my wits end here. I love the other people I work with. And I imagine I might be faring much better in developing new skills here if every single task didn't feel horrifically nerve-wracking. 

I've talked to family and friends, but I wanted to get a broader perspective and was hoping for some advice. Please be gentle (I've already been driven crazy) but honest and let me know what you think. Thanks so much!",AltruisticAddition58,2,0.75,5,1712260262,2024-04-04 19:51:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bvwwia/i_think_my_workplace_is_toxic_and_dont_know_what/,4,2024

I should make a big decision in my life. I have a permanent contract in a small company < 30 people, no possibility of career but 5% increase salary annually. Boring but stable job for now. I got an offer 3 years contract + 3 years and any futher extention indefinite. I'm now 32. Interesting job but in a team where everyone has a better contract (band1) and myself i would have the maximum contract of the ranking below my peers (let's say band2). I wouldnt be able to go from band 2 to band1 unless someone leaves and I would win a campaign (it's a public eu institution).

1bvwjmd,Going back on a job offer acceptance?,"I've been interviewing with 2 firms, and they both basically had told me I'd get an offer. The one I preferred a little less offered me first. I tried to give the one I preferred a notice and give them time, but after days of waiting I got uncomfortable and felt as though I had to accept the offer I had on the table before it was pulled/given to someone else. 

This other company that I originally preferred still claims I will get the offer sometime today or tomorrow. Let's say that's true and the offer is better than the one I originally took. 

Should I just.... email back to the firm who I originally agreed to join and apologize and go back on my acceptance? Idk, I'm a little worried about the unknown. Like, contacting references I gave them and damaging reputation, or if they find out who I signed with and reach out to them or something (both are in the same town).

1bvuu5l,Repost because I haven't received answers :(,"How do I find my path?

I'm 21 in my 3rd year of uni, studying a 3 yrs bachelor in business management.
I've always liked the corporate world but I know a lot of careers in it are about IT, finance, accounting... and other technical skills.

I know I will incorrectly sound as a lazy person saying this but I don't really like to dive into details, also because I'm not good at it, if I work at something I cannot avoid looking at the big picture, I like a lot more thinking at the whole of something, could be a project or a company.

This is why, while studying, I'm also trying to launch some projects I have in mind, but obviously I have to face that doing startup has a high probability of failure, so for this reason and also for personal growth I decided to go mainly for a career in my first working years.

I'm not a dev but I studied a bit of IT both in high school and uni, I would never be able develop a software all by myself but I know basic/intermediate stuff and I know how to ""talk"" to people in IT.

Because of this I thought these careers (in IT or not): 
- Project management
- Consulting
- Maybe even sales also if I think there's less entry barriers so more competition but I could be wrong.

I'm Italian, and I know my english is not excellent now (maybe a high B2/C1) because I haven't trained it for years but I would consider also moving in us/uk/any other country where I can speak english and get some work experience.

Sure thing I'd love to work on something I like but obviously also money is a factor so with all of this said:

1. What master's degree would you recommend?

2. Do you think a career in IT can be pursued without having to be a engineer/knowing how to code?

3. What are some other careers I could take a look into?

4. If you know the Italian job market, should I consider moving or not? And why?

5. Any other tips you have for me?",BestRow3647,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1712255650,2024-04-04 18:34:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bvuu5l/repost_because_i_havent_received_answers/,4,2024

I am being offered a small promotion that will still leave me underpaid and under titled.  The HR process is for me to acknowledge a new job description and salary to make the promotion official. The job description leaves out a bunch of the work that I do. I’m sure the org expects me to continue doing that work despite leaving it out of my JD. My bosses aren’t acknowledging my point about being expected to do work outside the JD, and they are very unlikely to budge. Collegiality and being easy going are really valued at my org.

Recently, I finally got out of my funk of losing that job, but dont really know what to do next.

1bvszog,Should I go back to school? And how do you juggle school and a full-time job?,"IDK if this is the right subreddit to ask this on, but would love anyone's thoughts and opinions. Let me start with some background:

I'm 22 years old, and a college dropout (sort of). Basically, I graduated HS/started college in 2020 (a truly terrible year to make this transition). After 2 years of working towards a bachelor's degree, I dropped out because I couldn't keep my grades up. I really am an intelligent person, I just couldn't put in the effort at the time, and it was causing more harm to my mental and physical health than seemed worth it at the time. So for my 3rd year, I transferred to a community college and earned an Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts. I'm coming up on a year since graduating, and I'm starting to consider going back to school (maybe enrolling not this upcoming fall but next).

I think if I go back to school, I would want to get a business degree, but I'm not sure what concentration (open to any and all suggestions). What does it realistically look like to go back to school with an associate's degree under your belt, but a full-time workload o attend to as well? Online degrees? Is this something I could knock out in 2 years or is it going to take me closer to 5? Also, financially, I don't think I could dish out full college tuition with my income, so what could that look like?

Right now, I have a couple of income streams, but my main gig is as a personal assistant to a travel agent. I do a lot of admin work and run errands for her (essentially, if there's a task she needs to do but doesn't have time for, she gets me to do it), and I honestly love it! In total, I'm working about 30-40 hours a week (sometimes more, but rarely), but making guaranteed pay for 42 hours/week at $20/hour.

1bvswjl,How do I leave without feeling bad? ,"My company is bad. It's a small 100 employees family business run by 3rd generation. The directors (cousins) are... Incompetent and literally running their company to the ground. Bad management, no management, toxic working environment, no possible career evolution, everyone's complaining and wondering when the company will shut down. 
So I put myself back onto the job market and I was just recently offered a job (slightly higher pay, better city, better career future and so on). I think I'm going to accept it, but the problem is, the work I have now is quite relax. Due to bad management and everyone actually not caring if the company is not doing well at all including my manager, no one keeps track of anyone. My work is really very relax. I'm able to deal with the company owner in a way that he leaves me alone and actually have faith in me and they are relying on me a lot (for things in and out of my job scope which I stated clearly a few times that I am not hired for the certain tasks they give me). 
If I leave, I can foresee my manager hating me for it (since all my task would fall back on him), the company's owner will hate me bcz I would have ""betrayed his trust"" and my colleagues will hate me out of jealousy and also bcz I might jeopardise their leave (we are absolutely not in the same department but our manager is fixated having us rotate even though I don't do their job at all).

1bvsuzi,Make more money or job I enjoy more? ,"At a bit of a crossroads in my medical career. Obviously only I can decide for myself, but need some advice from people with life and career experience.

I got into a graduate program recently that starts in August.
 Pros of this career:
 It’s 2 years long and then I’ll be starting at about $100k. It’s pretty autonomous and can be flexible. You can either work 9-5 typical schedule, opportunity for some remote work if I were to choose, but also allows for working less longer shifts (ex. 4 10s, 3 12s, etc). Can switch between specialties and have lots of decision making powers. I already got accepted so no more applying for school. Salary can get up to about $170-200k depending on what you do with it. 

  Cons of this choice: 
Pretty high stress, need to be on point at all times pretty much. The majority of it is talking to people which might end up getting to me. Has pretty high risk of burnout. Not much room for moving up/different positions. 

Pros of second choice: 
Get to do more hands on work, in a lab so not interacting with patients (but still get interaction with people bc everyone works in the lab). Think I’d be able to reduce a good amount of stress working this position. School is cheaper by about $20k give or take, only 2 years as well. Has a lot of teaching opportunities which I’m interested in. Can get involved in leadership/management. Opportunities for research which is interesting to me. 

Cons of second choice: 
Make less money (80k starting, salary caps out around $120k). Less job availability (might have to move out of state for awhile). Schedule is more strict (typically either have morning or afternoon shift, but no overnights. Usually no weekends). Can’t ever work from home bc of hands on it is. Less autonomy. 


The second is something that seems more up my alley but concerned about having to re-apply to schools, having to find a job, not making enough money, etc. 

I’m already on track for the first but am worried I might end up hating my life. I can always choose a less stressful specialty but then might not feel super fulfilled.

1bvs1go,Does anyone else vehemently refuse salaried positions? What conditions would you consider salary and loss of WFH?,"My first experience with salary conversion was a nightmare. They lied and said I might work more or less but it should all even out. Once I converted I was working nothing but 10-12 hour days, I re-calculated my wages for the time I was spending and it was not even competitive. I never considered another salaried position again.

&#x200B;

I make a comfortable living at an hourly job, I rent an apt, own my car. I have some savings/investments from a prior condo sale, enough for a down payment on a small condo if I should want to stay in the area and buy again.

An opportunity came up at work which I may have some qualifications for, know and work with the team, and currently help them out already so I have a pretty good ""in"". It's 40-50k more/year than what I make now, and I'd have to start coming physically in to work to be near the new team if I needed to bounce stuff off them.

I'm not really much of a material person, the extra money would be nice, it would definitely help my retirement, a home purchase, and replacement of my older car. But not if I have to sacrafice my free time or overwork myself etc. 

Is the commute and the extra money worth it? Plus the salary conversion, I'd be on call (I'm not on call currently). It would at least get me out of the team I'm in now which micromanages a lot and throw me into something which was a super interesting challenge.",EmotionalDmpsterFire,0,0.5,10,1712249128,2024-04-04 16:45:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bvs1go/does_anyone_else_vehemently_refuse_salaried/,4,2024

1bvqv6t,"Should I accept? I'm in crisis, please help","Hi! I recently got accepted into the European University Institute's MA in Transnational Governance and I don't know what to do. I am very happy about being selected --although I did not receive a scholarship :( --, but I am very afraid of a big change like this one.

First of all, **let me give you some context as to why I'm hesitating**:  
I'm a 25 yo woman from Argentina working remotely for a US non-profit. I hold a BA in Political Science and Government. I also hold both the Argentinian and the Spanish citizenship.  
Last year I got tired of working 100% remotely (I hated it and I was also fed up with my boss), so I decided to start a Master's Degree in Public Policy at my Alma Mater just to change something in my life and gain some professional skills, although at that time I had already been thinking for a long time about studying abroad.  
The professors and the subjects of my MPP were the same as in my bachelor's degree, so I was very upset and bored. That's when I gained courage and decided that something was going to change in my life in 2024.  
I started talking to people I had professional relationships with, I applied for several jobs, had interviews AND I also applied for several masters abroad.  
To my surprise, a month ago a former professor called me to offer me a part-time job rather linked to behavioral sciences, an area that I have been learning about lately and I am very interested in. At the time, I was still waiting to hear from the universities abroad.  
I took the job, but without letting go my previous work (which also has a lot to do with behavioral science applied to social programs, more than political science). I also started the second year of my MPP and found out that the second year subjects were much more interesting and useful than the first year subjects. In fact, there are a few first year subjects that I skipped this year cause I was bored with the topics... Instead, I signed up for courses I was very interested in: a data science course and a public policy-oriented behavioral science course. Now I am looking at my MPP with better eyes.  
A few days ago, I received the news I was accepted at EUI and now I am so conflicted. I want to go, but these are the things that are holding me back:  
I feel very guilty about making my parents pay a tuition of more than 20k euros. In Argentina, my entire MPP is only 3k. However, both of my parents support me in this decision and think this is the right choice seeing how bad my country is right now.  
I am afraid of sacrificing career opportunities by making this change. By choosing to move to Italy, I don't know if I would be able to keep my main job, which is my main source of income and which allows me to mantain myself without help.  
The new job. I haven't been given much to do yet, but it looks like an exciting opportunity. They are going to organize a congress related to the study topic and it would be a pity not to be able to attend if I'm in Italy.  
Anyway, my new boss was very was sympathetic about studying abroad and said to me I would be able to keep my job working remotely. But I won't be paid enough for Italy standards.  
Somehow I got half a master's degree done. Even though I was not very excited about it, in June it will be a year since I started my MPP. Perhaps I should just finish it.  
I can finish my master in 2 years or gain a Graduate Certificate in Public Policy by doing only 1 year.  
I can also finish my master remotely. Most classes are online (thing I hate, but ok).  
Should I be more knowledgeable about public policy and international affairs? I am not sure. Six months ago I thought differently, but when I started to get so deep into behavioral science I began to wonder if I shouldn't be studying something different to political science/public policy.  
My dog. I don't feel like anyone in my family is going to take care of her as well as I do.  
My best friend is about to return to Argentina after 2 years abroad. I really miss him and he is the person who first motivated me to study abroad.  
As you may have noticed, I have a million reasons why I'm hesitating about starting this master. However, this is something I truly desired at one point and now I have the chance I'm afraid of later regret it if I don't do it. In addition, as a wise friend said to me, probably I will end up in the same point in life - some adventure just makes the journey a bit longer.  
Among other things, I think a challenge like this will help me grow up. Until recently, I always had things resolved for me (housing, food, education, etc). My sister and my mother believe this experience is going to help me get out of my shell.  
Lastly, I am a big Italy lover... I first visited Florence when I was 15 yo. I completely felt in love with the city and promise myself to live for a short time of period in the country. Now, it is the perfect time -- Life and ambitions change over time, but somehow I have been preparing for this opportunity. For the past 5 years I have been learning Italian. This experience would be a nice treat for my younger self.

1bvqjqe,When You Have No Work To Do,"I am in a technology project-based leadership role. Not that long ago, like earlier this year, I was so stretched to get my work done that I was working long hours, renegotiating timelines, etc.  

Then: the organization I work for started to signal that they needed to look for cost-savings opportunities. And by that they meant stopping or canceling or postponing projects.  And ultimately two of the projects on my plate ended. 

I saw my work dwindling to almost nothing. Then the person to whom I report resigned and is going to a competing organization. I met with his boss to offer myself up to take on some work in his absence; she'd already found other arrangements.  And there are days when I literally have NOTHING to do. If there is a colleague or direct report away I will cover for them leading meetings and work but otherwise... nothing. 

Just a bit of context. I am almost 60. I've been with this particular employer almost 17 years. I have excellent pension (yes a company pension) and benefits with them. 

So the dilemma: If I start looking elsewhere I have a lot of experience and up to date skills (certifications etc.) but I'm also not young and it is not easy getting work at my age. Agism is absolutely a thing.  

Also, leaving would be nuts. I'd actually be okay if they laid me off/let me go. Because at my age with my years of service I'd get a very good severance package.  

But I'm bored as heck....

Any words of wisdom or experience?

1bvpjcf,"Ex boss who made me quit my job, wants a favor now","I know this should be obvious, and maybe it is, but the circumstances feel complicated.

I've worked at the same place for five years. I had two bosses, one in the finance department and another one I was assistant to. The second boss (lets call her Sue), flipped a switch on me and screwed me over. She then started acting cold and overly demanding for months until I attempted to resign from half my job but was told I wasn't allowed and basically given the ultimatum- keep working with Sue, who I used to be close with but has crossed a massive line with me or quit your job. 

Well, I quit decided to quit. In my last two weeks Sue was cutting off my access to documents and email in a beautiful display of immaturity. However, my other boss, who really stuck up for me, offered me contract pay to do some of the work I would have done but at a higher rate. 

Two days ago as I'm working on this project, and I have an email from Sue (with her big boss on CC) asking for some documents I had created for her. I should NOT have responded, this woman sucks (literally everyone at the company knew why I quit without me saying anything). But I couldn't help it because I know she can't be wrong, so I pointed out that I already gave her those things and to look in the google drive I can no longer access or to redo the documents herself.

Jump to today, another email, with more reasons why she needs me to send it to her (I know it's because I make everything look nice, she doesn't need me to get this). Quite frankly, I don't want to spend the time looking for it. It could take 2 seconds or 30 minutes, I'm just appalled she even reached out.

Question - I'm not trying to start a fire but it's also really tempting to tell her to fuck off. I'd love to say something to the effect of 'I don't have access to half of my drive, so if I already left it for you I don't know. I think it's also incredibly disrespectful to reach out to me about this. You have what you need to complete the task, there's no reason to be contacting me asking for favors.' But the adult in me is just like either send it or ignore her.

1bvnihz,Going from UX design to Front-end development with no CS degree. Good idea?,"Hi all, I'm currently working my first job out of uni (UX design masters) as a design system designer. I quite like it as it's bridging the gap between design and development, but obviously there's a very small pond of jobs since it's a very niche field. I'd love to have a more generalistic approach in the beginning of my career in order to keep more doors open instead of focusing on such a specific role. I talked to my manager about it and have been offered to switch and focus on product design, or give front-end development a try. 

Now, I've been thinking about front-end for quite a few months. I enjoy the idea of a more technical role, and it's still pretty tightly knit to design. I don't have any education in it, but I have been actively working with HTML, CSS and JS in my current position. I'm doing web development courses on the side but there's obviously many, MANY gaps in my knowledge and understanding. And it is a good opportunity if I want to change my career trajectory.

On the other hand, I feel pretty comfortable with staying in design, as I'm familiar with the work. It would be an easier shift, and I'd still get the experience needed to then be able to find the next job with a reasonable amount of effort, but I'd be making my career in design a bit more set.

I'm not sure what I should be basing my decision on. Obviously salary is a big part of it, and as a developer I'd have better job opportunities as well as higher salaries, but I'm not too confident if I'd be able to do it. On the other hand I'm not too excited about staying in design, but I've never given product design a try and maybe I'd love it.

1bvn4mr,What careers can I try to get into with customer service experience and a BA in Communications?,"I am 31F. I have worked in corporate customer service and supply chain.

I was a customer service rep for an auto industry manufacturer, where I processed orders for auto service equipment, created and managed service calls, conducted survey calls, freight quotes, credits returns. 

Then I worked as a global planning support specialist in the agriculture industry. We had a client company and we did their operation process and stock transport orders using SAP. I tracked the progress in excel and made reports.

Now I am a customer operations coordinator for a chemical manufacturer. I want to leave the company because my morals do not align and they famously run too lean and it’s too much. I make 52k now. I process orders etc. using JDE.

I NEED more income. I have 22k in student loans and 3k in credit cards and no savings. 

I have considered sales, supply chain, marketing, project management, business analysis… I don’t know what to do!!!

1bvmzfa,Im a chef and i want to change careers. Need advice! ,"Like the title says, im M28 Working 9 years as a chef and need a change. I started hating my job a while ago  but that's the only thing I've got to make money. Recently i had an opportunity to move to Switzerland for a chef job and i did. (i only speak English) Life is kinda better pay is ok if you don't go out a lot. Still the kitchen life just doesn't look attractive anymore. I hate long working hours. Im working 10.5 hour shifts with 1.5 hour break. So, total 12 hours away from my freedom with minimum wage and destroying my body so that someone makes a crazy amount of money on my back. I thought of sucking it up and opening my own business but i don't know if i can wait that long to gather some money. I don't wanna burn out again, like i did in the past. I've thought to change to IT. I enjoy learning about cybersecurity and I've seen that it pays good. I never was the best student and i never got all straight A's and that makes me think if i can manage to study because im not used to it. Mostly my life was work, home, friends, repeat. Im open to do something else apart from cybersecurity and i don't know what but im desperate to change careers. It has to be before im 30 so i have some time to progress the whole situation.

1bvm103,Rejected an offer for law school,"Hi. I honestly don't know what's the point of posting this here when this all happened in the past and I can no longer change anything. Ig, I just need to share this all out since I got no one else to share this with irl.

So last year, I resigned from my job of 4 years because my boss and I don't really work well together. Leaving him was an easy decision, but deciding what's next was really hard.

I got hired in a full remote role, which is a first for me. I thought it will be easy even if I won't have F2F interactions with colleagues. But three months in, I felt terribly bored and unproductive. So, I applied for another job which is on a hybrid set up. The role is for a managerial position, and I got accepted. It will be my first stint as a people leader. My field isn't really that available where I live, its not in demand because its very niche, so getting this offer was my last chance to have a stable career at a large listed company. I remember praying to God to give me this and I almost cried because I know this will be my last chance. However, I declined the offer because


1. I felt like I am not ready to become a manager yet despite my 9 YOE. 

2. It will require me to go to the office, once a week and traffic is reaaaaaally bad in my city rn

3. My parents have been pushing me to go to law school. They said I am not fit for the corporate world so much better if I try law instead.

4. I got close to someone online during this time so the boredom in wfh was lessened, thus eliminating the immediate need for social interactions elsewhere.

Now, I deeply regretted this decision. I'm not sure if I can make it in law school. I'm not young anymore and tbh, no longer as bright as before. Plus, I'm very bored again in my wfh job and I feel isolated. I go to the gym or run every evening but still, I feel very lost. I try to be positive but I am very scared.

Is the course worth it? Will anyone even care that I have it to employ me? It’s hard to find accurate information on what career I could have.

I think I am at a turning point in my career. I have studied electrical engineering, but ever since worked in the marketing field of consumer electronic companies (f.e. Samsung).

A few years ago I decided to make a master's degree in marketing.

Now after several years, I want to go more into tech as I think my strengths are more towards the technical aspect than the financial. I am very good at data analytics, communication, online marketing, branding, web programming, etc. (As a side hustle, I am also helping local businesses to improve their digital marketing)

The obvious thing for me to continue my career path would be digital marketing or software engineering focusing on web technologies. With my academic background in electrical engineering, I would also be interested in joining the marketing or sales department for smart home technologies or building technology products.

What do you think?

It was never a good fit for me--I'm not particularly creative, I don't use social media or keep up with trends, and I'm not keen on talking to many people at a time. Most of all, I hate that my success hinges on how others perceive my work and me as a person. My coworkers are naturals and love their jobs. I feel so left out.

I never had real training and it's always felt like I'm playing catch-up. In many of my jobs, I was a marketing team of one.

1bveb40,Growing pains in role on a difficult project?,"I’ve been at the same job 2 years post graduation. My job is project based and the project I’m on now is a challenge. It’s taking a toll on me and my mental health. 

Description:

* 40 person team, my work stream is 5 people. 
* My work steam's work requires input from the other work streams.
* Work is in an area I have some familiarity with, but am not stellar at and do not love. 
* Project is constantly changing, quick turnaround items with pressure from leadership come up.

Current Challenges:

* Coordination with other work streams and a large team:
   * In the past, I’ve only worked on smaller projects without dependencies from other work streams. Mid-level managers channeled the information I’ve needed to me or set up that process. They've always led meetings and helped put guardrails in place for what has needed to be done to complete our work. I've always only coordinated with my direct manager. 
   * On this project, I’m moving up into a higher role. Every task I’ve been given has been ambiguous and required input from senior leaders across the project. I’ve never worked in an environment like this, and I’ve never been the one to take the steps we need to get information. It may sound stupid, but as the most junior one on the team, I've always felt like I shouldn't be the one to set up meetings, send messages to leadership asking for information, etc. I really don't even know where to start here or the etiquette for this. We need a lot of information to do our work. Because of my hesitations with how to get information, I end up working with what I know and it's far off from what we need. On several occasions, our main main manager has had to send our work to the broader team at the last minute for sign off and it's been a mess. I really want to do what I can to fix this, but I don't know how or the etiquette. 
* Working with new team members on my work stream:
   * I’ve been on this project for a few months. We recently got a few new team members. One new team member is my level (so they aren't a manager by level), but they seem to be positioning  themself as a manager. I'm used to working directly with managers at this point so it feels weird to have someone who is technically at my level giving me direction/instruction. They've done a few things that have been off putting/even insulting like ask me for status updates on work they weren't even working with me on, ask me to send them meeting notes, etc. 

I am very concerned about my performance on this project. In the past and on other projects, I have done well but I feel like I am screwing this one up left and right. I have always been available, even on weekends, at midnight. I am trying so hard but I know my approach is just wrong. There are underlying problems I have on not knowing what to do to communicate with our broader team and not confirming things with my manager that I need to figure out how to fix. 

I used to be really happy, always approach these situations with a can-do attitude and I've done a 180 on this project. I am lost on how to fix any of this and approach my manager.

1bve72h,Placed on PIP ~6 mo into job?,"Just as title says. 

Started with a new company late last year. Thought things were going great - I had the occasional mistake here and there, but only one BIG fuck up. Have always taken feedback with grace and acted upon my mistakes to ensure they don’t occur (and manager agreed on this). 

Fast forward to performance review season, and manager says I’m doing great. Gives me some focus areas, I take it, all is well. Two months pass and all is going fine... Until I get pulled into a meeting with HR and manager saying my performance is unsatisfactory and I will be placed on a PIP. 

PIP is vague and I challenge it, but no avail. I sign it and move forward.. manager keeps moving the goalposts and not providing any direction.  

It’s clear this is personal as the targets keep moving and no improvements are good enough. Had a check in meeting where it was acknowledged I had improved on most areas but not all. Haven’t heard back yet. 

Am I overthinking that it’s ridiculous I was placed on a PIP with just shy of 6 months of experience? I’ve been with the company for a year now, but the PIP was solely based on performance for those first six months (and manager acknowledged I had already been doing better and working on my focus areas). 

TIA. Kind of going crazy over here.

1bvde19,Finally quitting and want to say why….,"Long story, short - I was treated horribly by the executive director for two years. I responded by working harder and longer hours in hopes that the owner would recognize I was a good employee regardless of the negative talk I knew she was hearing from my E.D.  They are the only two above me and are very close although they’ve know each other only a handful of years through that job. 
I REALLY want to lay it out there - the reasons I’m leaving. My leaving is causing a huge problem for their business as several employees quit after I told them I put in my notice. They have all had my E.D. as their boss before and were also treated like shit in legitimate ways. 
The other issue is that the owner is a lot like the E.D.  Very immature and gigantic egos.  

So, what is the most professional way to go about this?  An email to both of them or just the owner? The owner hasn’t been to our building since I originally quit a month ago. (which is also really bizarre as she’s never been away longer than a week - I don’t know how to read that either)
 I’m still there helping out because I feel bad for the staff and consumers and I am still interviewing for jobs. 

I swore I’d never quit a job without having one ready to go. But there was a straw that broke my back that involved both the ED and owner. And my SO had been telling me to quit for the last year so he was ok with my being out of work for a little. 

If you’ve even skimmed this, I’ll take any advice. ",Girl--Gone-Mild,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1712202086,2024-04-04 03:41:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bvde19/finally_quitting_and_want_to_say_why/,4,2024
1bvdd5m,Job Application Strategies for Web Developer/Designer? ,"So, I've been out of the web dev/design game for a while now (mainly because of the gargantuan amount of time & effort I put in that STILL–yielded zero results; no job prospects after 4-5 years), & I just want some opinions on a couple strategies I had in mind; rather simplistic strategies, but I want some feedback nonetheless. 

I will lay them out as simply as I can here:

1) Mindlessly vomit applications everywhere from job board to job board–not a fan of this one, as it never yielded results.

2) Create a replica website of the company that I'm applying for, & submitting that demonstration along with the application; have tried this a couple times, but still no cigar.

3) Pretty much just begging and pleading in my cover letter–stating: I'm willing to work for free & will prove myself before being hired on; even if it's just an internship. 

Well, uh, that's all I got so far; feel free to tear me to shreds 😎 At this point I'm willing to use the dark web to get a ripoff bachelor's degree; fuck it lmao

1bvdd32,Should I take a break to reset?,"I'm currently in a job I don't love; I'm under-utilized, micromanaged, and I don't see much hope for advancement. To be fair, I like everyone I work with, and I don't think it's a toxic space in the slightest. It's not an emergency that I leave it. (Yes, I have asked for expanded responsibilities and professional development, but over the course of the last year, it has become apparent to me that it's not a priority for my boss or the company).

I took this gig about a year ago as a life raft out of a job that I had previously loved but the pandemic twisted it into something that was completely unsustainable for me- I was overloaded and stressed to the point of a near total breakdown.

I'm doing better mentally (therapy is amazing, y'all) but still regret not taking time off between jobs. I feel like I'm still carrying around a deep-seated exhaustion. This, combined with feeling really unfulfilled in my current job has led me to consider resigning and taking some time (1-2 months) off. I have enough savings to sustain me for about 5-6 months, and would likely start actively job searching after about 5-6 weeks.

Have you ever done this? Is it a ludicrous idea?

I was frustrated with the location requirements (it was a hybrid role that required me to be in the office 2 days a week and to live in the city where the office was), and the lack of support from senior leadership in terms of hiring for my department. The day I gave notice, was also the day they hired a new boss for my department. I had an exit interview with her and indicated that I was having some second thoughts about leaving, and she asked me what it would take for me to say and I said being able to be fully remote. She said that was a non starter for them, so I decided to leave with grace. I left on a high note—got great reviews from everyone, and kind messages from the president of the org. They also asked if I would be available to do freelance work for them still, and I said yes and have done so. 

I also got a new job that is fully remote and pays the same as my old job did. But…Turns out I hate being fully remote and stuck in the same city. The job doesn’t feel as engaging as the last one I had. Now the last job has posted the role I left, and they are offering up to $35,000 more than they were paying me.

I feel really torn up about this, and feel stupid for not asking for more money if they wanted to keep me. A friend has suggested I apply for my old job. I’m unsure how that would be received.

During the first year went from a department that was not making quota monthly to making it every single month and the morale is much higher. Added on another shop employee as well. They then started talking about a promotion to becoming the service manager of the branch.

After the first year the monthly quota was raised 53%. Made budget consistently for the 2nd year all year. Added on another field and 3 more shop techs. Was told the net profit was the highest in the company (although we are a much smaller store). Was told by the end of the year I would be promoted to service manager. 

Come end of the year was given 5% raise (which I’m grateful for) but was not given a promotion because it was “not in the budget” monthly quota was raised another 50% and there have not been any talks about adding more personnel even though service is back logged a couple of days. Was told that at the end of this year the promotion will be there for me however it seems like the same thing they said last year. Other positions are opening up that are a promotion and coworkers are being told to apply for it however no one tells me to apply because they have plans for me.

My question is do I stay with the company and wait it out or start looking for another job to make more money? I don’t want to keep waiting and hoping on a promise that seems like will never come true.

1bv6y4c,Is my workplace toxic or do I just need to get used to it?,"Hi everyone, 

I really really really need some advice about this new job I started. 

I started a new job 1 month ago and I hate it hate it hate it.   
It's for a very small start up with only 4 people total so I can't really talk to anyone about it at work. This job keeps me up at night and I wake up multiple time in the middle of the night because of the anxiety. 

The work itself isn't that hard but the workload is insane.   
I'm having a hard time deciphering if I hate the work or if the environment is toxic.   


Here are somethings my boss has said to me   
\- You're young (25y/o), you should be working 24/7. That's the only way you'll grow.  
\- After working until 3am from Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, my boss said ""I know you must be tired but I don't believe in giving people a break when they're tired. You need to be working to grow""   
\- Doesn't allow me to ask question or clarifying questions to him or my coworkers. "" you need to learn how to do things on your own""   
\- Gets mad at me for doing things on my own and making mistakes and tells me it's my fault everything is a mess   
\- Constantly tells me I have no skill and no knowledge (I am losing confidence in my ability to do anything)   
\- Got mad at me for refusing a work call at 7pm on a Saturday because I was having dinner with my family. ( I said, can I call you back in 45? I am having dinner with my family. And he got mad at me for disrespecting his time)  
\- This job is in Japanese (even though I was told it would be bilingual) and he tells me how terrible my Japanese is every single day.   


Is this toxic?

I'm almost at breaking point. There was no training, I was thrown straight in.   
My boss is a serial entrepreneur and keeps telling me that the way he became successful is working 24/7 and not sleeping so that's what he expects of me. Everything is so disorganized and I'm so anxious.  
I don't enjoy my work at all, but my boss keeps telling me to not quit, that this is going to get easier as I get used to it. But I am unsure if I can keep up with the working conditions.  
I think he thinks I'm much more stronger than I am as I forced myself to work until 3 am multiple times and it's only been 1 month.   
I want to quit but it's only been a month.  I don't want to let my parents down, and I don't want my boss to think of me as a quitter.   


If you were in this situation what would you do? I know I will be fired if I tried to set boundaries as the person before me quit in a week because he didn't want to work on weekends.

I finally hear back from one (the quickest), and I took it out of fear that I won’t find anywhere else. 

**(since the job market is trash rn and it took me WELL over 6 months to hear back from anyone). **

The job I had before this one that I know had….laid me off because they couldn’t “afford” all of us.

*Current (new) job:

- pays 18/hr in the start of New York. Is a 45-min drive from my apartment (that’s how bad the market is where I live rn). Already after the first week, went through a full tank of gas. I already am barely going to afford my bills, and now I’m barely going to be able to afford gas.

- finally hear back from another job that I applied for, and that my friend now works at, so she name dropped me to them. Offers $29/hr and is located 5 minutes from where I live. And guaranteed pay increase after 6 months of working there. 

How do I possibly tell my job that I have right now…..that I’m essentially going to ditch them??! How do you word that to them?

1bv5thv,Thinking of leaving my job - need advice,"Hi, I'm thinking of quitting my job due to job related stress. I joined the company, it's a hospital job 7 months ago, and I could tell from the first early weeks that I wasn't going to like it. The workflow is shared, so I'm not getting a lot of work. Some of the work I am getting from the nurse, or coordinator requires things that are very specific that I'm getting better at doing, but I've still noticed that when little mistakes are made, including me asking if I can send out a schedule, they get very angry, and this past week imo verbally harassed me in an e-mail trail I have from them asking me if I see this, and that they don't need to point this out to me, do they? and if there's a reason why I need to ask them if it's okay to send out a schedule every time?  
I did this for the sake of letting them know I was going to be sending out the schedule, and so if there are any errors they may see, or may not have known about from the original booking they would know then. This is just one of the many things that have happened. I've noticed glaring coming from another coworker. I just get this uneasy feeling coming to work, and feel like I'm being pushed out of there. I've never worked in a place like this, so maybe I'm flying off the handle, but I've had a previous clerical job in a hospital and it wasn't as bad as this. The trouble is I can't go back. I need advice. I'm 33, I'm owing like 30k in debt, and I am looking for other jobs, but I do have a habit of leaving jobs every year, or job hopping. I'm really scared, but at the same time, each day I'm finished work with the little work I have to do, I find myself just physically and emotionally exhausted, and feel like I'm giving up on life, and everything. I feel like my life is falling apart, and I need either help, or advice on how to cope in the meanwhile because the job situation where I'm at isn't great right now.",Historical-Carrot999,3,1.0,1,1712181919,2024-04-03 22:05:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bv5thv/thinking_of_leaving_my_job_need_advice/,4,2024

1bv4rop,When to know you have reached your limit career wise?,"So recently I changed careers from IT Operations(I was an IT supervisor) to a junior developer, but now I feel like I might not be cut out for programming.  

So first I am 33 years old and have always enjoyed programming and creating apps for myself and even published a few om the play store, so I went with the old saying of make your passion your job...turns out doing it as a job makes me HATE it. 

The company I work for now seems to keep pushing deadlines up, there is always overtime to be worked without compensation, and it just feels like with every task I'm given I struggle and I dread getting new tasks. So I think that I might not be cut out for a developer role and should rather keep it as a hobby. 

I left my previous company to pursue this but they did say I am welcome back anytime. I even gave up a promotion to pursue this,so I kind of feel embarrassed and like an idiot but I realised today that I am not enjoying development from within a company. 

So my question is. Should I try and stick it out? Or go back to my old company and take the promotion? Because I'm leaning to just going back and taking the bad remarks from friends and colleagues, but not sure if it's just my flight response kicking in. All I know is I dread going to work every day and don't even enjoy maintaining my apps on the app store anymore.

1bv4od4,"Reapplying to the same company, but a different division. Should i do it?","So about two weeks ago I applied for an internship (it was meant for working student) in a division where it is not related to what i’m studying right now. I know 99.9% they were not going to consider me bcs of my background. However, i still gave it a shot and ended up struggling when i wrote my cover letter because my study program is not aligned with their available position. Then, yesterday I got a rejection email from them (I haven’t done any interviews yet, just after I submit my CV and cover letter). I’m not surprised bcs I expected it to happen.

Now I saw them (the same company) advertising for a different division that is not entirely related but i can say 40% related to what I’m studying right now. It’s a completely different division compared to the previous division which i apply to.

Do you think it’s a good idea to reapply but with changed cover letter?
I figure i should change the cover letter since the division advertised this time is different so i’m thinking to adjust to the available position.
What do you think? Is it a bad idea to reapply when the recruiter is the exact same person?",Alarming-Teaching416,1,1.0,1,1712179243,2024-04-03 21:20:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bv4od4/reapplying_to_the_same_company_but_a_different/,4,2024
1bv430m,Should I walk from an interview process for a prestigious role?,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub, but I’m wondering what the hive mind thinks of my situation. I’m at an impasse personally. 

I’m currently a contractor in the public sector. I had the chance to lead an extremely large and visible health program in a major city, and I’m now in the running to head up a brand new center at an Ivy League university in my field. Sounds great right? Well the interview process is becoming a nightmare, and I’m thinking of walking. 

Situation: I started interviewing for the role in December (it’s now April). I’ve gone through three rounds, including one virtual panel with 5 people and two all-day on-sites with many more people. These on sites have required me to take off work, do extra work, and leave my 4 month old baby with our nanny for longer than I would have liked. My last onsite included 7 meetings across 20 people, and an hour long presentation that took me hours to create. I was told before the onsite that this was the close to final round, and I would need to meet with a community partner next before a decision. 

Well, after this marathon day, I’m now being asked to meet with said community partner plus MORE people and answer questions in writing “in 8 pages or less.” It’s like every step the process is changing and getting longer, and I’m not sure I want to or can keep this up, especially because I already have a full time job and a young baby. I’m also interpreting these changes as them not knowing what they want, which will bleed into this role likely substantially. 

The catch: my contract is up in May, so I need a job. My current employer wants to convert me to full time staff member with a promotion. The issues are that I don’t like it there anymore and the pay wouldn’t be great. I’d be making the same salary I make now but have more work in a bad working environment. 

Have folks experienced these never ending interviews and had it work out? Not work out? Have folks in these long interview processes been able to put a foot down and say “no more or I’m walking.” I’m really unsure how and if I should move forward considering my personal situation. The idea of working for this institution is very attractive, and that’s what’s keeping me in this plus the salary is substantially more. 

Thank you for your kindness in advance. ",Koko_bean_28,2,1.0,1,1712177903,2024-04-03 20:58:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bv430m/should_i_walk_from_an_interview_process_for_a/,4,2024

1bv3t7r,How would you handle this as a new hire?,"Hi there, I just started a job at an insurance company last week: 

It’s a remote position & during training we were supposed to meet with our team leads to check in and build rapport. I met once with my team lead and she mentioned to me that I will be assigned to another leader.  The new leader has not met with me. She just mentioned that we have a new client going live in June.  I’ve been on board since 3/25. The new team lead msged me this morning and told me that my trainer will meet with me on zoom. 

The trainer met with me today on zoom to do training but it wasn’t really training. She just sat there clicked the program we are working on and just filed claims without really speaking to me. I tried to take notes and have small talk with her and ask her questions but she would keep it short with me.   We left for lunch and she told me we would meet again: I was expecting her to call me back but I never got word from her: 

I took the opportunity to go other training tasks that I have on our work day portal to fill the time. 


I feel like I’m not being onboarded or that I have a warm welcome to my new team. I’m not sure whether to mention it to our trainers & I don’t want to come off as  complaining because I’m new but I don’t know how to go about asking what I’m needing without coming off as problematic .

1bv2sox,Choosing between 2 offers,"I have 8 YOE as an automotive engineer in Michigan. I was making \~$130k including bonuses in a technical project manager role. I left my job last year voluntarily with a severance package. I took some time off and starting looking for jobs around Oct 2023. Found a job through networking and was supposed to get an offer letter right after New Years but due to budget problems, the company had to rescind their offer.

I wasn't getting more than screening interview until 2 weeks ago when my luck changed and got multiple 2nd round interviews with a few companies in which I performed well in. I got an offer last week from Company A for a contract position making $50/hr doing almost exactly what I was doing in my previous role. There was pressure to sign because their project was urgent and needed help immediately and the job market isn't great so I signed the contract on Monday but don't start until tomorrow. I was supposed to start today but got a call from HR that the chief engineer and CEO wouldn't be in the office so asked if I can start a day later because there'd be no one to guide me. I think this may be a red flag that they might be understaffed or disorganized. There is a 3 month probation period. 

I had an in person interview with Company B for a salary position on Monday since it was scheduled before I got the offer from company A. I did well and HR is currently assembling the offer to send to me by Friday. 

Here are the details.

Company A  
- Small family owned company doing engineering consulting  
- Contract position with good healthcare, no 401k, no bonuses, 15 days PTO.  
- $50/hr with OT if approved  
- **22 min driving commute on local roads (Biggest and maybe only pro)**  
- Work is similar to what I was doing, but I was really hating it by the time I left my old company voluntarily  
- Less room for growth, seems a little disorganized when I went to the office early this week.  
- Expedited timeline, dealing with OEM and product launch.  
- I assume this company is less stable since it's at the mercy of the OEMs. The project has been secretive and I don't even know which OEM/manufacturer we're providing engineering services to yet.

Company B  
- Salaried with good healthcare, 50% match up to 6% of pay, 3% automatic contribution to 401k. All 100% vested immediately.  
- Waiting for their salary and PTO offer.  
**- 45 min highway driving without traffic. Can be up to 60mins with traffic.**  
- Similar project management skills but a completely different commodity, which I think would be less of a headache to manage.   
- The engineers that interviewed me seemed really nice, genuine and willing to mentor and train. They've been employed there for a long time.  
- Stable and well established company in niche market with lots of business and almost no competitors.  
- Timelines are not as crazy and don't deal with OEMs and launch too often.   


I guess the only pro for Company A is the short and safe commute. I am a good driver but know that driving takes its toll. But doing 40 hours at a company doing something I dread with VERY tight deadlines and launch also sounds bad. I think I can do some audiobooks to kill the time but never commuted that long for work before and I'm not an early bird. Can you guys help me think through this and see which one to choose, at least for the next 2 years or so?",BirdPhlu123,1,1.0,3,1712174899,2024-04-03 20:08:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bv2sox/choosing_between_2_offers/,4,2024
1bv2p7r,What to do if you feel ashamed of the companies you worked for?,"Long story short I got laid off during covid and after job searching for a month accepted a job affiliated with GMO products and pesticides. Then, I was desperate for more money and currently work as a customer service rep for a dye manufacturer.

When I told my family I had an interview at this company, my older sister acted like I was going to work for the devil. She was like, “don’t tell them who your sister is, she protests that stuff!” And she said it’s HORRIBLE, as her and her kids are dyed cake and ice cream. I mostly now work to enter orders for pharmaceutical or cosmetic companies. And at almost every family event she has thrown in a comment about how dyes are bad. Meanwhile she is a stay at home mom and her husband is an engineer at a controversial aerospace company. No shade but she just seems to be being really harsh?

My younger stepsister works for a homeless shelter. I feel a bit jealous honestly because I feel guilty about the work I do, meanwhile someone else is doing a non profit job.

I have been applying to different jobs lately, I want to leave for various reasons. But I wonder if the stigma of working her will stay with me forever. I recently applied to a library nonprofit org a for a position that is very in line with my degree, experience, and goals. I’m not trying to copy but I’m tired of feeling ashamed about my job. 

Thoughts?

1bv2hay,Is it that bad or do I need a serious shift in perspective?,"I have over a decade of experience in my field and am currently pursuing my MBA. I have climbed the ladder through working hard and making many sacrifices, all with the motivation that one day I'd have a job I felt (mostly) fulfilled at. On paper, my current job is great. When I started I was refreshed as the culture seemed great and I was optimistic about the company and my leadership team. I would say I am rather skilled in data analytics, the rest of my team is not. They can barely filter an excel sheet. Long story short, I have been made a glorified data analyst. I have no problem being a team player and helping out except I feel like now this is all I'm seen as. There have been things said around not hiring an actual analyst (it wouldn't be worth it to pay an analyst to do these things) and once our VP said ""soon we'll have a bitch to do this work for us"" (prior to her knowing they had no intention on letting her hire. Both of these comments had me feeling a lack of purpose. Due to my new responsibilities, I interact with our VP way more than I'd like to, in short, she's psychotic. I find myself having actual anxiety attacks over my interactions with her/asks of her because of how she is. My question is, should I just be grateful that I have a good paying job with decent benefits that is wfh and need to shift my perspective?

1bv24vj,Does it make sense to give notice for my job now?,"I’m pretty burnt out and overwhelmed at work, and am hoping to fix up my resume and start applying for new roles soon. I know I shouldn’t quit before having a job, but I don’t think I can keep up with expectations at the current moment and it is a huge stressor. 

I have a project completing in mid June, which I think I’d like to stick around for (and was cause some major issues I left beforehand for). However, I also have another project that ends in December. If I’m leaving, I think it’d be better to have someone try and replace me sooner, right? I’m very out of my depth for the December project and I’m a bit too deep in to pass off ownership. In an ideal situation for me, I could pass off that December role to someone else and still stick around for 2-3 months to finish my June project. 

Not sure if that’s possible, but I think it might be if I ask to put in my notice 2-3 months in advance? Does that make sense? Looking for some opinions here. I was meeting expectations for all areas as of last month but really don’t think I can keep up that facade much longer. 


Side note: I should also be getting a raise in a month. Not sure I’d still be getting that if I put in notice, but thought I might look more attractive to other employers if I show that I got another raise.

23 F

I work as an HR assistant for a very large company, as a seasonal contract for 3 months now, contract ends in may. I dont have much experience working prior to this, other than a recruitment and admin role at a small company for 6 months, and an hr coordinator role for 4 months.

My manager did a performance review. She said i’m doing amazing work performance wise.

My strengths:
- Very fast learner with very little training (i jumped in during their busiest season)
- I’m exceptional at work performance, nothing bad about my work and that i’m doing perfect

My weakness:
- I’m too soft spoken and sweet, I’m not as confident, and let people sort of step over me. I need to be more assertive and direct

She advised me that she wanted to extend my contract, but can only keep 3 out of the 8 that got hired for the contract due to budget. And that i was the 4th person she wanted to consider, but due to my soft spoken and sweet nature she couldn’t, as the business needs someone more assertive and confident. 

They hire HR assistants every summer. She said that if i want to come back next summer, she will take me in without any interview or application, I would just need to let her know through email.

How do i fix this about myself? I’m sensitive, soft spoken, and i feel like i’m too sweet.

I want to be more outspoken and assertive but i’m not sure where to start. Please advise

1buzwa6,My job was changed without enough notice to find something I actually want,"Intentionally vague at points, hope this is enough info for advice. After over a decade in food service, from line up to GM at different locations of a pretty popular regional chain, I quit during the pandemic because the burnout was so real. I went back to school to finish my bachelors in Sports Management, my real passion, and found a job with a local startup in the meantime to work my way through school. It was great - one person department, flexible hours, great working environment. The role very quickly grew as the company did, so much so that it felt crazy to want to leave once I graduated, which I did with straight As and good connections with my professors. It was a lot of hard work and long days but I am really proud to have finally graduated after partying my way out of college at a young age.

Out of the blue, a VP was brought in above me, and within a few months my job has been completely eliminated by outsourcing the in-house operations to a company out of state that does this already. It is the best call for the company and I totally understand why it happened. That said, I wasn't presented with another option until the last minute. It is at the bottom of another department and not something I am interested in as a career path. The pay is about the same, definitely fewer hours overall but at worse times (night and weekends). At the same time, I was rejected from a job with a local professional sports teams that I really thought I had a great chance at. It was my out. I am in my mid 30s, and with my work schedule as it is as well as my home life I can't afford to take the very bottom level sports jobs (street teams, game day only, etc). The jobs I am looking at are intro level in their department (comms, admin, or equipment), but as sports goes, it is basically impossible to even get a rejection email written by an actual human, let alone an interview. I have worked so hard to get to where I am and feel completely stuck, defeated, depressed. The only bright side is that my wife is WFH and has given the green light to apply for jobs all over the country as it doesn't change a thing on her end. I think there are potential opportunities at my current company down the line that don't exist yet, but after grinding for years to get to where I was, I feel cheated having to start that process over. I have sent dozens of apps out and have only had two interviews, both with the same local franchise, and feel as far away as ever from breaking in with a team. At this point I feel like I could just bartend again while sending out applications in sports, make as much or money, but worry how that would look to potential employers. I also have considered grad school. Not even sure what specific kind of advice I am looking for, just feel like I have hit a dead end before I even started my goal of a career change.",MaybeJohnElway,2,1.0,0,1712168338,2024-04-03 18:18:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1buzwa6/my_job_was_changed_without_enough_notice_to_find/,4,2024
1buzfg6,Employer found out and now I’m stressed!,"UK based professional

I’m in a pressurised role and all my reviews are outstanding and my employer very much like me.  

However, I do suffer from stress from a young family, personal circumstances and my job.  I worry and I overeat and I struggle sleeping.  

I went to my private medical cover through work and just asked for resources but they set me up with some counselling.  I’m not in any big mess with it but I thought what the hell it might help me work more effectively.  They assured me 100% none is disclosed to employer . I did make the first call on a work mobile and got a couple emails to my work email.  I also discussed with a couple of business contacts who know my employees but explained it’s no biggie.  

One colleague has noticed I’m overworked so they set up a consultation with a more experienced person to help me delegate and manage better.  However, now they are taking stuff off me and pulling out the stops and mentioned stress, and how I can come to them etc etc so I think they know!  I don’t know how they know. 

Now what started as just a “hey let’s improve” is now some issue and this is stressing me out.  I’m now going to be seen as weak.   It’s now a big deal.  

I know they are worried about claims but I would NEVER take a day off for it, I just want to be happier and stop being fearful of failure . 

This has now backfired.  

Perhaps what I’ve identified they can see?

I don’t know how to get out of this mess.  My friend says this is normal for many professionals with a young family and challenging circumstances but I hate the kindness and feeling weak and I can’t go back.  

I just wanted some relaxation techniques and now this has blown up and I feel way worse than if I’d never made that call or asked for help with workload.  Argh!

1buze91,I have applied for every job under the sun and have been constantly rejected. and the short term jobs I worked at where either too short or filled with work place harassment/bullying,"I 25f am unemplyed for the last few months. when I went to college I had volunteered in many different jobs from shop assistant, to stock and inventory assistant, to learner mentoring students with special needs to events assistants, leaning and developing as many skillsd as I could. when I turned 18 and moved to my college dorm for my final years determined to make it my best year I continued to do the same whilst applying for offical work but was only successful in getting a part time job as a college cleaner. it paied of that years turition and residancy along with donations. but following that I contined to applie for otherwork while applying for uni. unfortently during my second year of univeristy the pandemic hit in full forse and impacted my tuition greatly so I was forced to with draw. I had stayed at my cleaning job as it was my only sourse of income but followin g that the loans company sent me a notice that due to withdrawing because of the lock down rather than be written down as a faliuer due to being unable to complete the course properly as practical work was critical. I had to return the entier years maintance loan on top of rent from my new acomidations in my local city. during thsi time I had no complained once about the work place bullying I was getting from my co workers ranging from I had not done my job properly to stop asking for things and just get one with it. I have savier skin conditions that make it difficult to even handle bars of soap never mind cealning products where were ment to use and was alwsays requesting gloves. I carried a bottle of talcon pouder around with me for a while but was told to stop because i made a mess. even though I cleaned up right ater applying it to the gloves. when I was 19 I had walked in and heard my collegues complaining that it was too earley in the day to be doing this and the manager of the shift laughed and mage a joke that the bosses where pushing them to their emotional limits, that they couldn't live like this, looked at me with a smirk and said maybe we should just kill ourselves. i changed to the evening shift that very day but I was still crying all day. for 

for clarrification, I live long term with anxiety and depression from physical and emotional bullying at school (not college but high school and junior school) and have a have scars from it that will never go away

I quit that job at the end of 2021 after the new company that took over the cleaning of the college not only messed up wages drastically making it impossible to make rent on time, but also told us to used nock off cleaning products that where not great as that and cased harm. I had been asked to work overtime one weekend and an incidant happened where the chemicals reacted violantly to the directed way of making them and I had to be taken to the hospital and had operations on both my hands. there was no apology given and I was reprimanded for my imcompatance instead so I told them I would not be returning and cashed in all of my holiday for the remainder of my sick leave. the only karma I got back out of that was I later learned that my manager had ask for me to come back because they could not handle the work load but they had asked why when they had complained that I was incompetant at my job and was a problem that needed to be gotten rid of anyway. 

After that gettig a job was harder and I lived on benifts which made it very difficult to afford anything other than rent. but was able to get into a part time job scheme as an events assistant for a local center ran by a city church. I worked there for the whole season with the encouragment and belive their was an opotunity for perminent placement but by the end of the season the church management thanked me for my hard work but they where not continuing my emplyment even though just the week before they had told met that they needed permient staff. some family memebers of mine belive that while the job scheme was active they recieved money for taking on people who needed work that applied for the job scheme but when it ended that year there was no more money to be given which is why they terminated my contract in october 2022. at the same time my landlord put my rent up an extra 150gbp even though their where people squatting in that house that he was unaware of and the house was in a state of disaray as it was. I gave my notice for the month and moved my stuff out because I could not only afford the extra rent but I was not willing to pay extra when their where people living in the same house as me rent free and damaged property, where theives and god only knows what else. 

fast forward to my most recent full time employment. much as I was reluctant I apllied for a teaching assistant roll for special needs highschool students at the high school I went to. the same high scholl where I was emotionally and physcially bullyed at. but I had been told it was under knew management and that it was different to how it was before and I had no luxurary of turning my nose up at the job. I was quickly accepted and from April to december I gave it my all in supporting and doing right by the students helping the teachers and these students have a clear cominication and supporting them in learning. some of these specil needs kids needed to be in specialised schools that are disinged to handle their care but can't because of the costs so they are thrown into a main stream highchool with regualr going schools that is also a public high school and ran by a trust. that trust is ran out of a prestigous boarding school in the city, and when the new academic year started it became clear that that the trsut itself only cared about the positive development anfd money it got out of that boarding school and the good marks from offsted while we did not get anything worth a damn. it is not easey to go into work every week and be shouted at swore at threatend and ocasionally physcially assulted by the students you are supposed to be supporting and then not supported by management level co workers. I ahd spoken to the welfare officer a duzen times about so many incidants and how I was never listened to when I brought it up in meetings. in October I was given a reprimand because one studant had climbed over the ledge of the steps and was doing gymnatic twirls and nothing I could say or do would get her to go back over the otherside but I could not just walk away incase she lost her balance and fell. that day left me very shaken up because the stundent had slipped but had caught herself intime so she did not fall but I was freaking out on the inside and told my manager the same I did everything short of not physically hauling her over the otherside because everything in me was telling me to especially when she slipped, because worsed case scenarior was she could have died. but after that I was having panic attacks at work and was the laughing stock of my team. several in paticualr would make my job dicciult but I sucked it up and got on with it because they had applied to desk jobs that where with the manager while I ran around like a headleass chicken to meet impossible standards and do right by the students. at one point it got so bad I had relapsed back into my self harming ways and have been struggerling with it since Noverber when I starded to have thoughts about ending it all I desperitly applied and reffered myself for theraapy, but I was told the process can take up to three months and 6 months for the free therapy groups as I do not have between 30-50gpb change spare for theerapy. 

it got worse when the benifits company I had been on sent me a letter ut of the blue stating that my benifit's claim was disputed without contacting me and the department of work and pensions ahd closed my account but had not sent me a reson why untill the letter. it was to say my claim was basically fraud and I was overpayed and was required to pay it back. but because I was past a month where I could disupute the over payment claim and as a result am stuck with an 8,000gbp debt over something I had been entitled to and had done everything I was told to but had not legal or financial way of contesting it. my teaching assistant job was destroying me mentally and I was becoming physically ill over it sometimes but tried to power through it a lot. the only time I took time off was when I caught covid as I have to sheild relatives  and while it was not horrific enough to warrent the hospital for me, I could not fucntion properly through it, exhausted to even get up and disoriantated and could not go two seconds without coffing untill I vomited. the only good thing that happened to me during this time was the seasonal part time emplyment I had been able to get at at a musem. this place runs a christmas spectacullar every year and is a nationally popular event that people flocked to by the thousands, even people over seas have come to see it for themselves. 

going to work their on my weekends was an escape from the troubles I was having at my school emplyment but I had to tell myself not to get comfortable because it was a temporary thing and would be over by christmas eve. but I enjoyed every second of it and the people I worked with where nothing but kind and supportive. they taught me so much and showed me a lot of support when I came in to work and despertly trying to put on a mask of everyhting was fine when I was hurting so badly. towards the end I had been summond to a formal meeting at my school employment on the basis for lack of integraty, the reason was that I had taken up a second emplyment with another company when just the week before I had been ill. I Can understand the point but I explained to them that I had to apply for that position in august as everythoing happened so fast. at during the summer I had no problems working at the shcool either. it wans't great but I had a few people their who supported me and I was supporting students in a subject area that I was good at. I explained to them that my weekends where my own as I was not contracted to work in the school during the week, I had made sure that working at the temporary job would not impeede my ability to be at my primary job and my reasons for taking up the second emplyment was because I was forced into a financial corner and while the school paid more money than I was used to which covered the bills for my current living acomidations. it did nothing to put a dent in this outragous debt I had forced on me  and barely left me with enough to feed and clothe myself as it was. I was fully commited to the school job and had kept my mouth shut about how it had becoming a toxic enviorment with my team co workers and how management did not seem to care that I was working myself into the ground to please them and do right by them. the day before pay day and four days before christmast I was summond to the head masters office where I was given a letter of dismissal and told to vacte the school immidetly, because my only methord of transport is a moped because I sruggle with test's they would not let me leave on my bike either I had to be picked up, fair enough I was shattered and could not stop crying but still to have to have to explain that first to my grandfather as he was the only one with a bike trailer, that they would not let me leave on my boke because they thought I would crash it on purpose...was like pulling the pin on a genade and then holding onto it to see if it exploaded. he was furious but also 300 miles north delivering a car to a customer so could nto come and get me himself and I had to be picked up by my brother, who litrally dropped all his plans that day to come and help me. 

I was greatful to my seasonal work place who told me to come in anyway they would make the room to slot me into those shifts all the way up untill the last day on christmas eve. but then it was over and I have been unemplyed scince. they told me they wanted me back but that was a once a year thing and I could not depend on the job for the rest of the year, but that I looked forward to next christmas festives. even so being jobless is not easey. I have been applying for everything and everything where I might have even one skill in. even applied to work in car homes and be assistant cares which I had not ever wanted to do. not out of disrespect as I admire anyone who has the mentality to do that job but because I have always had fears that I would be attacked by the people I was ment to be caring for and there whould be nothing I could do because they can't help it, or that one day I will walk into a room and find a dead body in there and there will be nothing I could do. but for the last 4 months I have gone to interviews and applied for every job under the sun and later I am informed that they have decided to go for somone with just a bit more experience and that it was a difficult desision as I was a very close second choice or I am just not contacted at all. 

I'm not close to family. mostly because I can not be myself around them. I have tried some times to tell them how I fell especially when I was recieving help as a teenager when therapy was free and mandetory but it often ended in falling out with family memebrs or insults and acusations hauled back inforth and one time being told I would be dumped at a mental hosptial and left there for the rest of my life. but I'm still waiting for therapy so I decided to pour my heart out on here. I have no doubt other peoples struggles have been or are far wose than mine ever could be and I don't expect this to stay up for very long or to ever get a responce but I just needed to get it out somewhere I feel really despert right now and can't even contemplate what to do. what did I do to deserve this. why am I a punching bag where ever I go. I have never tried to hurt anyone, have alwasy tried to be polite, help and support others and lead an honest life. why is my only purpose in life to be hurt and rejected at every corner for no other reason other than somone else is potentially job hopping because they have more experiance than me.",Red-Knight15182,1,1.0,0,1712167213,2024-04-03 18:00:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1buze91/i_have_applied_for_every_job_under_the_sun_and/,4,2024

Hello,  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns. Currently, I am (31M) working as a Regional Manager for a small company. I grossed 98k last year and will never make more or less at my current position. (2% raise YOY). I have no degree and no experience other than sales and the restaurant industry. I feel like I have trapped myself in a corner and wasted the last 6 years and don't know where to go from here.  
  
I don't mind the grind of sales, but currently, I am the sole provider for my family of 3 and require at least 70k a year to survive with a mortgage and everything considered. I feel like I cannot start over in a new career. My current sales/management position is very niche and doesn't have a lot of transferable aspects. I deal in yearbooks for schools.  
  
I don't know where to go from here. Any position that pays close to what I make isn't interested in my work experience. Even though I am very good at my job. Top salesman 3 years running, and the 2nd best is my team member, even beating the other 3 regional managers in my company. We even have the hardest region in terms of market exposure.  
  
I've thought about getting into the finance sector. I have even started studying to pass my Life & Health, SIE, Series 6, and Series 7. But I don't want to be an insurance salesman. It just feels like a scummy career path, and I have to feel good about what I sell in order to be effective.  
  
I am a good worker, and given the chance, I feel like I could be a good fit almost anywhere, but no one seems to want to give me that chance.

I'm a lost 23-year-old man (this year 24). For a long time, I've been trying to find the field that will give me a safe financial future and allow me to realise my ambitions. 

I cannot decide between a financial career or computer science. To be honest, I don't know too much about finance, and currently, it's not my interest. On the other side, I like computer science. I learned something about HTML with CSS (maybe 1 month of learning), C#, Excel with a bit of Power Query and VBA, Word (I did a 7-hour course), and now I'm learning about MS SQL Server. Of course, I don't have expert knowledge of these things, but I found myself wanting to learn about things like these.

At the beginning, I planned to go into IT (web development or data science), but I was not sure about my future in this field because of the current crisis in the IT industry and approaching AI. Additionally, I want to enroll in computer science this year, but here is the next problem: I will probably be forced to go to a weaker university due to my matriculation results. If I decide to go into finances, I'll have a chance of getting a better university.

I can devote one year of my life to learning and improving my matriculation results in the next year and enrolling in reputable universities, but due to my age, I don't want to do this. Maybe I should do this, but I'm really lost in everything. I was thinking about going into finances (in a more analytical direction, where I will be able to use some programming skills) and, in the future, maybe pivoting into a position that is more associated with IT.

I feel that I'm losing a lot of my time because I lack a definite direction for my future career. I feel a real desire to realise myself in one of these two fields, but I'm currently very undecisive. I know that nobody could decide for me, but I'm looking for any advice and guides. I don't have anybody who can help me, so I decided to write this post. I know from my autopsy that strangers can sometimes give the best advice. 

At the end, I want to mention that I don't have any experience with jobs that could be associated with any of these two fields.",c4lder0n,1,1.0,0,1712159794,2024-04-03 15:56:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1buw6jb/i_need_to_find_myself_in_my_life_could_you_advise/,4,2024

I work at a pretty small company with about 45 employees and we have not been doing great. I'm in a contract role with only 30 hours a week, and my manager was working about 45–50 hours a week. After almost 5 layoffs in the company and 3 people quitting, my manager also decided to quit. I am on the marketing team, which has about 5 people. I am specifically on the e-comm team and it was just me and my manager - who left about a month ago. At the moment, there are no plans to hire anyone for my manager's position.  Since then, I have felt somewhat overwhelmed. I have had many conversations about increasing my compensation to a somewhat comparable range with no avail and the same goes with my hours. I have been told to take on more tasks and am feeling very overwhelmed. I want to leave but I have no job to fall back on and do not have the flexibility to be able to not work at the moment. All of my team members know that I am underpaid and being taken advantage of but the owners of the company are ignorant to anyone else's opinion on anything. They yell in meetings and are very rude and there is a lot of miscommunication on timing for product launches, which has a direct implication on what I do. For example, there was a product launch and the date for it was moved around so much that I missed when it was supposed to go live - my hours limit is also very strict, and I have been adhering to that, which led me to miss a message that had implications on launch timing.

1butnya,How to proceed after coworker told management about concerns I raised about our role,"Hi there, I’m in a frustrating place after the past couple days and could use some advice.

I’ve been at my job for 6 months, pay is decent for an entry-level gig. However, there are some issues in the department that me and others have raised with each other, and sometimes to management. To explain a bit about the culture, I would classify it as a bit toxically positive. Those who provide negative feedback to systems and management are treated badly by the managers themselves.


We had a new group of people train in, and in training they paint the job in a very rosy way. I fell for it too, before realizing that it’s not a dream job. I got to chatting with one of the new people and she mentioned how great the job is. I said that it’s a fine job but isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. when she asked for me to expand, I gave her my phone number and told her some of the things I wish I had known before I had to figure them out on my own (size increase of the department, attendance policy, time it takes to come off contact).

I shouldn’t have trusted her clearly, because she took almost no time to bring my observations to management. They had a meeting with the whole department, plus a solo meeting with me saying my name came up, and challenged the exact same points I had raised with a corporate counterpoint. 

Now I’m very worried what this means for me in the current role, and what this means for being brought into other departments. I’ve been in a bit of a tailspin, because I was looking out for her and may have ruined my chances to get out of my current role in a company that has much better departments to work for. What are your thoughts here? Is there anything I can do besides keep my observations to myself? Should I talk directly to the woman who reported me to management?

1butc2n,My Team of 10 is hiring 3 additional people after one (fairly new) member revealed she is going part time.,"I’m new to working so I don’t know what this really means- but basically a coworker of mine that is just 1.5 years in revealed that she will be leaving to go back to school. 

She then realized that she’ll still need to pay rent (lol) and asked if she could return to be at least part time, they’ve granted that. 

Though what’s interesting to me is that this triggered our higher ups to hire 3 additional people to join our team. I honestly doubt that it is because the work the girl leaving was doing was so tremendous- she wasn’t responsible for that much really, and is fairly new. 

The pay scale is as follows:
- new member 50k
- 2 years in - 60k
- 3 years in - 70k
- senior title - 80k (cap for non managerial role)

Right now I’m still under 1 year with the team. I understand that this is a pretty awesome pay raise year over year, and I’ve been banking on this trajectory to reach my goals in the future (buy a house, have kids, etc.)

But now I’m worried that with all the new hires, everyone will experience pay cuts across the board, and not see that year over year increase that has been the way of now and in the past.

Am I wrong to be thinking this? Could it just be that the higher ups see the workload of our team growing and have allotted more funds to be able to handle growing the team but keeping the pay scale the same?

I have worked with the same company for almost 10 years now. Three years ago i fell in a good vacant spot where my yearly income pretty much doubled. Last year i made $150K before taxes and all deductions. The kicker is about half of that income is from commission tied to sales.

I make the most sales out of every employee there the last 3 years. Some months i make more sales than 2 or 3 other employees combined. So yes i make more money than them but i work harder and smarter.

My salary portion, the other half of my pay is salary which has  not changed at all since 2021.

Am i wrong for asking a bump on the salary portion to match inflation? I feel like as of now even if i make $200K this year, it won't cost them more because that would mean i made them more money as well.

* should i show this title change on my resume? 
   * I'm concerned about employment checks when I move jobs if I don't make the update; I don't want them to think I am lying. The Sr. AM with 'director' in parenthesis looks a lot more compelling, but does that look like I am lying?
* Is there another way to show a title change on a resume when the role of my job did not change at all? 
   * Do I add it as a bullet point at the bottom of the section and say something like 'title was changed to Sr Sales manager due to company re-org'? 
* Do I try to show it as a 'promotion' and create a new line item with some other tasks that I handle to spin it in a positive light?

The reason I am trying to choose one of these types of degrees is because it will give me a Plan B in case cybersecurity doesn't work out for me but I know computer engineering is a very difficult degree to pursue since the study hours per week are very long meaning I won't be able to dedicate as much time as I need on my certificates, one of the other reasons is because my older brother had always told me that engineers find internships so easily compared to engineering technology and I know experience is way more important than some degree while the computer engineering technology would supposedly be more difficult to find internships but since the study hours per week aren't as long I would be able to dedicate more time to my certificates.

Within this company that I work in there are different projects for different types of companies (mainly from UK). Previously I was on a project for 6 months that I loved, I liked talking with my colleagues, talking on the phone or on live chat with the customers, responding to emails. I was really confident and learned all the procedures, documents, promotional offers, products etc.

Everything seemed fine, the last 5 weeks, I was spot on with only 5 stars reviews from the customers and 100% score from my quality analyst, until a month ago when we were all called in a meeting (that was announced 30 minutes prior) with our Team Leaders and Team Manager to let us know that that company that we've worked for/with will cancel the contract with us and go for a much cheaper outsourcing company from Asia.

Now of course they did not fire me, as l've had good results in the last month-month and a half (they did fire 2 of my colleagues tho, which is really unfair for them with compensation of one months salary), but they moved me on a different project which is only voice/calls and I have to start from scratch again learning everything, new systems, new procedures, new higher ups...

I am currently in training while writing this after a mental breakdown…. don't understand a thing th trainer is explaining. Training will last one week of theory, systems and documents and next week of shadowing (watching more experienced agents take calls).

I have to note that previously I worked for a similar company and the same thing happened, project closed due to the client not wanting to work with us and going for companies in Asia or Africa.

I have only 2 years in experience, went to college but never got my degree (economic studies and management) and feel like l've waisted my time, my parents time and money. I plan to get it next year tho.

I am currently looking at jobs on Linkedin or other popular apps from my country, but they don't pay as nearly as good and I feel that l'll forever be stuck in a lower position at work.

1bup8iz,Need Career Advice : 2023 CSE Graduate Feeling stuck in a PSU,"I have graduated from a Tier -1 engineering college in Computer Science Engineering. I like software development, and hence I got on campus placement from a startup with high salary package in software development, but things took an ugly turn when that startup started laying off SDEs and didn't convert my intern + fte offer to FTE. I eventually joined a PSU which came to my college through dream category placement, thinking I will get a coding job there.

They have given me posting in a department, where there is no Computer Science Engineer, and I am the only one. There is no coding. The role is kind of product management, where I am getting their website built from third party vendors, for which I have to make tenders. I am totally hating this slow paced work environment, where I am not feeling like I am achieving anything. I want to get a software development job in private sector, but, even after rigorous applying, not getting any interview call , due to the current job market under recession. My boss is so busy with his work, that he doesn't give time to what I want to say or how well I want to contribute.  Now they have started giving me clerical job as well. I don't understand what should I do. Shall I leave this job and prepare for coding job, even in this current job market of 2024 ? Is this PSU job experience being in my resume, making me unfit for software development job in private sector?

Additionally, I've observed concerning trends such as high unemployment rates and reports of low job satisfaction within the field.  
  
Given these uncertainties, I'm left questioning what is takes to make a good 'real engineer'.

I have 2 years of work experienceand 3,5 years I did my internship to learn it. I'm not really happy with my current situation. We work in shift model, and you can't sleep, it's very difficult... Most of the time I go to work with 4 or 5 hours of sleep. I'm a very committed worker, i try to help everybody I can and I try to learn all the machines. All my teammates say, don't work so much, it's not worth it, you won't get paid more,... My teammates are also let's say not the best. Always say you're doing this wrong, don't clean, but they also forget things often. The work it self is good. The people in high positions are... Meh. They only look for numbers but we really work like in the 19th century. We measure pieces with a thing from the 1990s, a few from our machines are from 1980s, we don't have enough workers, but they don't hire cause now it's a bad time due to war,... So we really have to work more everyone of us. When you say something to improve, they only write it down, and then forget about it cause there is so much to improve. We have to Deburring Our pieces with a Triangular scraper, we have to grind our own steels,... So as you can see we are living in 19th century. So you don't get much valued due to try improving things, cause they just don't care. I have a big stutter problem so I don't know what to do if I should quit. Any advice what I should do? Should I just keep going and try to be the best? Quit and look for something else, if so a complete new job or still in the industry? Should I study more in school like a bachelor or master? Also I'm thinking about leaving Germany cause it's not so good as it was, government does everything to make this country worst. My dreamjob would be helping other in some way and a home office job.

Just started my career in January after graduating from school in December. Trying not to give away too much here, but I work in an industry where you typically “get your foot in the door” working overnights.

That’s the stage I’m at right now, and it’s causing me so much distress. The night shift have gotten a slight bit better than when I first started, but not by much. I love the actual job and my coworkers, none of that is the actual issue. But the hours, and lack of sleep and self care that comes from that, have exacerbated previous mental health issues in ways I never would have expected. In turn, that means I am thinking about work way more than is close to healthy, which creates a negative spiral. I have not yet started therapy for this, but am planning to in the very immediate future. 

It’s also an industry where non competes are common, so it’s not as simple as “find a comparable job elsewhere in the city.” I am under contract for two years, and don’t have anywhere near enough money to survive for even a month if I were to quit. 

Do I be completely open with them about what it’s doing to me? Would there be legal ramifications to that? Do I continue to just hope I adjust better and suck it up? Do I start looking to leave the industry already?

1bul76u,How to Handle Potential Conflict ,"
Hi everyone! 

I am leading an annual meeting with a few key stakeholders in May. One of the people involved in this meeting is an engineer. 
Before this meeting, we have “prep” meetings 1x / week to ensure we are well prepared for this annual meeting. This engineer has not joined one meeting or participated in the discussion. 
Today, I was speaking to someone on his team and they told me that the engineer said that he has been “excluded” from emails and meetings. This is completely false as he is on the invites, he just has not shown up to anything, yet wants to travel to the UK for this meeting. I explained to the person on his team that it was not true, and that he has been absent. She told me she would let their team lead know. I spoke with my manager and he told me he would discuss with that engineers manager.
I am anxious now as I feel like I have created conflict in the workplace. I spoke with one of my friends, and she does not believe I should be, but I cannot help but feel that way. Has anyone experienced someone like this in the past? How was it handled? Was I in the wrong for involving my manager?

Thank you for any advice!

I'm a recent University graduate (as of one month ago), but I have one and a half years of experience in Fintech startups, as a Strategy analyst. (I worked and studied at the same time and i've always been VERY active in my country's fintech ecosystem). I was hoping to get into startups full time but I didn't get any significant non intern job offers for 4 months, despite having a great GPA, work experience AND extracurricular activities in the Fintech Industry.  After a while of looking I got offered an IB job and honestly it is not my first choice but I am grateful to have received an offer in this absolute trash job market and I'm proud of the effort I put to get the offer. Anyways, i'm not planning on staying for anything over a year or year and a half, as my true passion are Fintech startups. However, I'm wondering if this year or year and a half in IB will affect my CV when I try to go back to product analyst, strategy analyst, business analyst, or product Manager type of roles, given that the skillset might be somewhat different.

1buhln0,Hate Banking,"I’ve been banking for a couple years now and have never loved it. I was in a cannabis startup previously for 5 years which I absolutely adored the work I did.  Unfortunately things went south and I was at square one. I didn’t want to keep going in the industry I was in as it was quite new and there is a real negative stigma around the industry. Not to mention I was diagnosed with melanoma so my dreams of being a master grower vanished. 

Fast forward to today. Because of my diagnoses I dived into something that was indoors, being banking. I thought hey, I can build a great career doing this. Only problem is, im extremely unhappy. Everyone seems to hate it and it just feels very negative. No matter how positive I try to be I just can’t find my groove and often think to myself… wow is this how I’m going to spend the rest of my life? Not to mention I got my first raise and it was a measly $50 a month. I don’t rake in the big bucks since I started entry level and managed to work my way up.

I’m just unsure where to go since I live in a smallish down and the job market isn’t great. I could serve and make more money than I’m making right now but I don’t see myself being a server for the rest of my life. The only thing I like about my current job is the security it brings.

1buhkge,Planning my next career move with my company. Should I worry too much about how the title hurts my future external opportunities?,"Hello! I am currently working at a small tech company as their Implementation Manager. It is a remote position and I make around $130k + bonuses.

Since it’s such a small company, the role demands much more than a typical Implementation role. On top of the customer facing work that comes with implementation, I also help with the data integration, post go-live support, and the creating items on the product roadmap for both non implementation purposes and implementation purposes.

I have been talking to my boss recently about what my next steps are, and he has been thinking to push me more towards the Customer Success side of the business where the career path would look like: Implementation Manager -> Director of Customer Success -> COO?

However, the other potential path I could take is on the product management side of things. This career path would look like:
Implementation Manager -> Senior Product Manager -> Director of Product Management -> VP Product -> CPO

I really don’t have a strong preference on what route I pick, but I am conscious of the job market outside of my company, and have concerns that if something doesn’t work out well with my current company, then I feel like a Product Manager title is much more appealing than Implementation/Customer Success titles to external companies. I feel like the salary ranges for those positions also favor the Product Management roles.

1bugt78,Team Dynamics and Career Growth Concerns,"I have dedicated over two years to a startup, serving as one of two graphic designers. Throughout this time, I've consistently demonstrated enthusiasm for advancing both my role and compensation. With confidence in my skills and dedication, I've voiced my aspirations for growth. However, it's important to acknowledge that my initial salary upon joining the company was lower than anticipated, considering my experience of over ten years, technical proficiency, and the consistent high quality of work I deliver. Despite putting in extra effort, including unpaid overtime, meeting deadlines, and demonstrating proficiency, I have been overlooked for promotion and paid significantly less than my male colleagues.  
Recently, the team dynamics underwent a significant shift with the addition of a senior male designer. It's worth noting that I expressed my interest in being considered for this position, only to be told by my manager that I couldn't handle the pressure. As the sole female member of a team of four, consisting of three senior members, including my executive-level manager, I've found myself increasingly excluded from meetings and the creative decision-making process and it has created a demotivating team dynamic for me. Instead, I've been assigned primarily to troubleshooting problems and mirroring the work of the senior designer, which diverges from the initial expectations. Despite raising concerns about workload and fair compensation, my manager tends to brush off my inquiries with vague references to budget constraints and doubts about my experience level and working faster.  
I'm considering a meeting with my manager but unsure of its effectiveness, as he tends to evade direct questions and doesn't listen. HR has shown some support, suggesting I lead more projects and possibly receive better pay, but I'm hesitant to share all the details for fear of retaliation.  
How should I navigate the upcoming meeting with my manager? Is it even worth discussing with him given his dismissive attitude? Should I provide more details to HR in our follow-up meeting?""

1bugfx6,"What motivates you about your work, what is it you love about it? I'm told that you can't be motivated by just money or counting the days till a great summer vacation, but that you need to enjoy the activities you perform on a daily basis, hence my question.","I may have been mislead but that's what I hear, which is that even people who say they are in a job for the money (as a certain accountant told me), they must enjoy *something* about the job activities they perform on a daily basis. Because 40 hours a week of doing something you hate just can't be counterbalanced by good pay.

For example, a programmer told me that he enjoys the puzzle-solving aspect of programming. So that even if he is working on a website for a product or service he has no interest in whatsoever, the puzzle-solving aspect of it motivates him to push through difficulties and figure things out.

If you disagree with this assessment, let me know. Otherwise, what do you like about the activities of your job? What motivates you to keep pushing through, whether you're crunching numbers or cleaning rooms or delivering food or whatever.",sans--soleil,3,1.0,9,1712108688,2024-04-03 01:44:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bugfx6/what_motivates_you_about_your_work_what_is_it_you/,4,2024

Any guidance? ,"I’m 33F, have a BFA in graphic design and a lot (10y) of experience working as a graphic and digital designer for multiple Fortune 500 brands as well as production agencies, and branding studios. I’ve been fired from almost every single one of my jobs because, as a trial and error process, I’ve been learning what works for me and unfortunately that has meant burnout over and over again to the point of poor performance and getting fired. I’m currently unemployed and at a complete dead end.

I know what I want to do next and that’s become a content creator within the fashion, interior and travel niche, I’m passionate about this and it lights me up. The problem is I not only have zero money left, zero savings, I’m also in debt. I had to move back in with my parents and sublease my apartment (yeah, it’s at that point).  

I know this may sound entitled and not like a real problem but it’s a real mental block for me that I’m doing my best to overcome. I had a call with a recruiter today and it got the ball rolling a little but at this point, I dread the thought of applying to new jobs because my faith in them leading to anything remotely fulfilling is so low. I’ve at least been able to narrow down to needing to be remote and potentially part-time, but I still have so many blocks around what I will actually do for the company (design digital ads and emails again…?)

1bucsjd,Need advice…,"I’m an analyst who has been in the game for about 6+ years. Recently been working for a boomer Fortune 500 company for the last 2 years or so. 

I spent 1+ year in my first role with a team and recently lateraled to another Analyst role on a different team. My new boss is supposedly big on “development” according to herself. 

I’ve noted that even in nonstandard 1x1 meetings where we are reviewing an analysis, she takes quite a chunk of the time, talking about my development opportunities and how “you’re an analyst” and “I’m a manager so it makes sense you wouldn’t know this”. She’s also always referencing a star player on our team: “Zach is incredibly smart” and “Zach is truly quite special, he has done amazing work”.

Are these normal, standard managerial discussions that managers have with employees or would this qualify as passive aggressive behavior? Do I just straight up suck? Maybe I’m reading into this too much, but I feel like my boss is insecure for some reason, I can’t put my finger on it. Why would we constantly have this same discussion or variation of it over and over again for the past 6+ months? 

Is there any way to approach this situation or do I just try to bail? I feel like my manager has these ideas and barometers of success based on Zach’s performance, but is Zach’s performance the metric or KPI for my success? Is everyone supposed to be a prodigy like Bill Gates, Lebron James, or Michael Jackson? Is there room for mediocre people to exist? Really curious to get insight from other managers, how do you lead your team? Are these conversations within the realm of your normal day to day interactions with teammates?

And while I know exactly what I want to do, work R&D or similar, the company that has positions for me is in a different city. Nearby but still far away.

And then at the end of the day take the 5pm bus or else I'm screwed and be at home earliest 6:30pm. It just seems so... Not worth it. But at the same time it's actually the only place I can gain good experience within my specific industry (chemistry) at this point because not many other options exist within the city in which I live.

Had it not been for the commute I would have begun applying today already, but I doubt myself now because I really value my freedom and mental health.

When i asked why i wasn’t considered originally they said due to location but they hired another for another role at the same time and that person also doesn’t live near the ‘ideal location’.  It just feels like they’re desperate and never really wanted me to begin with.  

I have a job but as i mentioned i don’t love it. I loved working with this old manager but i can’t get over the fact they didnt really consider me the first time - or even give me a heads up about the opening even if it was location restricted (which clearly it never was).

1buaq3l,Should I pursue law in Canada ?,"Hello friends,

I am a Brazilian immigrant living in Vancouver, BC.
I’m in my 30s and have been here for over 7 years, but work in the admin field of a small Real Estate Development company.

I am on track to be a junior executive and like some aspects of the job like decision making, problem solving, managing people and dealing with finances together with the CEO.

I started my professional life as a real estate lawyer in Brazil where I practiced for 5 years (with a total of 7 in the legal field).
The issue is that Brazil is a civil law country and Canada a common law country, that being said it would take me a lot of time and money to pursue the legal field and become a lawyer here.

I am still in touch with law as I have a friend that is a Canadian lawyer and together with him we give lectures and free seminars about international law and some aspects of Brazilian law (our attendance is not great tho).

My fiancee encourages me to be a lawyer here and says that this would be life changing money for us and a great career, but everywhere I look I see young lawyers making a little more than me and working way more, with no vacations and drowning in stress and depression.

Long term I can see that this would be a great career, but I never abandoned law in my country, I am still (technically) a lawyer there where I am still associated and active with the OAB (Brazilian BAR).
On top of that, I am currently connecting Chinese and Brazilian clients to work as an importing/exporting lawyer in Brazil (while living in Canada) - this might take a while but the pay is extremely good and I trust this would give me the freedom and lifestyle I am looking for.

So am I delusional here?
Am I “throwing away my degree” if I keep working in the admin field until my import/export consultation starts generating me money?

1bu7t97,Feeling trapped in my career. Anyone have experience going from Mechanical Engineering to Software?,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading.

So I graduated with my Mechanical Engineering B.S. in 2019. After a rocky start looking for employment I ended up with a job at a manufacturing plant in 2021 and I’ve transitioned from process engineering to a sort of commissioning and deployment role in the factory automation deployment (with some light controls/robotics programming work).

Now here’s the problem. On top of hating the work environment at my current job (due to management/general vibe), I also really dislike being in manufacturing. However, since I’ve gotten myself into a controls role, I haven’t had an opportunity to develop any CAD modeling skills, so I feel as though l don’t have enough experience to transition to something in the design world. And then on top of that, since my degree is Mechanical I don’t know enough to find a job as a full fledged Controls engineer (I lack electrical knowledge), and I don’t even feel motivated to find another job in manufacturing which is where the controls jobs are.

I’ve been self-studying C# and JavaScript with the half-assed idea of being a web developer since 2020 and that’s getting me nowhere, but I enjoy it and I’d really like the opportunity to work from home someday, which wouldn’t happen in manufacturing.

I’m wondering, does anyone have any experience going from a Manufacturing/Mechanical Engineering environment to Computer Science? Did you get a second bachelors, or go for a masters?",mr_first_look,1,1.0,0,1712086424,2024-04-02 19:33:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu7t97/feeling_trapped_in_my_career_anyone_have/,4,2024
1bu77vz,Advise needed on promotion in msp company ,"Hi all

So I currently work in a small company an msp (managed services provider) for around 6 years. The company was small but we've grown to around 20 technicians strong. 

I am currently acting as project manager, technical director in the company and my boss which is also owner and ceo is acting as hr, sales and accounting. 

I've recently in the last 2 weeks hired a 2ic and am busy training him to alleviate my tasks as I am working Mon till sunday every day for the past 3 years. 

My boss now has sent a 40 page plan to me for implementing policies, sop's, reports for every tech as well as automating whatever my position has, which I agree with. 

His end goal is for me to take on accounts as well as budgeting and hr in a more branch manager role. 

I am highly inclined to refuse this and have had numerous arguments with him about this as I have always dreamed of being a highly skilled it technician. Now me being 30 and reaching technical director just less then a year ago now I must step down. 

I am feeling that when I joined I never wanted and have stated this to him that I don't care for accounts and hr. 
My boss wants also me to manage arrivals, departures as well as overtime. I feel that as having build up experience being a tech as well as studied and becoming best in what I've always wanted to do. Now I must step out? I'm confused tbh. 

Accounts for example has always been my most hated subject and it's boring to me.

1bu6t8y,"Thinking of steering away from engineering, any advice?","Hi all,  
So I am someone who had a tough time in college (I had some mental health issues that were not being addressed until I was in Engineering School) so my love of mechanical engineering has been iffy at best. I started out my career at the end of 2019 with a full-time position at a defense contracted company (not my first choice but I had to get my foot in the door somehow and it was one of those places that would hire just about everyone). Absolutely hated it, I am a non-binary individual as well and the amount of random misogyny I would get almost on a daily basis made me feel more and more dysphoric and out of place. I was trained by the only other ""woman"" on the team who was younger than me and had maybe only been there about a year. I did not realize how much of a gap in my learning/training I had until I was comparing notes with a dude who started at the same time as me and was trained by someone who had been at the company probably  at least a decade. And THEN right as I was maybe getting the hang of things the pandemic hit. The Company did not handle it well, there was no time off, we were considered ""essential personnel"" which was absolute bullshit. So we were on a half-in-half-out schedule which made working on projects even more daunting. My mental health was at it worst bc -gestures vaguely-.   
So after about a full year of this I started looking for new opportunities. Luckily I found a position at a medical device company (one year contract, no benefits) that was remote (biomechanics was one of my minors so I was actually really excited for the position!). I had a really tough time working there too. Again I was being poked by random bits of misogyny. None of it was really overt but it was silly stuff like co-workers talking about beer and assuming I wouldn't fall into the category of liking beer bc I was a ""woman"" (again im non-binary) so I was excluded from the conversation. But it adds up after a while. This was again another place where I felt like I was falling behind on training bc I was kind of just tossed into the project to figure it out without much training or someone to guide me. Which normally I think I would have been fine with BUT the project was so new the goals kept changing every week. And because the head of the project (a dude) was more buddy-buddy with other guys on the team I (and the one other woman on the team) kept getting left out of the loop. It was a shit situation, I was trying my best but was getting more and more depressed bc of still being stuck inside in a one-bedroom apartment where there was no real divide between work/life. I was falling behind on work because I felt so awful and could not at the time put in to words what I needed from my group lead to make things work better for me. I ended up getting fired from that position right when my contract was up (all around shit week too, my father had a heart attack like 2 days before I got fired, he's okay now).  
I was fired from that position in 2022. In the time since then I've been putting a lot of work in to bettering myself. Figured out that I'm Autistic/ADHD so that explains a lot of the work issues that I was having in general. I know what I need from a position now, or at least have a better idea. But the idea of going back into engineering after the last two experiences I've had has made my stomach churn every time i think about it. Plus I think my technical skill for someone who has a few years experience may be lacking considering I was trying to learn in the setting of the pandemic. So now I'm trying to figure out what positions will work for me (maybe data entry or clerk positions, something less customer forward) but I keep running into the wall of all my experience is engineering. It seems like recruiters toss my resume directly in the trash when they see it because it's so technical and engineering forward. It feels like I'm under qualified for  engineering (if i even wanted to go back to it) but over qualified for literally anything else. Part of the issue I'm sure is also the two year gap which I've explained as a ""family medical event that required me to take some time away from working"" (this is not a lie really, I was working on my own mental & physical well-being that whole time). But again from a recruiter's standpoint I might as well not have been doing anything at all.  
So I'm making this post partially to vent but also partially to hear about other people's experiences navigating engineering work. (Especially if you're lgbtq+ or a ""woman"") And if you steered away from engineering how did you figure out what to do next? And how did you manage to get your foot in the door to step away? I don't really have any money at this point so going back to school is not an option (not that I would want to). But I would love to hear some success stories bc right now applying to positions and getting ghosted has been my reality and man has it sucked.",NikNakodile,1,1.0,3,1712084096,2024-04-02 18:54:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu6t8y/thinking_of_steering_away_from_engineering_any/,4,2024

For context, I’m married, have a child, and I’m the sole provider with a mortgage and couple car payments. My wife is finishing up her degree and went back to school after working for some years. 

I was laid off at the end of last year and recently went through the process for two job opportunities. 

Job A:

Hybrid schedule, 3 days in office with 2 days at home. Commute is about 1 hour maybe an hour 10 minutes each way. The pay for this job is close to 200k base. It’s a salary full time position with benefits, time off, insurance all that. Easily would cover the bills and save/invest to. One thing to note here is after onboarding they said it could be a 4 day remote 1 day in office schedule, onboarding is about 6 weeks. Management type of position with lots of responsibilities, something I’ve done before but more stressful than other job option 


Job B:

Fully remote, however contract job 6 months with potential to hire/month to month extension. Pay is $45 per hour so around 90k annual. No benefits and no paid time off, the big plus here is always remote, no commute and it would cover the bills but not much savings. The job function is also much easier, no stress. 


I’ve got to decide in the next couple days, while I lean Job A, the commute & additional stress kind of creep me. Im not sure either job is more stable than the other, I work in tech and layoffs happen a lot while one is full time I don’t think anything is guaranteed in corporate tech these days.


Job B I know I’d have very little to no stress. Would love to hear some thoughts?",BlueberryOGSuperGlue,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1712081240,2024-04-02 18:07:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu5kae/unemployed_offered_two_jobs_which_one_to_take/,4,2024
1bu5dux,Has anyone in the advertising space experienced this?,"Ad Sales Career Trajetory 

Been working ad sales in the ent/media industry for 4 years now (26F) and (greatfully) have 2 major media corps on my resume. 

Making around 75K now (before taxes), between CoL in NYC  and paying off student loans, its most definitely not enough (& before you say anything- i cant move home and i live with 2 roommates). 

Ontop of feeling behind financially, my current job (1 year in) at this massive publisher is leaving me unfulfilled/understimulated and quite frankly bored and frustrated with where im at. I feel as though my potential is being limited in these pivotal years of growth and its slightly causing me to spiral.  The company has a great work life balance since i barely have any work but its not challenging at all- truthfully anyone can do my job as long as you can learn the user interface so i dont feel as though any of my people skills, sales skills, or solution oriented skills are being utilized to their potential which is defeating. & yes I continuously apply to jobs internally, externally, & network constantly...

At my previous employer (3 years employed) our team was extremely lean and although i was only making 58K, i always felt creativly stimulated & was always busy due to the team structure.  It was definitely a high stress/fast pace enviornment as i was dealing with smaller deals and sh*tty management, but the work i was doing felt way more fulfilling/motivating. I was constantly expanding my network and skills between entertaining clients and having the opportunity to do more things outside my role which motivated to grow and stay ontop my keeping my skills sharp.  Being heavily involved in the sales process (creatively, nuturing client relationships on a personal level & analytically), & seeing my input for client activations/ideas for the client come to life was exciting and felt glamorous to me.  I find myself looking back on this experience and even during interviews referencing my work at this company, not only was i more passionate about it since i was heavily involved, i just have so many more solid examples of what ive accomplished there. 

Have been applying to marketing jobs lately, based off my pros/cons of being in ad sales i *think* it would be a good move (specifically brand partnerships/integrated marketing).  Unsure if this is a good route for my career trajectory... has anyone felt this way in their advertising job or have advice on how to not feel so unfulfilled/stuck? Or do i just leave this whole career path and pursue something else?

I understand ones career doesnt define them but this has been taking a toll on my mental health as i take pride in my career and am very ambitious (&&& tend to hold myself to my high expectations of what i should be accomplishing).

The people are great, the work is okay, the pay is okay too. But this is the first time in my life that I feel so restricted, both in terms of my routine and mainly in terms of how ambitiously I can see my future self. I can see my bosses who've apparently been working for 10 years now slog all day with minimal autonomy and it doesn't seem like they get paid that well either, and I can't help but see myself there since I'm working in the same place as them.

When I tried to understand the reason for my weird thoughts so early on in my career, all I could conclude was that it has to do with the lack of ambition and autonomy that I feel in this place. I just feel like even if I try really hard and do really well, I don't really have many aspects in my control because of which I don't get the advantage of either making decisions of what's gonna happen to me or my project, nor do I get paid like crazy.

He's been doing it for around 20 years, never over the road, always working local jobs. So he offered to be my mentor, get my CDL, even buy a truck for me and could write it off. However I also was planning on getting an associates at my local community college for cloud computing. Today I decided to ride with him for the day and am trying to weigh out the pros and cons of going with each career.  
  
IT Cloud Engineering/Devops  
  
Salary: 59$ Hr/ 122K Yearly  
  
Pros: Work/Life Balance (If I'm not on call possibly), I can work anywhere or move anywhere, Good and Consistent stream of income, Always Learning  
  
Cons: 30k Debt Degree, Corporate Ladder, Takes Time To Move Up, Competitive Field, Cubical Life (Not sure whether to look at that as boring or peaceful thing), Mentally Stressful, 2 Weeks Vacation, Always Learning  
  
Trucking LLC  
  
Salary: 95$ Hr/ 80 -120K Yearly (Realistically)  
  
Pros: Local, Job Security, Good Money, LLC Tax Deductibles, No Debt, Vacation Anytime, Weekends off, Can start right away, Chill Job  
  
Cons: Long Hours, Breakdowns, Snowy Conditions, Potential of Hitting Car, Bathroom, Tied down to where I live, No Benefits Provided Have to factor in Taxes, Fuel, Maintenance, and INSURANCE for my age is NOT cheap  
  
I know I'm very blessed to be in this position, just deciding between the two, for IT my plan would be to get a helpdesk job then possibly sysadmin, and then a cloud position. Currently building some homelabs with some think pads, pi's, virtual machines and love it. If I were to get a cloud junior position I'd move to some sort of city in like New York, Austin, Hawaii, Vegas, not Cali lol. Only thing is that it's going to take some time getting to that point for sure, guessing around 2-6 years.  
  
As for trucking, I'd love not to be micro-managed and bow down to the corporate BS, I'd make good money even with all of the expenses, and would want to put that money towards some investment, also I just really having this traveling itch right now and would be able to visit anywhere anytime since I'm my own business, of course not excessively. My parents are very biased towards real estate, and would want me to buy a house and either renovate or rent it out to someone. However, riding out today with my father he told he's never loved this job and now just does it at this point to make ends meet. Also he used to lay carpet with my grandfather and knew he never wanted to get into a trade that would just tear his body. He hates the winters though while driving. I'm not sure I'd want to do this job to raise a family later on down the line.  
  
No matter what I get into, I have an insane creative and travel itch, I'm a full stack creative (Photography, Videography, Design) and would definitely have fun with that outside of work along with many other hobbies. Not too sure on moving if I were to go into IT because visiting and moving somewhere are definitely different. I know nothing worth getting is going to be easy but both paths are viable and I just got to start somewhere.",_estebanz_,2,1.0,3,1712078900,2024-04-02 17:28:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu4kj9/im_19_years_old_trying_to_decide_between_llc/,4,2024
1bu4fq7,What to talk about in informal mentoring meetings,"I'm new to my current employer and the industry but have 7 years experience. I've always struggled with knowing what to ask/talk about in mentoring relationships but I know the expectation is that the mentee drives the discussion. 

During an informal meet and greet with a skip levels' peer (my boss's boss's peer), he offered to meet with me as I get my feet under me at the company. I have no direct reporting relationship with him, share similar work content, he is well-respected, and I think highly of his approach to his work/leadership style. 

Our third (30-min) meeting is this week and I just don't know what to talk about. I don't particularly want to follow his career path and already have a good understanding of what his team does. We've talked through his insights on the industry and how our teams can add value. 

I feel like I'm pretty established in my role now and want to preserve the relationship but we have recurring meetings scheduled through the summer, so I'd feel rude cancelling the meeting cadence.

1bu49c3,22 y.o. about to graduate college struggling to decide what to do.,"Hey all,

I am about to graduate college with a B.A. in Computer Science. I don't have any internships or jobs tying me down for the summer so I basically can choose whatever path I want to take. To be honest, I feel like I don't have much life experience right now. I want to travel and learn more about what the world has to offer before tying myself down to a 9-5.

I know it may be unrealistic, but how hard would it be to find a job in my field after 1/2 -1 year off after graduation. When I say ""off"" I mean not working in jobs directly tied to my field.

Examples: 

* I work in a kitchen and really like the environment so I might stay the rest of the summer. 
* I found a seasonal job working at Yosemite which I would like to do.
* I also saw other volunteer/work experiences (pubs, homesteads, Eco-lodges, etc.) over seas which are appealing to me.

I would of course do projects/improving skills in my down time while working these positions. My gut is telling me to pursue those opportunities first while I am young but I also don't want to screw myself.

Maybe a potential other option would be to work full time for a couple of years then try out those opportunities?

Sorry for the long-winded post.

Any help is appreciated,

Thanks!",HolyRavioliStromboli,2,1.0,0,1712078183,2024-04-02 17:16:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu49c3/22_yo_about_to_graduate_college_struggling_to/,4,2024
1bu45pb,Am I overreacting/overthinking,So I have been in a job for a little over a year. I started out part-time and have worked up to full-time but same position. When I moved up I was taking the full time slot of a coworker that got promoted but I didn’t get their senior title. I did get a decent raise at my yearly review but every time I ask about growth or even just learning more to be ready for a better position/title I’m pretty much told to stay in my lane. I have never been told I’m not doing a good job or that I need to work on anything. In my interview for the job I specifically said I wanted a job that I could grow into a career. I asked about training (we are assigned quarterly training but the website we get the material from has TONS of other lessons/certs/etc. ) I spend most of my 8 hrs playing solitaire because there is NOTHING for me to do. I asked if I could take this lessons (I stated I’d be willing to pay for them) so that I could have something productive to do. They said I could take the classes but NOT while I was on the clock. I feel I’m being gaslighted because I’m good at my job. They don’t want me to grow.

1bu3uoq,I need some brutally honest advice here.,"I'm doing a Bachelor of Commerce with a specialization in Business Law. Aside from all the regular courses in areas like Accounting, Finance, Human Resources, Marketing, etc., my last two years focus heavily on areas of law such as labor and employment, contracts, insurance, intellectual property, data privacy, and other areas of business. My course work consists of analyzing various legal cases and understanding how the relevant law or statute applies. This requires condensing large court documents into their most important aspects and my exams consist of a hypothetical scenario and predicting the outcome of a legal battle using the existing legal principle.

Does ANY of this sound useful to a company? I want to work in corporate policy or financial compliance but all of the internships I'm looking at often require me to be in law school or they require a degree in accounting and finance. I'm planning on going to law school but I'd like to have some kind of work experience under my belt in case I need an exit option.

1bu3swh,Grad School or a Job (Healthcare business),"
I have like two weeks to decide as to whether I’ll be taking a job and working or going to do an MPH in healthcare management. I would appreciate any advice as I’m a first gen graduate, and I don’t feel like I have good advising.

I have a full ride for the MPH. It’s at an ivy that I also went for undergrad. I applied to give myself options for after undergrad and wasn’t really considering going until after I found out that I wouldn’t have to worry about paying for it. I feel extremely lucky to have the option, but I don’t know if it makes sense for me. 2 years out of the workforce, unsure about the utility of a MPH degree in relation to pay/over experience, etc. If I do it though, I’ll probably be all in, going to every networking event, applying for internships and jobs, trying to build skills that will hopefully make me useful even after the rise of AI… but even still I’m worried about salaries after, I don’t want to spend time in grad school just to get paid the same I would’ve fresh out of undergrad.

The job is at a company I’ve interned at, doing healthcare system research and last time I worked there, I really liked my experience and felt happy. But the problem is the pay isn’t super high (I’m on the east coast and the pay is ~70K w decent benefits). There is probably going to be fast growth over a year or two, so maybe at the end of year two I can make 85-95K. 

The job market for early career professionals is so bad right now, as I’m sure you guys know. Maybe in two years it’ll be better and I can make more? I’m not sure. 

My career interests in healthcare business/management aren’t fully developed yet, but I know this is a sector that I’m super passionate about. I could use the time in grad school to figure that out. But I could also learn a lot on the job, but probably not have too much flexibility. I don’t want to make this so much about pay, but for me I really hope to build a solid future for myself financially since my family isn’t in the best place to do that.

Please share any advice. Thanks",itslostandfoundd,1,1.0,0,1712077102,2024-04-02 16:58:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu3swh/grad_school_or_a_job_healthcare_business/,4,2024
1bu3kab,Should I stay or should I go?,"A bit of context left a job (after 4yrs) for a a higher paid, senior position - turned out to be way over my experience and didn't make probation after 3 months.

Then found a job which pays the same but essentially is not needed within the company right now and more importantly the role isn't what the title would traditionally be, I have been there 6 months and it has been very boring and they have accepted that they hired me prematurely and I do v little.

&#x200B;

My issue is do I stay or go 

Pro of staying -

\-Decent salary

\- Nice people

\- Stable

Con of staying 

\- I am going to have to BS so much when I move on eventually and then that will risk being found out later down line (See previously not making probation)

\-Despite title I won't actually be qualified in experience

\- Bored beyond

\- Not what the title is, which would be traditionally much more fulfilling

Pro of leaving now

\- Done some stuff/could lie just about dates/could say just wasnt a fit 

Con of leaving now

\- My cv will look like 4yrs, 3 months, 6 months unless I lie or just dont put the middle one but it's starting to give a messy job history

&#x200B;

I don't know. Do I keep job, BS when it's time to leave but that could be risky, and be bored AF, or Leave but look messy job history wise and be in a awkward title is more than I have in experience

1bu3j40,"Planning to quit after 2 weeks of being on the job, should I?","(24F) I've been recently hired, like 2 weeks ago as an accountant. This is my 2nd job, the first one I had was in the similar field where I stayed for about 2 years. I had to relocate hence why I resigned. Thing is, this current job has been affecting me greatly. 

Before I handed my 30-day notice, I already passed the interview of this second company. HR then told me, on the same day, that I had to submit a list of requirements to proceed with my application. I found it odd at first because I thought they'll give me an employment contract instead, but eventually shrugged it off. I thought maybe they'll give it to me once I submit the requirements. Anyway, I did my best to keep them up to date as I was doing my notice just to let them know that Im still interested in the offer. 

A month passed and I submitted my requirements and was scheduled for an orientation. Still no contract but I made sure to open this up to HR. They keep telling me that they're still ""finishing up"" my contract even if they had a month to do it!

I really went in blind in this job because aside from knowing my job position, I didnt know how much I was getting paid for and what underlying company policies they have. I was reporting to their office for about a week but they werent training me or anything. Imagine my disappointment when all I did was sat in an office, like a vegetable, until my shift ends. The job isnt even that hard, its just basic clerical and bookkeeping tasks but they're treating me as if Im not capable enough and cannot be trusted with the responsibilities. I also learned that they have this stupid policy where probationary employees have to take a total of 5 exams because this will be their basis of making you their permanent employee. If you fail even one of these exams, the company basically has the right to terminate you. And on top of that, I am now earning 10k less than my previous salary (i knew about this on my second day). None of this was ever mentioned in the interview! 

I just feel so stupid and cheated because I thought they'll give me an employnent contract if I just report to the office but no, there was nothing. Its worth mentioning tho that they did pay me so I guess thats an implication that we already have an employee-employer relationship. But still, it wouldve been better to know what I was signing up for. 

Edit: these 5 exams are not related to my work. These are just for product knowledge and how to interact with the guests since they belong to the hotel industry",drypapayaa,1,1.0,0,1712076426,2024-04-02 16:47:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu3j40/planning_to_quit_after_2_weeks_of_being_on_the/,4,2024

I interviewed for it and was successful. They have now asked me if I would like to accept. The way the interview was conducted/organised leads me to believe that probably very few people applied for it and the problem is after the interview I don’t feel like moving anymore. The new office where I’d be based is the most depressing place on earth and the role itself does not interest me the more I learn about it. I also did not get a good vibe from one of the guys I would be working closely with.

How would you go about declining this offer? I’m slightly concerned it will look bad and they will be pressing for reasons why, but as long as I don’t accept it and then decide to turn it down it shouldn’t be an issue right?

1bu351u,Switch Back to FTE At New Company with Pay Cut,"Hello, I'm gonna try and keep this to the point. I've been a W2 contractor for just over a year now and it's been pretty great overall. I'm making great money even with the lack of benefits, pto, etc. That's the thing though, I've recently switched roles at my contractor position and I really do NOT like the current work. It is tedious, stressful, and really bothering me overall and the pay is the only thing keeping me from completely losing my mind.

&#x200B;

I am *likely* to receive an offer for a full-time position at new company that is equally as large and profitable. However, the one issue is there's about a 17%-18% pay cut... Now I know contractors typically make much more money due to the lack of benefits, pto, taxes, etc. but I'm wondering if this pay cut is too large even though it may be a more secure job with all the benefits etc. Here's a break down:

&#x200B;

* Current Contractor Role:
   * 60$ an hour ($124,800 Annually)
   * No PTO/Vacation
   * Terrible Medical, Dental, etc.
      * I pay 500$ a month for marketplace healthcare instead of their ridiculous ""coverage""...
   * The job sucks! The ""culture"" sucks! I DO NOT feel valued at all even though I have received a ton of good feedback.
   * Contract seems likely to renew but technically expires 12/31/2024
      * I started 02/13/2023 so it's a long term contract (up to 3 years)
   * Management and culture puts me off. The people at my staffing agency are cool overall though.
   * Not feeling very secure in my role
      * They always say ""if/when you get hired full-time"" but the company has been on a hiring freeze since I started over a year ago.

&#x200B;

* Potential New full-time Role:
   * 49$ - 50$ an hour (103,000 - 105,000)
      * likely 103,000 according to the recruiter
      * 17% -18% pay cut...
      * I tried to get 110,000 annually but she said that wasn't going to happen.
   * Large, old, global corporation that likely has solid benefits
      * I'll pay much less in medical, dental, etc.
      * 401k matching, annual bonuses (apparently)
      * PTO/Vacation
   * Based off the interviews, the company seems and feels much more secure and professional
   * The energy really felt right.
   * I do feel like I want this job more.. The large pay cut is making it challenging though

So yeah, I'd be taking a pretty decent pay cut but potentially have a more secure career path, much better benefits, etc. Both jobs are at VERY large corporations. I've crunched numbers and I'd certainly be able to live with the pay cut BUT I would not be able to save the amount I'd like to save for things I need like a new car. It's not that I can't save but it will certainly be a tighter budget. I own a home and live alone. My mortgage ain't pretty...

&#x200B;

What do you think? Do I jump for the *likely* better career overall and take the pay cut? Or do I continue working my current role that I absolutely hate for the sake of greed?",Apprehensive_Bad3397,1,1.0,0,1712075466,2024-04-02 16:31:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bu351u/switch_back_to_fte_at_new_company_with_pay_cut/,4,2024

1bu2jzt,Looking for the next step,"Hey everyone. 30M here and looking for some directional advice or even just something to help bring me back to appreciate where I am at. All advice will be read and appreciated. 

With that said, I got a chance to get into a union out of NYC. Always working with my hands and being a natural, I got into construction and got an opportunity to join Dockbuilders Union out of
NYC. We build bridges, piers, drive piles and weld and sometimes build some really cool stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed it through my 20’s. I had something to work towards such as becoming a foreman of a crew (specifically, I wanted to be the youngest foreman) I ultimately achieved that goal a few years back and while I knew I didn’t want to do this for the rest of my professional career, the compensation is what is keeping me here. Pension, vacation pay, employer based annuity contributions, etc. I now have a baby and wife and a mortgage (not a hefty one) I purchased below my means. However, I am completely over this lifestyle of commuting over an hour every morning at the ass crack of dawn to spend all my available energy out in the field doing physical labor. Long story short, I’m burnt out from this career path and am pretty stuck. I do not have a college degree nor the time to pursue one even though I hold the abilities and book smarts to do it if I could. 

I took a stab as a financial advisor during my 5-9 to see if there was an avenue there to pursue which checked off some personal passion boxes of mine, but I wasn’t able to balance my construction career, being a new dad, husband and second career so I had to drop the side job. 

Just not sure of how to take steps to find the next chapter. I hit the ceiling at too young of an age and I feel as if there is no one left above me I can work towards or a position where I want to be.

1bu2fbp,Close to graduating college and yet I still have no idea what career to pursue ,"I’m currently a junior at a public university in the US. I’m studying Public Policy after graduating from community college last year with an associates in Business. During the fall semester this year I was a finance major but I ended up changing my major because I wasn’t really sure if I enjoyed/ wanted a career in business. 

A large problem I noticed is I’ve had the desire for a career that would be considered important. I’ve recently recognized this desire came from a place of having low self-value and therefore hoping having a “high value” job would make up for it. 

Now I’m unsure what to pursue to be honest. Another problem I have is I tend to have phases of interest that change after a couple of months. 

I’ve also noticed throughout my life I’ve tend to taken a path of least resistance. In high school I was able to get good grades in every subject without studying except math. Because of this I’ve avoided math and careers involving math, which is also in part why I think I changed from finance. 

I’ve taken career assessments to try to figure out what I should pursue except the results always suggest a field in engineering or science. I believe this is due to having an analytical way of thinking, where I tend to focus on what the numbers and data say instead of ideas/emotions to form arguments. For whatever reason though, it seems the math skill of thinking analytically didn’t translate for me. It is worth noting though I have managed to get high marks in math courses (A,A-) in university, as I said before, I just seem to avoid them due to them requiring more time and effort. 

I’m posting this looking for advice as to what I should do, most advice I’ve read is about finding my passion, but as I said it seems my passions fluctuate frequently so it’s not really practical.

1bu23dp,Finally made it to six-figures and I hate it.,"I'm hoping for some advice or insight into how to proceed. I've been working in the nonprofit world for 7 years, mainly focused on fundraising and specifically grant writing. I made okay money, my highest point was $81k, enough to where I could live semi-comfortably, with roommates, and save.

In January I got offered a job for 100k in post-award grant management, basically to be a pseudo accountant for a hospital network, managing grant budgets for researchers. I saw the money and immediately hopped on it because this has been a big goal of mine for a while.

I hate this job. I'm not good at it (tbf it's only been 2ish months), but the systems they use are horrendous to navigate, it's somehow chaotic and difficult and tedious all at the same time, and I stare at spreadsheets all day. 

I miss the creative aspects of writing and marketing. But the money... It's so hard to go back. Post award is where the money is for grants, so this would more than likely be my future or I'd probably have to seek alternate career paths. I never knew what the Sunday scaries were prior to this job.

The second is a real estate sales/acquisitions position,

3000 draw with 15% commission (they expect minimum sale to be like 30k) and the expected salary is 80 - 150k (a 1099). It's a 5-10 min commute and another good friend works there.

1bu0pwi,A Grade 11 STEM student in the Philippines,"So I recently found out that medical schools in the states mostly cater to students who take Biology as their pre-med course. My concern here is that the plan I made was to finish college in the Philippines and continue medical school in the States but, the course I was planning on applying here in the ph is BS psychology or Med Tech. In the states Med Tech isn’t a Pre Med course but actually, a profession on it’s own. Here in the ph, you have multiple choices to choose from for a pre med course. My concerns go to as 

1. I rlly want to pursue psychology but since I wanna go to the states they said it’s too difficult to get into  the country with this kind of career. 

2. If I do continue Med Tech, if i wanna go to the states, I have to take it as a profession but knowing I wanted to go to the states for medical school

3. Accept things and just not go to the states but after all the studies but it’s even more difficult to go abroad. 

4. Go to college there in the states as early as possible but with cons like:

- too expensive the student loans there
- and to be honest science isn’t my best yet here I am wishing to be a doctor 

5. Or continue Psychology and maybe I’ll get into Medical school in the states but the cons there are, majority of the students are biology majors who have the enough knowledges with you who studies psychology.

6. Pursue biology in the PH knowing if ever I don’t get into the states with that course, the course Biology here will be useless unless you continue medical school here.

I really need a some what professional advice since going abroad has always been a dream but I didn’t expect the sacrifices I have to give even the career dream I want to take in order to make it into the American dream.

B.E. offers more options M.Tech, M.Des, MBA, MS, etc. but lacks IIT perks and going to a top university is extremely hard, I could maybe get an average/below average university.

I've completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering. After completing my studies I started working with one renowned MNC  for 1 year in SAP and then switched to other renouned Indian MNC in Product and Project Management domain. In all I've 2.5 years of work experience. After working till now, I realised that I can't work for 9-12 hours a day infront of computer since I am a people person so I am in search of a domain which is more of a people oriented and I want to flourish in management role and less tech oriented or desk type job. Please suggest domain like HR, Operations, Product Management, Project Management and so on with their pay.

I am planning to do my Masters now either MIM or Management related course. I have offers from these universities and I am still skeptical to choose from this:

Northeastern University USA
MS Project management STEM
1 year duration

University of Manchester UK
MSc Management 

University of Birmingham UK
MSc Management
1 year duration 

University College Dublin, Ireland
MSc in International Management

1 year

University of Sydney, Australia 
Master of Management
1.5 year
Master of Project Management

University of Queensland 
Master of Business 
2 years
Specialisation in HR or SCM 

Which one is best option according to ROI, PSW, overall cost, future job opportunities, recognition in India for job search if required and other factors as well.

1btuvdi,Are Partners allowed to have relationships with their direct reports in Big 4 in India? Need your advice,"The TMT Consulting Leader of a Big 4 firm in India is notorious in the company for allegedly engaging marital relations with junior staff over many years. The individual himself has a reputation of being rude, abraisive with his direct reports. There have been many complaints to all level of leadership but there seems to be no action visible by the organization to address this behaviour.

Are relations between Partners and staff permissible, frowned upon or not allowed?

There is no response to compliants on official channels and ask for evidence from HR. Processes in consulting are opaque and this person is responsible for all decisions.What evidence does someone have to give?

He attends Internal aUdit committees and board meetings of some of the largest companies .Would clients and industry forums be concerned on dealing with a person and organization like this?

Will disclosing the complaints lodged help? Who should this be to NASSCOM, FICCI, ICAI?

How does this impact the morale of the team and culture of the organization?

1btt8i8,Need help to choose a degree,"Hi guys. I don't know what to study in uni. I am interested in cs and I am proficient in programming, I know web and game development. But the market for computer science is highly competitive. I mean literally everyone is graduating with a cs degree. With all the problems arising such as the rise of AI, tech lay offs, ghosting and rejection, it's just overwhelming. And securing a position in FAANG is also hard. I can't even imagine myself doing leetcodes for days. I am also not really confident with my math skills. 

So right now, I changed my plans so I could have a healthy career. I am really good in science and I love doing studying it, so I am planning to major in health science. I don't wanna be a doctor and don't wanna go to medical school.

All I need is a bachelors in science in any medical-bio-related degree.

I had the idea to study pharmacology, but to have a stable career I need a masters or a doctorate.

Please give me advice on:

1. What should I major?
2. Is bio-related a good degree and has a healthy job market?
3. Should I really need a masters or a doctorate in pharmacology? Is pharmacology really hard as people say?",Fragrant_Noise_4608,1,1.0,0,1712045298,2024-04-02 08:08:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1btt8i8/need_help_to_choose_a_degree/,4,2024
1btr0i5,Boss takes credit in a very small company. Where can I turn?,"I work for a small company of under 20 people. There are few if any opportunities for upward mobility because all upper level roles are filled. Still, I’m highly highly capable, efficient, educated with a terminal degree, and aiming to produce in my early years with the company. I have one boss, and the two of us make up our “team.”

Over the last year, *anything* concrete that’s gotten done/produced has been because I did it. For efficiency, I usually draft things and then bring them to Boss for review/input— which I incorporate, but a lot of the time, concept to execution is me leading. Recently we have two huge projects that I’ve been doing for “us,”— but because he’s Boss, he has a title that makes it seem like he’s involved/overseeing (which is a stretch), and people assume so. I lead everything from all— and I mean ALL— project management on projects with many partners in different countries to production of decks and any materials or deliverables needed for projects.  My workload is overwhelming, I execute incredibly well, and recently I asked Boss for help and he said he was too busy.

A lot of the time, if he does anything on these projects it’s because I tell him he needs to. And he frequently will take days if not, actually weeks, to do the smallest tasks that I set him up for efficiency for by providing all needed information, deadlines, etc. I feel like I’m in a domestic relationship where my cognitive labor is unrecognized.

I know some of this sounds like, “Well they’re your projects, it’s your job! You’re just doing your job.” These projects are the only projects going on in my team right now. There are no other projects to work on, and Boss isn’t doing any projects independently.

Sometimes gives me credit by saying my name when I did something that’s being described to others; other times says “we” when I think at effectively a minimal advisory level, that’s not accurate. 

I’m at the lowest level in my org, and I know Boss makes more than double my salary. Boss has done a few things on strategic planning and low level speaking engagements that are valuable, but literally anything that has been achieved and produced has been me. I’m resentful.

I simply don’t feel I can go to the C-suite bitching about this, and the org is so small that I don’t feel I can talk to anyone about it or ask what to do.

I’ve started saying “I” a lot and keeping some of my work closer to my chest. Everything is documented… but it’s hard to point out he’s taking credit for something that I produced and he merely “looked at” but that our “department” produced.

I’m applying for jobs elsewhere but my industry has had layoffs and I feel really lucky to even be employed. Are there any strategies I can use to make sure I have credit I feel like I deserve? 

Also— when it comes time for yearly evaluation and potential raise/promo, the person evaluating me is Boss. I already feel him pushing back sometimes against when I try to speak the credit I feel I deserve. The more credit I take, the less he’s due. I just don’t feel like this bodes well for me here. 

Advice please!!",kat_spitz,0,0.5,0,1712036326,2024-04-02 05:38:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1btr0i5/boss_takes_credit_in_a_very_small_company_where/,4,2024

1btp7j9,MA grad looking to switch gears. Trades without frequent overtime/inconsistent work schedule?,"Hi - entertaining the pursuit of a trade career at least for a few years and would love advice.

It may sound stupid, but I am 24 and about to graduate with an MA. I had plans to continue my career in the humanities/academia with PhD to eventually become a full time professor. I did not get into the programs I applied for so now I’m in a position where I just need to start paying off my loans (they would have gone on pause if I went straight into PhD). I could teach adjunct but it’s a pretty awful way to make money, from everything I have heard. I do want to pursue my career in academia one day but for now I really just want to get my feet on the ground financially, even if that means doing something completely unrelated.

 I know there’s money in the trades, I’ve been doing some research, and I like working with my hands and problem solving. Things like maintenance technician, plumber, carpenter, and water treatment operator all looked promising to me. So there are really two conditions I want insight on:

1. Is it feasible to work in the trades for, say, 5 years then return to another career path? Obviously this means I’m not inclined toward a trade that requires super long training or certification periods.
2. Are all the trades super spotty with hours? It seems like almost all of them require you to be on call for overnights, overtime, etc. Do any of them have a more consistent work schedule?

Thanks for any insight.

New job: Better title (IT Support Specialist), 10 days PTO, 10 floating holidays, 2 personal days, 8 days of sick time. Also free vision, medical, dental, plus a stipend for lunch and breakfast. Bi-weekly paycheck I estimate would be about 2500 after taxes?

1btmwzt,How to “dress up” fake current job in interviews to show off skills?,"
Background: I had a tough last few years since graduating just 2 months before Covid. Had quite a few “almosts” and a rescinded offer (due to perceived visa issues at the time) + a very short-lived job in 2022/2023 which I resigned from since it was in a city I hated and felt very isolated and lonely in. I’m now mentally in a place where I’m ready to reapply to jobs and I want to find a tolerable yet enjoyable role and just move on (physically too) with my life. It does not have to be the dream role!

My resume barely shows any gaps because I lied that shortly after graduation (so from 2020) I’ve been working as a marketing manager (“promoted” from coordinator) at a clinic. No issues with verifying as the owner is a relative, although I’m not using their name for reference so the relation isn’t obvious. I’m also showing that I had a consulting llc on the side (not completely false as I did multiple interview social media projects for companies who then used my work and hired someone internally or magically paused hiring lol). 

Please no lectures on how you think this is unethical or whatever else. I graduated with a few idiots who used to come to me for help and got fired from internships but then still got great jobs during the pandemic due to family connections (no hate- I would’ve done the same if I could). Sure I’m not as experienced as I like, but I can learn quick. My question is, how do I discuss my wider marketing skills in interviews when there’s only so much I could lie about my current work at the clinic? They don’t have social media and it’s not the kind of clinic that would be able to, so I can’t make it for them. I’ve written that I’ve done more in-clinic marketing and events, as well as email marketing and customer/client outreach. However, I am highlighting my social media skills such as KPI analysis, creative digital strategy etc,  in the blurb about my self-employment work as a Social Media Markering Consultant. I’m not an expert yet by any means but I know I could do it if employed in such a role or something related.  

So in interviews can I speak more to the latter since I honestly do feel limited in how much I can fib about my salaried “marketing manager” role? Is it even ok to acknowledge in interviews that while my current role doesn’t use social media marketing, I am comfortable with it because of my “consulting” work?

1btmk52,Overwhelmed & lost,"I’m 38 and feel completely lost on what to do with a career. I went to college, have a degree and I’ve spent more than a decade in the same inside sales job. While I never liked it, there was a big level of comfort in pretty much doing the same thing every day and being knowledgable at it. I put in my 8 hours a day and that was it and never worried about work outside of work. 
Recently someone higher up left and the job was offered to me. Though something I didn’t want, I took it because of a significant bump in pay and felt I had no choice really because if I said no, everyone would pretty much write me off. 

Well, this new job is significantly more stressful because the manager provides little to zero direction and I’m in the spotlight which I despise. Im an easy going person that has never before now felt anxiety and now feel anxious constantly and work is always on my mind. 
I just feel so defeated no matter how much I keep telling myself to give it time. 

I really hate absolutely everything about sales and want out completely. I would love nothing more than to find a labor job where you put in your time and that’s it. No worrying about customer relationships, spreadsheets, hitting sales goals, etc. 

The big problem is i have a family to support and can’t just make a choice based on my feelings. I make close to six figures and I’m not sure what I can do in an unskilled labor job to make at least 60. I’m willing to significantly cut my pay to rid myself of the work stress and anxiety. 

I have always been a rule follower, enjoy structure and being a part of something bigger than myself (sports teams & band in high school where I was able to contribute but still be one in the crowd so to speak and not be singled out)

As time goes, the more I realize many folks don’t have it together and just deal with their situation. While I would do absolutely anything for my kids, I realize that I would tell them to do what makes them happy and I should take my own advice. Issue being, I don’t know what job I could do to help make that a reality. No matter what it is, it’s work and I don’t expect to love it.

1btmicr,Laid off but contacted by old manager about role - does this situation seem odd?,"I was part of a mass layoff late 2022 that took everyone by surprise. My manager (who i really enjoyed working with/for) lost their team of 3  

Just over 1 year after the layoff it looks like they’re rehiring for my role (slightly different title but similar enough job responsibilities). I was disappointed my manager hadn’t considered me or mentioned it. They know i found a new job but that i’m not loving it. 

Today i receive a text from said manager asking if i would ever consider coming back, that they have a role open.  They didn’t specify the title when i asked what the opening was - so i’m not sure if it’s the one they posted 2.5 months ago that was similar to my old one.

I was in meetings all day so didn’t respond again for 3 hours and asked if they had a few minutes to chat but they never responded (this was at almost 4pm their time, now its after 8pm). 

I’m not sure it would be a good move anyway

This just all feels odd to me, especially not considering me for the role in January or maybe they didn’t find anyone.  It’s also odd they didn’t text back about chatting about the opening even if it couldn’t happen today.

1btlnzl,New grad looking for advice,"For a little background, I recently graduated (Spring 2023) from a fairly prestigious public university in   the US with my Bachelor's in Data Science. In college, I worked fairly hard to get 4 internships under my belt (albeit 3 were with no-name companies, and my junior year internship which was with a mid-large sized company was a technical consulting role). In November of 2023, I had a full-time offer for my junior year internship in technical consulting which had a start date for this March, but it got rescinded due to market circumstances, leaving me with nothing 7 months after graduation.

  
I was looking to break into the tech market as a software engineer but it's not looking like it's going to pan out given the current job market and my search thus far.  I've been getting interviews here and there (no luck yet), but as I get further away from my graduation date, I'm becoming increasingly concerned that I look unhireable to managers and recruiters. I am really passionate about the field but with my non-computer science degree and unemployment stint, I've been losing motivation lately to stick to this path. I'm not sure what other options I have considering I have little to no professional experience in any other industries and fields but I am starting to lose hope.

1btlfwv,UK uni vs SG uni for Pharm,"Hi, I’m looking to enter the pharmaceutical industry in the future and I have some questions relating to choice of university and job prospects, hope that the community can help provide some insight into my doubts 🥺

I would most greatly appreciate you taking the time to read through some of my concerns :)

I’m currently a Singaporean citizen looking to enter university. I have 3 options:
1. NUS with full scholarship studying Pharm Sci, graduating with Bachelor with Honours
2. Imperial College with no scholarship studying Chem w Medicinal Chem, graduating with MSci with honours 
3. UCL with no scholarship studying Pharmacology, graduating with Bsc/MSci

Motivations for overseas (please do evaluate how realistic they are):
1. Gain access to the UK market, and by extension, easier to enter EU market
2. Uni has a better reputation (but it’s also not by a lot, unsure how industry treats a NUS vs Imperial/UCL grad)
3. Learn how to be independent

Drawbacks:
1. Insanely ex, tried applying for scholarships but there isn’t much available anyway and because Singapore doesn’t count as a developing country so a lot of financial aid isn’t applicable

Apart from that, my main worries are about job prospects in UK. Could anyone in industry shed some light on how receptive pharma companies / branches in UK are to sponsoring a tier 2 visa for an international graduate? Although I’m aware of the skilled workers visa that allows for 2yrs of work, I heard there’s a minimum of 38k salary a year, I’m not sure if companies are willing to provide that sort of salary to a fresh grad. 

Is the Pharma industry good in the UK compared to SG? And in general is there a substantial difference in salary and treatment in graduating from NUS vs Imperial/UK? If so, is it worth the 350k SGD I have to pay for a UK uni? Because this sum is by no means small for my family and I would not want to burden my family if I finish my uni in UK and in the end come back to SG if I can’t land a job in the UK.

Are there higher barriers to entry to the UK US market having graduated and mainly worked in SG compared to graduating from a UK Uni?

I also have some plans for future development, wanting to work in management in the future. What are some advice you would give to head in this direction?

And last but not least, between Imperial & UCL, which would be a better option to enter the Pharma industry, I have heard Imperial with a broader course allows for more flexibility but UCL goes more in depth into Pharmacology. Is it also worth it to take a gap year to do a year long internship since that would extend my studies by a year.

Sorry if I have bombarded you with so many questions but these are some burning qns that after scrolling through the Internet, I haven’t gotten a satisfactory answer to. Thanks for taking the time to read through and greatly appreciate your answers!",Ok-Hour-7901,1,1.0,0,1712019397,2024-04-02 00:56:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1btlfwv/uk_uni_vs_sg_uni_for_pharm/,4,2024
1btkxsf,Passed up a job offer. Can't seem to get over it. Need guidance/support to deal with regret ,"As the title says, I got a job offer about 3 weeks ago from a reputable and good company, which I declined. 

I declined it because it was a contract position whereas I currently work as full time, the pay was pretty much the same and the benefits weren't that great. But, it's a great and well known company that could have boost my career in the longterm by being associated with them. The culture is apparently great as I have friends working there (who really tried to get me to accept it).

I work at a startup currently where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm at a management position there and have made a name for myself in my field of work as I have good skills and competency. 

Now, since I passed up the opportunity there is one thing that's been eating me up: regret. I can't help but feel that I passed it up not purely because it didn't seem enticing enough on paper, but because I was too scared to take a leap of faith.

It was a 10 month contract based position, and its a company people don't get into easily despite applying  multiple times whereas I got in the first try and from the looks of it they quite liked me.

Since I said no, I've suddenly not felt very content at my current job. I had decided this year anyway that I would transition into a different organization, so as per what my friend said I gave up the best opportunity that was right there in my face. And, honestly, I've been dealing with painful grief and regret. All I can think about is how I would have been starting at this great new place in a month, how I would have loved the work culture and environment, how I would have had better work life balance, how I would have felt reassured knowing I have trusted friends there already. Basically, I've been thinking about this and ruminating on it consistently for the last 2.5 weeks. Nonstop. Safe to say I'm consumed with it, even if sometimes it's at the back of my mind.

I have so many fears. What if I don't get another equally good opportunity and spend my days wasting away in regret? What if I have proved to myself that I am a coward and couldn't jump the train because of my fear of change? What if I can no longer respect myself because I may have made a decision which was basically self sabotage? What if I never forgive myself? 

Every time something inconvenient happens at my current workplace, the regret amplifies tenfold and sometimes I just feel so disappointed in myself I become paralysed and feel totally stuck.

I have no one to talk to about this and lean for support. I'm ashamed of bringing it up with my friends; I can feel their judgement when it comes to this. I don't know if they secretly really judge me for making such a stupid choice and if I have lost respect in their eyes too. I am lowkey scared of sharing this with anyone for fear that they'll be like, ""you passed THAT COMPANY up???, but I thought you were a sensible person??""

I'm scared, regretful, disillusioned, sad and really unassured. 

Any advice or guidance, especially if you've been through something similar, would help. I feel like I've sabotaged my career in the longrun. 

TLDR: declined a job offer from a reputable org, consumed with regret, shame and fear, don't know if I've ruined my career, can't stop thinking about it, suddenly feeling very unhappy at my current job, disappointed in myself for choosing comfort over change, don't know where to go or if I'll find an equally good place to work at next. Need guidance and help as I feel stuck and consumed.

1btkcw0,Does taking a retail marketing role make my career retail only focused?,"Does Product marketing in retail, keep future opportunity retail only?

TDLR: does working in PMM for retail company often keep you within retail only roles? Would like to be within Ad Formats. 

—
Hi all! I am going to interview for a Paid Media Marketing role for a retail company, with opportunity to be PMM down-the-line. 

I’m currently in an ops role with a background in marketing. My current role has a low ceiling, no growth, and also is tanking (in terms of high potential for lay off). 

I ultimately want to shift into PMM, focus on B2B products, ideally Ad Formats or dashboards. My dream is to work at Pinterest or Reddit (clearly I love reddit). 

I am interested in this position i’d be interviewing for, it has a lot of growth potential, and I feel like it puts me into a role that works closely with PMMs and can be a PMM eventually, but I’m worried I would be subjecting myself to only retail as I’m noticing a lot of people with retail experience stay within retail.

1bthrzc,Company doesnt want to honor my PTO because they found out I was looking for another job,"First let me state that I live in GA Where they basically have no laws in place to protect employees at all. I currently work at a job where I have to travel every week out of state and work long hours. Ive done this for several years and I have kids at home and decided I was tired of doing it and wanted to find a local job. I informed my boss months ago I was actively looking for another job for this very reason and told him id give him plenty of notice when the time came not to screw them over ( he had no issues and understood ) well this past week I finally accepted another job and contacted my boss and let him know what was going on and asked him if I could use my last week of PTO due to me having to goto a dr appt and having to drug test and take care of a few things at home before starting a new job and let him know id be finishing out the next 3 weeks with them so they didnt have any scheduling issues and plenty of time to sort that out. I also stated that I know how companies get when they find out an employee is leaving they want to get rid of them soon as possible and not honor pto time ---my boss replied and stated this company def would be the company to try and screw you over and that he would approve my PTO as we had a slow week anyway with minimal work and to turn in my 2 weeks directly to him and NOT CC HR on the email yet and he would send it directly to them himself so they didnt try to screw me.  ( im not trying to screw the company over I just needed my time off that I EARNED and worked really hard for and gave them plenty of notice and was very professional about the entire thing ) Well today I get a call from another higher up in the company and he just flat out said ""i heard you were quitting and where did you get a new job at and bla bla"" so my first reaction is....how did he know...and why does even know considering he has 0 to do with the side of the company I work on...which I thought was pretty unprofessional if the news of it has spreaded across my company like wildfire within a couple of days. Now im sitting here thinking that im on my PTO week this week.....i know the company is going to try and let me go and not honor my PTO.  The handbook states that they wont honor pto time if an employee quits are is fired unless theyve been here for 10+ years. I have not officially sent in my 2 weeks notice yet and my boss has not approved my PTO like he stated. I feel like they are going to retaliate against me for this. Is there anything I can do? I just find it disgusting that I worked my butt off on the road away from my family for years and gave them a heads up months ago that I was looking for a local job....went out of my way to be honest and give them plenty of heads up etc and I feel like theyre about to give me the shaft. I will say the company is pretty sketchy with things they do for example:  


they change the handbook often and on the fly without any prior notice  
We get paid travel time to get to our jobs across country and now they dont want to pay us for the first or last 45 minutes of our travel time (yet want us to be behind the wheel of a company vehicle off the clock which doesnt even sound legal to me tbh)  
We get $70 a day per diem but the company takes $30 of it for themselves

and alot more i wont go into detail about...

&#x200B;

im honestly thinking i should have just lied said i was sick then just never came back to work after i used my PTO this point. I just feel like its pretty messed up and border line retaliation. I also cannot find a single copy of the 2024 handbook anywhere on our website only the 2023 handbook to review the updated handbook....but im afraid to ask HR at this point especially considering the changes the recently made with no notice and it upsetted pretty much every employee.... anyone have any advice? or should i just use this as a lesson learned and just never be honest with an employee and do the right thing from this point forward lol?",Hoggbox,0,0.5,5,1712010296,2024-04-01 22:24:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bthrzc/company_doesnt_want_to_honor_my_pto_because_they/,4,2024
1bthqyd,Got a Toxic Boss but I’m short on references,"Basically, I was unemployed through the pandemic which hit right after I graduated college, so there is a sizable gap in my resumé.  I have served in a leadership role in an office at my local university for the last 2 years, and there’s a job I want to apply for that’s a perfect fit.

Unfortunately, my boss is kind of a toxic person. I had hoped that she and her boss would someday be great references for me, but this woman has a long history of starting drama and being petty, and she is close friends with her boss. I am on pretty good terms with her personally, so normally I would expect a good reference, but another employee recently put in his 2 weeks, so we will be extremely understaffed if I leave as well. Because of this, I think there’s a non-zero chance that she agrees to serve as a reference and then deliberately sabotages it to keep me around.

If I don’t use her or her boss as references, then the only supervisor I could use as a reference would be a retail supervisor from several years ago. I’m worried this might be seen as a less professional reference, or that it might raise red flags that I don’t have more recent employers as references.

TL;DR— There is a chance my bosses might sabotage me if I ask them to be references, but my references aren’t very good if I don’t choose to use them.

I can stop smoking until after the test and cleanse/detox no problem, however, I’m a daily grass smoker and have been for quite a while now (1 yr+).

My offer is contingent on passing the test, and in the offer letter i’m said to start 2 weeks from now April 15. Im not worried on how im gonna pass it, thats not what im asking. Im afraid of handing in my 2 weeks and for some reason I fail the test and lose my offer of employment, and I’d already have given in my two weeks, leaving me unemployed or with a bad taste in my current employers mouth if I rescind the resignation.

1bth90k,How to break out of tech,"Hey all, mid-30s, work in tech support, it’s sapping my will to live. I’ve worked at an online bank, a collections agency, sales, customer support, and for a while now, tech support. I have major ADHD inattentive, meds do nothing but kill my appetite. In an industry where we are nothing more than a productivity chart, my struggles with focus and consistency are a huge issue. To be clear, I get the work done and I do it well, at the cost of my mental health and, too frequently, my personal time.

I’ve got 30 days off coming up (the only decent benefit they haven’t stripped us of since my start, earned by enduring half a decade of micromanagement and sticking out the game of having 12 metric goals, thus, always something to threaten your livelihood with). I would love to spend that 30 days plotting my escape into a different field.

Something enjoyable is the dream, but more importantly I need to hit the ground running making $70k. I have dependents and am the sole earner in a major metropolitan area, so I can’t afford a pay cut. Around here, $70k is a small 2br 1 bath, $40 for the train and walking when I can, and maybe a weeks worth of decent food to supplement the three weeks of grind food.

So, please go easy on me. I feel like the walking dead and I just don’t have much more in me. Do I have options or am I just supposed to keep counting my blessings while my mind rots away?

1bth4a0,Masters degree dilemma ,"Hello, 

I am 23 years old , I have been working 3 years as a software engineer. I have a bachelors degree (4years). 

I'm thinking of studying MSc Software Engineering at University of Amsterdam which is 1 year of studies. Do you think it will add value to my resume?

Also, I know MSc Computer Science at TU Delft (2 years of studies) is valuable as well, however I could not afford 2 years unemployed. Is MSc Software Engineering at UVA equally recognised as MSc CS at TU Delft?

Thank you for your responses ",SpecialistBeyond7964,1,1.0,1,1712008747,2024-04-01 21:59:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bth4a0/masters_degree_dilemma/,4,2024
1bth2um,Stay or go?,"Sorry in advance for the long post!
Tl;dr - I work FT for a bank as a teller/loan officer and I'm unhappy/don't love it but I am stable in my job. Leave to be bookkeeper for family business and make way less money (at first) to be happy, or should I suck it up for the benefits?


Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any advice or perspectives you can offer. I currently work for a medium-sized local credit union as a ""universal banker"", so basically a teller but I also open accounts and loans. I am 50/50 on how much I like this job but it does pay the bills fairly well. I usually think of it as ""I don't hate it"" but lately for certain moments, I am starting to hate it... I am able to save a little and pay down debts without accruing any more currently, but it's slow going. One big consideration for me is that I am also turning 26 in the next month, so I will  be kicked off my parents' plan and will need my own health insurance. I just got married in August to a loving and wonderful husband who is supportive no matter what, and we have no kids so no worries about mouths to feed besides our own.

The good: 75% of the time, in person foot traffic is pretty low. Most of our customers are regulars and are very very kind and easy to work with. I like everyone I work with well enough. The incentive payouts for loan production are not bad. 

The meh/bad: the workflow is not managed well. There is little autonomy given as far as how you manage your time- you are expected to take care of customers that just walk up to your station without being called over, or invite themselves into your office, and these customers expect instant service, even if you're not ready. The concept of ""flow"" is pretty much impossible in this job due to the constant interruptions. It's honestly pretty infuriating. There are also many many ""nitpicky"" things about doing this job that are so beyond irritating.
We do get incentive pay as well for doing loans, however if your error rate is over 15%, they reduce the payout for your bonus by *25%* - and you don't know your errors until you've already made them (again, very nitpicky). Also, certain loan products that do not count towards our monthly goal, and that we do not get ANY incentive for, count towards this error rate. 
We recently did yearly reviews and mine got artificially deflated by my regional manager so that they could give me a smaller increase... I self reviewed everything either 4/5 or 5/5 (exceeds or far exceeds expectations), because I truly believe I do go above and beyond for this company. My direct manager comes over to me a few weeks ago, after I submitted this, and says ""so I agree with everything you entered for your review, but [regional manager] told me I had to enter all of your stuff as 3/5"" (meets expectations)...... Because they base your merit increase on your review, so giving me 3/5 overall score meant that they can only give me up to a 3.5% raise.
So I ended up with a $0.68 raise, basically $25 more a week. Like I'm sorry, but are you joking?? I bust my ass here every single day, even when I'm not feeling 100%, I give 100%.

I will add that mentally, I have not been doing well at this job as it has felt extremely overwhelming lately, and that pitiful raise felt like such a slap in the face. I've been working with my manager on strategies to overcome this, and I absolutely adore her, but there doesn't seem to be any concrete action at this point besides her telling me it's okay to refuse more walk ins and schedule appointments instead. So mentally not doing well, it has gotten to the point where I cry or even have full-blown panic attacks before leaving in the morning, around 3 out of the 5 days I work every week. It gets better throughout the day, and at the end of most days, I feel pretty proud of myself for making it through.

My husband has encouraged me to quit/put notice in on the particularly bad days, and says we will figure it out, but I really really don't want to blow our house savings because I can't suck it up and work a shitty job. The other part of this- my husband and his friend just started their own business this past September; they will be installing fences, both residential and commercial. They have already sold at least 5 jobs, completed 1, and have 10+ quotes out to other customers, so the business is definitely picking up. They are going to need a bookkeeper/executive assistant... Bookkeeping/admin has pretty much always been my dream job, either for my husband or for another small local business. 

We hope to have kids in the next 2-3 years or so (earliest to start trying is around *maybe* August this year) so this admin stuff would likely be perfect for that. I am actively saving towards this, and I'm 99.9% confident that I would not be able/not want to work my current job after I've had children. 
The problem is, I don't want to leave a stable job now for something that may only pay me around $300 a week to start... Under the table too.. that would really hinder my savings goals.
But if I wait too long and they get too busy, they may have to hire someone and then the position would obviously not be available anymore.

I'm honestly just not sure what to do! I know that I want to work for my husband's business and I would love to take the plunge now but I guess I'm scared???? I suppose with the health insurance, I could probably just go through a broker or the marketplace...??

1btgeqs,Job gave me a final notice today that if I’m late one more time I will be fired but I already put my long 3 page resignation in a week ago. What should I do?,"Hi I put my 1 month courtesy notice resignation in a week ago to leave a big company I work for. It was a very long 3 page resignation letter and I had a lot of things to say about the working environment of the company in the letter, both good and bad. Today I was written up because I have too many tardies and if I’m late again I will be fired. I have never been talked to before about my tardies before today. I didn’t even fight this because I’m leaving in 3 weeks and also because yes I am guilty of being tardy a few times. I guess I didn’t pay attention to my tardies eventually adding up, but why did they add up now? Why do I get written up after putting my long resignation letter in? Is it just a coincidence that my tardies added up after I put my resignation in or has it always been a problem but was never addressed until now because my boss likes me? I am very close to my boss and she looked like she was about to cry when she had to write me up, obviously this is out of her control. My boss’s advice to me is to just not be tardy for these final three weeks. What would you do if you were me? If I get sick or am 1 min late again I am fired. I kinda feel uncomfortable being here now, like now they want me out or something. Or I could just be being paranoid and my tardies just so happened to come to light after I put my long letter resignation letter in. Thanks!

1btgc4p,I keep making mistakes in my role. ,"Hi everyone. Back in September of last year (2023) I took on a new role, completely different from my previous role. I was a manager at a Restaurant to now a Financial Services Representative, who handles client day to day in a call center. 

I spent September - December studying for exams to obtain licenses, and do my training for the job. In January, I officially began my job. 

Since then, my grandfather died, I got sick with the Flu, and have had various health issues occur. So I have missed about 1 1/2 weeks in total. That said, I flew through training and had a really hot start, so I felt confident that I was okay despite those hiccups. 

In the past week, I’ve had multiple mistakes come through, pretty big ones. My manager has been helpful, but also stern and let me know that I should use these as learning opportunities. I’ve responded positively, but my anxiety has been going crazy because of this. 

We have a scorecard we get graded on and for the most part, I’m achieving a decent score (3.6/5, I’ve been told 5’s are nearly impossible). 

Today I logged on and the first thing I saw was an email highlighting one of my calls, and another mistake I had made on it. I proactively messaged my boss, and asked him how I can best handle it. 

I guess I’m just at this point, where I’m questioning my everything. Is messing up normal? Because before last week, I had almost no errors. And now I’ve had 3 in one week. Is this because it’s a newish role to me? I’ve asked my manager for feedback, and most times it’s generic “you’re doing good, just keep working on this one category”. 

I’m petrified of messing up so much that I get fired. 
I’m providing both for me and my fiancee, in terms of income and insurance. I don’t want to fail her, and I’m trying my best. 

What can I do to stop feeling so anxious all the time, and just stop making mistakes? Am I being too hard on myself?

Sorry for ranting.

They said that people are supposed to go in 3 days a week.

When I initially spoke to the recruiter and she told me this, I said that was doable.

However, now after going through the interview process and thinking things over, I don’t know if it would be for me. It would just be a lot of commuting.

I’d be willing to even just do 2 days a week spaced out. 3 days makes a big difference to me. Ideally once a week would be great. 

Is that wrong of me or something worth negotiating? I don’t have the money yet to move out and move closer.

A mission statement for a company is a concise declaration of its long-term goals, core values, and approach to doing business. A compelling mission statement inspires, motivates, and provides direction and focus.  
  
Similarly, a career mission serves as a compass, revealing one's identity, purpose. I use that for myself, for other people when I help them secure job offers or promotions.

I was lucky enough to land a position in a very highly technical company which taught me a lot. I was told I am a quick learner and because of my anxiety issue I was very eager to jump on thing for a reason that I don't get labeled as incompetent. with this company I was fast tracking everything and was well on my way to become escalation engineer. until mass layoff hit and company let go of 90% of its US  work force and move the operations to India. 

Now I just landed another position which is higher pay/ Better benefits and more PTO time then I have ever gotten but the problem is that there is no technical learning here.

1btdau0,"I landed my dream position, yet I'm burnt out after 6 months.","Hi all,

I'm not even sure where to begin with this. It'll likely come across as a really crappy ramble as I haven't slept for some time.

I've always wanted to enter a company that is growing, earlier stages being better. Having run my own small IT business for a couple of years (before having it ruined by the pandemic), I always feel the most comfortable in a small team where the entire heiarchy communicates directly with each other.

The job I am currently in fits this bill perfectly. A successful and trusted MSP with a grand total of 4 employees, a healthy number of clients and a working plan to grow even further in both. My boss is an amazing person and my coworker, whilst admittedly crabby at times, has given me invaluable training and access to a tonne of educational resources that would've otherwise been quite difficult to access... That's where my issues unfortunately start.

This kind of role is generally given to those who have a good 10+ years of experience in enterprise IT, namely systems admin, which I am not nearly close to. Considering the enthusiasm and knowledge I presented in my interview, my coworker having started out similarly to me and the boss simply liking the cut of my jib, I landed the role. Being in such a small company, I completely failed to realize quite how much pressure would be on me.

Since then, 6 months have passed and while I have definitely learned a lot and pricelessly benefitted from the support around me, I have also slipped pretty hard with my workload - using days I normally wouldn't work to catch up, not having the time to study the material I need to in order to do my job more effectively. The expectation on me is to balance everything out but I just don't have it in me - there's only so many hours in a day and I'm already finding myself working on weekends and public holidays. This is a combination of an inability to say no and guilt from not being nearly as talented as my more experienced peers.

While finances are thankfully not a factor keeping me in this situation, I am terrified of putting in my 2 week's notice regardless. My boss is a great person and I really do not want to let him down and make it so that his gamble on me has gone to waste. He's always had the time to talk to me and I am embarrassed that I did not let him know I was struggling from a much earlier point.

1btcqbw,Relocating should I change jobs?,"My wife and I are relocating closer to her family. The plan right now is for me to commute to my current employer where I work as a Firefighter/Paramedic. The commute would be about an hour and 30 minutes 2 days out of every 8 days. I have since found out that a municipal ambulance service in the area we are moving to is hiring paramedics. The pay is similar. The weekly hours average to the same amount the benefits are similar. With the exception of the retirement being a lower percentage once retirement comes. The biggest difference is the schedule. Like I said my current job is 2, 24 hour shifts over an 8 day rotation. The opportunity out there is 7, 12 hour shifts over 14 day. I’ll be home everyday but also means I will be driving more days a week 3.5 times a week vs 1.75 times a week.

The opportunity out by the new home they run out of 2 stations. Depending on which station you work out of the drive is 35 miles over state highways and the other being 48 miles but all interstate. Both taking around 45 minutes to get there. Commuting to my current employer like I said takes about an hour and a half covering 83 miles 1 way over interstate.

1btchor,My job is pushing me towards a promotion I am lukewarm about,"So last year I was pretty much voluntold to step in for my manager while she was on maternity leave since they couldn't fill her role with someone who knew the client well enough. My manager emphasized that I could do the role well so they trusted I could. I went along more or less because I did not want some incompetent new person to come in and screw things up. So I did the role, with no formal training or the required certification to do the job. And apparently I did well. So well in fact that I was awarded employee of the year in 2023. Came with a small bonus. Cool.

My manager comes back from maternity leave and all is well, but I kinda sorta wanted a raise or a slight promotion after all that work. [For context, managers role is 2-3 levels above me, so a promotion still would not put me at their level]. My manager agrees with my sentiment, and says they'll talk to the C-suite about it.

Fast forward to now. The results of that convo: they want to promote me to my managers level and give me her entire workload on this contract (she'll get a new one). They will also pay for me to take a course and take the exam to get the necessary certification to do the role. 

I am in shock, annoyed, dismayed because one: this is the second time I have accidentally girlbossed to close to the sun at a job when I do not want that level of responsibility, and Two: I don't know if turning it down will affect my growth. I wanted a small promotion, not the whole kit and kaboodle.

*Bonus points* they want an answer today.

Am I being obtuse about this? Should I take the promotion? If not, how can I turn it down without hurting my career prospects/position at this job.",throwingcandles,0,0.25,3,1711998435,2024-04-01 19:07:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1btchor/my_job_is_pushing_me_towards_a_promotion_i_am/,4,2024

Little bit more on myself. I am 24 and I currently work for a medical device company as a automation maintence/facility technician. I don't mind the job but I'm not too sure if this field is the field I want to stay in for the rest of my life. The commute is about 35 minutes, co-workers are alright, and there is some growth in the field depending on if i get my associates or bachelors. I feel like I got really lucky with this job and I don't want to take it for granted so that is why I'm thinking about this pretty hard. 

I've always liked technology, IT, and computer stuff. I wouldn't mind changing careers but the thing my current job isn't bad but I don't like it. It's paying me 68k right now and if I change careers I would most likely take a 20k or maybe even 30k pay cut. 

My question stays the same. Should I change careers and try going into IT? I am still young I know, but I do have goals I want to reach in life like any other person. Am I just over thinking things and I should just stick it out with my job to see if it's really something I want to do for the rest of my life or switch?

1btb77v,Options as a statistics major ,"Hello,

I am a 20 year old student studying applied statistics at a private research university in the United States. I am currently in my last semester of my undergraduate degree and in four semesters I will graduate with a masters in decision sciences and operations research and a bachelors of science in statistics with a minor in artificial intelligence. My true passion is music and music technology, but from my initial research, it seems that entering this field is difficult without a formal background in audio engineering or some related area of study. I am confident that I could create a meaningful career for myself in this industry within a couple of years, but of course I need to support myself in the meantime. This brings me to the main question of this post, what types of careers should I start aiming for after I graduate college? I want to have a job that will provide me with enough time outside of work to focus on my personal endeavours, while also being able to support a comfortable life for myself. One last clarification, my standard of comfortable living is not one that requires a particularly high salary, but having the freedom and flexibility to travel is incredibly important to me, so in an ideal world I would have a mostly remote job that still pays well enough for me to afford flights and cheap housing. From talking to people I’ve heard recommendations to become an actuary, a financial advisor, a data analyst, etc. I am open to any field and am curious to hear what people might recommend.

1btazqz,Toxic workplace makes me want to quit… should I? ,"I am feeling stuck in my job, and I think I want to quit. Can you guys please give me some advice on what I should do? Should I stick it out because there are lots of benefits to staying and the whole grass isn’t always greener on the other side, or should I make a change… and which change?

I have always been an overachiever. I love to plan, organize, think ahead, problem solve. I graduated from my state’s university in just two years (two years early) by taking the maximum amount of credit allowed each session on top of graduating high school with many college credits. While in university, I had a part-time, entry level job at the company I currently work for. After a year in that role, I was promoted to the department I dreamed of working in – our investment management team. I had an operational role here until I graduated and became an analyst. I have been in this position for one year, in the department for two years, and have worked for the company for three years.

I quickly have realized the downsides to working in this department. Every person (literally every person) working on the team is related in some way to the CEO and family the owns the company. They have massive egos and are honestly not very good at their jobs. I am looked down upon because I am young and clearly do not have the connections they all do. About 6 months into my working in the department, a man in my university graduating class (who’s related to everyone else in the department) was hired and he was given a title above me and an office. He does not do any actual work for the company. He just uses the space and company time to study for his upcoming licensing test. It might not be right of me, but this irritates me beyond explanation.

I was going to be promoted to be at the same level as the man above last May, but I’ve come to find out that the reason this did not happen is because one manager did not feel I had enough responsibilities to make the title appropriate. However, I have been largely involved on projects above even the manager that disputed the promotion. I feel like the significant contributions I make are not recognized. Also, in the department, you usually need to do the job you are aiming to be promoted for in order to be up for promotion. I feel this is not right.

However, there are benefits to this place. The culture (while toxic) is very easy going. I can have time off basically any time I want. I can generally come and go as I please. There is no micromanaging. I can work from home one day per week, but if I am sick or have any reason really my manager is alright with me working from home more. The department is moving buildings next month and I will get an office there (at least that’s what I’ve been told).
I wanted to work on the investment team because of the high status and potentially high pay. I also am mildly interested in the stock and bond markets. For me, it is more of ‘well the market isn’t going away, and people are going to win. Might as well learn to play so I can win.’ … if that makes sense. I think I want a remote asynchronous job. I want to learn more about myself. I want to be able to work wherever and whenever I want. I love to read and write. Like I said before, I am good and love planning, organizing, problem solving, and thinking ahead. Money is important to me. I currently make $50k a year in this position. My manager makes around $200,000 a year.

1bt9m9v,Should I stay in a 'perfect' job that isn't for me?,"I am a biomedical engineer, however, I wasn't able to find a job within my area of expertise for a year after graduating, so I started applying to other things. I got to a big telecommunications company with great pay and benefits, a good work-life balance (although I start at 6am) and an amazing work environment. Everything is great except for the work, I have no interest in telecommunications and working there just really drains me entirely and I'm not good at it, at all so it's very stressful as well which has impactes a lot on my mental health, all the time I feel like someone's sotting on my chest.

I've been working there for over a year, actually I tried to quit last October but they told me I should wait until I get another job and in the meantime I could stay there with them. I haven't left the job because it's a good pay and I wouldn't like to lose the economic stability, and I've been looking for a job but I have been getting nothing but rejections, not even interviews, or nothing that really interests me. There are some jobs that I can get in with my degree but they wouldn't even have the half of what I'm getting at my current job and also those are not jobs that I would like to get in either.

I'm thinking of getting into a course in sleep studyor maybe a masters, but I'm afraid I won't be able to get a job in that either. My main interests are biomechanics and neurosciences but in my country it's very scarce the possibility of getting a job on that. 

I just feel I can't keep going at this job, but I'm stuck between staying where I'm not doing well or leaving to the uncertainty of getting a job.

At this point I feel like I should quit and try to work on my mental health because I've got a lot of issues aside from work, but I feel it would be changing this issue to the issue of not having a job...

1bt5ulg,What are some of the best online programming courses / bootcamps?,"  
Hi everyone, I am 26 and I have been coding for about 2 weeks on FreeCodeCamp and I have realized I quite like it! I am currently learning HTML and CSS, so I haven't started programming yet.  
I need some information on online courses / bootcamps. My goal is to learn as much as possible in around 6/8 months (I am not considering going to uni), create many projects and then land a job.  
First of all: I don't know much about the web dev world. I know there are many paths one can take, how did you people choose your path? I am curious about your experiences.  
I have read somewhere to try and take the Coursera course for free to see if I like programming. Here is the link to their courses in web development: https://www.coursera.org/search?query=web%20development. Do you recommend one more than another?  
Do you recommend another approach altogether? Are there some paid online courses that in your opinion are better? Some bootcamps that could really help?  
Thank you so much for your time and patience. Please be nice, I am just starting out and I really need some help figuring some stuff out.

1bt42ou,When to reject a job offer?,"I am interviewing tomorrow for an internal promotion. I am aware that I am one of the top candidates as my boss told me how excited he is to potentially work alongside me. I have applied for this position two times in the past six years so it’s pretty exciting to find out I was a top candidate. 

The problem becomes that after sitting down and really thinking about it, I have a lot going on in my life the next six months that I don’t think I’m able to take on a position like this. It would completely change my work hours and my days off and would require me to entirely miss out on half of important event that I have to attend. So it comes down to money versus happiness.

I haven’t come to the decision if I will actually reject the job offer if I’m given it. I think it would just decide on the money aspect. They haven’t let us know yet the salary range and I figured I’d ask at the interview tomorrow. If the offer is less than a certain amount, I would reject the job offer, but if it was higher, I would choose the money over the important events as the money would be life-changing. (Just for an example. Let’s say I make 50K now it would have to be at least 85K or higher for me to accept.)

I guess my question is, what would be the professional way to reject the job offer if the money is not worth it? I don’t want to lose the current relationship I have with my boss, nor do I want to be no longer considered if this position opens again six months from now where I’d be more freely able to accept it.

1bt3q1x,Looking for suggestions,"Hi there, I am needing help in trying to find a new job/path for me. I currently work 100 or so hours  a week, and am hitting my breaking point where I just can't keep living like this.

I have previously worked as an executive assistant, low voltage electrician, youth sports coach, preschool worker, sales, and as an expediter in a restaurant. 

Currently getting 2 degrees, one in early childhood education and one in financial management.

Is it possible to find a job with any of this background that will pay a livable wage? Realistically I know it would be hard to make the income I am making now with just one full time job (my monthly take home pay divided by 160hrs is over $30 an hour) but I really am struggling to continue to work like this. I want to be able to live my life, have  a bit of freedom, not sit and work 14-16 hour days, 7 days a week. 

&#x200B;

I keep thinking about going back to the trades, the only thing holding me back is the discrimination I may face from potential coworkers (since I am a female), and the fact that it will take a while to build back up to a decent pay.

I know the financial management degree will help a lot once I receive it, but that will not be until next year.

First of all, I'd like to thank you for your attention.  
  
I hope I can summarize while giving the full context to where I need help.  
  
I am a 27 year old, working as a Business Development Manager in a home services platform (2.5 years here). Previously, I have worked for 2.5 years at a Big4 in Consulting.  
  
I currently manage a small team of people responsible for improving our product, growing our revenue and increasing our customer base. So far, we have  
  
I'm from Southern Europe, and I have always had the ambition to move to Dubai. I'm looking to land either a Business Development Manager position or an Account Manager position.  
  
Ever since I was a little kid, it has been a goal of mine. I remember the first time I heard about Dubai was when The World (the artificial islands shaped as the world) were announced. I must have been 5 or 6 years old but that memory is clear as water in my mind.  
  
Last month, I finally visited Dubai for a week with my girlfriend, and we fell in love with the place.  
  
It's not just the higher salaries an tax free, but the way we felt (safety, the way everything works, etc) made it feel like it would really be the next logical move for my career.  
  
I have been trying for a while now to move to Dubai. Last year, I was just pressing on Easy Apply on Linkedin to anything that fit me, even if it was a longshot, but since february'24 I improved my methods and have rebuilt my CV, improved my Linkedin (even changed the location to Dubai) and have been reaching out to people directly in DM's with a brief introduction and trying to connect with them.  
  
The success rate of this approach hasn't been great either. Maybe 1 in 10 reply back and the responses are usually fairly generic, so it doesn't lead to anything else. Sometimes I insist and do some follow ups but so far I have 2 or 3 things that may develop into something.  
  
I am curious to know what you would recommend for me to do, to improve my odds to move there and land a nice position.  
  
I really wanna make this change over the next couple of months.  
  
I feel like my skillset and drive to make things happen make me a great candidate.  
  
I know everyone can say that but my track record does help to back it up.  
  
What would you do in my situation? How would you improve the odds of being noticed and hired by recruiters?

I haven't enjoyed any job I've had, despite being successful. I want to find something I'm passionate about- either a job or something I can turn into a business.

  
I'm an engineering manager, but do not like working- and I haven't really enjoyed any jobs I've had so far. I love the people I work with, and I do well in all of my roles... but I just really dislike being there, and can get quite stressed out about work issues.

  
My current staff and I work hard but it feels like we're underappreciated. There are always urgent issues that come up that we're asked to help with, which prevents us from working on larger improvement projects. Then it feels like we're not achieving our goals... It feels like we can't win.  
In previous jobs I've experienced varying degrees of the same things- but mostly just not feeling connected with what I'm doing. 

It also feels like I'm the only one faking wanting to be there. Other people seem passionate about their work and to genuinely care. I really could care less if the company does well or not.

  
I have always felt a pull to running my own business. I've started a few and one reached 6 figures before dropping to zero.  
I love the outdoors (hiking, camping, boating, cottaging etc.). I love to design, build and fix things (physical products). I also really enjoy learning about different businesses and how they work.

  
I need to have a business (or job) that I can do remotely and ideally would have a flexible schedule. We like to move around a lot and work remotely from different locations.

  
For the past 10 years I've spent way too much time trying to figure out what I should do. I've tried several different things and still don't feel any closer to figuring out a way to make money that doesn't suck the life out of me.

I went into thjs degree back in 2020 becuade I thought that it had value and my family also told me that being a engineer would net me great results but I'm extemely miserable in my classes, struggling to even pass and although I have 10 courses left, I genuinely don't know if I can pass them due to how hard these courses are.

As a result, I've been thinking of quitting engineering and I thought that finance could be a better option. I took a intro to finance course as a elective and loved it. My GPA is relatively average 3.09 so I think i could get into a finance program although probably not a very good one but at least one with coop.

The thing is, I'm 22 years old and I really fkn regret having spent so much time on engineering. To be clear, I don't care abt passion or things like that, I genuinely just wnat to make money and work a job that isn't torture. That's abt it. I don't care abt solving issues or anything like that. 

Is this career switch stupid? I genuinely am incredibly miserable and I've communicated to my family that I am going through mental health issues due to just loathing engineering and struggling so much bur they tell me since I'm near the end to just push through it but it's too hard for me to do so so I genuinely don't know what to do.

1bsy5ip,Salary negotiations: Reflecting on missed opportunity and moving forward ,"I joined a new company last November after being contacted by a recruiter for a consultancy position. However, the salary was never disclosed during the initial discussions. I eventually agreed to a salary of 85k, which was a 40% raise from my previous position.

Midway through the process, another recruiter contacted me and revealed that the position offered a salary of 120k plus expenses, which the first recruiter had not disclosed. Despite this, negotiations were already at an advanced stage, so I proceeded with the agreed-upon 85k salary and joined the company.

Now, I can't help but feel a sense of regret. I believe I should not have disclosed my previous salary to the recruiter, which may have led to undervaluing myself in the negotiation process. Even the company seemed surprised by the low salary I quoted.

While I did receive a substantial raise from my previous position, I can't shake the feeling that I missed out on a higher salary. Am I being greedy and ungrateful? 

Should I consider asking for a raise just five months into the job or Should I wait a year before approaching the subject?

I decided to get a server job at a more upscale restaurant in the meantime as I know I'm capable of doing that, but still, thoughts of self doubt and anxiety eat away at me. For some reason I feel like I dont belong and that I stick out like a sore thumb, that people dont like me, and that I'll mess up and that I'll ultimately realize that I grew up in a privileged way where I became soft and its too late to turn my life around. They gave me a menu test and I got every question right. They said I'm the only person to never miss one question. But I still cant shake these feelings that I suck. It doesnt help that the owner is verbally abusive to his employees and called me ignorant in a company meeting in front of everyone. I'm only working this job until I find out what I'll do next. After each shift I'm exhausted to the point where I just want to sit around and zone out because I dont see a way out. I'm also a chronic over thinker, and I beat myself up thinking ""you just got this job. of course you'll feel nervous. why cant you just relax? do other people feel this way too? why dont they show it?"".  


I'm thinking of taking online classes to become a teacher because I love trying to help young people, or maybe a career where I can be outdoors, because that's where I feel happiest and most natural. The problem is, this is the first time I've had to think long and hard about what I'll do next, but being single and 38, I feel like I should have my life together by now and have a family and kids, but instead I'm here.  


The weirdest part is I know I'm smart. I know people who are much less intelligent than me (I'm not trying to diss them. they're great and talented people), but much more successful, and they even encourage me to go into certain fields, saying I'd do great because I'm smart. The problem is I have so much self doubt, and quite frankly, I feel no desire to work really hard at something I'm not sure I'll like. I almost feel like I'm at a point where I need to decide on something and go for it regardless of if I'm passionate about it, because I need to earn enough money to set up a life for m and a future family, and that I'm too old to have the privilege of ""going for my dream"".   


The worst part is I'm pretty sure I'm wrong, I just dont see a path forward for myself. Have any of you dealt with something similar? Its really stressing me out.

1bswc83,Salary expectations as a career shifter.,"Hi. I am a phone banker sa isang financial institution with Metro Manila. My basic salary is 22k since this is my first job. I am a year and half na sa industry pero I'm planning to shift career and balak ko bumalik sa province dahil hindi na din kaya ng mental health ko knowing na walang ibang pwedeng kasama parents ko na matatanda (only child ako btw), plus andamjng expenses sa manila kahit anong tipid mo, plus ayoko na ng calls. Now I plan to apply in this company within the province. It is for HR role. Hybrid setup. Free shuttle. For basic salary 16k offer nila for fresh graduates. 

Question: Is it okay to expect 20k from them even though career shifter ako? Or need ko din i-closely align salary expectations ko like I am a fresh graduate?

1bsvruo,35 and clueless about career direction.,"I (35M) have a masters in environmental engineering but I don't like the field. I chose to do it purely because it sounded cool and had the grades to get into the course. I completed the masters back in 2014 but have no experience of any kind in the field after graduating. I didn't bother looking for jobs because of my failing mental health at the time.  
  
Since 2014 I have been freelancing on small art and illustration projects on Fiverr. This is because I have always had an interest in drawing and painting. However, even after all these years I am still doing the same kind of work as 10 years ago. I haven’t been able to scale or earn more over the years.   
  
After working from home for so many years, I have developed extreme anxiety and depression. It has become difficult for me to meet people and face the real outside world. I feel like an imposter for working in the field of art without any professional training. At the same time the guilt and regret of ditching 6 years of engineering education is killing me. I used to be among the top in my class but now I feel so dumb and slow.  
  
I am very indecisive when it comes to choosing long term commitments. I was thinking about making a career shift and learning UX / web design. Or maybe bite the bullet and do another masters in environmental engineering to possibly open up job prospects. Please suggest me something that I can do to be job ready.  
  
 I understand that at this point I don’t have the luxury to pick and choose which career to follow, but still I would like a role that I can develop an interest in as I go along, pays well, and is easy to get into.  
At 35 I think it is already too late to start a new career because I will have to start from the bottom.    


What advice, suggestions or career recommendations would you have for me ? Thanks.

1bsur7o,"Pregnant, working with family, help. ","I wrote out an extremely long post but deleted it because it felt like too much. I’ll try to hit the important stuff:

I work at a job with a family member (FM) that is related by marriage. FM is very high up, and my bosses report to him. FM made bad choices so my blood relative decided to divorce him. I realized how manipulative FM is and told him in December that I’m trying to respect everyone involved and wanted to keep our relationship professional. My bosses report to FM.

I’ve worked here for a couple years with no complaints. Moved up from my entry level position to a higher position managing one asset line in the company. 

In January, I was told by my bosses that I’d be taking over two more asset lines with no pay raise. It’s an expectation that I do this because that’s what was envisioned for this role originally. 

I have also been talked to about “issues” with me since January. My bosses told me I’m too social in the office (they are both remote) and not getting work done. No specific examples were given for this and when I apologized to the manager in office for this, he made it very clear that he’s never heard a bad thing about me and that their assessment was very wrong. 

My bosses told me to focus more on my role and not some of my duties from previous roles. I was told to say no and be assertive. I was talked to about complaints by others that I’m unhelpful. My boss has read the email threads for this incident and doesn’t see anything wrong with them, just reiterated to be kind to everyone. 

FM has asked me to do things for him that have landed me in hot water with other parts of the company and I have had HR talk to me about chain of command now. 

I’m pregnant and asked to be returned to a hybrid schedule when I come back from maternity leave. I was on one previously but after the January conversation, I come in daily to get a handle on the new lines I was given. My boss stated that her boss and FM feel like it’s just not possible, even though 95% of my work is online. Also of note, the majority of the company is remote or hybrid. 


I’m really struggling. I feel like I’m being set up to be fired or forced out. I can’t quit so I need advice on how to protect myself and what to watch out for over the next four months. Thank you!

1bsugm8,Any nurses out there? ,"Hi 23(F) with a Bachelor’s degree in Biological sciences:)

I’m currently in the final stretch of my LPN (Licensed Practical Nurse) program, with graduation slated for July. My goal is to leverage this accomplishment by gaining valuable work experience until January, with the ultimate aspiration of being accepted into a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) program in the spring.

I believe that working as an LPN will not only allow me to apply the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired in school but also provide me with invaluable real-world experience in the nursing field. This hands-on experience is crucial not only for my professional development but also for strengthening my application for a BSN program.

I’m reaching out to the Reddit community for any advice, insights, or experiences you may have regarding this career path. Have any of you pursued a similar trajectory? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? Any tips for making the most out of my time as an LPN before transitioning into a BSN program?

Your guidance and support would be greatly appreciated as I embark on this journey towards furthering my education and career in nursing.

1bsu0ss,"Pregnant, working with family, struggling with my job. Help ","There is a lot to unpack so I’ll try to shorten what I can : 
I got hired at a company in which my family member (by marriage) is very high up, let’s call him Steve. 

After six months of starting as an assistant, I was moved to asset management to help get everything organized and under control there. 

For the last year and a half, I’ve never been in trouble, never had any problems, and felt pretty happy over all. 

Now the present situation:
Last September, Steve blew up his marriage to my family member and made some choices that left me weirdly in the middle of him and my family member’s divorce. Steve basically tried to keep me on “his side” and I realized how manipulative he is. In December of last year, I told him that to be respectful of all parties involved, we could continue a working relationship but anything outside of work would need to be put on pause.

In January, I was “talked to” by my boss and her boss who both work remote and are never in my office. They directly report to Steve. In short they told me I was going to be managing two more product lines without getting a pay raise, that they would give me a new job description to sign (they haven’t) and claimed that they were concerned that I was a distraction in the office because I’m “too social” with others at work. I’m the only female worker in our office and I work with 8 other men who report to one manager in office. I sincerely apologized to the manager in the office if I ever distracted anyone by being social. He had a conversation with me basically saying that he disagrees with the assessment given of me by two people that are never in office and that no one has complained one bit about me. He said that if anything, the guys come to my office and talk to me, not the other way around. 

I feel like I’ve been getting “talked to” over stupid stuff since then. Steve asked me to look into different vendors for something in our company and he would sign the paperwork to set up a new vendor. This upset two other sectors of our business that are under Steve because they weren’t consulted in this process. I was talked to about chain of command for that one.

My boss and her boss told me to be more assertive when people ask me to do things outside of my job description and tell people “no”. They want me to focus on assets more and helping others less. I’ve done this and now I’ve been talked to about complaints by people who are upset that I’m unhelpful now. My boss has seen the emails and doesn’t see anything wrong with the way I handled these situations but still, got talked to. 

Almost everyone in the company, including my bosses, are remote or come in two days a week. Most of my tasks are done online except for yearly inventory.  I’m six months pregnant and asked that after I come back from maternity leave, if I could have a hybrid schedule again. I was on one but after the January talk, I have been in office every day to try to get a handle on the other asset lines. My boss said that after talking with her boss and Steve, they feel like this won’t be possible. I’ve asked for a meeting to discuss option but haven’t heard back yet. 

I’m really struggling with wanting to go to work. I can’t quit my job but I feel like I’m being set up to be fired. Since I’m pregnant, they can’t let me go. So now I’m wondering if I’m being forced out and if this is being led by Steve. I need advice on how to survive these next 4 months and maybe more red flags to look out for? Since this is my first corporate job, I feel like I’m constantly learning. 

Sorry this is so long and thanks in advance for your help!

Lots of decent paying jobs and in-demand jobs require you to think fast, to multi-task, and to be on top of so many different things. It's reflected in tight deadlines or having pushy bosses and supervisors. Or having very high expectations of what you will need to get done on a daily basis, which pushes you to your max every single day.  
  
And I don't mean just jobs that pay six figures, like managerial type work. You see that even in data entry, secretarial work, coding, you name it.

1bst1v7,Where can I possibly go next on my career journey?,"Hi! Not sure if this is a good place to ask about this so please feel free to point me in a different direction if you think this should be elsewhere. I'm basically in a ""I don't know what to do next..."" situation. Here's where I'm at:  
I recently graduated from college with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering (May 2023). I specialized in Supply Chain and Logistics and had a Computer Information Science minor up until senior year when I dropped it (so I have some basic coding knowledge).  
I was an Industrial Engineering intern for a summer which was neat. I also had an Operations Management internship another summer, but was not a fan of managing people who were doing physical labor all day but I learned a ton. I have now been working full time as an Inventory Analyst for a major retailer since July 2023. I enjoy the thought of doing this job and analyzing inventory positioning, but feel as though the job and company organization are all over the place and I'm only actually ""analyzing inventory positioning"" 15% of the time and the rest I am completing tasks they couldn't get anyone else to do. I've often assumed this is how a lot of entry level positions are.  
I do very well at my job and am often told I will go far if I continue doing so well, but I don't think I want to continue working at the company I'm at right now for more than 1-2 years total. So I've started brainstorming options for what to do next and am at a loss and stressing out due to how much I really dislike my current position. I find that 1) I don't have any idea of jobs I could do next and 2) most jobs I find interesting have weird requirements I don't have and 3) I think the corporate world is not for me and that seems to limit things heavy.  
I would love to go to grad school but wouldn't be able to support myself financially and be a full time student at once I don't think. I gotta pay rent somehow, and taking out more loans for more school seems like a bad idea. I love the idea of being an Industrial Engineer somewhere but would like to avoid manufacturing settings and 5 days a week in person jobs (but 3 would be okay), this limits a lot of the entry level options. I feel as though I've searched every possible job title that someone with an Industrial Engineering degree could hold and I don't like the idea of any of them. I'm struggling finding something I enjoy doing because those things are all over the place: I like making informative resources (eg documenting processes, making training powerpoints). I like data and visualizations. I love excel. I prefer individual work over tons of collaboration but I still work well in a team. I love improving processes but less like production lines and warehouses and more like creating excel tools for repetitive processes I do at work and helping teams work more efficiently. I love organizing things (my calendar, my files, my notes, my thoughts, etc). I loved high school and college, I thrived on making flashcards, attending lectures, taking notes, studying for tests, writing essays, learning in general. I'm a typical type A girly when it comes to education and work ethic. I often say that I wish I could be paid a full time salary to simply attend different colleges all over the world. That's not possible.  
It gets even more difficult when I add in that my job pays me quite well, but still much less than I could be as an engineering graduate. I'm not sure what to do next. I've asked chat gpt to spit out job titles based on my interests, I've talked to my family and friends, and I just seem to get nowhere in my journey of figuring out how to not hate I'm doing. I know it's never going to be all rainbow and unicorns at a job, but I wish I at least enjoyed 60% of what I'm doing as opposed to 10-15%. Curious if anyone has any ideas for me. Thanks for reading my novel if you got this far :)",hgc1172,2,1.0,0,1711940832,2024-04-01 03:07:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bst1v7/where_can_i_possibly_go_next_on_my_career_journey/,4,2024

Since I started working there over a year ago, my colleagues who come from the same contracting company have been ignoring me and just hanging out with each other. I ignored them back and hung out with my coworkers from other companies (these coworkers were warm to me and included me in everything they did at work). All was good until recently a manager from my contracting company reproached me of not being close to my coworkers from the same company whilst also weakly admitting they've been excluding me since I started. Now, he asks me to make efforts to be closer to them. He even said we are a ""family"".  
  
I'm honestly pissed off since I don't like them and I'm pretty close to my coworkers from other companies. Besides, they didn't care whether I was close to them until I started having a big break outside of work as a speaker. I wonder if it's related since I literally got this reproach right after I did well with my activities outside of work.

1bsprgk,Struggling and Need Help Deciding Between New Job and Current Role,"I'm posting this from a throwaway account because my workplace knows my reddit account.

I need help deciding between a new job offer or staying in my current position. I (34M) currently work 100% remote as a database administrator in the IT department of the law school of a major University in Michigan. I recently got an offer to work in a similar role for the same University but in the Politics department with a \~10% salary increase (with a bonus). The Politics department is a lot bigger and they have a lot more staff. 

Here's the issue: I was just recently promoted to my current role. My current manager really fought for me and gave me a 10% raise this year to take on more responsibilities and some leadership opportunities like managing projects and working with new clients. I was assured that I was on track for leadership opportunities in the next 18 months if I continued to work there and excel in my role. Last month I saw the Politics department had an opening for the same role that I was just promoted too. I decided to apply since it was a similar position to the one I'm in now, and the modern technology (data lakehouse) they use is something I have wanted to learn to use and implement in my current role but was told we don't have the need or money to build one. Now that I have an offer in hand, I feel guilty and don't know if leaving my current role is worth it because the two positions are so similar but each has major tradeoffs; and if I leave, my current boss will probably hate me because they depend on me so much. **I'm losing sleep and feel completely paralyzed by the decision.  I can't get any work done and feel absolutely awful. Please help me!!!**  


**Current role:**   
Pros: 

1. 100% work from home
2. I have a lot of authority to make decisions about our tech stack
3. Co-workers are nice and manager is very supportive 
4. I just got promoted this year with a 10% raise. Decent pay compared to others on my team.
5. I've worked there for 4 years and management seems to really like me. 
6. I'm on an 18 month plan for more job growth (not official but that's the plan)

Cons:

1. Tech stack is old and no interest in modernizing it. 
2. I'm basically a team of one, my colleagues are mostly in help desk function so I don't have anyone to help me with my work. 
3. It can feel lonely sometimes since I have no one to bounce ideas off. My manager is not a DB. 
4. Manager is too busy to help me but promises they will try and make time when things slow down. 
5. Growth involves taking on more help desk and sys admin roles  


**New Role:** 

Pros: 

1. 7% salary increase
2. Opportunity to work on a bigger team
3. More learning opportunities
4. Modern technology stack
5. More resources available to support projects
6. More interesting projects to work on at a larger scale

Cons:

1. On-site most days (hybrid after 1 year)
2. Higher expectations for the role - they have a high performance culture
3. Yearly bonuses and raises depends on performance - must be top performer to get any raises
4. Haven't met new manager - they have not hired one yet.
5. The work I'll be doing initially is on an even older technology stack than I work on now (will get to use the modern stuff once I've learned it after 6-8 months in role)
6. The existing team didn't seem too friendly (I know one of them from previous work and they don't like me, I might be asked to manage them).
7. More opportunity for growth and management role after first year
8. Big organization, not as much face-to-face time with higher level execs
9. They have a lot of high achievers - not sure if I'll fit in or can keep up with people that smart and accomplished in their fields

Please help! How would you overcome this decision? If you were my manager would you hate me for leaving? I'm 34M with no wife or kids so I don't have a lot to lose if things don't work out but I don't want to be homeless in this economy.

1bspo76,Need a new direction… ,"Hello everyone. 

I graduate in 3 weeks with an education degree. I have 24k in student loan debt. 10k of that was a private loan I had to get to pay rent while I student taught. 

I spent 4 years in school, spent 40k on a degree, did 1000 hours of unpaid labor, and have applied to over 100 teaching jobs in 3 states. 

As of now I have had 0 interviews. 

I am done with teaching. It’s nothing more than martyrdom. Even if I got a job in my dream area I wouldn’t be able to afford living alone, I’d never buy a house, and I’d never be able to afford having children. Please don’t comment telling me not to give up on teaching. That ship already sailed and sank. 

I am looking for a new direction in life. I want a job that pays me enough to survive and be happy. In my area, that looks like about 75k a year. 

I know I have a useless degree and no experience, but I want to point myself in a direction where happiness can one day become my reality. 

I work hard and I’m smart. It also takes a hell of a lot to make me give up. (Refer to the 1000 hours of unpaid labor I did where I got yelled at and threatened by middle schoolers) 

I will do whatever it takes; please just help me find a path to put myself on. What kind of career, training, etc. can I pursue? ",Suletta_Wasureta2346,2,1.0,6,1711931073,2024-04-01 00:24:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bspo76/need_a_new_direction/,4,2024

1bspgt9,"Lost in career, think l'll get laid off soon and lose my visa, job applications not leading anywhere, any advice?","TLDR at the end

Hello,

I am a bit lost in my career, I am currently in the UK on a work visa and I believe my current employer and I will part ways soon. Which will mean I will have to find another sponsored job or leave the country eventually which I would like to avoid.
I have a bachelors in computer science, which honestly speaking made me realize it’s the wrong field for me, but it was too late for me to change. I then did a masters in information security in an attempt to move towards the less technical side of things, which I enjoyed more. 
My first work experience was as a research engineer, which included various projects but nothing in depth, I have had imposter syndrome throughout and my performance is pretty low which is why I am trying to leave to a different role, no blame on the company as they are trying to help but we don’t think I’m the right fit as the tasks are very open ended(research).

Also unfortunately I don’t have anything I’m overly passionate about that I could pursue for work, so money is purely the motivation, hoping I can develop an interest as I go a long.

Any guidance/suggestions on what roles I could apply for, or what I should focus on will be greatly appreciated. I know software engineering is the obvious answer but I am very weak in coding after several attempts at trying to learn it, which made me not enjoy it either. Will probably need a junior role where I can learn and train on the job.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you in advance!

TL:DR:

1bspdfd,Leaving 6 month job to move to Japan?,"So I was at my last job for 1-2 years (first professional job) then I applied to become an alt in Japan at the end of 2023 (it’s a 1 year contract). I thought I would be able to start for spring semester (April) but the spots were filled so I have a starting date for fall semester (August). I do have an offer standing that I accepted but I think I can back out of it early enough.

The problem is that since my start date is later than expected I applied for jobs (I don’t work at my first job anymore). Now I have a new job but if I leave for Japan I would only be at this job for 6 months.

I honestly feel really bad because I was quite literally hired to do a job. People here seem nice and it seems they expect me to be here for at least a year (there’s no time length contract just at-will basis). I could possibly stay here for a year and then go to Japan later. 

But then I’m indecisive because I feel like that’s going to take too much time and hold me back in a few ways. I purposely chose a job that wasn’t ideal because I knew I would be leaving. The cons of this job is that it’s low-pay and the location. 

Part of the reason they liked me was my audit skills and they have yearly audits. So I feel bad because it seems like they wanted to use that. They could probably find another person if I left but they wanted to hire me. I’d just hate to leave them high and dry. From an employer perspective it’s just shitty when you take the time to train someone and have expectations but they leave. 

At the same time it can be the other way where the employer can fire you at any moment. Or they just suck. The audit part isn’t even part of the job description either but I care too much. I applied to a job I could somewhat easily leave but I feel bad. 

The other part is that I’m still at an entry level point. This isnt like I’ve been in the industry for 10 years already. I think it be a good time to go now that I’m young and can do something like this. If I do go to Japan then I would come back with about 3 years professional experience from 3 different jobs (but it would show 6 months for one job and like 8 months for another job). But the alt job I’m not really going to learn skills and it’s unrelated to my field so will I even have a better chance of being hired if I come back? I don’t know how fast I can get another job afterwards. Or I could stay at this job for a year go there for a year and still come back with 3 years experience. 

Any thoughts and advice? I also just don’t want to burn bridges at my current job. I guess an excuse of going to Japan is valid but how does that look after 6 months? How would my resume look?",Mobile-Sun,2,1.0,3,1711930293,2024-04-01 00:11:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bspdfd/leaving_6_month_job_to_move_to_japan/,4,2024
1bspblo,27 year old. Lost on what to do after a military contract.,"Hi guys. Not sure if anyone has a similar experience, but I'm approaching my 3 year mark of a 4 year enlistment contract for the military. It's been an interesting one, and I won't say I hated it.

Still, people don't join the military for the money. It's seen as a ""last-resort"" sort of endeavor, and while I can see that, I admit it's helped me build self-confidence and life experience.

That being said, I don't plan on re-enlisting and I'm constantly fretting on what my next steps are. I have a BS in English Literature, minored in Japanese and studied for six years because of personal enjoyment, and I've never developed any ""hard"" skills, if you can call them that. Expertise that most people and companies look for like software development, CS, Engineering, Management.

I was considering going back to school for a bit using my GI-bill, but it's still up in the air. Wouldn't even know what to study if I did go back. Travel and working outside the country are on my mind these days, but it seems so distant given my limited experience and lack of expertise in anything particularly valuable. 

All of a sudden I feel a tight sense of urgency like I *need* to leave and do something now, while I'm young, otherwise I'll end up regretting never trying things.

For anyone who've had relatively smooth transitions out of a military career, how has it gone for you? How did you manage your finances, find a place to live, find the ambition to seek a new career path? Dusting off my old resume now, but I feel I have so little to add to it...",TheBigSmol,8,1.0,10,1711930166,2024-04-01 00:09:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bspblo/27_year_old_lost_on_what_to_do_after_a_military/,4,2024

I want to work in tech especially in AI/ML filed but I don't have any knowledge or any background. I did my undergraduate in finance but couldn't find a job in my field. It been 3 years already. What learning path would you recommend currently I am studying AWS and am planning to get certification on aws machine learning as well. Doing master's is also good solution but I am an international student, so tuition fee is really unaffordable for me. I couldn't find a better learning path so please give me some advice and which tools or skills I should learn those are essential in that field as well.
