1bsowno,Failing to see purpose in my accountant's career. How to find meaning and purposes again?,"
Hey Folks,  
  
I am a 25-year-old male who has been working for the past 6 years in one of the Big-4 accounting companies and made it to a manager's position within the audit department. The job itself is well-paying (at least for my age and experience). For some people, it's even considered prestigious to be this young and to be a manager on the team. However, I have been feeling that I somehow made it up there not by my choice (but rather was pulled up by my teammates, counselors, and managers - who maybe just liked me as a person?). I don't exactly know why I feel this way... however, it could be just a self-sabotaging thought. Along with that, because of the fact that I am being paid well, I am planning in the next few months to get a mortgage and jump on the property ladder (it's a very safe investment, especially given where I live - Ireland).  
  
Anyways, I am currently feeling super unfulfilled in this life, particularly because of my profession. With the whole AI bandwagon going around and threatening people's employment, I feel very much easily replaceable and hence am drowning in this feeling of blue and dissatisfaction.  
  
My fiancée, whom I love a lot, is a year younger than me (24 years old) and is already a doctor who is obviously working long shifts and hours in a hospital in Oman. I have intentions of moving in there with her and for her. She holds a very appreciative and well-regarded title of a doctor. She mentions that her work is very fulfilling and satisfying. This would be quite a common thing to hear from people within this field, and obviously, that challenge and difficulty is very attractive to say the least.  
  
In my own work, though, I feel like I am hitting the ceiling. Feeling very unambitious, not planning ahead for my next steps, not being hungry for work, for challenges for projects since I find very little meaning or feeling in what I am doing. I am currently just working on house-hunting (looking get a property) and am very much tempted to do something as sudden as quitting my job and going into a self-exploratory journey, but parallel with that, deep inside, I envy my fiancée for the profession that she has (and I think I have all the good reasons for that). I am very drawn to medicine but also appreciate the fact that there is just that end goal that I am drawn to, that feeling of appreciation, of respect as well as doing challenging and difficult hard work. I am someone who truly loves and cares for people and if there is something that I could do for them to express my empathy and my love, I would be the happiest man in the world...  
  
So far, I have done very little self-reflection on this particular topic (as it took me just 5 years alone to whom I want to spend the rest of my life with). However, I don't even know where to start from. I am caught in this existential crisis (I should say)? I am doing a job I don't like and never dreamt of doing. I am feeling like I am wasting my time that I could be spending on my true purpose. But even with that said, I don't even know at this stage what is my true purpose. I would like to turn time around and consider going into the med-field at the younger age when I was in my early 20s. Now taking such a risky shot (of going into the med school) would be very dreading and scary. As I am intended to get married, have kids and manage my family relationship, and jumping into a medical field amides all of that is just scary. Not even sure, if my lady would appreciate it.  
  
  
  
I know this feels like a massive dump but anyone who made it this far, just know, I appreciate and love you!  
  
Give me your advice fellow Redditors. What would you do if you were me? Where to start from? Do you know anyone who caught himself/herself in similar situation and managed to prevail?  
  
Any help is appreciated.

1bso0qk,How to go about leaving a job after only 3 months?,"I have recently started a new Job at the beginning of this year, have been there for 3 months. I have already started to have issues in the role, I have been given a tonne of work by another team and have received no support or even check-ins from my current manager. I have had to send her project updates unprompted which she doesn't respond to. I have had no one-on-ones since the first one when I had just started and generally don't feel supported at all. On top of this there is a weird atmosphere among the staff with animosity between management and the staff, and I know my manager bitches about staff members to the Admin Officer regularly. Between this and the fact that the two people I get on with are both trying to leave because of the culture, I want to leave already.. I have never left a job this early on before and I don't even know how to go about it. I want to start looking for/applying for roles.. historically when I get an interview I have spoken to my boss and let them know but in this instance because its only been 3 months and I really don't have a rapport with my manager I kind of want to just get out..  
  
I am worried about (a) getting another job without putting my current manager as a reference (if that's even possible as they always want to speak to your current manager) and (b) explaining to a new potential employer why I am trying to leave after only 3 months as I imagine that will look bad - do I just be honest?  
  
I have never started trying to leave a new job this early and I really don't know how to go about it.. any advice would be appreciated",LauraRusso,3,0.800000011920929,1,1711926844,2024-03-31 23:14:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bso0qk/how_to_go_about_leaving_a_job_after_only_3_months/,3,2024

1bsncdw,tell me if you would risk it or not?,"Imagine you‘d have one last chance to change your studies (financial reasons) your dream was since 5 years psychology, but you were always scared to try it because it‘s a difficult subject and many people are failing the exams and you‘re also unsure about the jobs afterwards. So there is this option Psychology. 
Then there would be becoming a teacher. Much more stable and your 100% convinced you will pass the exam‘s and you‘ll see your future more secure. But the School sucks and you‘ll unsure if you like this.

You only have one opportunity and if not you‘ll gonna be in massive trouble. So would you personaly risk it with your heart desire and psychology or would you more be on your rational side and do the teacher school to be secure?

1bsn5ud,34 years old been working same job for 10 years and I’m broke.,"I went to college and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management. I did very good in college and I actually saw myself managing a large hotel in a big city somewhere.
 Well during this time, I’d say it was my Jr year in college I got really into working out. I got a job at a gym during college. I really liked it, I made relationships with the members and I really felt like I was using my hospitality strengths and it was working. 
 When I graduated college I got a job at a hotel. During this time my father was very ill. It was a very stressful time. I was younger at the time, maybe a little less confident. It was a very hard transition for me. My father ended up dying. I was off work for a week but I never went back. I think this is my biggest regret. I never went back to the hotel, 10 years later I could
He way more ahead in life. Instead I went back to my old job at the gym. I grew my business as a personal trainer, I’m well known in the fitness community, it’s basically my life. I also can’t pay my bills. I’m really tired of this hamster wheel I’m in. I can’t say I regret my fitness journey because it has given me the confidence I’ve I always wanted. But being a trainer is very unsustainable long term. I want a family one day and buy a house etc.

So my question here is… is it too late? I have thought about going back to the hotel industry but I know I’d be starting all the way down at the bottom. Working the front desk just doesn’t appeal to me. I also don’t think financially it would be any better than where I’m at now. Does anyone have any advice?",ContentSquirrel7137,71,0.8399999737739563,63,1711924687,2024-03-31 22:38:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bsn5ud/34_years_old_been_working_same_job_for_10_years/,3,2024
1bsn5ou,Direction and advice please!,"Hi all! I'd really welcome any ideas or advice! So I've been working my way up in my current career for 16 years and I'm now a youth worker, working with young people in care where there's a lot of risks happening in their lives. I have always loved my job and I'm masters level qualified and I'm really skilled and experienced. My problem is that I've just come back from maternity leave and we are in a part of the UK that has no help with childcare costs and honestly - it's just hammering us financially and I've started to think much more practically about work and what my next steps are.  The problem is that I've realised I've nowhere really to go from here.  I'm already at a senior level and because of the niche type of work I do I'm on a decent wage for this sector. For me to move in to even more senior management in another organisation I'd actually probably be taking a pay cut and there's no sign of room for progression in my current organisation.  But I need to be earning more in order to have a better quality of life for my family.  So my question is - where would you go from here? I'm open to other career paths but I can't take much of a drop in wage in order to retrain so I'd need to be paid on the job if it was something completely new and I can't earn less than 30k or we wouldn't be able to cover our bills.  Is there anything that my skills would be easily transferable to that would allow me to go in at that wage bracket and give room to move up and earn more? I'm on a rate equivalent to a lot of social workers and don't particularly want to go into social work as that seemed like an obvious choice.  I want to do something more behind the scenes or managing people, I think I feel ready to take that step now and I've really enjoyed the management experience I have so far.  I have been going round in circles with this and would honestly really appreciate any feedback! Thanks in advance!

1bsn1jn,Seeking Advice,"Hello, I have been feeling so lost recently while thinking about what I should do with my life and what career is right for me.

After taking what feels like dozens of career aptitude tests, applying to anything and everything I can since October (with only 2 unsuccessful interviews), and graduating with a Bachlors degree in Organizational Management in Feb 2024, I seemingly cannot make anything work. 

Its making me question if I should go back to school for my Masters degree in a different major, or keep trying to find a local job... 

I honestly regret being a business major, but at the same time I do not know what I should have majored in in college or what career path I'd enjoy. I need direction! At least I know lots of others feel the same way, but that only helps so much. 

I am currently employed, but I hate my job and am absolutely desperate to move on from it. What should I do?

1bslip9,Masters Degree in Business Analytics? (Career advice) ,"Hello! 

I’m currently a Senior Analyst at a fairly large company. I run a lot of analyses leveraging SQL + Excel. 

I’ve worked my way up to this position, and learned nearly all of my analytical skills on the job. I have a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. 

Flash forward to today, I’d really like to go back to school for a masters degree. I’m leaning towards a business analytics masters program to really put a “stamp” on my name and learn some additional tools. 

However, the next position after senior analyst at my company is Manager. This position has many leadership elements to it.

My thinking is, obtaining an MSBA would still be very useful as I could coach younger analysts more effectively with a stronger toolset. I am however worried though that an MSBA may not be the most optimal degree given where I’m at..

Hiring managers/analytics professionals - any thoughts here? Is it common for analytics leaders to have MSBAs?

1bslbkm,From public librarian to private sector?,"I’m a librarian with a decade of experience in both public/academic libraries. The field has not been the same since Covid though. Sluggish wages, attacks from the far right even doxxing of librarians. 

I’m moving and applied to all the jobs in my field that are (on paper) hiring. I’m over it. 

I found out where I moved I can’t even be a school librarian because it’s an additional graduate certificate that is so many credit hours it’s basically a second masters. 

To supplement my income in college I worked in call centers and was good at it. I applied to some remote ones and have a few interviews set up (passed the screeners and simulations very easily). After I put in my time entry level I don’t what to do with this new experience (which let’s add insult to injury, pays more than a lot of libraries). 

Some ideas would be insurance agent or adjuster, underwriter or take a sales path SDR and eventually AE, or maybe HR or legal. 

I interpret data well and write great reports based on useage of different resources. Obviously I research well as a librarian but I don’t know what I’m looking for here other than suggestions or career trajectories. 

Trying to put the information science part of my MLIS to work. 

I’m 100% not going back to school unless it paid by someone else. I took out enough loans and will lose out on PSLF forgiveness if I take the private sector path.

1bslav6,Do you struggle with this too? ,"I always see posts here that I feel like are describing my life so wanted to know if I’m on my own here? 🤔 

I recently realised that I really struggle with sharing how I truly feel with people around me. Even with friends I think would always tell one person part of my problem and another person a different part. It was my way of protecting myself…I was actually quite proud of it…even though it was a real issue. I struggled to maintain any connections.  

Until recently when I started investing in my personal development. I discovered my true passion of helping women and started my own career coaching business. When I  actually wanted to talk to people to make new connections, I noticed that I was still uncomfortable when people asked me about me!! 

It’s so crazy and now I acknowledge that it’s been a form of protection. Through coaching on myself I am now choosing to consciously open up and share my experiences with others to create a connection to share and inspire. 

It’s helping me build deeper connections with colleagues, friends and event family! I was holding back with my own family 🫣 It’s still new to me I have to say. I’m really enjoying the transformation journey. 

Has anyone else struggled with the same thing and what have you done to work on it ?

I am sooo lost 

Im 19 , living at home and just dropped out of college for aircraft mechanics which sucked because i liked the it and i was passing with flying colours but i had to move across the country and my living conditions were horrendous.

I'm home now and took a job in a warehouse as a forklift driver. I honestly hate the job but I need the money. Im hoping people could lead me towards a career path i might have overlooked 

Im pretty good work working with my hands and i was always pretty good academically ( my best Subjects in school were science maths and engineering) although i wasn't a huge fan of school. 

I would love a job that has variety, pay is not too important but obviously the more the better, flexibility is also something I'd like but not a make or break.

Honestly right now i just need something to work towards career wise because the job I'm in right now seems like a dead end and it's eating me up.

1bskpq2,I am not good at anything? Am I mentally handicapped? ,"I am not good at anything 

OK so, I have always been told that I am very creative and I am good at things like drawing, and makeup. I haven’t pursued anything related to these things, because I just fear that I will fail at it? And that there will always be someone better than me. Some people just have a natural talent and they end up excelling at whatever they enjoy! But for me, I find that when I put in a lot of effort to learn something that interests me, I only get to maybe an average level and that’s it! I don’t WOW people with work! I feel like I took after my mom. My mom is mentally slow, and she is not good at anything whatsoever!!!! She doesn’t even have good social skills or the ability to empathize with others. I feel like with many people who have intellectual disabilities, even those people can  have something that they excel at, like for example, high levels of patience or making others laugh, which is a skill in itself!! But my mom, she is literally not good at one single thing! She is doesn’t even have the empathy or patience! She had such a bland dull personality and NO sense of humor whatsoever because you have to have WITS to be funny which she literally doesn’t have. She is just a complete and total narcissistic useless loser!!! The only thing that she is good at is manipulating other people and making other people feel bad about themselves, and OH leeching off of others. She’s just a burden man… She literally destroys everything in her path!! Ok so back to the story, I think my sister got the opposite end of the intelligence from my dad, because he was always so smart and witty and accomplished… the OPPOSITE of my mom. My sister has always made excellent grades, and she has always been better at drawing than me. It just breaks my heart that  my own sister got all of the high-level talent from my dad, but I got the shitty things from my mom… It makes me not want to exist at all because I fucking despise my mother… I wish that she didn’t exist. Genetics are so fucking unfair man. It really sucks to live in a world that is full of witty, intelligent, talented people when you are literally just… An average, and you have to suffer from low intelligence. This makes me fear that this is all inherited, and if that is the case, then that means I will never amount to anything in life! My mom never did! She is a total bum and a narcissist, and she married my dad to get a free ride in life, and she was never successful, because she’s not smart enough to work in high paying professions, which all require high-level skill. It doesn’t even have to be jobs that are in the medicine or science industry! It could be things like, working as a hairstylist, a waitress, or even a manager at a restaurant!! Those are highly skilled professions also but it doesn’t necessarily take a high IQ person to be able to do them either! She can’t even do that!!!! I DO NOT WANT TO BE LIKE HER!! I just want to excel at SOMETHING! Even if it’s just ONE thing!!! I want to look at something that I do and be like “WOW I AM A BAD BITCH” want other people to be impressed by my work also! This has never happened in my life! I seem to only be valued for my looks and that’s the only thing that I have ever gotten praised for! I just feel like I don’t even belong in this body! Like, I inherited the dumb genes..  but physically, I am pretty… Do you guys have any advice for me?? I feel like I will never be able to contribute in society like other people are able to because everybody is so intelligent!!!

1bskm4i,Need guidance on what to put on my resume if looking to change careers?,"I graduated with a bachelors of science degree in civil engineering in 2017 from a private school where I paid a lot of money and discovered it is not something I wanted to do.  
Things happened from bad interviewing skills to bad preparation when relocating and I was not able to land a job in the field.I had a short stint as an outside sales rep after college, about 5 months from December 2017 - April 2018 which ended because I was fired for ""making flyers for business"", and then another short stint as a retail sales associate for 7 months, from March 2019 - September 2019, which I quit without notice.  
I also worked as a delivery driver for uber eats, door dash, grub hub, etc. from December 2017 to February 2020 in between jobs and part time or full time when i didn't have a real full time job, which I stopped because of COVID which began in march 2020 and was collecting unemployment until it ended in September 2021.  
I was not applying to new roles since the unemployment ended and my next job was with my dad as a renovation construction laborer from July 2022 to November 2023 where I was able to gain experience in the renovation construction industry, renovating a restaurant, multi-family and single family home, garage, and laundromat.  
I was applying to jobs again and landed a new job as an assistant engineer for my state DOT working as an inspector in the field in November 2023 which I am currently working at now. However, I am looking to leave it and get back into sales because I believe they are switching me to the night shift which have work hours from 9:00 pm to 5:00 am.  
When applying to sales related roles, should I include my recent short stint as an Assistant Engineer as well as my Self-Employed Renovation Construction Laborer job so there is not a 5 year gap on my resume since September 2019, where I worked as a retail sales associate?  
This is my current resume:  
Assistant engineer, State DOT - November 2023 - Present  
self-employed renovation construction laborer - July 2022 - November 2023  
self-employed independent courier - December 2017 - February 2020  
retail sales associate - March 2019 - September 2019  
Outside Sales representative - December 2017 - April 2018  
Bachelors of science degree Civil engineering August 2013 - May 2017  
Including everything would make it look more robust, or just removing my independent courier work experience would be fine?My thoughts are that including everything would make me come across as honest but it may lead to lack of interviews because they can see that I currently have a job in my field of study and will discard it immediately due to it being unrelated to sales. It also won't make me seem like I was just sitting on my ass for the past 5 years.

1bskk5n,What should I get my MS degree in?,"Hello, I’m 23 and I graduated a year ago. My degree is cellular and molecular biology BS and I minored in chemistry. I started working immediately after I graduated in a lab where we evaluate seeds and seedlings. I am using my degree, but it’s not what I expected. I guess I took the first job I was offered before graduating because I know how hard it is to find employment as a biologist fresh out of college, without an advanced degree (at least, this is what I was told). 

I am paid $20 an hour but I’m not very passionate about this industry and I’d like to do stuff that is more environmental science focused or chemistry based or microbiology influenced…. or maybe some combination of all three. That probably doesn’t exist, haha. 

People in my industry usually cap out at $30 an hour and I’d like more opportunities for advancement. I’ve been reading about MS degrees in environmental engineering, but I’m missing a lot of math credentials and I have no engineering experience. I am willing to move back in with my parents to save money for an MS degree, and maybe even go to school online while continuing to work so I won’t go into crazy debt while I’m studying, but I just can’t decide what to study.

1bskhiw,My job underpays me,"So I work as an assistant property manager. When I got hired they based my pay at $22 an hour salary cuz I “lack experience” from the old property manager. Granted I know it’s my fault for not doing proper research but keep in mind I have worked 4-5 jobs since I was 19 to pay bills and I thought this was my break. 

So the previous APM was getting paid $25 cuz he lives in housing and specifically requested to get paid less. They based my pay off of that which is insane.

My coworker is now the property manager but he was the APM before the last which was only 4 months before the other guy left. He was getting paid $37. So in a 4 month span the pay went from $37 to $22. Insane.

My experience is working as a lab tech at Columbia uni and Fordham uni. I have also worked at 4 different offices at uni which I worked simultaneously two at once which four years. And a fellowship at a non profit for a year. These were all long term jobs (1-4 years) and I did a lot numbers work and general office things. I also have minor jobs but not office related. Anyways I have a ton of experience. Not in property management exactly but enough to easily transition into the role. 

My coworkers experience when he became APM was a sneaker store and reception. That’s it.

So when I get hired my supervisor said we can discuss a raise in January. They started asking me to help the new property manager (there’s two at this location) who has 10 years of experience and start doing tasks that the office manager had. Because I was looking forward to a raise I was like that makes sense. I also got my FDNY license that non of the property managers have when they’re required to have it, not me. 

I also looked into what APM get paid in nyc and they make six figures.

Come January and she says I’m not getting a raise cuz I lack experience and that’s the pay I agreed to when I got hired. I started crying cuz I live paycheck to paycheck and can’t live my life at 22. She asked about my expenses and how my rent is high. This bitch told me to move out of my apartment and find a cheaper apartment. As if breaking my lease, moving and starting a new lease wouldn’t cost thousands. She also told me to get another job, when I got hired she knew I worked at target and told me I couldn’t have another job so I quit. That was such a spit in my face. She also said I should be grateful for $22 since it’s more than minimum wage. I was infuriated and didn’t talk to her for two weeks. She asked to talk to me a few weeks later and I called her out on her bullshit and she was silent. I told her I won’t be helping the PM since I lack experience and that I’ll be going back to school and they’re gonna deal with whatever schedule I have. 

I feel so disrespected with her comments especially since I work the hardest there and im obviously not appreciated. I created the arrears system to help get money back which non of the APM have done. To expect me to help the guy with 10 years of experience (he’s literally slacking and that’s why he’s behind) but I lack experience. Then to have me fill in a role bc they don’t want to hire someone. And I get the licensing that by law they require. They don’t give a fuck.

I know I should leave but im only staying until I finish school, I have a year left and with this job I can work with my school schedule. 

I genuinely hate my job because of this.",violeta_polyphony,1,0.3799999952316284,12,1711918069,2024-03-31 20:47:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bskhiw/my_job_underpays_me/,3,2024

1bsgkq8,Potential smear campaign or mobbing? ,"Without giving too many identifiable details - I’m a very young woman at a high managerial level. I am very good at my job and I’m fully commission which is why I can have a high director position at a young age.

I am consistently kind, supportive, but direct when needed with my team. However I’m very super conscious of tone, how things come across etc. As a “strong” woman this has been engrained into me and I’m hyper vigilant. 

Despite this, during our company’s most recent confidential 360 survey, I received two complaints of being toxic, with one person accusing so toxic that if it continued would leave the company. 

For context there are some people I’ve been putting more pressure on to meet our targets because we’re behind and there’s fairly basic and key deadlines or quality controls being missed with our clients. Again, all of the communications with the team are still respectful but are increasingly direct with actionable, detailed, tangible feedback.

I screenshotted a majority of my comms with the team YTD to also send to HR but overall it’s a very difficult accusation to fully protect myself from given the confidentiality and I can’t know what exactly is being said or what situations are referenced, which worries me this label will stick without a proper investigation. Again, I’ve even showed all of my comms to third parties who have agreed that I’ve taken a gentle and respectful approach. 

An important piece of context perhaps is that last summer I did “rock the boat” because a well liked team member fabricated an email to a client to send to me as proof we had properly communicated with the client (a very key client who sends around 100k per year). Turns out she had actually forgotten to reply to the client and even though my question to her was just hey just want to make sure we got back to them, etc she lied and then fabricated as evidence. She had been making many mistakes to this point but nothing had been taken to her direct manager or HR so some intense fear doesn’t seem to be feasible as I’d been fairly understanding to that point.  It turns out in reality she was promoted into a role that didn’t suit her and she was transferred to one that fit her skill set better after a full performance review and investigation. She is much happier now. However, she did have to enter a PIP, there was gossip spread that I made her cry, and overall I likely earned a very negative reputation from this. 

There’s a very well paid fairly new employee who is also underperforming quite substantially on the basics of her role. Think sending CEO clients emails with the name of their company spelled incorrectly. 

Any advice from people who have navigated mobbing, smear campaigns, workplace gossip etc? ",goldenchicken828,1,1.0,0,1711908097,2024-03-31 18:01:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bsgkq8/potential_smear_campaign_or_mobbing/,3,2024
1bsghe2,"I’m going to ask for a 50% raise next week, could do with some advice ","I’ve been with my company now for 4 years, 3 months. My responsibilities include overseeing 8 managers, including production, quality, engineering, logistics etc. and being the sole health and safety manager for 250 people. I know I am well underpaid (I make £40k a year, this was £35k last year) and my boss has offered me a more responsibility to oversee a new team of 30, including 11 engineers. We discussed this last week and he said to have a think about it, he would increase my salary by £5k. I almost burst out laughing, next week I’ll be going in and asking for £20k increase. 

Reasons for: 

1) he initially wanted to hire a new manager for this, which would have cost >£30k. And has instead offered me £5k. 

2) I’ve been underpaid for years, now that’s not a selling point but from what I understand loyalty pays here. Everyone I manage has been around for >10 years, they’re all paid more than me which is a big blow. 

3) accidents decreased by 30% over the year with the same head count.

4) I’ve produced savings of over £200k on materials alone. There will be another £200k on energy. 

There are of course many other reasons why but they are harder to quantify such as good communication and improving morale, the constant but small improvements I have little time to document. 

20k is of course a big leap, similar jobs are paying the same however. I’d like to know the best way to negotiate this next week.

1bsfwn6,Is moving from California to Arizona for a job worth it?,"Fellow Nerds! I need help with a life decision..

I work for a fortune 500 company that specializes in manufacturing products in the medical sector. I'm the Senior Systems Analyst. My location was one of their smaller ones so I pretty much ran the IT department by myself (with the exception of a single desktop support employee). We had a ton of free time and it was a relatively relaxing and low stress environment. Well, 2 weeks ago the plant was shutdown because there was too much competition for the product we were manufacturing. Everyone was let go with severance. I was pulled into a room, a long with 15 other people, and offered a substantial retention bonus (half my annual salary) to stay on and help close the plant down until September-ish.

The division manager asked me if I wanted to continue to work for the company. There is a position available doing the same thing for the same pay in Arizona (I live in California). He offered to pay for my moving expenses and to fly me down to check it out before I make my decision.

The thought of moving from California to Arizona sort of bums me out. I've been here my whole life. My family is out here. I may not have friends (adulting is hard) but my fiance has friends out here. I'm just looking for moral support and honest genuine advice from your perspectives. Would you take the job, uproot your life, and endure the Arizona heat?

Things to consider:
My commute would go from 15 minutes to an hour and change after the move.
The plant in Arizona has about 700 more employees to support.
I would need to provide on-call support on weekends as production never stops.
The pay is probably more than I can get switching to a new company.
I would be able to afford a house with a pool paying $500 less a month in rent than I pay now. 
My take home pay would increase by about $195 a paycheck (bi-weekly pay schedule).",twist3dlogic,3,0.7200000286102295,15,1711906340,2024-03-31 17:32:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bsfwn6/is_moving_from_california_to_arizona_for_a_job/,3,2024
1bsfvbo,Is it fair to ask for Relocation in these circumstances?,"I am an international student currently in the US working in a tech/hardware company. I am originally from a country which is more conservative and not the most LGBTQ friendly, although being gay is legal, there is very less tolerance and huge stigma by the general public and basic rights like marriage, adoption, etc are still not in place. I identify as gay but have been discreet and never used this anywhere in my uni/job applications/interviews.


I recently found out that my 3rd and final H1B lottery attempt was unsuccessful while I was on OPT. My current company have given me the option to relocate to my home country as they have an office there. I was thinking of requesting them to relocate me to a country where there is more tolerance. I know that my orientation or gender expression is in no way my company's fault but I am turning close to 30, tired of hiding/fighting for tolerance and want to live a life of acceptance (these 4.5 years in the US have been phenomenal in that sense, wherein I got to be who I was without any fear after years of repression). 

I was thinking of bringing this point up to the HR of my company. I am open to take a huge pay cut and cover all my relocation/immigration costs by myself. I am willing to take the same wage they would give me back in my home country in any of the more liberal countries (the amount will be close to minimum wage if we consider Canada but at this point, I would even take that as I want to prioritize my mental health and live my life more openly).

1bsfacl,Struggling to Transition from Security Guard to IT related job.,"Hi community,

I'm an almost 40-year-old, full-time security guard with a burning passion for IT since I was a teenager. Despite my age, I've dedicated the past few years to transitioning into the IT world as a Helpdesk/System Administrator. However, I'm facing hurdles in interviews because HR professionals doubt my suitability for the role due to my vastly different current job.

Here's the kicker: I've earned a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and obtained a Cisco CCNA certification within the last two years. Plus, I've been working as a part-time freelance system administrator for small local companies in the last 10 years.

I would have liked to change sooner but due to having 2 small children and not having the possibility to move I didn't (now I have the support to move to a city that allows me to work in this field)

 Yet, HR seems to overlook the fact that a security guard could achieve such feats.

For Junior jobs there is no hope due to my advanced age.

I'm seeking genuine advice and insights from the community. How can I break through this barrier and prove my worth in the IT field?

Two senior bosses and the rest of us are managers. Lead boss has been staff for years (Let’s call him Jeff). One senior boss is also staff (Let’s call him Fred). Using the “Senior” title is being far too complimentary of how toxic he is. The other Senior boss is a freelancer, like me. And a badass woman (Let’s call her “Beth”). . Have a great relationship with Jeff and Beth, but Beth I trust the most, and a confidant having worked with her for 10 years now.
 
Fred was new to the team, failed forward and in no way a boss. He can’t really do anything..except delegate poorly. Even being new, he had 0 interest in learning about the department, how it is run, any details, and doesn’t do ANY work. Always claims to be available to help. But doesn’t. Lies, talks poorly behind others back, just a shit human.  The work (or lack there of, speaks for itself.  He made my life hell. Completely hands off, but in a bad way. I needed the manager assistance and he provided zilch as a senior manager. He was cruel with his words. Tried to throw anyone he could under the bus. Blamed anything bad on me.. and my emotional health definitely suffered. First time I wasn’t having fun at work.

There are two main departments at company A. Jeff oversees all of it. Beth helps to run department #1 and Fred was hired to run Department #2. During Covid I switched from Dept 1 to help set up and run Dept 2 bc the other senior manager was pulled into a long term work project and couldn’t manage that and Dept #2. . I did a great job. I was well-liked by everyone. Everything was smooth until he came. I’ll call it creative differences. I wanted to work. He didn’t. Personality clash? Anyway. Moving into the new quarter, Fred wanted me off the team. He got his way. Because he’s staff? They don’t want to do deal with HR? Who knows. I felt gutted. Immature prick about all of it, too. Would never meet to talk despite my numerous efforts to be on the same pag.

Good news is both Jeff and Beth both were very supportive of me, and Jeff moved me back to Dept #1. They all know he’s toxic. So here’s where I need advice. What I learned is that “role” under Fred is a “yes, man” kind of job. I am there to help improve and collaboratively make things better than they are. And want everyone to pull weight. Do your job. Not hire 15 more people to do the job you were hired to do. They hired a “yes, man” who was one of our coworkers. It’s a big undertaking, and he’s a nice guy, but I have 0 interest in training him or helping him in anyway. Fred should be the one training him, but he knows nothing. 

My question is, how do I handle seeing everyone? Other support staff will find out I’m back in Dept #1. And I don’t want to bring up the toxicity of why I switched when they ask. I don’t want Fred to get the satisfaction of feeling like he got away with getting his way. The managers all know why Yes man was hired. I just don’t want to be the snarky salty person, who is negative and dwells on it/him.  I want this to be a good year emotionally and have fun at work again. How do I field questions and focus on the better work environment during the day to day job? Fred will still be very present during collaborative projects and I know he’s going to treat me like crap.

Need some advice on a work situation. I recently left my old job (on good terms, thankfully) for a new one that offered a better work-life balance (super flexible!). However, the new position is honestly a bit dull, and the pay isn't great.  The kicker?

Don't get me wrong, my current company is awesome for flexibility, but I know I'm definitely underpaid for my skills.

1bs4eoz,Career vs family conundrum ,"Career vs Family conundrum 

Sorry long post 

I was impacted by layoff with whole group when it was decided by management to close the group I work laying us all off.

This news came 3 weeks after when we got to know that we are going to become parents. This put an enormous pressure on me even though my wife is working and we have a runway of savings for 6 months. Also since I am in the Netherlands with a permanent contract they gave 3 notice , garden leave of 6 months and some severance. So for short term money was not an issue but having a child in these circumstances added on to the costs and put some mental pressure on me. This is my first layoff experience.

Now I panicked as a first time father to be and started applying for internal jobs within the company of all kind.. 

As 2 ppl were retiring in another group and a manager needed to replace them atleast with 1 , after the interview the kind manager decided to offer me the role even though it was not be a fully perfect fit and it might be step down in work but the salary stays the same. The job is in the same building and I don’t need to move.
The positions were difficult to come by as management was tough on costs. I was desperate and I accepted the offer and they are dependent on me to start in 6 weeks.

4 days later I got another internal interview for a group which was doing similar work as I was before layoff and I just accepted the interview as I saw better fit and now 2 weeks later I have got it. The catch is that it’s in a city 1-1h30 min drive and I have to be in the office 2-3 days a week. They know I have the other offer and also have a backup candidate who is my colleague . 

Now the conundrum is 
As a new parent should I just take the first job which is a new profile and stay close to family ?

Or 

should I burn the bridge with the first manager and take the more challenging suitable role 1hr-1hr30 mins drive away from my pregnant wife and soon to be child ?

I discussed with my wife and she is ok with me taking a decision on either but have a better preference for the job close by.

Any advice would help this to be father in this situation.",seeking_advice_here,1,1.0,0,1711868970,2024-03-31 07:09:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bs4eoz/career_vs_family_conundrum/,3,2024

1bs3jmm,Career change for teacher,"

In my mid twenties, been a teacher for nearly 4 years and ready to leave. I'm so tired all the time, have no time for myself and go home genuinely feeling gutted. 

The kids are incredibly below (3+ grades lower academically than where they should be) and I'm doing my best to catch them up but fuck it's destroying me. 

I have heard from teachers I work with and seen online posts say ""I've been a teacher for 20 or 30+ years and loved it from the beginning but if I were a teacher just starting, I would be leaving the profession"". They're not wrong. Teaching is so much harder now.

I've realised that not feeling on top of things and being in a constant state of feeling frazzled for work is not normal. On top of that, my workplace is incredibly toxic. 

 I have always wanted to be a teacher. I love seeing the students' growth. But being a teacher is taking my spirit away. 

I'm not really interested in working in the education world for my next career.

I don't know what steps to take. I'm planning on taking a year off teaching next year and getting a job that pays similar but with way less stress. 

I miss my life. Not that I had anything special but I miss having free time, sleeping well, and not stressing every second of my life. 

If you are an ex-teacher or know of any jobs that meet the below, can you please let me know? 

- non educational job 

- no more study - I just want to leave teaching and work elsewhere 

- creative / fun 

- job satisfaction 

- $80k + year (I earn quite a bit more as a teacher but the endless hours aren't worth it) 

- something that I can ""check in and out of"" in my mind and NOT bring work home unless I can work from home and not in an office

1bs39yn,I dropped out of College,"I am 18 and have Amblyopia (lazy eye). My mother passed away 2 years ago. Her death was so sudden that I'm still shocked and can't get out of it. I was a Topper but I felt lost after my Mom's sudden death and my grades started getting bad. Last Year I passed high school but couldn't get as much marks as I could. I applied in Computer Science in my dream college. I couldn't get admitted there so I panicked and applied for the available college and chose the major of Architecture. I've always loved drawing as a hobby and thought that it wouldn't be do any harm since I already have a liking for drawing and Architecture itself is very interesting. I got admitted there. I packed my bags and went to the hostel. On my first day of college, it was all normal and the college wasn't top-tier but since I was also an average student so I didn't have any right to complain. I missed my home and couldn't sleep at night. New city, new environment and all, I was having a hard time getting used to it. I'm the youngest daughter so my Dad didn't want me to move out so soon. On my second day of college, the Professors were not very helping, they just started teaching us like there's no tomorrow and didn't teach any basics. The whole class was shocked on the 2nd day since it was not even close to what we imagined. Architecture needs creativity but they told us to focus on completion of tasks. Our studio in-charge was especially rude and she taught us so hastily that we started hating Art in just 1 week. Anyways, I tried to hold on but the problem was not me. The class representative talked to the head of department but he was not ready to co-operate. We were loaded with work (7 assignments) on our 1st weekend and obviously couldn't sleep. At some point, I stopped using my creativity or enjoying the process and just tried to complete the work. I forgot about my meals, in order to complete the studio work, designing, etc. before Monday. As I already mentioned I have Amblyopia, my muscles started aching and I started having a constant headache. It wasn't so bad tbh but I was so fed up in just 3 weeks that I used it as an excuse and told my Dad that I can't do this anymore. He is very cooperative. He told me to just come back home and that I can apply again next year if I want to. I dropped out of college and came back. Now that I think of everything, I feel like a loser for giving up. I feel like I've wasted a year. In this year I completed a 1-year diploma but most of my friends are in college. So I feel left out. I have regrets that are getting worse day by day. The admissions will be open again soon, but I don't feel like I have any dream or aim to follow. In short, I think I am a loser.

1bs1n77,Would it be wrong to ask to go back?,"I was recently offered and accepted a position with another team at work. The team is part of the same department so I’m still somewhat connected with my old team. I was initially excited by the prospect of learning the new position and working with the manager of that team, as we get along well and are on friendly terms. 

I’ve been with them for a week now and I’m not a fan of the work environment, mainly how the team gets along with one another. I knew going into it that there had been some concerns, but not to the extent that there truly is. 3/4 of my first day, 2 people were nonstop hating on another member of the team and her work. Another example being a team member took a personal phone call regarding her health, throughout the call another member of the team was quietly mocking everything being said. Granted she could’ve taken it in private, but still very much inappropriate. The 3rd example, keep in mind this is all on day one, the idea of planned lunches rather than the free or all which is currently in place was brought up by our manager (we need phone and occasional counter coverage). When asked about it, one person ignored the question then snapped back at the manager stating they’ll figure it out on their own. The manager just smiled and went to her office…

I don’t want to be that person, the one given a chance and not fulfilling my end of the deal. But so far my experience is one of a toxic work environment where there is a lack of decency toward fellow team members and no respect for the manager. This is why I’ve been contemplating going back to my old team. There is definitely some concern on my part regarding what people will think and how it may impact my career progression going forward. I’ve discussed the possibility of moving back with my previous manager and she is 100% okay with it, but my director (over the entire department) was heavily pushing for me to move to this new team so that is causing some anxiety. 

There are some perks to the new position such as singular focus when it comes to what the team works on. Some limited work from home options and less direct public interactions. I just don’t think it’s worth the trade off due to the work environment. 

It’s just a shame because I believe I’d come to enjoy the work and what they do does make a meaningful difference to the community (public sector job). This may have become more of a vent than asking for advice so for that I apologize! Do you think I’m in the wrong for entertaining the idea of moving back? If not, how would be the best way to approach it with my director? I know the manager of my new team will feel let down, and that’s probably my largest regret.

1bs0h84,How to discuss a pay increase after given a new role and new responsibilities,"***TL:DR; Is it reasonable to ask for a more than standard pay raise (hourly) of $1/hr after taking on more responsibilities and benefitting the company a large portion.*** 

This is my first ""formal"" workplace and by that I mean neither food service or retail. I work in the tech sector specifically at a company that manufactures, calibrates, and designs laser machines. Company has \~40 employees give or take. I was hired about a month ago as a laser technician where I would wire and calibrate each machine ad nauseam until the end of the day. About two weeks into the job I had met the co-owner of the business and said that he really liked my background and how I preform, etc. I expressed that I have an extensive background in working on 3d printers and would love to work on them if needed.

He wanted me to take on the project of completely renovating the entire farm of 25+ 3d printers. This is upgrading certain printers, getting others online, as well as automating the entire system. I have made numerous suggestions that would help both techs working with the farm as well as benefit the company in efficiency and cost saving by a large margin. All of these ideas have been approved and are in the works.

I have my first review coming up that is supposed to be 90 days from hire as is standard and the raise is $1/hr. My main question is that even though I have only been in the company for 7 weeks is it reasonable to ask for a raise between both taking on more responsibility as well as benefitting the company a reasonable amount? I've thought of comparing my position to the person who did this before but I am the first. This entire farm was setup by coworkers and never touched again aside from the printing of certain parts on occasion.

- I love game designing, I know university is not necessarily a requirement
- Maybe something in the business field, but I don't know how to choose
- idk, YouTube? I'm not confident about this though 

Here's where I need your help:
- If I go into business, what is a high paying field
- What courses could enhance my CV/Resume and how do I get them?
- What would be beneficial to learn
- Are there any good alternative jobs that I could potentially like to pursue further? (Similar to the ones I've listed).

I make the most sales out of every employee there the last 3 years. Some months i make more sales than 2 or 3 other employees combined. So yes i make more money than them but i work harder and smarter.

My salary portion, the other half of my pay is salary which has  not changed at all since 2021.

1brz40s,Leaving 6 month job to move?,"So I was at my last job for 1-2 years (first professional job) then I applied to become an alt in Japan at the end of 2023 (it’s a 1 year contract). I thought I would be able to start for spring semester (April) but the spots were filled so I have a starting date for fall semester (August). I do have an offer standing that I accepted but I think I can back out of it early enough.

The problem is that since my start date is later than expected I applied for jobs (I don’t work at my first job anymore). Now I have a new job but if I leave for Japan I would only be at this job for 6 months.

I honestly feel really bad because I was quite literally hired to do a job. People here seem nice and it seems they expect me to be here for at least a year (there’s no time length contract just at-will basis). I could possibly stay here for a year and then go to Japan later. 

But then I’m indecisive because I feel like that’s going to take too much time and hold me back in a few ways. I purposely chose a job that wasn’t ideal because I knew I would be leaving. The cons of this job is that it’s low-pay and the location. 

Part of the reason they liked me was my audit skills and they have yearly audits. So I feel bad because it seems like they wanted to use that. They could probably find another person if I left but they wanted to hire me. I’d just hate to leave them high and dry. From an employer perspective it’s just shitty when you take the time to train someone and have expectations but they leave. 

At the same time it can be the other way where the employer can fire you at any moment. Or they just suck. The audit part isn’t even part of the job description either but I care too much. I applied to a job I could somewhat easily leave but I feel bad. 

The other part is that I’m still at an entry level point. This isnt like I’ve been in the industry for 10 years already. I think it be a good time to go now that I’m young and can do something like this. If I do go to Japan then I would come back with about 3 years professional experience from 3 different jobs (but it would show 6 months for one job and like 8 months for another job). But the alt job I’m not really going to learn skills and it’s unrelated to my field so will I even have a better chance of being hired if I come back? I don’t know how fast I can get another job afterwards. Or I could stay at this job for a year go there for a year and still come back with 3 years experience. 

Any thoughts and advice? I also just don’t want to burn bridges at my current job. I guess an excuse of going to Japan is valid but how does that look after 6 months? How would my resume look?",Mobile-Sun,1,1.0,0,1711850940,2024-03-31 02:09:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1brz40s/leaving_6_month_job_to_move/,3,2024

1brxe11,How do you handle “extra” work?,"I currently work in let’s say the data industry.
Early on I received meaningful work, and survived several layoffs so clearly they find me dependable, capable, etc. Because of these layoffs, I have worn many hats and absorbed many additional tasks. While it has expanded my resume, it’s exhausting. I spoke up about “spreading out” some of the extra work i.e. training responsibilities so that everyone can work on guidance for their respective areas. It seemed to have been received well but for the broader team-wide training, I’m still in charge. We recently hired a training & communications lead who I thought I would be transitioning this responsibility to. However, both the training lead and my manager assumed I would still cover this oddly. Just the other day, I had to ask my manager what I can ask the training lead to help on and she said she wasn’t sure and that she’d talk to the training lead but I was still in charge of it. So I’m doing my main job plus this training effort. Now every time someone has a training question, they come to me and I’m worried I’m less seen as a “data” expert and more as a “training” expert. Everyone else on the team only focuses on their scope of work. 

Have you experienced getting the extra work dumped on you? How did you handle it?",07gutchug,2,1.0,1,1711845970,2024-03-31 00:46:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1brxe11/how_do_you_handle_extra_work/,3,2024

1brwjk0,What should I do about a promised promotion I didn’t get?,"Sorry long post but there’s backstory. Been at my job for over 9 years, moved up a couple times, taken on a ton of extra responsibilities without asking for more money and made myself basically irreplaceable without affecting operations. We got a new manager a few years ago and he noticed my hard work and talked about getting me moved up over a year ago. Our company was in the process of being sold to new owners and my manager again mentioned getting me moved up once the new owners started making changes. A few months ago my manager said he had a plan to move me up and he was going to get the ball rolling with HR and the new COO. I had a meeting with my Manager and HR manager and they said they didn’t have any compensation figured out but they had a job description and they wanted me to “test it out” for about a month because it’s much different from my current job, but that I would still be doing my regular job just doing new stuff as well. My wife is 32 weeks pregnant at this time and I asked if this would be figured out before I take my paternity leave. They both assured me that it would be and I didn’t have to worry about that. I do this new thing for a little over a month and get a meeting with the COO and HR manager. The COO asked how it was going and how much I had helped on a specific project and I told him it was good and I was splitting my time between my current position and the “test” so I hadn’t helped a ton on that project and he said that’s not what he was wanting. He said he wanted me to stop doing my current job and just do a full test of the new job. At this point I’m frustrated cause I spent the month doing what I was told to do but that’s not what the COO wanted and my wife is now 38 weeks pregnant. So I do this “new” thing for a week and heard rumblings of me doing this temporarily. I went into my HR managers office and she said she owes me an explanation. She tells me when her and my manager, met with the COO again to get me a new job description and figure out compensation my COO was confused and said this was only supposed to be temporary to help get this project done. My wife is now 39 weeks pregnant and all the COO wanted was for me to help try to move this project along before I take my paternity leave and there is no new position for me. My manager is not happy about it because his plan the whole time was to get me a promotion but he didn’t do anything to try to change the COO’s mind.

1brw7gm,Career Advancement vs Personal Relationships,"I simply miss my friends and being around the people I enjoy.

I took it and now I don't know if I made the right choice.

Hanging out with my college friends, I realized I am missing out. Most of them live nearby and hang out once every 2 weeks or so. I really miss it. They're so fun and nice to be around. Growing up my family and I weren't the closest but my college friends and I are extremely close. 

My career has only begun and the company I am at, wants to send me overseas and they want me to grow within the company. I know I will have to leave friends over and over. I don't know how to get over this weird nostalgic and FOMO I have. Do you guys sacrifice your career advancement for your personal lives? I am worried if I keep doing this I will become extremely robotic. I have not had this feeling in a while, it was just being home and hanging out with them and them saying they missed me and wish I'd be around more.

I have missed out on some trips they had. It's extremely difficult for me being stuck in the middle. We are slowly growing apart because I am just not available.

1brt8ga,"I am about to graduate with a classics degree, should I go into academia or IR?","Hey, thanks for reading. This is in Europe. Next month I will graduate with a classics degree. I am deciding on my masters, but I will for sure do one. I absolutely love my degree and I am quite good at it. I know for sure I do not want to go into teaching High School, so that is why I am considering academia. I was told by teachers that I am suited for it.  However, I know it is quite difficult to obtain a permanent teaching spot at Uni and that there can be quite a lot of job insecurity.   
On the other hand, one of my advisors also told me to consider diplomacy, IR, all that stuff, because she thinks I could be happy doing that. However, this mentour is not quite related to the field and there are not many things she can tell me about how the industry is,  operates or what it is looking for, but the idea sounds appealing. Especially in relation to heritage, culture and also I am quite interested in the Middle East.  
I am adding some information in regards to my curriculum, just in case it might be relevant. I am fluent in French, English, Spanish and have basic knowledge of German and Modern Greek, as well as decent reading and writing Italian skills. Also, I have completed several internships in archiving, research and museums, none of them very important, but I liked all of them. Also I got two scholarships to do two projects in an  important american uni, they were online, about history and globalization.   
Also, If you have any suggestions of additional career paths to look into, super interested in hearing them. Thank you!

1brsqw0,I am NOT an accountant,"A few years back, I was contacted by a previous employer asking me to come back and help with the new companies they were aquiring. I was hired to do AP data entry, create a purchase order system and review expense reports.

My prior background was in office administration where I've always been tasked with light AP entry work, POs and assisting employees with their expense reporting. So sounded like the exact same thing I had previously done and they were going to be paying me more.

I started the job and all seemed to be going well. I took on the role as described and did very well with it, however, the merger between the companies kept being delayed. I didn't think much of it since I've never been through a merge.

Fast forward to February this year, everyone started quitting. My boss abruptly left with a one day notice. The new company CEO decided to freeze my company's current software and immediately merge it into their software.

This past week, I received a report consisting of over 100k lines. The company they hired to extract data from our system wasn't sure if it was accurate. I was asked to compare line by line for accuracy. I told them it would take me months to do and I wasn't really sure how to do it. I was also told several more large reports were on the way.

I think perhaps there is a disconnect of understanding my background. My boss was a certified CPA..I'm a political science major. I feel like I'm in over my head. I'm drowning and not understanding the tasks I've been given. 

How do I approach my new boss without sounding like an absolute failure? I honestly have never been one to admit defeat but there's a huge difference from simple data entry and understanding extensive accounting. I'm also worried that they are expecting me to reconcile and update all of the books once we are in the new software. Something that I have no right to be doing.

I currently still work at my school for their sustainability office making 42k/yr. I'm grateful for my job--it's easy, I'm friends with all my coworkers, and have a ton of flexibility as long as I get my work done. The problem is that I think I'm sacrificing my career. I initially had plans to work as a business analyst or data analyst, but wasn't able to find an internship in that role my junior year (I took an internship in the sustainability office).

1brrmoz,Considering quiting,"Am i the asshole for wanting to leave my job
I want to leave my job however I feel guilty and afraid because of several reasons. 
I am a caregiver for an elderly person that's in their 90's. 
I have been the caregiver since 2018. I was first with an agency then I started working with them direct in 2020. 
The family bought a house because they wanted me to stay with them and so my 2 kids could move to the house and go to school while I take care of him. 

When I started working with them I charged them below the daily rate. And now almost 4 years later I am still getting the same salary. They haven't offered me a raise and I am afraid to ask for one.
 
The cost of living has increased so much that I am struggling with my kids even tho I am not paying rent. 
Other than housing they are no other benefits. I have to pay my own health insurance and I don't even get bonus or holiday pay. For Christmas they family give me an Amazon gift card. They also get a gift for each of my kids

Also another big issue is that I don't get much time to my self. If I want a break I have to pay to go somewhere to get a break which is costly. So I just stay for month without a day off. I have to give the relief caregiver my room and stay with my kids in the other room or go somewhere lease so I can rest.

I know if I leave this job I am able to make atleast $25000 more than I currently make do I will be able to afford my own home for me and kids.  As well as i would have more time to go out and do things with my kids.

Mentally this has been alot for me. I am so stressed out about this situation. I know  accepted this job but after I few months of being and seeing the restrictions of not being able to go anywhere. Because the elderly person doesn't want to go anywhere just stay home. So I have been cooped up. When I use to work with the agency I would get a break every week but this is not the case here.

I want to leave but I feel as tho the family will be upset that they got the house and then I want to leave and also I am concerned about how the elderly person will take it. I think they will not take it good as they have said to me before that if I leave them they are going to die. 

Please advise me on what what decision to make. What should I do?

1brqnkm,Admin Cyn - Black On The Job Career Consulting,"Posting this for anyone to find if they are looking for reviews for the company Black On The Job. She goes by the name Admin Cyn on Facebook

This company is a woman I found through Facebook. they provide career consultations and résumé services. Everything looked legit, but unfortunately my experience was not great 

- There were a lot of issues with her scheduling. First off, her website kept giving me error messages when I tried to book appointments. I ended up doing it manually with one of her assistants. About 2 to 3 times prior to my appointment, I kept getting emails that my appointment was canceled and rescheduled, which I thought was odd. I didn’t appreciate them automatically moving things around without my consent or consideration.

- The day of my career consultation, nobody from their team showed up on the zoom call. I emailed and got no answer. Finally got a hold of someone via text, and they proceeded to gaslight me trying to make it seem like I calculated the time zone wrong which I did not.

I found it very unprofessional.

I was very turned off after that interaction and just wanted a refund which they refused at first, but they eventually gave in.

- Upon further investigation I found there are a lot of other people complaining about her company. Former employees say they are overworked if you look on the website Glass Door. There are also some threads on the forum Lipstick Alley of people saying their results for cover letters and resumes were mediocre. And that they are contained grammatical errors. There is speculation that she hires people from Fiverr and makes it seem like it’s her work when it’s not

My old job had no stability or support from management, long 24 hour lone-working shifts and no set rota. 
My new job is a monday-friday, choose my hours between 8am-8pm, work from home opportunities. 
On paper this looks like a great improvement. So why do i feel so anxious?

1brpzcn,"What is the thought process behind male managers giving ""personality"" feedback to only women?","Background: During my (mid-30s F) annual review (1st at this company) my boss said that I looked annoyed and stoic during meetings. I asked for specific examples and what his actionable feedback was, and he had no examples for either and said that chatting though this settled some of his perceptions about my personality...I then asked if he had any additional questions about my personality and he said he didn't have any. 

The whole conversation felt so ridiculous. Thankfully I scored well on everything else and got my full bonus and merit raise. But I feel so shitty that he had such a negative perception of me, because I thought we got on so well before.

We're all remote too, so I'm not sure what he's judging me on. I'm talkative and smiley when we have smaller meetings, and then during larger meetings, I am quieter but I try to smile and participate as much as I can. 

Another thing that might be important, is that another one of my teammates (a young woman) is extremely talkative and almost flirtatious with him, especially during those large meetings, and he comes off as weirdly obsessed with her? Like he brings her up in conversations, and during the meetings he always singles her out when she says something. He's also said some suggestive innuendo to her in front of everyone. Part of me also wonders if he's mad that I'm not as talkative or flirty with him as she is with him so he gave me some BS personality feedback?

But now I don't feel comfortable around him. It's probably pointless, but I want to try to understand his rationale. Does he want attention from his female subordinates? Is he unhappy with his life and taking his anger out on women because our breasts are evil?

I think at the least he's sexist with gender bias.",ItsTimeToSparkle,46,1.0,24,1711826661,2024-03-30 19:24:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1brpzcn/what_is_the_thought_process_behind_male_managers/,3,2024

1brpg83,"Navigating Exam Stress With Expert Guidance From Sunanda Rao, Career Counsellor","The days leading up to examinations are bound to be stressful for most students. Even the brightest and most prepared of the lot can feel the pressure, be it internal assessments, boards, or competitive examinations.  
  
  
Experts say that given how exams are a nerve-wracking time for students across age groups, taking breaks between intense studies is one of the effective ways of managing stress. “Students should reward themselves between study-time,” says Sunanda Rao, a Career Counsellor in New Delhi.  
  
While stress and anxiety over exams is natural, Sunanda Rao advises students to channel it so as not to get overwhelmed. “When studying, ensure you’re taking breaks in between. For example, after studying hard for an hour or so, take 20 minutes off to, say, be on the internet or watch a favorite TV show,” says Sunanda Rao.  
  
  
Doing so will help take the mind off exams while acting as a motivational carrot to get back to studying after the break. The best way to go about it is to work out a plan and stick to it. First and foremost, make a schedule, breaking down the topics to be covered every day. “Be realistic about how much you can study each day when allocating time. It’s difficult to sustain your concentration for hours together. So, when you find your mind wandering, it’s probably a sign that you need a short break,” explains Sunanda Rao.  
  
Eating healthy and limiting caffeine is equally important, and so is investing some time in physical exercise and meditation. It may be the last thing most students feel like doing, but there’s a reason why exercise is a classic stress-reliever. “Physical activity is a great way to clear your mind and boost the mood. After just 20 minutes of exercise, you can hit the books with renewed focus,” says Sunanda Rao.",Federal-Arachnid-247,1,1.0,0,1711825296,2024-03-30 19:01:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1brpg83/navigating_exam_stress_with_expert_guidance_from/,3,2024
1brpaaj,How To Build A Successful And Rewarding Career In Fitness," People nowadays want to invest their precious time in something valuable and beneficial. Health considered one of the priceless things in our lives as humans, becomes the primary focus of entrepreneurs in starting a business. That being said, many people pursue a career in fitness and health.   
  
  
A fitness trainer directs, instructs, and stimulates individuals or groups in several types of exercise, such as cardiovascular exercise (exercises for the heart and blood system), strength training, and stretching. It takes a lot of effort and drives to get and keep healthy.   
  
Fitness trainers must be able to support customers thrilled about their development and help them to focus on their aims to keep them coming back for more.  
  
Fitness trainers often do the following tasks:  
  
· Show how to do various workouts and routines.  
· Watch customers perform exercises and prove or advise them the proper ways to avoid injury and increase fitness.  
· Provide alternate exercises during workouts or lessons for people with varying levels of fitness and competence.  
· Monitor client progress and change programmers as necessary.  
· Explain and enforce safety guidelines and regulations for sports, leisure activity, and exercise equipment.  
· Provide customers with information or resources on nutrition, weight loss, and lifestyle difficulties.  
· If necessary, administer emergency first aid.  
  
Now the question arises: Do we want to make the world healthier? That is precisely what a profession in fitness training allows you to do.  
Those who have used various exercise approaches to become in shape typically have one superior grip in common. They lose motivation to continue their training after the first few efforts and realise that they would rather spend an evening with a bucket of chocolate ice cream than on a tough treadmill. This is where the role of a personal trainer comes in. A fitness trainer’s key role is to guide their customers through a suggested exercise plan (Pilates, aerobics, weights, etc.) and aid them in achieving the most excellent fitness levels.  
  
  
Scope: Our sedentary lives and reliance on quick (junk) food have increased the number of obese people and cautious fitness freaks. In either case, this implies more clients for a fitness trainer and prospects in this industry. According to a recent estimate, the fitness business in India is expected to rise by 20 to 30% every year.  
  
Job Opportunity: Opportunities abound in this sector, and as a fitness trainer, one may branch out into various related fields. One possibility is working as a trainer at health clubs, gymnasiums, and other fitness institutes. In addition, if you have unique training in a specialised discipline, such as martial arts, kickboxing, Pilates, and so on, you may capitalise on it by delivering classes in these specific fitness techniques.  
As a personal trainer, you have the possibility of selecting your clients if you are selective about whom you work with. For example, once you have set up a trustworthy name for yourself, you might choose to only train movie stars and other celebrities. However, while these celebrities might be extravagant in their spending, they can also be unreasonable in their demands.  
  
  
Remuneration: A fitness trainer’s starting wage might be low (about Rs. 12,000 per month), but your profits can climb significantly with time. As your skills and credibility grow, you may earn between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 1 lakh monthly. This field offers opportunities to make money from various sources (weekend classes, personal training sessions, guest training, etc.).You may earn hourly as a competent personal trainer (from Rs. 400 to Rs. 1000 per hour).  
  
Skills Set: If you expect your consumers to complete 50 push-ups, you must be able to prove how to do it. Consequently, it would help if you always stayed in shape since your clients will want to see the outcomes they may expect. Your interpersonal abilities, in addition to your physical health, must be in good working order. You must set up a relationship with your clientele for them to value your advice and instructions. The fitness business is dynamic, with new advances and regimens appearing regularly, so as you train your body to keep up with demanding exercises, make sure your mind stays current.  
  
Benefits and Difficulties: According to Sunil Kudva, the most crucial benefit of working as a fitness trainer is the ability to preserve one’s health. “Daily, one also encounters a lot of fascinating individuals; therefore, the work is social and participatory.” There is never a dull time in our lives. “Afternoon naps may be viewed as another vital perk!” he explains. “This sector has its own set of issues,” Sunil explains. “If you’re a freelance trainer and you get sick or injured, you don’t get paid until you heal,” he says.  
  
  
Qualifications in Education: To enter this field, you must pursue a professional degree in physical education or a programmed certificate. Various institutes supply fitness training programs ranging from two months to a year. You may discover classes in your location if you wish to specialise in anything specific, such as Pilates or martial arts. However, make sure you learn with a licensed teacher since many people have found methods to take advantage of the opportunities in this business.  
  
A Piece of Advice: Sunil Kudva has some advice for the fitness trainers of the future: “Think hard before you decide to enter this area.” It appears attractive from the outside but requires significant labour and time. To succeed, you must always be on your toes and participate in ongoing education. It is your expertise that allows you to grow with your clientele.” So, if you enjoy working out, share the joy of exploring the adrenaline-pumping world of a fitness trainer.  
  
These tips are just an overview of what you need to do to work as a fitness trainer and guarantee successful and rewarding work in the fitness industry. Don’t be discouraged if your career journey may not thrive at first. You’ll eventually unlock your exceptional talent and grow your career with the right mindset and training.

I don't want to work with high schoolers but this is the only job I've heard back from.

1brnvn6,I was offered a graduate school position today. 24m. Need advice ,"Hey y’all. 

I am a 24M, I hold a 3rd assistant engineering (3AE) job of unlimited horsepower ships for steam, gas turbines, and diesels. I had an BS in Marine Engineering and have a very good background in EE, Thermo/Fluid Dynamics, as well as an exceptional amount of hands on experience doing plant management. 

As a 3AE in the USA, I currently make around 120-150k and work 6-7 months per year with the rest of the year off. It is an amazing job, and great opportunity to see the world, as well as varying plants. 

That being said. It’s hard work, it’s grueling, often dangerous, far from my aging family, and while I have no problem working 12 hour days 7 days a week, I see my “end of career” counterparts” kind of miserable. 

While I was in my senior year of college, and after I graduated for a few months, I worked for a Nuclear Engineer in Academia, as a research associate where from the ground up, I designed a testing setup for various types of heat exchangers. I was only supposed to assist for a week or two, and wound up being on the project for a year, and helped publish a paper on the subject. At the end, they begged me to stay, and told me I could work under them as I earn a higher degree. 

It’s been a year since then. Earlier this week, the PhD, (my former boss, let’s call him NF), called me and said I can come study under him as a masters or PHD in nuclear or mechanical engineering if I wish (his 3rd offer). I’ve been torn for a year. I love both lines of work. The time off as a 3ae is unmatched. But I feel like I could earn even more if got back to school. 

I am extremely torn. I’ve soul searched for months on this. My dad drives a dump truck, and my mom has never worked. While I love them, and their advice is love filled, I fear it is without direction. 

I am looking for someone as some real advice here, who will have an unbiased opinion towards my situation. Somebody who has been successful in their field and doesn’t mind sharing life advice with me. I am willing to hear everybody and anybody out with their advice. 

I am happy to disclose any information aside from the research I’ve already participated in, as it’s a security issue. Feel free to comment or pm me. Ask questions or offer advice, I’m happy to respond to all. 

Thank You

1brngoe,Feels like I’m going full circle ,"Feels like I keep going full circle 

Hi all, so almost a year ago now I was fired from my job as a recruiter. I didn’t really love that line of work and wanted to work with my hands, so I tried to become an electrician. 

I joined a small company in my city that installs security devices. I picked up on everything pretty quick. Soon I was leading projects and providing “Tier II” tech support. A month or two ago I was promoted to account manager at my job. It’s cool, I get more money for this job but Im in an office now and not working out on the field. I’m the face of clients and manage a lot of admin office work for the company. I had a lot of fun doing the installs and the job felt pretty stress free besides physically meeting project demands. But now I’m super stressed because of how disorganized this company is and I’m basically the sole admin doing everything from scheduling to invoicing.  

I just feel like I went full circle. Going from an office job I didn’t like, to a hands on job that I did like, and now back to an office job that is starting to get to me. 

I wanted to change my career because I really like working with my hands but the reality is the money is in the business side of things. The guy doing the actual work never gets paid the value they produce. 

I think I’m just going to accept the fact that busting ass at a job only rewards you with more work. And usually that work is going to be things that I’m good at but don’t like to do. 

 I decided that I need to focus on my craftsmanship and start my own business. I want to create things that I will feel proud of. I’m tired of making my boss’s dreams come true.

Why would someone play the 'I'm leaving card' if they are not given what they want.

1brmaw7,How would I market myself?,"TLDR; I’m an illustrator and a want some advice on how to establish a career direction that best suits my style, and how to go about making progress in said direction. 

This is a niche one so I’m anticipating that I won’t get many replies, which is fine.

Anyway, I’ll keep it brief.  I’m a freelance illustrator, and I’ve been illustrating (mainly digitally) for YEARS now, and am confident in my abilities. My style, which I’ve developed over the last few years, is very line-work heavy, with minimal colour (I’ll rarely ever go over 3 colours in my palette per-peice).

Usually, my work focuses around 1 subject, as I don’t typically paint ‘scenes’, if that makes sense. I like what I produce, but I have no idea where it can fit in the industry. I often second guess myself, and sometimes feel as though I’m perhaps wasting my time on my style if it does not have any potential to go further than just personal commissions, as I aim to work with bigger companies and have a catalogue of clients under my belt. 

I wish I could post examples of my work for reference, but I can’t. If you wanted to (no obligation) you can check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/whatsalexdrawn?igsh=MWY5MHJ3cTNxNjFxdA==). 

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to establish the direction that would work best with my style, and how to get a foot in the creative industry. I’ve tried to reach companies/art directors directly, but had no luck, so I think it’s time I start to look more inwards.

1brm741,Is trying to transfer internally as a semi new hire wrong?,"Hello,  
In July 2023, I relocated several states away from my hometown to accept a position with a large utilities company operating across multiple states. Fresh out of school and lacking prior experience, I got a great opportunity of employment with this company. While I generally find satisfaction in my role and enjoy collaborating with my colleagues, the location where I settled isn't proving to be a good long-term fit for me. Both my girlfriend and I sacrificed a lot to make this move, but we've mutually concluded that this area isn't conducive to our happiness, and we're eager to explore other options.  
Despite my desire to leave, I grapple with feelings of guilt when considering the prospect of transferring. My employer and coworkers have invested significantly in my development, anticipating my presence in this role for years to come. I genuinely value the support and opportunities provided by my workplace, yet our current situation is taking a toll on our mental well-being.  
Additionally, I feel apprehensive about initiating internal job applications. How should I approach discussing this with my supervisor? Is it even necessary to disclose my intentions? Transferring within the company isn't guaranteed; it entails submitting applications and undergoing interviews like any external job search. What if I express my interest but don't secure a new position? Being relatively new, I fear this revelation might prompt my employer to hasten my departure, knowing my desire to leave. Am I wrong for wanting to leave so soon? Should I just tough it out? Any advice would be greatly, appreciated.

1brlsbq,Need guidance for switching from a new job,"Hey everyone. This is my first post in this sub, and the first in any TBH.

I had quit my job (I specialise in Fluid/Thermal Engineering roles, among others) by December last year after working for 2 years, and joined this reputed automobile manufacturer in India. Now I find that, despite the reputation, the inside is quite outdated and to an extent suffocating. Very long deskjob working hours (I don't even get enough time or mental peace to workout in a gym) outdated softwares, no effective R&D at all, and most of all in a city which is quite costly and an environment which really impacts me negatively. I can adjust anywhere, but if given a choice I really wouldn't want to live in this place.

I am really hesitating to apply for other jobs at this moment. Especially for an almost dream role at a company whose customer happens to be my current one - who use the former's simulation software for their automobiles

I dislike displeasing others a lot, which has backfired on me many a times before. Should I be thinking of quitting now itself, or should I stabilise my mind and stay in the current organisation, and try to switch if doesn't work out, next year? If I am switching so early, are there going to be any consequences for me? It doesn't feel ethical, but I understand we have to do what is good for our career. Quite confused, really

Forgive my naivete if any, since I am still at initial stages of my career and there hasn't been anyone yet that I could ask freely. I lurk around reddit and Twitter, but just thought I could ask it once here.

Current job is fully remote and a nice to work with. Was leaving because promotion position doesn’t exist there. When I gave my two weeks notice they asked me why and then created the position the other company was offering.

Would you stay? I’d prefer current job I think. But I feel bad to rescind acceptance at the new job. We work in a small industry.

1brlafp,Planning to switch career need guidance.,"Hello everyone,

First time posting in this sub, sorry if my english is somewhere wrong. I am having work experience of automotive field in one of the German MNC as a service engineer for more than 6 years . I resigned and joined in another German product based company for SME (Subject matter expert) role, already that team is having 5 members for the support. And  its kind of a customer support for the single product most of the works are handling tickets and supporting customer over call but my previous role is at onsite customer support for the company delivered different products. Its been 6 months now joined in this new company and feeling like I am doing the same work who are already in this project for more than 1 year and the currently working project was started at the end of 2021 only. And I think I understood this project within some short time may be due to my previous field expertise helped me on this and than the people who are already in this project gets still struggling they hired me to assist customers in one specific field where other team members are lacking. My position level in this project looks like at entry level as per the hierarchy and not even considered as an experienced when I come to know the company hierarchy levels this was not mentioned in the offer letter at the time of joining. I am feeling like I am being de-valued and considered same as others. Do I need to switch back my career or stay in this. If I need to stay in this how can I make myself being valued and improve myself. Salary is decent and the organization work culture is also great.

Note : Previously I worked mostly in hardwares which involve tools and troubleshooting the product with no shifts but now working mostly in laptop at graveyard shift which makes me feel sick on what I am doing. I wanted to work in hardwares but the existing prohect doesn't have any scope in hardware which is clear from the management and If I need to move to any hardware team that is only through my networking skills in the organization.


Can someone help me out to get me out of this dilemma and need your suggestions.

Thanks for your response in advance and queries are welcome.",OkMistake6835,1,1.0,0,1711814551,2024-03-30 16:02:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1brlafp/planning_to_switch_career_need_guidance/,3,2024

1brj9k8,High school student (8 grade) want to get into Quantum AI.,"Hello everyone,  
  
I am an 8th-grade high school student in Germany. I am very interested in computer science, which I have been passionate about for about 2 years now. During this time, I have learned Python programming and delved into machine learning/deep learning with TensorFlow. However, I am also very interested in physics, especially in Quantum Physics. So, I think that Quantum computing/Quantum AI is the perfect career path for me.  
  
Now, I have a few questions. Firstly, do you think it's a good career? My thoughts are that when I obtain my Master's degree, Quantum Computing will start to experience the same level of hype as AI does currently. This would enable me to be one of the first leading researchers in Quantum AI. Of course, I understand that this will require long and hard work, but I believe that if I am truly dedicated, I can achieve it. Both the hype and the salary are important to me because I really want to achieve financial freedom as soon as possible (with something that I enjoy doing, although I know there are better ways to become wealthy), so that I can focus on what I love such as conducting research in this area, teaching, giving talks, etc.  
  
To summarize my questions: Do you think that in around 8-10 years, Quantum Computing will experience a surge in hype similar to AI's current status, enabling me to become one of the leading researchers in this field? And what would the salary look like?  
  
I greatly appreciate your attention and your time in reading my text",ShapeAdorable2760,1,1.0,4,1711809188,2024-03-30 14:33:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1brj9k8/high_school_student_8_grade_want_to_get_into/,3,2024

1brh6g9,Is there a way to find jobs that you don't know exist? Neither recruiters nor career advisors seem to be able to help.,"Is there anyone who can help plan for a job that I don't know exists?

(Background of my skills: I know a lot of techish stuff, specialized in visual simulation using proprietary engines, lots of 3d modeling, animation, scripting in software, problem solving for delivering creative products for clients, etc)

Context:

I'm a prof now, I had an average C student graduate, flounder for a few years, then land a job at a bank as a ""financial analyst"".

I ask him how he did it. Where did that come from? His majors had nothing to do with economics, banking, analysis, etc.

He said that he took one free online python course and landed the position. It's just writing basic python scripts that a beginner can do, for a bank.

I didn't know this position existed. My friends who WORK in banking didn't know this position existed. Recruiters I've spoken to didn't know this position existed.

So my question that I'm asking as many people as possible is: based on who I am what can you advise me to learn to land a 6-figure job?

Recruiters will ask me what my current skills are and say, oh, I don't have anything. Or, well of you don't have a skill I can't help you. But that's the thing. I COULD learn Python, I've used it before for small projects. But there are DOZENS of other things I ""could"" learn that could also lead to some job that I don't know exists.

I've hired ""career consultants"" who basically just ask what I know and what I want to do.

My response is ""before I knew about my former student's job in banking, I wouldn't have said I wanted to do that, but I would LOVE to take a shot at it! 

I just want MORE examples like that. Then my career advisor was like, okay what kinds of jobs? ""Uggghhhhh"" 

I've been ghosted by recruiters (even friends of family) and I'm not even asking them for jobs, just help as to what directions to go in, where to look, how to look, how to strategize, etc.

Maybe there is no answer. I don't know. Just thought I'd ask one more time.

Thanks for any thoughts!

1br5oex,Directionless soon-to-be physics graduate,"Hi everyone, I'm stuck and I'm lost.  
I'm graduating next year with an Master’s in Physics with Philosophy from the University of Lincoln (a fairly decent university, but it's excellent for its Maths and Physics school).   
I'm aiming for first-class honours, but I'm currently working hard and sitting comfortably near the top of my class.  
   
Career-wise, I'm feeling a bit lost and hoping to get some honest advice. My degree offers a strong foundation in physics, math, and philosophy, but I'm struggling to translate that into a specific career path. The physics industry sounds interesting, but I don't have a clear picture of what jobs are actually out there.  
   
Here are some of my qualifications:  
\-Strong academic background, including very good English communication and writing skills, and very mathematically competent;  
\-Problem-solving abilities from both my physics and philosophy studies, and quite computationally literate;  
\-Leadership experience as a course representative for most of my undergrad and a paid school ambassador;  
\-Good social skills and a broad range of interests, including writing (I do a lot of writing in my free time) and various humanities subjects;  
\-I am also reasonably well travelled and have visited a number of countries on my own accord for extended periods of time.  
   
Work experiences:  
\-Leading a research project at the university, published in their e-journal, and presented at a conference (funded by a £1000 grant!);  
\-Assisting with training and instruction at a paragliding school;  
\-Volunteering for 1.5 years at a hospice, providing care alongside nurses;  
\-Working as a COVID-19 contact tracer, offering medical guidance;  
\-Volunteering as a math teacher in Nepal for 2 months.  
   
What jobs would you recommend someone like me for once they graduate? As I said, the physics industry sounds promising, and I hear the money can be good there, but I have no idea how to approach it.  
Also, though academia seems financially daunting, I'm open to exploring it. I'm also very interested in working abroad and escaping the current situation in England.

I'm also a single mom with zero financial support from the other parent, so waiting another year and a half for disability without something coming in isn't feasible. I have 3 seperate disabling conditions; Chronic kidney disease, severe chronic pain (fibro and spinal issues) and a combo of PTSD/MDD/ADHD. I have 15 doctors and average 3 days per month in-hospital. I take a crap-ton of meds, including what you would expect from pain management.

All that being said, we are poor. I cannot allow my 13yo to suffer because of my issues. We were fully financially stable until I got very sick in early 2021, and 80k in savings didn't last nearly as long as I would've liked. We spent 8 months homeless last year because a complete stranger vandalized and totaled my last asset (my car) in 5 min less than a week after I was denied disability and had put the car up for sale. The result was a10k loss, and without steady income we havent bounced back. I've got to figure something out because the stress of being literally broke is making me more and more sick. I can't stand for long periods (5-10 min) due to pain and fainting issues, I can't carry anything more than 20lbs, I can't sit upright (like in a computer chair) for more than 30 min. I tried working from home so I could sit in a recliner comfortably, but my medications were an issue for 3 different companies, despite my being extremely forthcoming long before any drug testing was done. Plus, I'm bored! I've got an extremely active, curious mind that is definitely not satisfied watching TV and doing fuck-all day in and day out.

I'm at a loss here. Picking a college major took 3 years, and I didn't pick my career, it just happened.

I was concerned at first about taxes, healthcare, and all of those things, but after a bunch of research, I’m speaking with a CPA come Monday and locking in a plan for taxes, setting up the required insurance (business and health), and speaking with a lawyer. 

I’m curious if there’s any warnings of DOs and DONTs as a new contractor?

1br3xgl,Need some advice,"Early 30’s. Work for a well-known company that manufactures specialty vehicles. I am a part of a 5 person team (manager, assistant manager, two other people, and me). I am lead liaison for a specialty legal team (mediation and pre-trial), and cover all other aspects of our group function (dealer negotiations, manufacturer inspections, customer cases, legal / attorney follow up, decedent / survivor, records requests, document requests from corporate, financial / lender, etc.). I’ve been in my capacity the last couple of years, I’m burnt out (average burn out is 18 months), and my department is where careers go to die (we’re such a specialty division that no one really knows what all we do, and we’re not really supposed to go into too much detail otherwise - everything written down could be recalled if subpoena’d). 

I make 50k a year, but drive 2 hours a day and that isn’t doing me any favors. I’m up from 430AM - 11PM. 

Our management told us that they won’t cover any of our workload, and have discouraged us from taking any meaningful time off. I took 5-ish days total off when my daughter was born, and will have to spread out my annual PTO for when the next one comes in the fall. 

My senior manager has openly talked down to me in front of other departments, to the point they left the office so they wouldn’t have to witness it if HR got involved. I let it go.

My senior manager also told me after a serious life event happened that left us living with my in-laws for 6 months, that “I needed to focus on my work.” and “I needed to focus on my personal life when I wasn’t there” (there was more, but same basic message). Manager even called me into an office to tell me our VP advised I looked “unkempt” (my hair was a little long but not heavy metal long, I always come in clean and in clean clothes - even while my life was falling apart).

I basically make enough to pay our mortgage and bills and put a couple hundred dollars a month away for our emergency fund, but I don’t know how to move forward. 

If I calculate the 10 hours each week spent in the car commuting against my income, I make 37k before taxes / insurance / retirement. 

This job has encouraged an eating disorder, clinical depression levels I hadn’t seen at my lowest points, and the consistent reoccurring thought that this isn’t the life I want.

I don’t know where to go from here…

I recently accepted a remote IT job paying a little over 17 an hr. I know that if I stay put for a year or two or three I could *potentially* make more money but there's no guarantee if that. And thats what scares me. Tech is not as stable anymore depending on what you do. 

Meanwhile, I've recently had an itch to pursue nursing. I hear the money is good and I think I'd actually enjoy the work, plus there's more job stability. *I know it can be a shit job though, so I'm definitely not romanticizing it* Yeah the money would be life changing, but I'd also be able to take care of my family to if they ever got sick. I also don't mind working with people, yeah it can be mentaly draining but that doesn't scare me. 

So my question is, both have huge benefits and disadvantages, but which career path would you take? With IT the ROI would be slow. I'm 29 so I probably wouldn't see a huge growth in my skills set until mid 30s maybe and that scares me. Especially since again, finances are in the  Whereas if I became a nurse, I could do it in 12 months as an LPN and make money right away. 

I think my goal is to give myself a year to feel out my IT job andsee where it could go *the company seems to have growth opportunities* and if I want to do nursing, I can volunteer at a hospital and maybe get health related certifications to see if thats the career I'm suited for.

1br20tl,"Lost in career, think l'll get laid off soon and lose my visa, job applications not leading anywhere, any advice?","Hello,

I am a bit lost in my career, I am currently in the UK on a work visa and I believe my current employer and I will part ways soon. Which will mean I will have to find another sponsored job or leave the country eventually which I would like to avoid.
I have a bachelors in computer science, which honestly speaking made me realize it’s the wrong field for me, but it was too late for me to change. I then did a masters in information security in an attempt to move towards the less technical side of things, which I enjoyed more. 
My first work experience was as a research engineer, which included various projects but nothing in depth, I have had imposter syndrome throughout and my performance is pretty low which is why I am trying to leave to a different role, no blame on the company as they are trying to help but we don’t think I’m the right fit as the tasks are very opened(research).

Also unfortunately I don’t have anything I’m overly passionate about that I could pursue for work, so money is purely the motivation, hoping I can develop an interest as I go a long.

Any guidance/suggestions on what roles I could apply for, or what I should focus on will be greatly appreciated. I know software engineering is the obvious answer but I am very weak in coding after several attempts at trying to learn it, which made me not enjoy it either. Will probably need a junior role where I can learn and train on the job.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you in advance!

1br14y8,Graduating in a month and idk what to do,"I’ll be graduating in a month with a BA in Econ and minors in data science and creative writing. My current priorities in a job are something that lets me reach six figures in a few years and doesn’t require a lot of social interaction/getting clients to like you. 

I didn’t have an internship in the summer before senior year but I had two the previous years. However, I don’t think I can go back to them for a job. One was an internship at a tax accounting firm and they don’t even remember me anymore when I reached out. The other was a commercial real estate firm where I was doing like 75% accounting work and 25% other stuff. I don’t think they like me since I was awkward and accidentally turned down a job that the boss’ wife offered me 4 months ago (I thought I wanted to immediately do a full time masters in accounting)

Anyways, now I have to decide what to pursue after graduation. I feel so boxed into accounting even though I’m an econ major and only had one official accounting internship. But my family wants me to do it because of the job security and because I don’t have experience in anything else and didnt network into other finance/banking jobs.

I don’t enjoy accounting work. I’m also apprehensive since I know the salary is like 60k for the first few years if you’re lucky and the work life balance is pretty shit if you do PA. Then after 30 years, the salary caps off around 200k. 
I have a week to decide if I want to enroll in this accounting masters or try something else. I go to a T20 university and I feel like if I already need to spend tens of thousands on a masters I should do something more lucrative like data science. The problem is, my math and coding skills are not great. But since I’ve changed my studying method, I took my first python class last semester and actually enjoyed coding. I’m not sure if I can catch up on all of the math and coding experience other people will have (the highest level of math I’ve taken is calculus)
I’m been applying to a few jobs but I don’t feel confident enough to apply to many because I just don’t have any specialized, employable skills. 

Im curious about data science, commercial banking, other finance jobs but I’m not sure which certifications, masters, bootcamps are actually useful. 

Sorry this post is such a mess, but this is my current situation. What would you do if you were in my situation? What is the highest paying job I can realistically pursue? I already know that I should’ve researched and networked a long time ago and I’m starting to now. Any advice is appreciated.

The situation:

* My leadership are nice people but have no concrete vision or strategy of what we are doing with our product area. I've pressed them on it and tried to get clarification but nothing has changed, I'm stuck doing ops work that I'm not interested in.
* I've been here two years through 3 're-orgs' aka rounds of layoffs. Through this my job has completely changed from what it was presented to be in the interview process.
* The pros are that I'm getting paid decently to not really work much and I'm 100% remote. Company is a big name brand that looks good on a resume.
* I've been actively trying to get out of this job for over a year and only had a few interviews, despite pouring tons of effort into improving/quantifying my resume, networking, and crafting targeted applications towards desirable roles (few and far between).

My fears:

* I fear getting laid off every day, even though I know its not entirely in my control. I'm stressing about this and work when I'm not even on the clock.
* Stagnating by staying here longer and longer. Especially at my experience level (3 YOE).
* Taking a pay cut, especially in this economy. If I take a pay cut, how much is acceptable? Where do I draw the line?
* I also fear losing 100% remote, especially since I have a disability (crohns disease) which affects my daily life. But if you rule out hybrid jobs, there's little to nothing out there.
* If I go back to school, there's no guarantee I'll even get a better job after. And I'll be out a bunch of tuition plus years of salary.
* I feel like I lucked out big time in the hiring frenzy of 2021, hottest job market in decade(s), and won't be able to replicate that success going forward.

My stats:

* 27 years old
* Bachelors degree
* Make about 140k (depends on stock/performance)

1bqykhs,What else can I do to set myself apart?,"Bit of background: two graduate degrees (MS in Mech Engineering and an MBA in entrepreneurship), and 7 years experience in engineering and product management. 

I started my career at a larger corporation as an engineer and transitioned into product management at the some company. There was a massive culture shift due to some leadership changes, so myself and most of my friends left the company. I left for another company in hopes of further career growth, but only stayed for a year as both my new boss and his boss left the company within months of my being there. My new manager at this company all but quashed any notion of career growth at the company, so I started looking elsewhere and at smaller companies where I could make a larger impact and ideally grow professionally instead of being siloed in a role. 

After looking for a while, I finally landed a gig at a smaller startup and established myself there as someone who got things done. There was talk of a directorship and more equity in the company, and then I was promptly fired. I worked with a young team at this startup and we consistently ran into the same issues time and time again, so I brought up Netflix's [chaos monkey testing theory.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering#:~:text=engineering%20tools%20subsection-,Chaos%20Monkey,-Simian%20Army) A colleague interpreted this as my calling customers monkeys and unintelligent, and submitted a complaint to HR. Both HR and the CEO had never heard of chaos monkey testing, told me I violated our sensitivity clause, and fired me. 

Fast forward 3 months of hellish job interviews having to explain why I was fired and I landed another job at a small startup. It seemed like the perfect opportunity for me where I could grow and was truly interested in the work. Once again though, after two months of my being there, my manager left for his dream job. I was given team lead responsibilities until they hired a replacement and guided the team forward. Fast forward a couple of months and my new boss is hired. Really smart individual and someone I felt I could learn a lot from. We began talking about a promotion as I'd cleaned up a lot of messes the old product team had left behind, and it finally sounded like things were moving in the right direction...then the company laid off 30% of the work force due to a lack of funding, myself included. We'd all been told we had more than enough funding to last another year and a half, but I suppose that was a lie. 

Now I find myself in the job market once again with the last three tenures at companies being a year or less. And despite having multiple graduate degrees and plenty of experience, I'm having no luck whatsoever in the job market and I assume it's all because I now look like a serial job hopper with no loyalty whatsoever. 

Just looking for advice as to how I navigate the absurd past few years in my resume so that I can get in front of people and explain my recent professional history. Any advice? 

**TL;DR: I've got multiple grad degress and five years of product management experience, but my tenure at the last three companies I've worked for has been a year or less.

1bqyjog,"A degree in management along with certifications aren't enough to land me a job at 40, please help.","I am changing careers to become a Project Manager (PM); my energy is high; I have never been sharper. I can be a PM in different sectors, but I noticed that every one of these sectors requires highly specialized knowledge and experience, which I don't have because I did a little bit of everything from retail, production line, manufacturing, administration, and nobody wants a guy with a bunch of easy certificates and no specialized experience. Traveling and working informally overseas did not help. Foreign culturally-incompatible experience is not transferable, the expected local experience on job postings is discouraging and I hope there is a way to insert myself into the PM industry anyhow. I am currently doing an online undergraduate Management program with some courses related to PM.

  
I have an assertive and highly communicative personality and would love to pursue Project Management. I just know very well that there is no way to manage anything without getting immersed in any given sector first, this takes time and lots of overtime, unless managing in itself is my focus and whoever hires me can trust that I am competent enough to learn on the job during the training period to not require that much experience.

  
This is where internships come into play if there were only enough of them in my geographic area. Why don’t employers hire on partial pay? I’d love to work for a minimum wage to gain experience and prove my worth within the company. Fire me if I fail to deliver on my self-proclaimed competency! I thought that professional certification programs were meant to prepare for the job and compensate for the lack of experience as opposed to only complementing existing experience.

  
I feel like there is a gap between theory and on the job requirements and no real transitionary employability phase with adequate training. I keep seeing Project Management ads from Google promising a PM job without experience, nice relatable testimonies and all that, but why lie? Offer a certification program that does in fact guarantee a job upon successful completion, let’s say with a minimum score of 95% and extra-long probation period.

  
I understand that Project Management is only complementary to whatever existing specialty, yet I want to specialize in managing large projects that already have the technical resources to get the project completed on budget without me having to know how the pipe is welded. Can't specialization can be pursued from within the working environment as opposed to coming from existing experience alone? Not everybody is 20 years old anymore, maybe with the help of courses on the side (after work)? The idea that inadequate professional experience cannot be gained on the job is crazy.  
The challenge for any 40 year old undergoing a career change right now is to compete against the already experienced entitlements, some of whom are young and sassy with a lot of social clout in an environment where such things matter, the older folk are more experienced but not necessarily productive. Either way competency has to be upheld with demonstrated continues effort to guarantee maximum productivity, how can I show that I am not a typical lazy 40 year old?

  
My current fear is that I will graduate with a Management degree and then get stuck managing a retail store with no prospects for advancement. Daily retail and hospitality operations have nothing to do with PM. How do I break into Project Management without prior experience? In other words, how can I market myself as a potential asset to a prospective employer without appearing desperate? I do not have high wage expectations, I do not compare myself to entitled professionals in my age group and more than willing to offer my loyalty in a company where I can learn and advance but how would they know I am not lying? Is there a comprehensive online assessment that employers care about to compensate for the lack of experience? Could anything else pre-qualify me for an actual position in Project Management without prior experience? I understand that networking plays a crucial role in all this, but I don’t have such connections as of yet nor am I an active social butterfly with endless venues to choose from where I can just put myself “out there”. Where do I market myself apart from LinkedIn without making mistakes along the way? Any career coaches out there?

1bqy345,New job: high pay but low scope ,"I began a job approximately nine months ago in a marketing analytics role. The title of the role was specialist, but the role was described to involve close collaboration with associate directors of digital marketing and strategy, as well as the AVP. They emphasized that there wasn't a traditional org chart. My responsibilities include meeting with various teams within the marketing department, providing analytics on performance, and offering recommendations for improvement. Surprisingly, the job pays more than some director positions in the industry and even exceeds the salary of some assistant directors within my own company.

However, upon starting, I realized that my position within the company's hierarchy is much lower than anticipated, representing a reduction in responsibilities compared to my previous job. Some changes are relatively minor, such as having a cubicle instead of an office, while others are more significant, like experiencing delays or being ignored when communicating with teammates. I addressed these concerns with my boss and the AVP, hoping for clarity during their managerial discussions about my role. Instead, their solution was for me to cc them on emails. This approach is frustrating as it feels overly assertive, hindering my efforts to foster friendly working relationships with different teams. Due to the slow response rate, I find myself only working about 15 hours per week, despite receiving praise from my manager and colleagues.

During a meeting with my boss to express my unhappiness, he acknowledged the misleading aspects of the job interview process and apologized. However, as I outlined my concerns, he repeatedly stated he didn't know how to address the situation.

Another aspect is the emphasis during the interview process on the large amount of growth opportunities within the company – a significant factor in my decision to leave my previous job. I applied for a promotion in which I had all relevant skills except one, which happened to be the hiring manager's top priority: experience in a project management software that my employer currently doesn't have but is rolling out soon. Getting my current job actually diminished my chances for this new role. When I inquired about other growth prospects, none were presented in the coming future beyond lateral moves or jumps way to high.

While I am eager to make this job work, I have begun applying for other positions. However, I encounter a dilemma as many higher-ranking positions in my industry offer salaries lower than what I currently earn. Additionally, I worry that my current title as a specialist might cause potential employers to overlook my applications, despite my qualifications.

I would appreciate any advice on how to make my current job work better or how to address the title problem when applying to other jobs.",Bornacoric21,1,1.0,0,1711742271,2024-03-29 19:57:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bqy345/new_job_high_pay_but_low_scope/,3,2024
1bqxt43,In DESPERATE need of career advice!!!! (TW: GRIEF + CHRONIC PAIN),"I’m sorry if this is a long winded post, it would be helpful if everyone knew my situation in detail to give me appropriate advice.  
For reference, I’m a very ambitious person. (From the UK)  
I’ve always done okay in school with minimal effort. (10 As at GCSE) Initially, I’ve had always wanted to become a psychologist. To be honest, this was always an innate thing. I dont’ remember when this ‘dream’ began - that career has just constantly been an option. When I was younger (aged 8-16) I knew that I was going to do a psychology degree.  
Well, a week before I turned 17 (about a month into year 12), I was diagnosed with a chronic eye condition called corneal neuralgia. Quite rare. I basically have eye pain in my eyes that comes and goes. (stabbing in the cornea, aches and dryness etc.) These symptoms arrived overnight. As you can imagine, I was extremely depressed and hopeless. I did at one point attempt to take my own life. I was homebound for 3 months. Came back to college, was failing everything etc etc…  
My brother died a month before AS exams. (Sudden death, no known health conditions at the time, only 28 and we were extremely close)  
I retook Year 12 as I was sort of managing my eye condition. I became interested in biology (I do bio, psych and business A levels) and was set on becoming an optometrist bc of wanting to help people with my condition. I was getting better.  
In my AS year 12 exams, I got As in every single exam, including full UMS in biology and psychology. (basically 100%)  
(the reason why I got such high marks is because I was revising A LOT, it was a coping mecahnism for grief, everytime my brain would think about my brother, I picked up a textbook. I would also have to revise with one eye at a time, my eyes have a battery life lol)  
However, my eye disease got worse starting from November 2023. It’s way more hard to manage and studying gives me more eye pain. I had flare ups where I couldn’t open my eyes bc it would hurt so bad. I was suicidal again and very not like my self essentially.  
I made the difficult decision to cancel my university offers for Optometry + withdrew my university application as I wouldn’t be able to do the actual job of looking at people’s eyes etc because I can’t keep my eyes open for long due to eye pain. I don’t want a job where I’m straining my eyes. I don’t want to study a 4 year degree in which I may not be able to use.  
I’m going on a gap year when I finish A levels and planning on applying for a psychology degree, ideally I want to go to Bath but I’m not sure if I will do well in my final A level exams. I’m just really worried to be honest, about a lot of things  
1. People say psychology degrees are useless, but I’m commited to becoming a psychologist or CBT therapist.  
2. Sometimes I doubt if becoming a therapist is for me. The death of my brother is really sinking in now, it’s almost been 2 years since he died. I’m 19 and still feel like that scared 17 year old girl. What if I’m just not built to work in mental health?  
3. What I liked about optometry is that it is a set career path where you are guaranteed a job, psychology not so much. But that’s also why I should just do psychology because I don’t know what’s happening with my eye disease. I could get worse. I could get better. I may not be able to use my eyes properly in the future, hence why becoming a psychologist makes sense bc I can work around my condition. I can’t do this with optometry.  
4. Optometry felt like a perfect job for me I guess, because it has decent pay and I’m interested in eye stuff. Conversely, I know that being a psychologist would be more rewarding and give my life meaning. It would allow me to not define myself via my eye disease.  
5. I need to go to a good university for psych. I’m worried that I won’t do well in my final exams. I have been getting As and Bs in assessments this year but I’ve never felt so depressed. I’ve been in a lot of phyiscal and emotional pain so it probably will affect my final grades.  
I regret withdrawing my optometry application sometimes, but deep down I know it’s for the best. I just feel like a complete failure and that my life will amount to nothing. I want to be happy and have a job I like that can accomodate my condition.  
I don’t really know what I’m asking anymore. I just needed to vent lol, since my brother died, I have no one to get advice from.  
Do you guys think that it was a good decision to not purse optometry and to try and become a therapist or psychologist instead?  
Any other career paths that don’t require too much screentime or visual tasks?…

1bqx6k4,Told i’m a “wildcard” candidate for a leadership promotion ,"Hey! 

I’ve passed the first and second round interviews for a sales leadership promotion and will be headed into the final panel interview next week. 

I was told that I’m the wildcard candidate, meaning that I might lack the experience but they see something in me that could land me the job. 

I was provided a slide deck with an outline for my presentation and one page asks for defining moments in my personal and professional life. 

On April 16th of this year, I’ll celebrate 6 years of sobriety. I was barely legal drinking age on 4/16/18 when I decided to give up alcohol. At this time I was an unemployed, college dropout 2 months behind on rent with a red eviction notice on my front door. I didn’t have a car much less a tv lol. I was single, and had no real plan to correct any of the above.  

Today, almost 6 years later, I’m gainfully employed, hold a BA in business admin, obtained my MBA, own my home, drive my dream truck, and I’m expecting to become a father later this year with my wonderful wife! 

Deciding to get sober on April 16, 2018 was THE defining moment of my life. 

I want to leave it all on the field for this promotion, and I feel like mentioning this a defining moment but I don’t want to raise any red flags.

1bqtgms,Leave job I like for a 20k increase?,"This is definitely been asked before but thought it was worth getting a fresh take. 

I enjoy my current job. Good culture, good boss, plenty of freedom, generous holidays etc. But for my industry it pays a good bit below average. It is an established company though that's been around for decades. I've been there for a couple years and this is the least stressed I've been anywhere. Promotion wouldn't be impossible but no opportunitys are in sight. Boss says I'm doing all the right things to be in with a chance but I'm not the only one thinking the same and internal opportunities are scarce. 

I'm through to the final round of interviews for a new job. I wasn't looking for a new opportunity but a recruiter messaged me and I went with the flow, It's suddenly got very real. If successful my salary would go from 40k to 60k, but I suspect all other benefits holidays etc would be the minimum permitted (which here in the UK is pretty tolerable tbh) The new company is practically a startup just putting together a new team so it's a bit of a risk.

Here's the kicker. My wife and I have just bought a new house, with a much more expensive mortgage than were used to. I can afford it just fine on my current salary but if I moved jobs and it didn't work out that could be a difficult situation. On the other hand the extra money would let us live very comfortably if it all worked out, especially if we were to start a family in the next couple of years. 

If I get an offer I'll definitely be bringing it to my current boss to see if they can make a decent counter, but if not I'll have some soul searching to do. 

Definitely a good problem to have, but still could do with some thoughts. Thanks!

1bqrnl0,"Job hopping, W2 vs 1099","I started my first job in my field last October. I pretty much just took the first job that landed in my lap once I graduated. I work for a small company/clinic, maybe 12 employees at most. When I first got the offer, they gave me an option of hourly pay based on the number of clients I'm seeing, or a percentage of money brought into the company. I opted to take the hourly because it seemed more stable, and I would be able to do administrative tasks to earn money while building my caseload. 

Recently, my boss emailed the company and informed everyone that they can no longer afford to have W2 employees because it costs too much (insurance, taxes, PTO, etc.). I've also just been a bit disappointed at how unprofessional my boss seems, and I've gotten a lot of grief for getting ""too many administrative hours"". There also seems to be some shady business practices going on. Nothing I can point to specifically, but I can see how much money I'm bringing in to the company and the numbers seem off.

When I got that email, I applied to >20 other jobs in my area, and I've been doing interviews all week. I've gotten to the 2nd round of interviews at every place I've interviewed at. I've been told at this place that they have one of the most ""generous"" compensation models for fresh graduates in the area, but I have not found that to be the case. At one place I interviewed, their base salary is more than double what I'm making here. At another, base is double with the opportunity to make significantly more depending on how large of a caseload I want to take on. 

My issue is, I feel guilty. I've built a good relationship with my direct supervisor, as well as with some of my coworkers. I know my boss is struggling, and I can't fault them for that, but it seems illegal or at least unethical to offer me a W2 position and then take it away less than six months later. I would not have accepted the position at this company if I knew I would have to be a contractor. 

I had an interview the other day that went really well, great workplace culture, great salary, great benefits. I'm leaning towards accepting it. I just don't know how to deal with the guilt, and I don't want it to look like I'm just jumping ship at the first sign of danger.

I've also just been a bit disappointed at how unprofessional my boss seems, and I've gotten a lot of grief for getting ""too many administrative hours"". There also seems to be some shady business practices going on.
When I got that email, I applied to >20 other jobs in my area, and I've been doing interviews all week. I've gotten to the 2nd round of interviews at every place I've interviewed at. I've been told at this place that they have one of the most ""generous"" compensation models for fresh graduates in the area, but I have not found that to be the case. At one place I interviewed, their base salary is more than double what I'm making here. At another, base is double with the opportunity to make significantly more depending on how large of a caseload I want to take on. 
My issue is, I feel guilty. I've built a good relationship with my direct supervisor, as well as with some of my coworkers. I know my boss is struggling, and I can't fault them for that, but it seems illegal or at least unethical to offer me a W2 position and then take it away less than six months later. I would not have accepted the position at this company if I knew I would have to be a contractor.
I had an interview the other day that went really well, great workplace culture, great salary, great benefits. I'm leaning towards accepting it. I just don't know how to deal with the guilt, and I don't want it to look like I'm just jumping ship at the first sign of danger.

1bqq1uj,Please advise me which direction should I go now. I cannot understand. It's become too complicated. I need genuine help!! Any guidance will do.,"I am a 30 year old B.Tech guy passed out in 2015. Did my 12th in 2010 (One year gap).   
After my engineering I decided to prepare for government job. I couldn't clear the job though. Later in 2017 I decided to leave home due to mental exhaustion. These are steps I took in my career since Nov 2017.

  
I joined an international BPO job which paid more rather than an internship or job as a fresher in IT (Very bad choice I know.. I hope I knew that then)

  
After living in that environment and being careless I wasted time. Then I realized that I should do something. I couldn't prepare for govt. job nor I could see a future in the sector. I quit in 2019 and decided that I will only go for IT job. At the same time I gave up on government job as it was the time to decide a direction. I decided to get into IT.. but couldn't. After 6 months of unemployment I joined another BPO of a bank for credit card payment collection around the end of 2019.

  
Soon pandemic hit and I lost this job. But at the same time I got a WFH job in an Ed-Tech company as Customer Success Executive. It was not a BPO job and working environment was great. After some time I realized there is no future there as well. They were not promoting me as TL anytime soon.   
I got to know from a friend of mine about creating fake experience which many of other guys also did and got a job as developer in IT after they messed up their career due to wrong decisions. I followed the same footsteps but went for the role of Business Analyst (BA) as I used to work on Excel and Power BI as Customer Success in this company.

  
I prepared experience for BA and got job as IT Consultant/BA in last week of September 2023. Getting the job was difficult as I couldn't connect to anyone on LinkedIn with fake experience. However I got a decent job with 7.2L package with a company on contract in government office. I did my work there but then there comes a conflict between the company and the government department. Company terminated me in back date. I was terminated on 1st March while giving the date of termination as Dec 31st, 2023. 

  
Govt department had stopped giving my Monthly Performance Report (MPR) which was merely the attendance to the company to give my salary. The company then gets the money from the government which was fixed at the package of 9.3L. I got a surprise email from the HR on the day of termination. I wasn't even aware of it. No notice.. nothing. Anyways, I lost the job again and I didn't even get the salary for the month of Jan and Feb. I can file some legal action. I don't how exactly but I have bigger problems at hand now.

  
I don't know how to apply and where to apply. I will show that I served in this company till Feb 2024. Counting just months it is 6 months so I can make it work. But which experience should I show now? The real one which is for Sr. Customer Success and then IT consultant. The Fake one is BA for 2 years and 6 months of the latest one. It is very hard to get a job with the real one. 6 months experience won't stand much. But if I go for fake one, I can't apply on LinkedIn. Also, it is hard to be confident when applying with fake experience with all the questioning about the projects.

  
A friend of mine gave me the advice to go for real one and apply for Customer Success Manager or Account Manager. They also earn good. But I am more in to BA and Consultant role. Salary matters but I have never been that much money minded which is also the reason I am in this career state. I lose focus and get in the chill mode very soon. I am regretting it a lot now. I don't know what to do. Career is messed up and there are lots of responsibility and expectations in this stage of life. Fortunately, I am not married.

  
Please ask me any relevant question you ought to know to help me better. I need your advice guys! I need to know how to apply for the next job. I am running out of time.

I had submitted fake letter of acceptance and email thread to convince them. Now my main question is whether my company can contact the university and ask them directly that this person has been admitted to your university or not ! If the company do ask, then is the university liable to answer them ? Or they can simply state that its private and confidential information we can’t share anything about it ! FYI my company is based in India and the university in this case is Canadian university.

FYI - My company is too paranoid they don’t release candidates early even if they’re on bench.

1bqogsj,Continue drowning slow or drown fast? Where do I go from here?,"For over 30 years I've been trying to claw our way out of poverty.  We played the game by the rules, did all the things we were told to do.  My spouse and I earned 3 professional degrees, lived like paupers to break the shackles of student loan debt, then medical debt.  We paid our taxes till there was nothing left to give, and when we did have any left over, we put it into retirement accounts.  However, our dollars have always steadily lost purchasing power, and ""the game"" always pushed us to work more and more, clawing for that next promotion or pay increase, which sometimes we won, but ultimately we've just been treading water for decades now.

The past 3 years was the largest ""stimulus"" and devaluation of the dollar that we've ever experienced.  Despite our frugal lives, despite squeezing our budget to the extreme (no air conditioning, no heating, house and cars falling into disrepair, leveraging debt and credit cards to finance even groceries now, cutting our diets, and everything in our lives that cost money to enjoy), there is just nothing left over, and we're drowning.  Each passing week, we're either deeper in debt or reluctantly bleeding down sorely underfunded, paltry retirement funds.  We can't sell our house or cars.  Rent is several times higher than our tiny home, so I guess we could feel fortunate about that, but property taxes will eventually push us out anyway.  We need our cars so long as we have parents and children and need to get to jobs and the grocery store, but the cars will likely fail soon anyway as we tend to keep them going for 20+ years and they are reaching end of life.  There is just nothing left to squeeze, and we're drowning.

So, I find myself wonder what why are we even playing this game this way.  I've found no legitimate jobs that pay more.  Yet, we're just working more and more, and still going under.  I don't see the point anymore.  We fight it and drown slow, miserably, or just quit working and say fuck the bills, fuck the taxes, fuck it all, and drown fast.  It's just numbers at this point, numbers we can't pay either way.",agreeablederivative,1,1.0,0,1711716543,2024-03-29 12:49:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bqogsj/continue_drowning_slow_or_drown_fast_where_do_i/,3,2024

1bqkt10,"Bored at work, to scared to switch jobs","Hey r/careeradvice  
I'm male, 25 years old currently working for the last 7 years for a big tech company as well as some side hustles while finishing my bachelors degree in business informatics. In recent days I struggle to find purpose, working my job in tech as an engineer while learning completly different subjects in the same field (which I like alot) in my degree. I am in a quandary because my current work having nice colleagues and paying really good is starting to become incredibly boring (I'm doing the same thing everyday for the last 7 years).   
To climb the carreer ladder in this company I would have to move to another city which my SO doesn't support (And I also don't want to tbh). I like my side hustle but it's not making enough money so that I could quit working my full-time job. Switching carreers while finishing my degree as well as having some obligation for my customers in my side job would be really challenging.   
That's why I'm just drifting through everyday life and can't find enjoyment in anything I do work related anymore. This is affecting my jobs as well as my private life. I don't see the purpose other then making money and providing for my family. My goals and dreams seem so far away I don't really know where my career is going and because I'm to scared to switch jobs.   
My current plan is to finish my bachelors as well as masters degree in about 2 years beeing unhappy, stressed and bored just to overcome taking the risk (thinking the possibilities are greater having a degree).  
Did some of you have the same or a similar experience?   
Some additional info:  
I'm in Europe, where I live it's not normal to switch jobs easily (some of my colleagues work for that company for over 30-40 years). Jobs here are really secure and if you're not activly sabotaging yourself you could work the same job at the same company your whole life (it is expected to work really long for one company).",thrwaway9546,4,1.0,0,1711703682,2024-03-29 09:14:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bqkt10/bored_at_work_to_scared_to_switch_jobs/,3,2024

1bqknv5,Should I switch from early career in banking to government dispatcher job?,"Basically as the title says. Right now I work for a big bank and I have a good entry level position and I do so well my supervisor always tells me I’m on the path of becoming promoted. Well I’ve been through 3 different managers and it’s been 3 years in this entry level position. Where I’m at now it’ll take me probably the rest of this year to gain more experience before I feel confident enough to move from a position where I’m making $40k a year to $59k plus commission. I’m young and have been with the company for 3 years already. 2 more years and I’ll get 5 weeks paid vacation.

The downside is I feel like a pawn in this huge game of chess. No matter how hard I work and how much more work I take on it seems like my Manager is still constantly telling our team we aren’t doing enough while not actively giving us the tools to do better. And I have to deal with people calling off and not showing up when they’re scheduled. 

I’m wondering if it’s smart to stick it out on this career path or look to do something different. I know I have great people skills and am responsible enough to succeed but I don’t want to cap myself if there are other opportunities.

I applied to a great job this winter, loved my interview and thought of it as a dream job in an awesome location that brought us “home” and allowed me to take the next step in my career path at a bigger company.   I was up against an internal candidate but felt I crushed the interview.  This was for a director position. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I’ve been offered a job with them as the “co-Director” along with their internal candidate.  Reasoning seems to boil down to them not wanting to lose their internal but also realizing I’m the more dynamic candidate. I’m gutted to have essentially lost the job I truly wanted but have been trying to talk myself into this alternative and non-traditional role for over a week. 

Pay is fine but I feel in my core this co-Director role is just not the most effective or efficient set up for this type of job and will lead to a lot of unnecessary struggle, particularly for me as the “new” person.  I’ve tried many ways of negotiating but they seem tied to this co-Director idea. 

I’m really at a loss for what to do. I’ve been offered a job that I didn’t apply for, and probably wouldn’t have applied for, and that I know will be unnecessarily challenging and limiting, but it still feels like maybe a good move for me overall career-wise?

1bqi7mc,Should I take a new job while working on my own startup?,"what would you do in this situation? I currently work full time at an MEP consulting firm, but in the evenings I spend my time working on my own startup consulting firm. My goal is to eventually make it my full time job but it could take six months to two years before that becomes reality. I have been applying for licensure in different states, setting up standards, opening banks accounts, and have been trying to lockdown clients. I currently have 10 licenses and a couple clients but nothing major yet.

so here’s the predicament. recruiters contact me several times a week on linked in or via email and I usually ignore them but I had a very persistent recruiter contact me this week and I eventually agreed to take her call. she asked me about my experience and I mentioned that I’m licensed in 10 states. I didn’t mention anything about my startup and talked mostly about my experience at my current and previous job. I was trying to end the conversation because I really wasn’t interested in a new job so I told her that I wouldn’t even consider a new job unless it pays at least 50% more. I figured that would be ridiculous and she would end the conversation. Instead, she said that should be easy to find as she is well connected and that I should send her my resume this week. I started my current job 10 months ago and that was a 50% increase, so this would mean I more than double my salary in less than a year. Wow!

My end goal is to run my own company, which I’m confident will happen in the next year or so, but getting such a big pay increase would really improve my life. I’ve been quiet about my startup with my current company as I’m afraid they would fire me and I would be left with no income, but I’m not sure how I could be hush about it if I start interviewing. Having 10 (soon to be closer to 15) licenses seems like a huge benefit for me in the interview process but I wouldn’t have any (honest) reason as to why I have so many. I think I would have to be honest about my intentions of running my own company, which would probably crush my chances of being hired, which would ultimately make interviewing a waste of time. I’m considering making up a reason as to why I got so many licenses, but I don’t think that’s ethical, and might be borderline Illegal if I have to sign an nda or noncompete.

so what should I do? Should I stay where I’m at and just focus on my own startup? Should I be honest about my intentions and hope for the best during the interviews?

1bqglnt,"I (31, F) am being let go from my chef position a months and a half in even though boss said he likes me and it’s not personal","I don’t get it. I (31, F) am a solid worker. I work as a chef in a new kitchen which is kinda labelled as “cool” atm. I needed the part time work (I mostly do private events and pop ups) and my boss approached me first. At the interview we spoke and got along really well. I told him the salary and hours I needed (yes, I asked for the money I needed and yes, it was the highest hourly rate amidst other employees because I know I deserve it) and guaranteed him that for the salary I was asking I was gonna make shit sparkle and make new recipes etc.

Two days into the job, he announces to everyone the head chef - the guy’s good, has some fragile masculinity issues like most men in kitchen but mostly a chill dude. The last couple of weeks have been a bit weird for me because it just seemed like the head chef was trying to throw me under the bus multiple times but failing (ie. Sending pictures into the group chat with the section I usually work at dirty but it turned out I wasn’t working that section that shift etc)… He also pulled some macho shit on me which a year ago I would have easily bitchslapped him into oblivion but this time round I just kept my head down and did the good work ‘cause I just wanted to do my job well and make sure my boss is happy with me because I also like him and respect him.

Very often at this job I’ve had to deal with people slacking (leaving the shift an hour and a half early, always on their phones, not doing stuff like the chef asked etc) and me pushing through to make sure everything’s in order at the highest quality. And I know I’ve been doing a good job cz the boss is on call in the evenings and literally a day ago told me I grill perfectly.

And the other day my boss’s partner asked why I only had 13 shifts and I was like I’m part time and then he said ah okay was just asking don’t think anything of it. 

Then the next day the boss comes in and clearly wants to speak with me and he basically tells me doesn’t think I’m vibing with the place and that he feels really bad having to let me go and that it has nothing to do with my abilities or talent. So I asked him if it was a cost thing and he was like no it’s not and that I am the highest paid employee continuing to say that I’m part time and that he needs a full time sous chef.

I still don’t get it though- if it’s a cost thing why not let go the people that aren’t pulling their weight around? If it’s the head chef threatened by me and gunning to kick me out why can’t he see that the head chef is just projecting his insecurities? And if it’s a “i need a full time responsible person here”, why doesn’t he offer me a full time job?

I’m doing my brain in on this one ‘cause I know I didn’t do anything wrong and I’ve got a really good work ethic.

Any advice or wisdom to get my head out of the rut is appreciated here, thank you.

It started with a sports physical therapist but the work load, pay, and job description doesn’t completely align with me.

 I was looking into sports psychologist, I would love to help out sports teams and certain people with mental health issues because I’ve struggled with a deep depression that was hard to get out of and I’d love to help people feel encouraged and better about themselves as well as listen to their problems and give them some holistic advice (if that’s what they want that’s just what I prefer). But also their pay can vary and I also dont like the salary 

I was also considering sports psychiatrist which is a salary that I would like, but it can take 12 years, and I’m scared of med school i dont know if I’ll be able to apply myself completely.

Any advice on what to do I’m so confused

(Also I’m scared that with being psychiatric doctor or psychologist, a lot of that negative energy could rub back off onto me which I don’t want any of this to effect my mental health)

1bqe8pj,New Graduate Job - A or B?,"Thanks for clicking in -  advices needed please for a slightly-lost upcoming new graduate!

Background: 25F, postgrad degree that prepares for a in-demand skilled profession

Workplace A: 
- big team, established a few years ago 
- been working there as a part time for a few years so I know the operations & everyone there - really good team and my coworkers do like me (and mutually), boss were encouraging for me to learn. They all looking forward to me graduating and taking on their graduate role 
- as I already know the way they work it’ll likely be easier for me to start up my career 
- but they’re also a typical ‘we are a family’ type business/ corporate - if you’re quiet / don’t voice out they’ll treat you nicely, but if you say anything you’re out of their ‘family’. 
- also would need their staff to regularly bring work home to do unpaid
- we are in a big city with high costs of living

Workplace B:
- located at a small city with low population and relatively lower costs of living
-  long established in their community 
- did a video interview and they really like me, offered a contract before even meeting me in person - but I said I wanted to meet them first and they were excited about the idea of me travelling up to meet them, and offered me accommodation during my few days of visits, and even arranged a team dinner during those days so I can meet everyone. Seems very sincere 
- huge emphasis on work life balance, and advocate to always finish work on time 
- slightly lower salary than Job A
- I know no one in the city, starting fresh 
- this city offers more of what I like compared to my current city (Job A)

1bqcsgt,Manager in boring role or IC in interesting role ,"I'll start this off with a brief background. I (31F) have a decade of work experience. 8 of those were in energy and renewables in a major multinational doing business and commercial development (external-facing). I was a senior IC. 2 years ago, I moved to a different industry. I'm now in a tech multinational leading an internal portfolio management team. I'm well paid, practically exchanged one golden handcuffs for another.

My performance ranking in my current role was very good. Boss told me he slated me for promo for end of year (of course if I meet my goals). I feel appreciated and acknowledged so that's good. 

So what's wrong? 
The work is meaningless. I just review and report on what other teams are doing. Or I analyze data and call them out when they're not doing what they said they'll do. I know it sounds very privileged to complain about this. But compared to my previous career which is highly impactful with long lasting effects and consequences, my current role just seems contrived. I don't understand why they pay all of us so much. We don't contribute to the society. Plus it's a ""dog-eat-dog"" tech company.

So. I'm testing the waters to rejoin the energy world either related to power in my current company or outside. I'm interviewing and let's say I get whatever role I want. 
My dilemma is:
Should I go back to being an IC in a role that's interesting to me?
Or do I just stick with my current role as a manager and strive for the promo?

Notes:
- Assume the money involved in IC biz dev is higher than my current role. With promo, current role would be higher.
- If I stay away from energy and business dev too long, it'll be harder to go back in.
- There's not a lot of managerial positions in biz dev.
- My current org seems to think highly of me based on my recent performance ranking and of course I won't know if the new org/manager would be toxic. Although I suppose you'd never actually know up until you're in there?

I understand careers are personal decisions and what fits for one might not work for another. But I'm curious about other perspectives. How would you deal with this kind of dilemma?",Silvertricks,1,1.0,2,1711675675,2024-03-29 01:27:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bqcsgt/manager_in_boring_role_or_ic_in_interesting_role/,3,2024

1bqbw80,Manager is acting differently ,"Hello,
Since coming back on my maternal leave, my manager is acting strange. She almost ignores me, avoids talking anything career developmentwise. We used to be great work partners as our styles are very similar. 
We had a wonderful relationship, I would say even personal. We exchanged almost daily texts, met outside work (our babies are 2 months apart), she asked my opinion in fair bits professional/personal. 
All those stopped somewhere midway my leave. Since I am back to work, our conversation is gone and sadly I am given very unchallenging tasks. I was evaluated top talent 2 years in a row so this feels not normal. 

I gave her heads up in our next 1:1 I would be addressing some professional setbacks so I kindly asked her not to have anything else in the agenda. She replied saying she cannot do that as she needs to discuss work (amount of work I have is comically low), simply giving me cold shoulder.

1bqbruh,Today my coworker threw a temper tantrum at me because I submitted a help request that wasn’t even for him or made for him,"I work as a system administrator and yesterday my coworker received a high-priority request from my manager and a few other coworkers/customers because 4 different servers were having the same issue of not functioning.

Maybe like 3 weeks ago I had a different coworker come up to me who was having the same issue with one of these 4 servers, and I told him I would help, but I put on the back burner because I was getting absolutely no where with it. My manager contacted my coworker/officemate in a group email, and this group email made me think “oh yeah I completely forgot about and so and so,” so I created a ticket for my coworker who originally came to me to have networking change his subnet. The networking guy who received the ticket completely ignored me, but posted a tip in the request, and I took the information the networking tech posted and I put it into the group chat “networking told me this I don’t know if it helps at all”. 

The network guy who received my request for my coworker who completely ignored me reached out to my coworker/officemate directly without me knowing about it, and actually helped him resolve the issue with the 4 servers completely within 2 hours, and coworker/officemare was taking what I put on my ticket to networking and used it in his ticket as a status update to my manager on what the problem was, and he basically used everything that I had put in my ticket to networking almost word for word. But after the networking tech helped him resolve the issue it made my request no longer needed. 

The next day (today) my coworker closes the door and begins to yell at me and throw a temper tantrum for about 10 minutes about how he was in the “hot seat,” and that I made him look bad because it made it seem like I was doing all of the work. And that how what I did without talking to him makes him not even want to work with me. He wouldn’t even let me get a word in and I couldn’t even explain that my ticket wasn’t even made for him or to help him. I would say around the 6 minute mark I just began to zone out. 

My manager walks in an hour later to thank him for resolving the issue, and after the temper tantrum he had just an hour earlier my coworker said “without the networking tech I wouldn’t have known what to do.” 

I was just thinking “wait so the person who reached out to you helped you completely fix the issue, but you want to yell at me at me about how you were in the hot seat with everyone and that I shouldn’t have done what I did?” Basically, what I want to ask Reddit, am I the a-hole in this situation? During him temper tantrum I do agree that yeah I should have said something about it, but to completely blow your top like that is something that still boggles my mind. Without me submitting my ticket he would still be there spinning his wheels because he even admitted that he wouldn’t have known what to do about the 4 servers being down.

Honestly, I am looking for a job for other reasons but now I am going to be searching more. This isn’t the only time my coworkers have yelled at me or acted overall unprofessional. It’s a very common occurrence. Everything sets these people off even the smallest things that wouldn’t matter normally to other people sets them off. I am at the point where I just don’t care anymore.

1bqblwq,"Does white privilege exist in this industry, and when it comes to hiring in supply chain, do people from top schools get prioritized over everyone else?    ","I attend a fairly well-known, top-ranked supply chain management university in the northeastern United States. However, it is a satellite campus rather than the main campus. I’ve noticed that everyone who is pursuing supply chain programs and securing prestigious internships and high-level positions after graduation are predominantly white.

There were no employees from lesser-known state schools.

The store manager looked pretty tired, but the interview is very challenging.  He talked about my experiences at Goodwill and asked me why I'm part time now.
After that he was very vague about the position, which mean they will give me a placements on the job.  However he asked me what I do as a sorter and which job that I enjoy the most.

I asked him one questions.  Then after that he was like ""We will give you call if you are selected.""

I'm very stressed as I've got a big decision coming up for my career. Currently I'm the sales manager of a small Solar Sales company. I came on and grew the team from 2 to 5 people in two weeks and I'm implementing systems atm to get the company pumping some cash. I could project my earnings although unpredictable anywhere between 60-150k Probably will land around the 90k mark this year. Very exciting and fun job where I get a lot of responsibility, I get to learn about business and manage people for the first time in my life. I love the team and the job and there is good potential for me to come on as a co owner. I also know that I can grow this company. I have goals to get it to 10 Salespeople by end of year. Very ethical company and a good player amongst some bad names out there for solar.  
I did however also land a job as an ASO4 in the Federal Gov doing business investigations. It's starting base of 80k a year with 15% super. I'll learn a lot about the law and worker rights in this role.  
I live at home and have like 10k saved with my only expenses being food and fuel. I've got a lot of pressure from my family to take the Gov job but I don't really want to. I love business, I love the private sector and I hate how inefficient gov agencies can be. I know I'll get really good experience in the gov but I don't see myself their all that long. I'm an Entrepreneur at heart with 2 failed businesses under my belt and dreams of building a business portfolio. I also run a podcast about business on the side which I have the flexibility to do as a student and sales manager.  
I'd love some advice as my parents are adamant that I'm an idiot if I don't take the gov job.  I also don't know if I'll ever get an opportunity to learn about Business the way I have been ever again. On someone else's dime with their trust and expertises at my disposal.  
The two current co owners of the Business and I are sitting down next week to discuss my future at the company. They are aware I want to stay at the company and get equity, as well as that I've had another offer. I believe you can't go wrong with honesty.  
Can consider some hybrid style solutions but I don't think I can do more than part time uni and full time work that effectively. Maybe could do some night time appointments and manage the team on the weekend but it'll get messy very quickly.

1bq9wmw,"Got promoted but took significant pay cut and don't know where to go from here, any advice? ","TLTR:performed miracles, got promoted, took a pay cut, now stuck in a dilemma of liking my job but taking a paycut not sitting well with me

So been working at my job 6 years and I used to really enjoy working there. The work is interesting, I get on with everyone, the pay is decent compared to my previous employers (which I hated) and it's very close to home. However, I got promoted 2 years ago and am yet to see any benefit to it and it's frustrating me more and more. 

I was just working as a regular employee on projects for the first 4 years but was then asked to take on the senior management role on a product that I was familiar with. About halfway through the project I was promoted to management (one level below the senior management role I was doing). The salary I was offered was 7% more than my current base salary, but would still be more than 10% below the average in the company for that level, as I managed to get my hands on the figures from a union representative. And here is where the problem begins. 

When you are a normal employee, for the first 6 years you get a guaranteed 3.1% increase each year. You also get payed overtime of which I did a significant amount. When you take on a management role you do not get any of the guaranteed pay rises and you don't get overtime but instead a bonus based on how well the company is doing and individual performance. 

So going from a regular employee to management was the opportunity to negotiate which I attempted to do. I initially asked for the salary to be reviewed in the basis that I was going above and beyond my role at the moment and the offer was well below the average, in less than two years the base salary increase would be 0.8% and the fact I would be dropping my overtime for the bonus, which would generally never match the OT pay out. I simply asked they add the extra 6.2% onto the base salary. This did not go down well. I was told the the offer was non negotiable and if I didn't take it there was no guarantee I would get the offer again. 

I took a week to think about it and asked friends and family, all with mixed reactions. Family said to take it and eventually it would be made right. Friends asked why on earth would I take it. I decided to go with my gut and take it. There was also someone else who received the same promotion but only got a 4% increase. Now I don't know if that was the right call. I said when I accepted that I would take it on the basis that when I delivered this project as a senior manager the salary was reviewed. 

Somehow I managed to perform a miracle and deliver it on time and under budget, which is unheard of in our line of work, infact was the only project out of 12 to do so in the entire company. 

At my end of year review, I was given the highest individual performance score you could get and was asked could I take on the role of senior manager on another project. I said I would but I would like my salary reviewed if I was to do so like what was agreed. This did not go down well again, was told I shouldn't be looking a pay rise so soon after being promoted. In the same meeting I received the numbers for my bonus which shocked me. I was going to be taking a 12% paycut from before I was a manager.

It was a bitter pill to swallow but just thought I had to brunt it and would eventually be made right and did it because I was content in my role.

Since then I have had two different heads of departments approach me telling me they have a job opening and would I be interested both of which I have thanked them for but said no, mainly because the jobs themselves didn't really interest me even though the money was better. 

Now here we are, approaching the 2 year mark where I would be earning pretty much the same if I was a regular employee, not managing any projects even at a lower level and the straw that broke the camels back and incited writing this post, have just found out they are considering upping the salary of one of the grads who I mentored while doing the senior management role and who I had to baby through every task. 

So I'm stuck in the dilemma of liking my job but being annoyed at the principle of being paid significantly less than people who are doing less. And at this stage have no idea what to do.

1bq8zrq,Leaving procurement ,"Hi all. I’m hoping someone lurking on this subreddit has some input. I’ve been in procurement since college graduation in 2018. I loved it at first because the commodity I was procuring had a lot of changes daily, and I could really build relationships with the people I worked with. I had to leave because I was working 24/7. Then I made the move into software procurement. To say I’m miserable is an understatement. Every single day I cry before working and at least once during due to the intense stress. I negotiated a 96% discount and was told that’s not good enough. I can’t take it anymore 

I enjoy strategy and relationship building, but can’t stand to negotiate as my main job function. Anyone out there made the leap from procurement to something else and found themselves in a better situation? I have no other skills and have no idea what else I’d be interested in. 

I hope this is the right place to put this, if not please let me know and I’ll take down. ",Purple-Question-5526,1,1.0,0,1711665670,2024-03-28 22:41:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bq8zrq/leaving_procurement/,3,2024

Disney: 4 Days in Office (Friday Remote), Lasts through at least December, pays $21.70/Hour, NYC-Based  
Paramount: Option to be remote or in NY or LA, Summer-only internship (based off research, has the potential to extend through fall, but no guarantees). Pays $20.00/Hour. Already made offer and accepted.

1bq85lg,Got hired as an intern and they were not prepared.,"Hi all, I have an odd situation. I (21m) was hired as an intern for a small local company. This was through a program via my university which made the process seem very professional. It wasn't until it was tie for the interview process that I found out that the companies were not large corporations like I had expected; instead, all the companies that were a part of the program are small local companies.

I decided to still move forward with it as I wanted some experience in my field of study (marketing), even if it wasn't much. I ended up getting hired by one of the companies and started back in January. 

The longer I have worked with them, the more obvious it has become that they were obviously not prepared to have me working for them and it almost seems as though they have forgotten what the internship is for. I got matched with this company because they wanted a marketing intern and based on the outline they gave to the university and to me, it seemed like a majority of the tasks were marketing related with a few small exceptions which I thought would be fine.

Some examples of why I feel they are underprepared to have me as an intern: 

1. they thought my internship lasted from January until end of August even though the university makes it very clear to the companies that the absolute latest time they have us is until mid July.
2. there was zero training period. it was clear that my university expected us to have around 2-3 weeks training when entering the company, but there was no training. I was just given tasks by one of the co-founders and basically expected to know how to 'do marketing.'
3. there is no office for the company and at first didn't understand how I would work from home and how they could monitor my hours. The university seemed to think there would be a company office (or at least they had that impression).
4. I only have communication with one person in the company who seems very disorganized and never has clear things for me to work on. for context, the company is run by two co-founders and they have some part time employees doing very basic tasks. the person I communicate with is one of the co-founders.
5. the original document outlining my duties was about 75% marketing related 25% not. 2 months into the internship they seem to have forgotten this and now are frustrated because they are expecting/asking me to do 25% marketing and 75% non marketing related activities.

The main point is, I am not really learning anything to do with marketing which was the whole point in doing the internship in the first place. There is no marketing team at the company or even a main marketing person, so I am not learning anything specific from anybody. I have done one or two tasks that I wouldn't have done unless I worked for a company, but that is it. Most of the time I am doing very basic tasks and posting on their social media accounts. 

It sucks because I thought I would be learning from someone about marketing in the real world, but instead it feels like I am just an after thought at the company and they just wanted to get a cheap employee through a school program. I really feel like quitting, but I don't want to leave a bad impression on them or the school. I also understand that it looks better if I complete it the whole way through as it shows commitment. 

Has anyone gone through the same thing before? Please give me some advice or reassurance. Maybe I'm just overthinking it all.",Great_Champion1866,1,1.0,0,1711663521,2024-03-28 22:05:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bq85lg/got_hired_as_an_intern_and_they_were_not_prepared/,3,2024

1bq68q4,Seeking Advice: Should I go back to school for a CS degree if I want to pursue a future in Data Science?,"Went for an undergrad degree in electrical engineering but long story short, I hated it so I dropped out. Later I went back to college and just settled for a diploma in eng tech because it was cheaper and faster. Deep down I knew it wasn't because I'm not smart enough but rather I had no interested in being an electrical engineer. Plus pressure from my parents paid a huge part in it too.  
  
Anyways after school I worked a year in my field of study, hated it, so I taught myself data/more coding to make a career pivot. For the past 5 years I've been working in data and enjoy what I do much better. Currently I am a Sr Data Analyst with a fortunate 500 company. I aspire to progress further in my career by transitioning into Data Science. However, my research suggests that the entry barrier typically requires at least a bachelor's degree, if not a master's. I can't shake the feeling of inadequacy, fearing that my current experience won't be taken seriously without a formal degree.  
  
My dilemma lies in deciding whether to return to school part-time to pursue a degree in computer science (with the possibility of pursuing a master's later) while continuing to work, or if I should prioritize gaining more work experience.

I worked from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm everyday (sometimes later) i was making pretty good money for a 19 year old but i didn’t have time to go to the gym anymore or produce music anymore and those are the things i like doing and like incorporating into my everyday life, the job was taking a toll on me as I wasn’t getting proper sleep and i had a terrible work/life balance. I had an epiphany a few days before i quit, I just felt like i was wasting my time there and i feel as if im called to do something else with my life so i talked to my manager they where supportive of me leaving and I quit. I have $4,500 in my savings account and at the end of this week I still have to receive a full check, I’m getting paid out my vacation hours that I never used, and I still get to receive a bonus which they told me is almost $2000 dollars. Now I feel lost right now because I don’t feel like I’m doing anything with my life and it’s just been boring, however I’m using this time to improve my habits as I’m reading books, hitting the gym a lot, and I’m starting to eat healthier. 
Now I have a few goals. I’m currently taking a 75 hour pre licensing course to get my real estate license, I’m going to see how that goes, and I also plan on working to become a firefighter when I’m 21, so I can do firefighting and do real estate on my days off since firefighters only work about 10 days a month. Now that I’ve explained my situation, should I be looking for another job right now while I’m in the process of getting my real estate license? Because I know that’s a risky career to jump into as money might not come too quickly at first but I heard it’s completely worth it as a career if your willing to put the work and effort in and I absolutely am. I still live with my parents btw. So what should I do? Should I wait until I get my license and jump into the real estate game, or should I get a job right now and get some income coming in the meantime and work real estate part time while I get my license?",Alexvendetta1,1,1.0,4,1711657376,2024-03-28 20:22:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bq5mxy/19m_need_advice_can_anyone_help/,3,2024

1bq5h7b,SOS,"Hi all! In desperate need of advice and/or any thoughts on my current employment situation:

I was laid off in December, and due to my state’s unemployment benefits, I only have 6 weeks left to claim before it runs out. I do have some savings I can depend on to buy me a few weeks if necessary, providing some flexibility. 

It’s been difficult to find the right role as I work in Marketing and it’s been a very competitive market right now. I’m in a better place right now and likely to receive a formal offer for a role on Friday or early next week. However— this role is for a smaller team, doesn’t pay as competitively as it should, has little room for growth, be odd hours occasionally, fully onsite and would require an hour plus commute— BUT it’s likely to be a sure offer and an income. 

bUT I’m also in the early stages of interviews in 3 other companies, all of which are either hybrid and remote and may pay upwards of $10-60k more than the role I’m likely receiving an offer for this week. These other companies are far more desirable and exactly where I’d want to be if all goes well, but obviously it’s hard to feel out if I’d receive an offer at any of these and it’ll take weeks to come closer to that answer. 

With all these other considerations in mind, how long can I hold out an extended offer for? Do I take the offer or gamble and hope for one or the others? If I took the offer and started at the job, would it be awful if I was only there for a week then took a potential offer at one of the better companies?

I was a bit nervous and excited because I really want the role, it is perfect for me and my qualifications align perfectly with it. From what I remember, the Director said that they are currently hiring for another post and that their recruitment process usually focuses on one role at a time. She invited me to attend some of the events at the company this month and to keep in touch. She said they will open the post after the current recruitment process is finalised.

1bq2apg,Am I being ripped off?,"Okay so for context I am 24 years old and work in California as a contractor for a tech company as an IT technician 

Currently I am paid $40 an hour with 12 unpaid holidays during the year 

$83,200 annually - $3,840 for the 12 unpaid holiday = $79,360 pre tax

The contracting company is making a change with regards to pto and wants us all to sign a contract to agree to lower our hourly pay to $38.15 an hour + 12 pto days which they said will come out to the same per year

$38.15 an hour x 40 hours a week x 52 weeks comes out to $79,352 pre tax which is an 8 dollar pay cut per year

Add on to the fact that costs are rising and this seems to be even more of a pay cut. Am I going crazy or are they trying to screw all of us contractors with this change? 

I was thinking of countering their offer by proposing I keep my same $40 an hour hourly but with 4 pto days which would effectively net me my actual $83,200 a year. 

Has anyone ever been in this position before? How did it work out? Should I even bother trying to counter and just take the pay cut and look for new roles? I’m conflicted because I am not interested in taking a pay cut at all but I do like the stability and people at my job and it would be difficult to find another position that pays this same rate.

I am a 21 year old male with no debt as of now other than owing about $9,000 on my truck which I could pay off by the end of the year. I live in North Dakota with my girlfriend and work in the oil industry. We moved out here a few months after graduating highschool. 

Although I make pretty good money, I am not passionate about my current career path. I do not want to suffer the cold winters outside doing manual work for the next 45 years until retirement.

My dream job is to be an endocrinologist (horomone therapy doctor). This requires a bachelors of science degree and then medical school afterwards and from my understanding a couple years of on the job training as well.

I am fascinated by how horomones regulate and affect our bodies and I often research quite a bit about them in spare time just to learn more because I find it interesting. I love learning about the human body in general and it is truly about the most interesting occupation i can think of.

Anyways, I was never a great student in highschool. I did not like homework and spent my time after school working instead of homework and extracurricular activities. My thought in highschool is that I’m spending hours of time each day to find the answers to problems and all I get is a letter on a report card that means virtually nothing to me as long as I’m passing so I can earn my diploma. I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.

My main questions to you guys are:

1. Is it worth starting college this late? I understand I am only 21 so part of me says I am only a few years out of highschool, I have plenty of time. Another part of me thinks I have waited to long and should just keep with my career now and forget about it. 

2. How do I manage debt? I do not have tens of thousands saved in the bank and my parents are not wealthy. How could I ever afford to take on debt like this while also paying rent, car payment, insurances and other bills without working full time? 

3. Would it be possible whatsoever to work full time and also have time for school work? This is the only way I imagine I would be able to keep paying my bills as 15-20 hours a week would not be very comfortable to live on. I work 8 days on 6 days off roughly 12 hour days and then the gym 6 days a week on top of that. I have lots of spare time on my 6 days off but my 8 days on I am struggling to find time to do anything else already.

This is honestly my biggest dream in life and I have wanted to do this since highschool but I have always been to nervous to do something this crazy. 

I am looking forward to reading your responses and I thank you for reading and giving your input. I really appreciate it.

1bq19yt,What Would You Do in My Shoes? Balancing Passion and Opportunity at 24 Years Old,"Hey folks,  
  
I find myself at a critical juncture and could really use some outside perspective. I'm a 24-year-old software engineer with about 1.5 years of experience in a product-based company. Currently, I'm part of the professional services team, handling out-of-the-box customizations for specific customers using low-code tools and integrations like HubSpot, NetSuite, Zoho, and Microsoft.  
  
Lately, I've been grappling with a sense of restlessness in my current role. Despite the company's promising growth trajectory and opportunities for advancement, I'm beginning to realize that my true passion lies elsewhere. I've always nursed aspirations of building my own product and becoming a founder, recognizing that a lifelong career in coding isn't necessarily my endgame.  
  
Recently, a significant opportunity has presented itself in the form of a job offer through a referral. The catch? The salary offered is twice what I currently earn, and the position offers remote work, which would drastically reduce my grueling daily commute of around 5 hours. However, the role primarily revolves around using HTML, JS, and Deluge to craft widgets and similar automations in the Zoho ecosystem.  
  
Here's why I'm inclined to consider accepting this offer:  
  
Time and Financial Stability for My Passion Project: This opportunity would provide me with the time and financial stability necessary to focus on building my own product—a dream I've been nurturing for some time now.  
  
Continued Learning and Growth: Despite the focus on Zoho-related technologies, I believe there's still ample opportunity for growth, particularly in areas like system design and data structures and algorithms (DSA). Even if our passion project doesn't pan out as planned, I'll still be gaining valuable skills that will serve me well in the future.  
  
That said, there are certainly some reservations on my mind:  
  
Potential Career Impact: I worry that dedicating significant time to Zoho-related work might pigeonhole me and affect my opportunities in future roles, particularly if our passion project doesn't materialize as expected.  
At 24, I'm torn between the allure of financial stability and the pursuit of my entrepreneurial dreams. Additionally, I'm not sure how to navigate this decision considering my two friends who share my aspirations but will remain in our current organization.  
  
Any advice or insights would be immensely appreciated!  
  
TL;DR: As a 24-year-old software engineer, I'm torn between accepting a highly lucrative job offer with remote work to focus on building my own product and staying in my current company with potential growth opportunities.

Currently, I'm part of the professional services team, where I mainly handle out-of-the-box customizations for specific customers using low-code tools and integrations like HubSpot, NetSuite, Zoho, and Microsoft.  
  
Lately, I've been feeling a bit stagnant in my current role. Despite the company's rapid growth and potential for advancement, I can't shake the feeling that my true passion lies elsewhere. I've always harbored dreams of building my own product and becoming a founder, recognizing that I can't see myself coding indefinitely.  
  
Recently, I received a compelling job offer through a referral. The catch? The salary offered is twice what I currently earn, and the position entails remote work, alleviating the burden of my extensive daily commute (which currently consumes around 5 hours of my day).

On one hand, accepting this offer would provide me with the financial stability and time I need to focus on building my passion project—a goal I've long aspired to achieve. On the other hand, I'm apprehensive about potentially stagnating in a role that may not align with the latest technologies and could hinder my long-term career growth.  
  
I've consulted with a senior colleague, who believes that staying with our current company might present better opportunities in terms of position and projects, given its rapid expansion. However, my heart remains set on pursuing my entrepreneurial dreams.  
  
So, Reddit, I turn to you for guidance. Should I seize the lucrative job offer to afford myself the time and financial security to pursue my passion project? Or should I wait for potentially better opportunities within my current company, despite feeling somewhat trapped in my current role? Additionally, how should I navigate this decision considering my two friends who share my aspirations but will remain in our current organization?  
  
TL;DR: As a software engineer, I'm torn between accepting a highly lucrative job offer with remote work to focus on building my own product and staying in my current company with potential growth opportunities, despite feeling stuck in my current role.

1bq0xqu,Is it too late to turn back?,"27M, I spent 23+ years of my life “mastering” the Violin. I went to pre-college, music school, got a masters, even a couple of orchestra jobs under my belt. I LOVE what I did, it’s honestly hard to be real with myself about my decision so I’ll give context. 

While I was studying abroad during the pandemic (2021), I made a life for myself but like for others it was a crazy time. I ran out of money my parent (who I don’t like) offered to help me save and move back home. It was the last thing I would do but I panicked and needed to stack money. 

So I did, hated every moment of it, I still do. I had a couple of contract jobs but they didn’t last. I’ve been struggling to find steady job, granted those jobs were out my field. My parent got sick so I had to help which I didn’t have enough energy to enjoy my craft. Just to recharge. Fast forward to now I took a job I hate but it’ll help me move out(2nd time around)

Basically, a combination of lack of job security, being a caretaker, a couple love ones dying. I haven’t even taken the time to do what I enjoy. Being home, it doesn’t allow me to express myself at  all. My music making has suffered.

Did I make a mistake of taking this job after not having one for so long? Is it never too late to get back on the horse? How do I convince myself that what I’m doing is right? I feel like I’m doing what needs to be done but sacrificing my love for music. This was lengthy, I appreciate y’all ready this. Any advice would be awesome!

Both pays are extremely similar on the base

Job 1. Is a CSM (customer success) role in my field at a great company with an awesome product. 

Pros: little travel involved, I already know the market, product and the team sounds amazing, my direct manager is a dream

Cons: PTO is limited to 15 days, health insurance costs $165/mo, no equity.


Job 2. Account management (sales) at one of the biggest construction technology companies in the world. Everything I read about them online sounds like an incredible place to work 

Pros: unlimited PTO, commission so higher OTE, equity since it’s a public company, benefits package overall is better 

Cons: sounds like a lot of travel will be expected, I’m kinda tired of the rat race, it’s a new product and a new market

1bpzpa1,"Where to Look for Gov/Nonprofit Policy Jobs? Modest Income, No Car....","I'm a law school grad who decided to switch to policy work after graduation. I've been doing Medicaid policy with the state for about six months now at a fully remote, PSLF-qualified job. Ideal for someone like me, who is partially blind and cannot drive, and I actually really enjoy my job beyond the subpar pay. 

Yesterday my boss met with me and told me that while I was doing a great job, there had been an error in my hiring. Basically they thought that my term-limited position would continue until December 31st, 2026, and this was what I'd been told when I was offered the position; turns out the funding for my role only lasts until December 31st of this year. She already requested that my position be extended, and was denied. 

She apologized profusely, offered to help me find another position, and told me that as long as I put in 2 weeks notice I'm free to leave my position whenever with no hard feelings, since this was their error and our budget proposal will be submitted by April anyway. I qualify for internal hiring with my department if I want to stay on. 

Honestly, though, I'm wondering if this is a sign for me to move. I live in Denver, which is a great place to live if you have a car, not so great without one. The public transit is spotty and almost everything I'd want to do here is inaccessible by transit. I'd love a walkable, ideally somewhat affordable, city. My lease ends in July. 

I'm just wondering where I should be looking for jobs. My current list is:

* Boston
* Seattle/Tacoma 
* Philadelphia
* D.C. 

Does anyone have recs for walkable cities where I could feasibly get a job in nonprofit or state/local government? I know it's a hard ask in the U.S., but as much as I'd love to live in Europe, that's probably not a realistic ambition lol. Any advice is appreciated.

1bpz2qe,Do I switch when I have a good paying job but the work is dull,"I , 29f, a chartered accountant from India, recently moved to Canada. I managed to land a 55$/hr contract job within a month, for 6 mnts through a recruitment agency. My manager is really sweet and we get along well but he is so swamped with work and personal issues that he barely has time to manage me. I probably get to connect with him once in a week on an average. I have 4 years of experience(+3years internship) in a different role (was a consultant, now a business system financial analyst). And because I am relatively new to the company, I do need a bit of direction from time to time since I am unaware of the dynamics of people within the organization. Also, the company itself is in shambles since they are probably 2 years old themselves. Big company but through acquisitions. Absolute chaos. So, I get lost all the more because nobody seems to know what is going on. I end up having to contact 5 to 8 people before realizing that there is no answer to my question or get an ambiguous answer.
I will be nearing the end of my contract in a couple of months. I honestly have been doing very little work (despite having constantly brought it up with my manager). I am getting more and more concerned about not having much to learn in this role as it is more of an information gathering & assembling role. At the same time, I keep hearing about the ""failing economy"" and have not come across a lot of other opportunities either. But tbf, I wasn't looking as hard once I landed this job. 
Another aspect is that I am planning on appearing for the CPA exams. So maybe sticking on to a sucky job till I clear makes sense. But I am not even sure whether I will get an extension on the contract. I am told that I won't know till the last 2 weeks.
I live with my husband who is studying (which is why we moved to Canada) so I am the sole earning member for now. My mind is currently as chaotic as the company!

1bpx96y,I need real adult career advice and I have no one to go to,"Hi, I am a few months into my first ""real"" full-time job postgrad. I graduated with a degree in communications and I genuinely love this field; ever since I first switched to it in undergrad, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in it and I would prefer to stay in this field. I got lucky and landed a job in communications a 2 months after I graduated (I say lucky because I know a lot of fellow communication grads who struggle to find work in communications due to how oversaturated it is and how also how much the job market sucks right now). 

Fast forward a few months, I'm antsy, I do not like my job and I want to find a different job. This is where I really need advice and I have no real adult figures in my life that I feel comfortable going to/turning to.

Here's some background:

My salary is 45k which IS on the lower end but is currently manageable because I live in a city with lower costs of living, I only have to provide for myself and I live within my means. Now, would I like to make more? Fuck yes. But is that the main reason why I want to leave? No because a job is a job and it is stable. 

I want to leave because

1.) I am basically a glorified receptionist/assistant (nothing wrong with that profession - I'll touch on that in my 2nd point). I barely do anything directly related to communications and when I do it's incredibly easy work that I knock out in less than 20 minutes. My issue with this is that I want to be challenged; I want to work on projects and use the skills that I went to school for and learned. As more time passes (I know I'm being dramatic it's only been a few months) I feel like I'm actively losing these skills and I'm scared of that - I have looked into courses pertaining to things I want to do so that I can keep that part of my brain active, HOWEVER this is also the first time in my life where I'm not juggling multiple things at once and would like to actually have a job that I AM learning at and actively taking away new skills at instead of having to find outside sources. 

2.) I am basically a glorified receptionist/assistant to the executive director, so why not find a job as an actual executive assistant somewhere else and get paid 50-70k (the average I've seen for executive assistant positions in my area).

3.) I never planned on staying at this job for long, I knew from the beginning that it was going to be a stepping stone for me and a way for me to gain real world experience as a fresh postgrad. I say this because where I currently work there's little to no growth opportunities, there's no ""ladder"" for me to climb, the raises/bonuses suck (idek what's going on with that whole situation), and the only redeeming quality is the fact that I have benefits (health insurance, 401k, PTO). But I originally told myself I'd stay for a year before I start looking/applying elsewhere - spoiler alert, it's been less than half a year and I'm already itching to leave.

4.) I'm not in a ""rush"", but it's like if I can leave and go make *more* now, why stay for a few more miserable months?

I don't want to leave because

1.) Since the get go I've always heard (as is commonly known) that it looks bad if you've only been at a job for less than a year/jump around a lot. The jumping around doesn't really pertain to me at this moment because this is my first real job and I'd also prefer to stay at one place long-term (for stability's sake). 

2.) I would feel guilty as hell for leaving this job that I just got and that is incredibly understaffed. I know I'm young and they don't expect me to stay forever, but for context it's literally been less than half of a year. 

Yeah that's pretty much it for why I don't want to leave, but they're also pretty big, important factors and I don't know what to do. Please help, I have been sitting on this and going back and forth in my brain for a hot minute now and as much as I love my friends and value their advice, I would much rather prefer this specific advice from someone who's more experienced, older and has had to deal with this before.

1bpx07x,Still struggling to forgive myself for leaving a toxic but prestigious job,"Timeline:

\-2018 - 2022: Went to + graduated art one of the top art schools in the US with a BFA in Illustration (this wasn't on a whim, been doing art my whole life, took AP art twice in high school and won awards for both portfolios, walked away with no debt) - decided to focus in on product / graphic design for companies in the kid's sphere / market

\-2022 - Aug 2023: Right out of college I remotely interned, then freelanced for this one company, doing artwork and menus for various restaurant chains 

\-Aug 2023: Got hired for a full-time position for a ""prestigious"" / well-known company, relocated, only lasted 4 months until Dec 2023 when I quit

\-Dec 2023 - Now: Job hunting the past 3 months, I average about 1 interview in every 10 applications, working part time at the movies that I honestly really enjoy, but struggling to forgive myself for leaving my past job

\----

Just wanted to give a bit of background before I type this all out lol. In 2023 I truly thought I was doomed to be a freelancer forever and I'd never get a full-time position, so you can imagine how excited I was when I was finally offered one. I thought my prayers had been answered and that this was the start of my new life. The reasons the job was toxic:

\-The red flags started in the interview. They let me know that this wasn't a 9-5 or a 40-hour-a-week position, but did not give a specific number. Me being just out of college assumed it would be the rare 45 or 47 hours a week, but when I was actually working there it was closer to 55 - 60. 

\-In the same interviews, they would share very personal information about current and past employees, including details about their mental health and living situations (they basically said ""if you have depression or anxiety you won't do well here,"" both of which I have, but I was so desperate that I didn't listen)

\-My manager highly disliked me. After 2 months of working there I had to lead this big fast-paced meeting, and being so new I obviously didn't do very well and since that she held some vendetta against me. She would blame me as being the problem that my coworkers had to stay late

\-I never knew when I was going to leave. The best part about a job is knowing that no matter how mad or stressful things get that day, when that clock hits 5 or 6 you are free to go. That wasn't the case with this job - I would get assignments dumped on me at 5:30 and wouldn't be able to leave until I finished them. Including continuing working when I got home.

\-I was told not to write anything down, but I had trouble remembering everything through word of mouth only. My manager would ramble off 8 things I had to do, but would get angry if I took the time to pull out a notepad or something 

\-High turnover, we had multiple people leave my same position in the past 2 years, no one even staying for longer than a year. They would quit on the spot, one quit due to mental health leave

\-I had a coworker who I really loved and helped me with everything. She seemed so on top of her game, that I decided one day to open up to her about the struggles I was having. She promptly showed me her self-harm scars from the stress the job brought her.

\-Witnessing people cry after a meeting with their manager or coworkers, me included

\-My manger did not have time for us. She mangled about 4 people, along with her other jobs, and did not have t time to train us. I remember specifically one time where she chatted for an hour with each of my coworkers on my team (on Teams you can see when and how long someone has been in a meeting for), and when it got to my turn, she shouted that she only had 5 minutes and that I had to ask her things quick.

\-Eveyrhting had to be approved by my manager. Emails, design changes, e.t.c. By the time she was able to look over my work, it would be like 4 pm and she'd rattle off all these changes I had to make before I could leave.

\-I was dropping weight at an insane rate. We didn't really have a lunch break and I was coming in early, and staying late, so 12 hour days with no food were the norm. By the time I got home I was too exhausted to eat so I just didn't.

\-In the mornings I would vomit before work, cry on the way, and would constantly cry during

\---

So, that's it. Despite how horrible this job sounds, and it was, I'm still kicking myself for leaving such a prestigious company. I keep saying, was it worth a year or two of absolute misery to get the chance to kickstart my career? Did I do the right thing? I feel better, happier, but I know my ""social status"" has dropped and I just feel embarrassed thinking about all my classmates / people I know searching my LinkedIn and seeing I only lasted 4 months at the chance of a lifetime.

1bpwwhq,I'm being promoted with a pay-cut,"This has been a long and winding road to get here. I was laid off from a job after Thanksgiving in 22. Prior to that job I held a position as a coach and program director making $26k for a contract position that ran for about 8 months. I was offered a position at a private school doing the same job for the same amount but 5 months. After the season ended, I was not offered any contracts but was told they wanted to find me a full-time position. I interviewed for an assistant to the director position but was ultimately offered a full-time sub position at 55 plus my same coaching stipend at 26. During the year I received an additional stipend of 4500 to take on additional responsibilities.  
THEN the budget issues started to flare. I expanded my program by 2 teams but was not given any additional money to hire additional coaches. I fought with the finance dept on how the coaches were to be paid their gas coverage amount. When I asked for the money to cover hiring a needed coach, they said it would come from my pay. Now I'm being offered the assistant to the director position for next year, but at $5k less than I'm making now, but also adding 2 months of work.

My wife is due with our second child in July. I'm not in a position to not have a job. This is a very wealthy private school. I've pushed and pushed for them to at least meet me at what is equitable to my current rate of pay, but their response is to come back with less money.

What do I do? How do I turn down a job I want and have relationships built around for less money? How do I accept less money from an institution that definitely has the resources and apparently values me?

I currently work a very flexible job of Monday to Wednesday 6AM to 4PM. I only make 49K but considering I have 16 days off a month, I think that’s fair. I also only have to work rotation holidays with my peers (so approximately 3 a year.)

This new position would put me at Tuesday to Saturday working 12PM to 8PM and every holiday. They also have not disclosed the salary yet but I am under the impression that lowest paid salary would be 68K a month and the highest would be 94K. So I’m guessing it would just be up to negotiating where my way would start after the first interview.

After doing a math, it seems that for my days off I’m losing, the pay may not be worth it short term. But in long-term, this increase in pay could get me into my own living situation, and I can afford my 2026 wedding without borrowing from my fiancé’s (rich) parents and having to owe them money. So it’s very much about loss of quality of life for gain of pay. And idk if it’s worth it to me.

So for those of you who make great salaries, is it worth the quality of life that you have? Or would you rather keep the quality of life you have, and just spend your money differently affording what you can afford?",Tryingmy-best1,3,1.0,6,1711635260,2024-03-28 14:14:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bpwmu9/more_salary_less_quality_of_life/,3,2024

1bpuoyg,MSCS or MBA for PM ,"Looking for some advice on next steps for my career. 

I have a BS Biology and currently work in the infectious disease research space as a PM with the government (3 YOE in this role, ~7 years YOE in this research space). Lately I have been feeling like there will be an inevitable glass ceiling on my career progression without advanced (PhD) level science degrees in this field. This has brought me to a few possible thoughts / options for next steps in my career. 

Option 1) Pursue an MBA, from a not top ranked school since ~100k masters is out of the question, and keep in my current field with hopes to progress or switch into biotech/Pharma. I’ve read this may not be worth it if you’re not attending a top program anyways. 

Option 2) Pursue a MSCS / MSDS / MSBiotech degree to pivot my career somewhat. I don’t have any formal experience in the CS side but I could see Data analytics / the CS side of bio as an interest to me. Again, maybe move into the pharma / biotech space with this. Would possibly make me eligible for IT project management roles. In this option I would take prerequisite CS classes at my local college to fill the knowledge gap in preparation for a MSCS / MSDS.

In my contract, it states that my resignation notice is supposed to be 4 weeks, however I was wondering if there was a way of shortening this down to 1 week or so, which is when the new job is meant to start (if I accept the offer). 

In my contract, I do realise there is a probation period where it says that I can cancel the contract with a week's notice and then (possibly) immediately resign from there? Or should I just not rock up to the job anymore or breach the contract in some way like drinking on the work site?

1bpr5dh,Help me analyse new project opportunity,"Hey folks Not sure if this is the correct sub for this but
I am working in a service based company form past 5 yrs
My first project was for a US based retail company based on PLM where we provided platform operations and cloud management. I got exposure to cloud and was working on IaaS management.
It wasn't much, but I cleared az-900 and az-104 certifications.
I also worked on execution of Jenkins pipelines for deployments.
Apart from these I learnt so much here.

Later I came across devops and realised that I have few transferrable skills and upskill. asked my manager to add me in another side project going on where they were using ansible to build playbooks to provision adhoc environments ( I took ansible training outside of my work hours).
Dint get to do much but can say got to know and explore redhat's ansible tower.

I saw no relevant growth, so I took up a training and was trained on SCM tools (these trainings get assigned as per business requirements so no control here)

However, I did not get project in the same track related to the training. I got into a datawarehouse project for ETL and the work here was merely monitoring and resolution. No more than that. Just MySQL and Linux knowledge was put to use here.

This datawarehouse project now has been reassigned to another service provider company and I am on bench currently.

I want to work on devops or atleast I want an opportunity to work in cloud.
I have been parallely looking to switch targeting the roles that I am interested in. I have started to apply but no success yet.

I got a call today for another project which will be based around Azure data factory and Azure data bricks. I do not have more details yet as the project is about to start. Manager said we will be given training on data factory and databricks. They are onboarding me because I have some familiarity with Azure cloud and the concept is not new to me.

I am confused whether I should take this project up or should wait till I get any devops related project. Also not sure whether this project is in line with what I aspire and would form a stepping stone or is just another diversion from my goal.

On the other hand I feel I would gain a working experience on Azure cloud which more worth that gaining certifications.

Also I felt the datawarehouse project I was part of did nothing good to boast my career or resume.

Fyi- few days back I was asked to be a part of project where they required someone good with MySQL and I rejected it as it was not what I was looking for.

FYI- for devops, I am constantly doing training outside of work and know basics of Jenkins, docker, and k8s. Since I have a background of Linux and shell scripting I believe I can upskill to devOps. I had started my preparation for CKA certification and is going to take some time to get it.

17M final year high school student.  
  
I've recently found immense passion in two things. One is Art; be it digital or traditional like as fine arts etc. And the other is programming.  
  
I've always loved computers and learning how apps and games were created. So learning to code is quite fun for me. Currently I am learning Java script from codeacademy.  
  
I recently had a conversation with my school's career counselor and she said that as per my interests, I should aim for a career that is not completely STEM related but instead has a mix of both creativity and technology. And I completely agree with this. I'm not interested in a full CS degree but rather something that involves my creative side as well. My dad also thinks the same.  
  
I was initially very interested in animation but I'm discouraged by the immense low salaries and exploitative work culture in this industry. I feel it's same in other fields like game design, concept art as well.  
  
So currently I'm aiming for fields such as Web designing and Digital Marketing etc.

1bpqlu4,My naivety has cost me my career,"Been unemployed since my graduation in Economics last year in May. One of the primary reasons for that is my complete inability to give a fuck to pay attention in college. As a result, I skipped my college placements like a total dumbass and graduated with no internships and a subpar GPA.

But turns out that coming from a non-tech background with zero experience is a complete turn-off for employers who would immediately discard my resume having looked at my dogshit resume with a BA in Economics. Who would have thought?

So 10 months since my graduation, having applied to hundreds of ""entry-level"" jobs and even internships with even a decent quality of projects highlighted in my resume, I've faced nothing but rejection. Well, 2 interviews but just look at the proportion.

I’m running into two problems. 

1: I’m generally bad with people. Building work relationships is extremely difficult for me. I won’t say it was an entire crash and burn, but I’ve been a manager and it was extremely hard. Especially in this day and age where being liked is equivalent to being successful in a management role. I can’t even say that my coworkers always love me, even when I’m not in management roles but still leadership. 

2: I’m very uncreative in what career to pursue. I’m honestly at a loss. If I can’t work with people (I’m very good at short-term interactions like customer service), then what position on earth should I pursue?? 

For more context: A lot of people tell me I should work in HR because I’m very detail and rule oriented. But if I’m not good with people, wouldn’t that still be a bad fit? Or do my short conversation skills satisfy the people-part of the job? I think I’m mostly just not great at managing other people’s performance or extended conversations (I’m pretty introverted, so talking all day is exhausting for me).

I'm a 20-year-old soon-to-be graduate in industrial engineering, finishing up my studies at Tongji University Shanghai and my German home university, both pretty reputable. Despite a good GPA, I lack significant work experience.

  
Previous internship in China had limited impact due to language barriers and coworkers attitude.  
Though I gained valuable finance-related experience as Head of Finance organizing a large career fair (mid 6-figure revenue) in a student organization during my studies in Germany. Facing challenges in choosing a master's program, because of lack of experience, and have a brief gap before starting my masters degree in Germany (October 2024). Looking for advice on how to address the lack of work experience.

  
Actual Question: Do you have any advice on how to improve the situation?

I just feel like I should have gathered some more experience by now (ignoring that there was Covid 19 for my first 3 semesters in university).

1bpnwff,Supervisor gets insecure/defensive,"Running into some walls at work and was curious about others’ experience in this situation. I will start by saying, I very much enjoy working with my boss. He’s responsible, doesn’t micromanage, and has been very effective in turning around the mess in our day to day operations left by the previous manager.

But lately, when I propose a deal he is very quick to oppose it, with the main reason being “Senior leadership has refused similar requests previously”. I have been with the company 5 years and have regular meetings with senior leadership so I’m familiar with their goals and methods (fluctuate though they may). When I try to explain why I believe my proposal is different and acceptable, he doesn’t make an effort to understand and makes me feel bad for trying. The explanations can get technical and I’m more specialized in analytics than he is, so it’s difficult to communicate when he’s not open minded. 

However, when I make the same proposal to senior leadership directly they are happy to accept it. This has happened multiple times now and I’m worried he may resent me for it. He doesn’t like to be wrong or admit when he doesn’t understand something and it’s making it harder for me to do my job, since I have to spend more time getting his buy-in than it takes to secure a deal in the first place.

Al momento non posso trasferirmi, ma ammetto che vedere l’offerta economica (sui 40k Dirham al mese) mi ha fatto riflettere tanto.
Io sono donna 31 anni italiana, sono quasi sposata con un ragazzo 31 anni Italo pakistano quindi diciamo che sulla cultura islamica sono abbastanza sul pezzo.
Quello che invece non so è se effettivamente ne valga la pena (trasferirsi lí) per avere una qualità di vita migliore e soprattutto mettere da parte un bel po’ di soldini, cosa che al momento in Italia è difficilissima.",Medea_00,1,1.0,0,1711598605,2024-03-28 04:03:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bpmctj/italiani_a_dubai/,3,2024
1bpm4l7,27[M] looking for candid feedback/advice,"I'm a 27 year old male working as an assistant manager of a retail branch in the financial industry with an associate's degree. I started in banking about 4 and a half years ago as a teller and have worked my way up to assistant manager. 

Recently (at the beginning of this quarter), my branch manager resigned for a better offer at a competitor since he felt he was lured in with promises that underdelivered. I've ran the branch for this quarter and largely in part to the phenomenal team I have in place, we have been one of- if not the- top performing branch within our region across varying metrics. I applied for the two open positions within our region only to be called a high performer that doesn't have enough experience and therefore I was passed up on as a candidate after being talked up to about how I was a ""leader"" and leadership opportunities and what have you. This happened end of 2022 as well where I was presented ""leadership opportunities"" and no obvious additional compensation/consideration. I was in the midst of being recruited by another bank for a Branch Manager role candidly informed my regional that I would be resigning and that is how I got my current role in a retention effort. 

The news of being passed on the existing opportunity was also informed to be during my annual review where I was upset with a ""meets expectations"" review, no merit increase, and a rejection. This has made me feel like I've been in a rut for the past two weeks - month with no little to no motivation to do more for the company. I will always do right by my clients, but it has made me develop bitterness for the company corporate politics. It's made me rethink a career in retail banking but I realize I could be letting my emotions heavily weigh on my decisions. I just don't like and don't want to be on a management track that might lie and twist the truth to people who put their trust in other people- human beings- not corporations. And I'm not the biggest fan of pushing paper, pulling reports, and baby sitting. I do miss working as a banker whose primary focus was the customer in front of me and what I can do to assist. However, I don't want to take a step down in career path/pay. Ironically, I've debated either taking my experience in sales and looking into getting licensed for Investment Banking to be a Financial Advisor or sucking it up, sticking it out, and getting my bachelor's degree and possibly pivoting into some shape or form of STEM field (computer/data science). But I don't have the confidence in myself to commit for one excuse or another (fear of failing math-heavy courses -ironic, huh?) 

I do take a genuine interest in people being financial well but I earn a base pay of 55K and with bonuses will probably have a take home of 65K-70K for the year and expect myself to push myself to learn and earn more. I've given myself a goal of making and committing to a decision by the end of this year with the goal of providing myself a lucrative career.

1bplo7e,"“Whats your desired Salary….” Dreaded interview question, plz advise. ","Hi! Quick question for interviews. When asked what your desired salary is, hourly or otherwise, what is the best way to answer? 

I know that sounds silly, but Ive never been good with the conversation surrounding my pay. For context, I am actively applying and interviewing (if Im so lucky to get noticed) for jobs that pay $50k/yrly or more. Im currently stuck at $20/hr or roughly $35k/yrly. 

My last interview (Commission sales), went well until I was asked desired salary range. I fumbled, froze a second, and highlighted on my current wage, and that I am striving for better. 🤦‍♂️ the thing is, ive made decent money in the past (commission sales) but it was under the table, and beyond my percentage take, dollar numbers were never discussed. Outside of that role its been crap hourly jobs. 

So hows a guy who makes 30-50% less than the jobs he interviews for, not come across as insecure over money. (Im insecure because I feel like its painfully obvious im poor AF)

My supervisor had hired someone else to start April 1st and reduced me to 12 days work in April, while new guy would get 14 days. when I was hired it was for Full time of 37 hrs a week not 75-80 hrs a month. When I asked about it my boss just kinda shrugged off my asking why the reduction said well we now have four housekeepers and we only need two full time which would he her and the senior housekeeper/laundry person who's worked there longer than supervisor I don't begrudge the senior staff but I was blindsided by this and planned to quit after the first of the month with a proper two weeks notice. However after having to clean the entire facility on my own Saturday and Sunday, Sunday night I was up all night having breathing issues taking my inhaler cough syrup cough drops breathing treatments ECT worse than when I had COVID in Jan so I called in Monday morning she said bring in a Dr Note but unfortunately I don't have a vehicle and by the time it was light enough someone could pick me up after I was discharged (my family dosent drive at dark) the medications had finally worked and I was down fir the count by the end of the day my chest was less tight I was no longer wheezing and I was coughing up a lot less phlegm by the end of Tuesday my normal day off I was nearly back to normal breathing and less coughing with minimal phlegm and as id had a few conversations about the chemicals and my breathing with both my nurse aunt and a Dr I made the decision to quit for my own health. But now I feel like I didn't try hard enough or I gave up too soon.

 I feel.like I failed and I'm not going to get another job because all the places I apply to will see that I had a ten month gap after only 11 months of working for my previous employer (this was due to a medical condition that affected my balance and mobility that required Brain surgery) and then See that I was only at this facility three weeks and think nope she's a flake. 

One of my aunts was so sweet too buying me scrubs and comfy shoes as my shoes were killing my feet and I was informed after Hire on that scrubs were required and blew my budget on three pair that didn't fit and couldn't be returned. 

I feel like a failure like I've let everyone down. My rents based on my income and I was looking forward to getting a car this next month wrh my pay as mine died last fall.

- There is a program called “World Class Athlete Program “ where if you meet the standards you enlist, pass bootcamp, do ur MOS training and then ur free to do your sport. Housing, food paid for by the army. I know this from first hand Olympians in the program.

Note: that my main passion/goal is to make it to the Olympics and do my sport for a living. I don’t really care about an MSc but i know its really gonna help me get a great paying job if sport fails for any reason.

I received 2 job offers and I am torn which one to pick.

SECOND OFFER is a entry level customer service role for $65, 000 with 3 days Work From Home flexible hours between 7-7PM. The office is a 30-40 mins travel. They have 2-3 weeks Christmas Shutdown and offers once a month paid day off.

1bpijvm,Need help deciding between engineering and med school,"Hello everyone! I need some serious advice. I'm going to preface this by explaining my current career. I'm 35 in the US.  I am a licensed optician in New Jersey and ALSO the store manager of a chain optical. My salary is $83,000 a year, with the potential for up to $24,000 a year in bonus, which I have made in the past. I have 14 years experience in the field. I only have an associate's degree, plus many other credits, but not a bachelor's. When I got out of high school, I was attending a good 4 year university on scholarship, but dropped out due to mental health issues. Well, I want to go back to school now. I'm debating between medical school and engineering. I would love engineering, but I'm concerned that I'll go into debt to make LESS than I do now. So my first question is- does anyone have a realistic idea of the starting salary of biomedical engineers (in New Jersey or tri-state area/Eastern US)? Similarly- how quickly does the salary increase?

Now onto the next question- med school. I would also love being a doctor. However, I'm just so nervous about the costs. My friend (an optometrist -which is not a medical doctor (MD) but a specialized doctorate degree(OD)) was trying to explain the seriousness of the cost. Do you have to start paying back your loans while you're doing residency? Also- is not being placed into a residency common? My friend is just worried for how I'll get by once I'm done medical school because my partner doesn't *quite* make enough to support us both. I was trying to say that with the residency I'll make some money, but then I decided to look into average monthly med school loan payments- is $2300 accurate?!? 

I have a lot of reasons for wanting to change my career. Salary is definitely a factor (although I know I make good now). I would like to make more money. I don't want to have to feel like I can't afford a house or nice car. I also want to get out of ""retail"". Even though I'm a medical professional with a license, optical is still retail, unfortunately. I hate sales goals and leading a team of minimum wage workers and expecting them to care as much as I do. I hate dealing with nasty customers (although they are also patients). I am hesitant about being a doctor because that's still dealing with the public. Similarly though, I am an extremely social person with strong leadership skills, so I'd hate to be isolated in engineering. 

I'm just so lost as to what to do. I was taking prerequisite classes for engineering, but then I started taking classes for an undergrad in biology to apply to med school. I am grateful that unlike many millennials I know, I don't have a bachelor's degree that I'm not using, and I'd like to keep it that way. If anyone has any insight at all- advice, experience, etc., I'd greatly appreciate it!",plebianinterests,1,1.0,0,1711587434,2024-03-28 00:57:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bpijvm/need_help_deciding_between_engineering_and_med/,3,2024

1bpig2d,Should I stay or should I go?,"My company recently announced that they would be moving out of state by the end of 2024, and I need some outside advice about what’s the best path for me, as there are so many things to consider.

  
I knew this was coming eventually, although I thought I’d have one more year before it happened, so I had two plans in works. First, I applied to a master’s program. My current job is in a field only adjacent to my bachelor’s degree, and I love my current job and I’d like to continue in the field for the rest of my career. Getting a master’s degree isn’t necessary, but I like the knowledge and having the degree would make me a more competitive candidate for future jobs. Secondly, I’d been applying to all “good fit” jobs since November. One of these turned into interviews a week before the announcement, and I’m expecting to hear back from them with an offer soon as they requested and checked my references last week.

  
My current company offered a retention bonus and relocation or severance. I’m 100% not relocating due to family, so I’d be taking the severance, which is 3 weeks of pay, plus my 2024 bonus (\~4k) to be paid out in March 2025. The retention bonus is much more attractive, at $21k. That said, I knew my worth so I immediately countered and told them I wanted $35k or I wouldn’t promise I’d stay until December 31. They haven’t accepted this yet, but the $21k offer is still on the table. The retention bonus agreement is quite clear: if I stay through July 31 or they terminate me for any reason besides “cause” before then, I get 30% of the retention bonus. If I stay through December 31 or they terminate me for any reason besides “cause” before then, I get the other 70%. 

  
I hope to hear back about the new job and the retention bonus later this week, if not next week. I’m not sure what I should do. On one hand, 21k-35k is life-changing for me. I could have a healthy emergency savings plus afford my degree a little more comfortably. I'd be able to buy my girlfriend a nicer ring, I want to propose in the next year or two. On the other hand, the job market is tough for my field and location. I’ve been applying to jobs that sounded like a good fit for five months, and I’ve only submitted 5 applications as they’re rare. There’s no guarantee how quickly I’d be able to find a job in 2025.

  
My current job sucks right now. Management is finally realizing they’d been ignoring my warnings for years, and the current system is a mess and they have to try to fix it in a rush before the move. It’s looking like a stressful 9 months if I stay, my stress eczema is back and I’ve been having stress nightmares about it, and about being unemployed. Working with my therapist on those, but it’d be nice to just reduce my stress.

  
Adding some exact numbers: I currently make 80k plus 4k target bonus, my current emergency fund is around 3 months expenses. My retirement savings are at 20k (17k is vested), as my first job out of college was severely underpaid and I couldn’t save then. I owe about 24k on my current student loans from undergrad, those are under 4% interest. No other debt, and my budget is healthy. I’m able to save about 1k-1.5k a month, though most of it is planned to go towards the master’s degree.

  
I am leaning towards strongly considering the new job if I’m offered 85k or better, and taking it if it offers 90k or better. It feels bad to miss out on the retention bonus, but I’m worried about being unemployed and I could make it back in a few years, right? I don’t know, I need some outside perspective.

1bpi0r0,Regretting my career path choice half way through college,"Hello all, I'm a sophomore in college having huge doubts about my career path. I started as undeclared major and I was that way for all of my freshmen year and then went into media production to study audio engineering. Right now I'm really stressed with looking for internships and thinking about jobs after college and I feel like I chose the wrong thing. I don't know why, but I've suddenly started to have this massive looming regret and thinking that I should have chosen a major in a stem field.

I don't really know what to do. I feel like now it's too late to switch majors and even if I did I worry that I will eventually feel the same regret that I have now. Looking to get some opinions on what I should do. Right now I think the best option is to complete my current degree and minor in something unrelated that interests me.

This stuff just stresses me out so much. I've always been really hard working and put in a lot of effort in classes regardless of whether they were interesting to me or not, but I just don't know what to I want to do in the future. I know that I'm young and have time to figure stuff out but I just feel so lost and behind right now.

1bphuge,Career advice,"Hello Everyone. I am currently 25 (m) from NYC. Right now I feel like I'm lost on what I want to do for my career.

The pay is super low, I don't enjoy going to work, etc. I'm just not sure what to do with my career currently. Sports is my passion and it's something that I love to do but I currently need something that comes with good benefits, good pay, etc and it's hard to find that out here in NYC.

1bphsf3,Should I Pick a New Career for Money or Passion?,"So, like the title says I'm debating between two jobs before I graduate. This will be my second degree. I have a B.A in Communication, but I didn't like where I wound up. I started in corporate services, not bad, didn't love it. I did okay. Then payroll in HR, then recruitment, before I decided I hated it. I went to Finance when I asked to changed, they loved me. I did expenses, but what I was excellent at, and what they loved about me was that I was really good at problem solving the software and working with tech to get it fixed on top of my job. Me and a new Workday program started on the same day, and I kicked its ass. 

I was awesome enough that payroll asked if I could be its supervisor, I agreed. 

True fact moment; I'm awesome at payroll as long as I stay on ADHD meds.  If I don't it gets...well, bad.  I don't really want to be on medication all the time. I would like a job I don't need to be medicated on.

So an opportunity came up, we moved, I left the job, and I've gone back to get a  second degree, a B.S in Arts Technology-- focusing on Interactive Media. 

I was thinking Web Design would be my end goal, but while not a CS major, I could also lean towards Front End development. My degree does also track along Web development, apps, and like now I'm getting a B in Java. I like coding languages.

Web Design doesn't pay nearly as much, but it would be something I love, taking coding and adobe art to make neat things. Hours may be more consistent.

But then there's also front end stuff I could do, just fluff my GitHub a bit with some side projects while highlighting the coding I did in school.  My concern is it would be a job that I'd have to be medicated more than the other. But the pay is double. 

I also would be able to provide more for my family, my daughter is nine. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: I would like either web design or front end, but the one I like more pays almost half as much as the other.

1bph58z,Looking for guidance on job title,"Took a new higher paying role with essentially the same responsibilities as my previous role. When I originally interviewed, the job I applied for was “Infrastructure Engineer”.

On the actual offer letter the title was “Consultant”, when I asked about this I learned that basically everyone at the company in the infrastructure dept is considered a consultant title wise (and the job ofc includes lots of consulting as well). I guess this makes it easier internallly from a pay scale and management POV.

Should I just use the Infrastructure Engineer title on my resume? Or maybe I should go with Infrastructure Engineer/Consultant or Infrastructure Engineer & Consultant.

1bpgdko,Boss has been trying to hire for my replacement?,"As per title… I found out that my boss (the CEO of the company) sent a message (probably there’s more) to someone on LinkedIn to say “hey xxx, we’re looking for a (my job title) for our company. Would you be interested to have a call?”

As it turns out, this person that they reached out to is my childhood friend of 20 years, and they sent me a screenshot of the message.

I was speechless. I just had a good performance review, a good increment and bonus as well (2 months ago). Been pretty happy with my job and was planning to stay for at least a few more years, if not longer.

None of my conversations with my boss have indicated that they find my performance lacking. To the contrary, they have been full of praise for my work and efforts. However, they did share on a number of occasions that they did not find many employees up to par with their expectations. They often talk about wanting people with more experience, although the current senior management is already very experienced imo. We all have around 15-30 years of working experience? (Imo I feel that they have an unrealistic expectation for employees to be magical problem fixers)

I have no idea how to respond to this piece of information, and while I’m tempted to conclude it’s a huge misunderstanding, there is hardly any way to positively spin this piece of information. It would also be a reasonable guess that my friend was not the only person they reached out to. 

It’s a company with around 150 employees and I’m in senior management, if that gives any context. There is no chance that we’d need a duplicate of my role at our size.

I’ve already tidied up my resume and applied to a couple of jobs since I found out. 

But I’m afraid that I’ve misunderstood the situation and am catastrophizing. I don’t think it’d be wise to confront my boss about it because I’m worried that it’ll end up with me being fired immediately instead, or sour my working life for the next few months. I live in a country where there are no unemployment benefits, and the job market isn’t the best right now.

1bpfkgp,Job Offer from Mayo Clinic,"Recently was offered a Senior Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) position at Mayo Clinic at Rochester with $71k salary and $9k relocation bonus. I'm currently at a CRC at a large academic university in the Midwest making $60k. I have my Master's and have my SoCRA CCRP certification.  
  
I'm torn between the opportunity at Mayo Clinic and leaving behind my friends, family, and my girlfriend. I've also grown up here as well. I'm wondering if Mayo's prestige and potential career opportunities outweigh this sacrifice.  
  
Here's where it gets tricky: my current university job offers good benefits, especially with tuition assistance. I have always loved finance and business and wanted to pursue an MBA after my Master's in Clinical Research since business and clinical trials go hand-in-hand. My university makes it very affordable and would cover around $27k of tuition per year, but Mayo would only cover $5k.  
  
This difference would mean that I won't pursue the MBA if I go to Mayo due to cost. Not sure how useful the MBA would be in my career in clinical research but I hoped that it would have opened some paths for the fiscal side of trials/hospital management.  
  
I know this industry can be extremely demanding (explains the high turnover rate) and I am lucky to have a fantastic work team and manager at my current job. My work-life balance is great, with a steady $60k salary and a straight solid 40hr workweek. I would say I am happy with my job (pay could be better!) but I am also extremely ambitious and thoroughly excited about this opportunity. I've talked to my manager previously about moving to the senior role internally as I have the certification and experience required to move up. He says I'm doing a great job but can't give me a timeline for this since it's 'out of his control'. I can't afford to wait as I'm uncertain when another opportunity like this one will arise.  
  
I'm divided between the potential career growth and prestige of Mayo Clinic and the stability, benefits, and MBA opportunity at my current job.  
  
I'd really appreciate any advice or insights on the clinical research and work environment at Mayo Clinic. Would love to hear your thoughts on how to navigate this decision.

The role is fully remote, and I've previously completed one of these internships at a totally different company for 6 months. However, I've been feeling unsteady with this new internship. The interns don't really communicate much, the tasks we need to do as a team haven't been getting done, and when I've tried to get other team members to help, I usually have been met with a wall of silence. The older internship I completed was super organized and manageable, so I have the feeling that this experience isn't just me. I've given the internship three weeks as of now, and it is a 6 month commitment from this point onward. However, little has changed in those three weeks. I am also trying to balance my final months at college with this internship.  


And so that takes us to now - is resigning the best option? The agency is not local to me. And I don't intend to pursue a career on talent management as a first choice. Rather,  I am working on it as a side hustle in the case my main career path - video editing - turns out to be a blunder. I also am worried that fully committing to this position could soil the last few months of college life I could enjoy. But what is your guys' perspective? Resigning is a big choice, so I feel like I need a second opinion before I make any decisive decision.

While I've enjoyed the challenges and opportunities that come with being part of a startup, I'm also curious about exploring other avenues and gaining experience in different environments. However, I'm unsure about how potential employers would perceive my background as a startup co-founder and whether they would be open to hiring me for a full-time position.


If anyone has been in a similar situation or has insights to share, I would greatly appreciate your input.

1bpd86p,I'm [26M] very likely about to be fired and I don't know how to cope,"Instead of going in to the office the morning after a works event I drove home to work remotely and missed the first hour of work. I continued to work after this and finished an hour late to make up the time. 

Before I started my drive I did let my superior know that it was my intention to drive home and he replied saying 'Ok mate let me know when you get back'. There were work related reasons as to why I made this decision that are too long to type here, but it was with the intention of being available to work all day from the early morning instead of having to drive back from the far away from home office later in the work day (and missing hours of work).  
Today I was invited to an official interview by a couple of my superiors and was essentially told that I had breached company values, completely disregarded other members of the team, failed to attend my agreed office days, and acted carelessly in front of junior members of staff. I told the truth in the interview and apologised multiple times, but the findings are going to their boss next week and I'm almost certain I am going to be fired.

1bpc1a4,Looking for advice on dealing with a difficult manager ,"A bit of background, I've been working at my current company for over 4 years, getting good reviews and in the last year getting an excellent review and high performance recognition, so I don't believe that my approach/mindset/performance is an issue here. At the beginning of this year I was transitioned into a newly formed team to be able to pick up and run with a project I'd been supporting the inception of. I had originally come in as a product owner for my section of the project, put forward by my previous senior manager (this project is huge, with 6 or 7 different sections, each with their own product owners). 

One of the first things my new senior manager did was effectively demote me and put my new line manager in charge of delivery of my section because I was ""probably out of my depth"". My new line manager has no experience in this area at all.

Fast forward to today, 3 months in, and my line manager is struggling to keep up with the project demands, missing deadlines, has not been peer reviewing my work, not responding to my requests for time and support and actively withholding strategy because he is ""too busy"". Then, in the same breath, accusing me of ""not being joined up enough"".

I've switched from my more informal approach of asking for time when I need it and pinging items over to get feedback, (as it all seems to get lost) to a more robust method after being accused of not seeking feedback at all and  ""sending items of work outside the team without adequate review"". I've started utilising planner to generate a paper trail and being explicit about when I need feedback for and why, including the impact/consequences of not getting it. 

The response I've had is that my formal method is too much admin and that I keep doing work that I wasn't directed to do (at my level 75-80% of my workload is generated through working with stakeholders and guided by strategy and light touch steer). I'm not inclined to dial back the formality around my feedback requests as it is highlighting that it isn't a lack of request on my part, but a lack of prioritisation on my managers part and it has positively impacted the visibility of my work in other ways. I do suspect that he is now buried in my communications and request paperwork, but considering they didn't seem to be landing before, a paper trail protects me. 

From the start my manager had a habit of changing the story to suit his narrative, but it now seems to be in overdrive. He's constantly misrepresenting conversations, mangling interpretations of written communication, whilst accusing me of not having a generous assumption on what he's putting in written communications (this would require a mind reading skill that I don't have) and won't respond to requests for clarification (an element missed totally in his version of events). 

My new senior manager hasn't been much help. From what he's told me he's happy with my approach, and to just push back when I feel a request is unreasonable, as my line manager has known performance issues around his people management. Though it would appear, from what I can tell, he's lead my line manager to believe that their approach aligns. I am taking this with a pinch of salt, as I've seen just how much my line manager will twist information to suit his own agenda and it feels like a classic undermining tactic (especially while my senior manager is currently on holiday).

Dispite my complaints, I also want to try and represent my line managers perspective with some compassion, because I believe this is key in getting insight to allow me to move forward on this. 

From conversations I have managed to have, I believe that he really struggles with changes to the plan that he has defined. Specifically, once he has an idea in mind, he finds it really difficult to move away, despite good evidence for doing so. This would also explain, somewhat, why he seems so far behind in the project and comes across as really rigid and inflexible, often struggling to find a compromise with stakeholders. He also seems to need a lot of rules and structures around how to interact, and doesn't respond well when others bend or break those rules, but is happy enough to do so himself (and always has a 'good' justification for doing so, whilst not accepting any reasoning, good or bad, from anyone else). An explicit example of this was one meeting where he shared slides that we (senior, line and I) had all agreed prior were good, but we didn't want to share yet. Cue in the meeting and we as explicitly asked about the content of the slides and line manager shares them (to be clear, I do believe it was the right thing to do). Fast forward 4 weeks and same situation and I do the same thing and line manager rakes me over the coals for it. Another example, (and I would argue undermining feedback) is he insists that I stick to the letter of an agenda, but will typically deviate from the stated topics (even if they are his), but I get pulled up for doing the same thing (I have never had negative feedback around this before it's always been exceedingly positive, so the first instance from this manager came as quite a shock). 

I'm at a bit of a loss on how to move forward, and despite gunning for this project, I'm seriously considering moving roles as this current state is not sustainable. I do feel secure enough in my role, but the stress is becoming a problem, so I figured I would turn to reddit to see if there's something I'd missed!

1bpc0wv,I’m tempted to quit!,"I work at a very well known jewelry store and have for almost two years. Without our fail, every time we have new hires my hours get dropped. When I asked, i get the “it’s based on performance”. Which is complete BS. I’ll do everything I can to bring up my performance and regardless of what I do, I don’t get more hours. The schedule will be made weeks in advance, which doesn’t make sense if it’s performance based. I’m tired of having the same conversation and then treating me badly. I’m not going to put my everything into selling when you can’t even schedule me 15 hour, but the new girl has 32 hours. I’ve been passed up for a promotion over 5 times now. I’m trying my best to stay positive because the job market is so bad. But I’m tempted to quit. I can’t pay my bills will a couple hours a week. 

I also think they are discriminating against me because I was out of work for a month due to a back injury. When I got back, some people told me about how a couple of the managers thought I faked it. One of them even asked me why I didn’t go on disability with how much my back hurts. 
I’m honestly at a loss because I feel like no matter how much I try to get them to see it from my side, it doesn’t work. I shouldn’t have the same sales goals if they think she is going so much better. Why should I sale $8k a month on 30 total hours yet, she’s asked to sell $8k on 60-70 hours??

I know i'm not the only one. But it still a lot of stress, because first i have graduated for something that i absolutely don't like. Second my work experience only exists of retailwork (minimum wage). Third what makes it harder for me is that i think i'm still in a burn out (because of my studies). I never got over it and these last few years i feel depressed. I don't even know what i like and what makes me happy. I just go with certain things, because i have too.

1bpbrcm,Need Advice: Choosing Between Current Job and Federal Government Offer,"Hey Reddit,  
  
I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice on making a tough decision regarding my career. Here's my situation:  
  
I graduated about a year ago and after several months of job hunting, I landed a job with a prestigious university as a researcher in my field. I've been enjoying my work and recently moved to a great area close to family and friends. However, I received a conditional job offer from the federal government, which would offer higher job security, a slight base salary increase ($4,000), and valuable top-secret clearance.  
  
Here are the pros and cons of each option:  
  
Current Job (Researcher at University):  
  
Pros:  
\-Happiness and a better living situation.  
\-Hybrid remote work and flexible schedule.  
\-Close proximity to family and friends.  
\-Chance to pursue masters at prestigious university  
  
Cons:  
\-Less room for career and skill improvement.  
\-Lower salary increase potential.  
\-Uncertainty about future career path and opportunities.  
  
Federal Government Job Offer:  
  
Pros:  
\-Higher job security and stability.  
\-Greater potential for higher salary in the long term. (+$30k-$50k)  
\-Valuable top-secret clearance for future job opportunities.  
  
Cons:  
\-80 mile relocation required.  
\-Possible slower career progression within the government system.  
\-Less flexibility and no work-from-home options.  
  
I'm torn between staying at my current job, which I enjoy, or pursuing the federal government offer for its benefits and stability. I'm also concerned about the current challenges in the tech industry and how they might impact my future job prospects.  
  
I have until the end of the week to decide whether to continue with the security clearance process for the federal position. Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!  
  
Thanks in advance for your help.

To me this feels like a huge faux pas. But they both say that  this is what EVERYONE does.

And I was pretty focused when I started it and I infact got my first level cleared in C2. ( The passing percent was just 25 %) across the nation. I  am saying this bcz I worked my ass off hard and accomplished wht I wanted. But as I dived further into course I found out it demanded much more and that I am mentally and physically not capable to do it. 

I never thought this could happen with me and since then I am suffering from inferiority complex , depression and worthlessness. And the main reason behind all this is NOT that I am failing in my C2 but why in the world I dropped down from my C1 course from such a good college. I was doing well there too and could hv easily made good career out of  it  , but now I can't go back.

I just don't know if I was an idiot for doing it , for leaving what I had , bcz at that time it all made sense.

I've won 12 industry awards for my work, which now involves handling 3x the capacity we had during my first year in 2018. My boss praises me and my work all the time, often to the whole team, but I'm still in the middle of our org chart with no direct reports or clear path for advancement. My work lacks the daily campaign involvement and camaraderie that my colleagues enjoy, which I think has created an issue of workplace visibility. Everyone hired since me has been promoted at least once, often twice, and I think their more routine involvement in in-person campaign work with our boss and clients has a role in that.
  

  
Given our company's growth and my contributions, I believe a promotion to VP of Technology is warranted. This would position me for future expansion and potential leadership of a web development team, as we will probably bring on at least one additional web dev in the next few years. Is it appropriate to propose this promotion? Should I discuss it over a video call or request an in-person meeting? It always feels like I'm basically saying ""I want more money"" which is obviously true, but it's also true that I am passionate about both my work and the firm but feel like I am being overlooked and also underpaid compared to the industry standard. It's also worth noting that until we actually do bring on another web developer (which we have no immediate plans to), my promotion would have no actual impact on the structure or daily operations of the company as I would still be a one-man department and still have no direct reports.

I appreciate anyone's input.",ProteinResequencer,1,1.0,0,1711565112,2024-03-27 18:45:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bp9im4/routinely_recognized_for_quality_of_work_but_no/,3,2024
1bp9aiw,Coworker is trying way too hard and making my work life hell-how to do?,"I work with someone who is ex-military and he is making my work life hell. I've been working at this place for about a year, he has been working here for about two years. He has a lot more technical experience over me, but because he doesn't have a bach degree he cannot have the title engineer like I do. I fully acknowledge that he has probably been fucked over a lot in jobs because of that and has had to work really hard. I look up to him as a senior/superior in my role even though it is reversed on paper. I also acknowledge adjusting to civilian life after being in the military is probably really tough, and I have no idea what it is like.

The problem is that he is really up-tight and is overworking himself to death. No one else works as hard as he does. Even the other supervisors have noticed and will hand their work off to him because they know he will do it. He has made himself TOO dependable and will make trouble for himself, going around and asking if anyone needs help when he already has way too much on his plate. But then behind closed doors (we share an office) he will BLOW up and get so pissed off at other people because we work in a really chaotic manufactoring environment and no one knows what they are doing sometimes. 

He really takes work seriously, and that is usually a good thing, but he just will never give himself a break. No flexibility, no days off, come in on weekends, stay late. I feel like a shit employee sometimes, but have to remind myself that I am just normal and he is crazy. I work 9-10 hours every day already, there are times when he does 12+. This is my first real job with my degree and his behaviour is really effecting my perception of work-life balance. He makes it so easy to fall into obsessive working just so I feel less bad for leaving him on his own once 4pm hits.

I have to constantly remind myself that it's okay to work normal hours. 

But another issue is the workload. He is taking on way too many responsibilities, sometimes its stuff that I should probably be working on but I don't even know it because people reach out to him for everything first.  

He will freak out about a project and I will try to help and realize it is low priority and we don't have to be rushing it and losing our shit, but because he has so much to work on, he's just running around like a chicken with his head cut off, not knowing what is actually important. 

All I want is for him to chill out. His freaking out at work is inadvertently hurting every else around him. Our supervisors, the rest of the people on the team, me and himself. My performance is lower than it should be because I don't even know how to handle this.

Anyone else dealt with something like this? 

Is there anything I can do, or am I stuck dealing with this till he gives himself a heart attack?

How can I ask for a match (or more)?,"For full context, I have a Masters degree with 5 years of experience practicing in the field plus 3 years of research experience for the field. Today I found out that my co-worker is making a few more dollars per hour than me despite them only having a bachelors degree and in a field not really related to what we do \*and\* got hired later than me by a few months- both of us are in our first year in this job! I am actually appalled and quite upset especially upon finding out that they offered the co-worker more from the beginning. I am not mad nor do I have nothing against that co-worker at all because we should all be paid our worth! I am just shocked that I have been low-balled like this especially when the pay range on the job description was much lower than my current pay, so all this time I thought I was being compensated well for my Masters. 

The thing is, I love my job and what I do and want to continue. But how can I bring up that I want to be matched to that pay?

1bp8nxn,Should I go to grad school?,"32M. Went to college and graduated with a degree in Finance. My father owned a successful restaurajt growing up, and the plan was for me to take it over after graduation, and that I did. It's still a very successful business under my ownership, and I make about 110k per year. Sometimes a bit more, sometimes a bit less depending on profits

Fast forward 10 years..I'm miserable. The pandemic made me despise the restaurant industry as a whole, and the general public even more. I wake up everyday despising my commute to work and spending 8 hours doing something I don't enjoy anymore.

I want to find another job..but since I've had no corporate experience(my only experience is owning a business), I'm not getting call backs from anywhere that I've sent a resume in for. 

Question I have is..would it be beneficial or make sense for me to go to grad school and try to do an internship or network my way to a job through higher schooling? Or would it be a waste of time/money? How do I find a job with no corporate experience? Any entrepreneurs turned into corporate workers out there that can help?

1bp84jj,Offered big promotion but I am being told it has to be a lateral move with no pay increase,"I interviewed for an internal position in my company which I thought would be a great next step in my career. Really great advancement opportunities and the work I would be doing would make me very marketable in the future. The position was listed as grade 7 and I am grade 5 currently. I did very well in the interview and was offered the position and I accepted. It was not until I accepted that they told me it would have to be a lateral move and I would have to remain a grade 5 with no pay increase due to the companies freeze on internal promotions and pay raises.

Looking back I should have asked beforehand about compensation but I just assumed since this was two grades above me and my company had not mentioned a freeze on internal promotions. My new manager stated that the work I would be doing would be grade 7 work and they could not promote me until the end of year promotion cycle or ""maybe"" the mid year promotion cycle.

I start this position in a couple of weeks. My question is: should I ask my new manager if he can provide me a concrete plan on when I will see more compensation? I feel uneasy with this just being up in the air with no set time when I can expect to get paid more for doing a challenging role.

1bp62lv,IDK What to Do,"I have never been ambitious. There’s no profession I would call my dream job. I was privileged enough to attend high school in an affluent suburb where aspiring to less than an Ivy League education was unusual. The people I went to school with largely became competitive workaholics in response to these high academic standards. I earned mainly B’s and accepted early on that I was not particularly talented (though I was often complimented for my writing) and would never be the best at anything.

I went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in political science from a state school, which took me longer than 4 years due to my not-yet-diagnosed severe, inattentive ADD. Most people in my major went on to law school after graduating, but that option didn’t interest me. Spurred by a passion for social justice, I thought studying political science might land me a job in the nonprofit sector or in government. I served for a year in the AmeriCorps VISTA program and grew disillusioned by the nonprofit industrial complex. 

I felt lost and struggled to find work after. I applied to any entry level government job and social work positions that didn’t require a master’s degree; I was rejected for all roles. My local government requires that applicants have a driver’s license even if the position they are applying to has no driving in its job description (I do not drive). Then when the pandemic hit, I moved in with my parents and essentially gave up.

There’s huge gaps in my resume. My work experience is primarily customer service/call center positions. Outside of my year-long contract with AmeriCorps, I have never stayed at a job longer than nine months. My periods of unemployment have been more significant than my time employed. Despite being in my early thirties, I shamefully still require the financial support of my retired parents to survive. I desire a steady income and basic benefits, but I fail to even secure an interview for minimum wage roles.

I have been enrolled in vocational rehabilitation (VR) services for a year now and their support has only resulted in a single, unsuccessful interview. Most of the interviews I have been invited to recently have been barely-disguised MLMs. Self sabotage and self doubt have driven me here. I hate applying anywhere and needing to show others/defend my lackluster resume. I know earning certifications and licenses is the only way to improve my chances as a job candidate, but I can’t afford most programs or even decide what to pursue.

My debt is accumulating and making my need for income more urgent each day. Recently, targeted ads have been encouraging me to get certified in medical billing and coding. I have a VR meeting tomorrow to discuss VR potentially subsidizing the certification course cost. I’m unsure if medical billing is something I would actually like to do. Plus, certification courses generally take months to complete. I just want to establish stable employment as soon as possible that allows me to earn enough to cover my bills. 

I like the idea of learning a trade, but most trades are very physical in nature. Especially physical trades don’t work for me because I have cerebral palsy and use forearm crutches or a power chair to get around. I don’t know how to find an apprenticeship in more accessible trades. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time, get an associate’s degree and become a paralegal rather than waste my time and money on my unused bachelor’s degree.

Is there an industry that will hire me despite my spotty work history? Can anyone recommend a certification or trade that will guarantee me a career?

TLDR: What certifications and licenses should I get to make my resume more attractive to employers despite sizable gaps in my work history? I do not have a driver’s license and I cannot walk unassisted. I enjoy writing and want a steady income with basic benefits. I’m uncertain if medical billing/coding is my best path forward.",Ok_Weird666,3,1.0,3,1711556796,2024-03-27 16:26:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bp62lv/idk_what_to_do/,3,2024

I'm currently doing successful, massive proposal and technical writing, all marketing including creating materials from scratch, web design, job description writing and posting on various sites, procurement opportunity searching, product searching and communication with vendors, receptionist work, office basic IT, office administration, and travel hotel, car, and flight booking - all of this for 3 companies.

I do like this job, but, they are strict on only in office work.

Is there any sort of certificate or program (online) you could suggest for me to help me pivot into a decently paying remote job?

Ideally strictly computer based, no having to talk to end users/the public. 

And that will help me land a job with a *good* company that offers nice health insurance. Health insurance is a big need.  And I can't be on my feet all day either (health).

I have worked for my company for going on 8 years.

I am the director of that department (Finance). I was told they would need me to stay until July 31st to receive a 6 months severance package. My team was let go immediately, so I am working solo for the next 4 months.  
I started interviewing, and have some promising roles and I am almost to the ""offer"" stage in one, but I am pretty confident the new roles will not be able to pay me as much as my currently salary, let alone offset the severance I may be ""losing"" if I leave before July 31st.  
My specific question I need advice on: What should I do? Should I stick around to get the severance, and take some time off?

1bp3gh7,No idea what studies to choose. What would you do in my shoes?,"  
Im 19 years old, and have around 2 weeks left until I have to make a decision. Im kinda forced to go to university, and although im not profitable, daytrading has been my passion for the last 1.5 years.  
Ive been thinking of studying MI or so, but it never caught my interest. Ive done research, and it looks like economy and administration (i think its called business administration in english, im in norway) is what i should choose. honestly id just go out and work, but at the same time university wouldn't mess up my trading times, and i could live the university/college life as a teenager.  
I also want to get out of this village as its affecting my mental health negatively, so university looks like the right choice; i just dont know what to study.  
Any suggestions?

My HR career started 4 years ago and I got my masters in HR in 2022. Once I get up the ranks my salary will be good but I make ~$70k now and live in MA. My rent will be increasing $300 and this is too much for me. We’re looking for a new place but the cost of living is astronomical in MA for a 2 bedroom even.

1bp2tch,"Team All To Work on One Task, No one talks","I’ve been confused about my work dynamic for a little bit. Recently, everyone on my team (about 6 people) have all been working on one task. But the only thing is, we barely talk in between meetings that happen twice a week. In the meetings, we only say the work we have done, which usually overlaps greatly, and we never assign tasks to anyone in particular, as much as we say the things that need to happen.

My one coworker has a tendency to speedrun everything that needs to get done, and while I could try to compete, I’ve just learned he’s faster at getting the thing done. I ask him how I can help, and he will tell me something, then when I do it and pull it in to contribute to his work, somehow it was what he was working on and I shouldn’t have been doing it. He seems to have big ideas and sit in a corner and only shares when he’s finished the thing. I want to reach out and ask to split up the work but it has not worked in the past. He tries to complete everything.

My other coworkers have other responsibilities and seemingly don’t care about this task. I do not have other tasks, and neither does he. This has been going on since I started here a year ago. I have to fight tooth and nail for a fraction of a job. I don’t want to compete with my coworkers. I just want them to talk to me? 

Any thoughts?

My manager is aware. He said we would be put on two separate tasks, but I was told to stop working on my other task because this one is priority.

Job A : I have an acquaintance who I worked with previously that suggested the role to me. The interview process went very quickly and they’ve provided me with a satisfactory offer already. The benefits are great and the pay is a significant increase from my current role. Due to life events they’ve agreed to extend my start date by a few months. 

Job B : The interview process also went very well however they have not yet provided an offer and said they will likely provide an answer in a few weeks. It’s a manager role and the pay could potentially be better than Job A plus great benefits and big travel perks (It’s at a huge airline)

My question is around timing and weighing the options. Would it be a bad move to accept the offer of Job A given the late start date while waiting for a potential offer from Job B? If Job B comes in with a good offer (which I think they will) that is ultimately the job which I would like to accept.

1bp0xxk,"Coworker and I have the same title and role, but they make a lot more than I do","So I have BS in Mechanical Engineering, and I graduated in 2020. It took me close to a year to land my first engineering job (a consequence of not landing an internship during school I guess) and I've been at this company since 2021.

I was offered 55k for the role when I started, and the salary was not negotiable. The title was for a junior engineering position. I needed a job so bad I just took it. They told me they'd promote me to a regular Project Engineer after a year but that didn't end up happening until 2 years later, with only about a 6% raise. I live in the East Coast and right now I make about 60k and live alone. It's manageable but I barely have anything left to save at the end of the month.

Problem is I know my salary is super low for my position and my area. There's only one other engineer here and after talking to him for a bit I eventually found out he was making 78k, which is well over what I make. We have the same accreditation, the same title and role. And I honestly do a lot more than him. He is mostly just a secretary just answering emails where as 90% of the programming, report drafting, CAD drafting and lab work is done by me. I'm better at using tools than him (he didn't even know how to use a drill the other day, and barely knows how to use any tools for that matter). I'm not saying this to put him down but it's frustrating that all of the work is pushed my way while I'm getting paid more than 20% less than he is when I know I'm better at my job. I at least want the same that he gets for the same role.

We used to have an engineering manager on site but he retired, so now a lot of that work has come my way too. My direct supervisor is in an overseas branch now. I want to negotiate a significant raise but I don't know how to go about it. They always use the excuse that we're not doing well and can't give out raises (we're not getting a bonus this year either) but this company has been saying that since 2019. It's frustrating that kids in college are getting internships making more than I do while I'm a full time employee barely getting by.

I want to approach them about this respectfully without sounding accusatory but I'm afraid of repercussions and this company has been know to fire people haphazardly.",DudeDurk,46,1.0,84,1711543424,2024-03-27 12:43:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bp0xxk/coworker_and_i_have_the_same_title_and_role_but/,3,2024
1bp0ktm,I'm confused whether to do MBA or MA psychology ,"I (19)am a final year student. My majors is in economics and minors in psychology and environmental science. Recently I have come to know that economics is not something I want to continue further. So Last year, I decided to do an MBA bcz I didn't know what exactly I want to do in my life. In India, there are a few exams one has to clarify for MBA, so I started preparing for it. I started studying since my maths is very weak. 

But around 2 weeks ago, one of my professors advised me to do pursue masters in my field then do an MBA. So I thought about going further with psychology and work for a few years and then do an MBA. I studied 2-3 chapters of it and found it somewhat interesting. I have filled forms for entrance exams of the top 2 universities which offer masters in psychology.  

I thought that if I won't clear entrance exams, I will do the data analytics course and will do a part-time job. 

Today, my other professor said to me that if after a few years, I will do MBA then I should do it now rather than changing my field or waste a few years. 

One of my friends keep telling me how everyone's jobs will be taken away by AI and automation. It makes me so stressed.

Now I am very confused. Tbh, I don't know what to do exactly with my life. What field I should get in. I don't know if I can clear entrance exams of psychology or should I study for CAT.

My superiors are highly educated people with professionalism and integrity, who helped me grow. I stayed humble, worked very hard and learnt as much as possible while seeking any opportunities to contribute to the team.

1boxika,Reverse Recruiting - Seeking Insights and Genuine References ,"
Hi everyone! 👋

In a job market that's increasingly challenging to navigate, I'm exploring the concept of reverse recruiting. It seems like a promising avenue, especially when traditional methods aren't cutting it. I'm curious to hear from others who've ventured down this path. 

Have any of you had success with reverse recruiting? What strategies worked, and what pitfalls should one watch out for? I'm particularly wary of the myriad agencies out there that promise connections but deliver nothing substantial—or worse, turn out to be scams.

A bit about me: I bring over 14 years of experience to the table, straddling IT and banking sectors. While my expertise is broad and business-oriented, I have a strong technical foundation. Currently based in Canada, I'm on the lookout for incorporated and remote opportunities that can leverage my diverse skill set.

Any shared experiences or pointers to trustworthy references would be greatly appreciated!

1bowtb8,Feeling disconnected and unfulfilled ,"I'm hoping for some guidance as I'm feeling incredibly lost and disconnected from my current job. Some background:

I have spent the last 11 years in nonprofit work. From 2018-2022, I had the opportunity to work for an organization in another state doing work that I genuinely loved. I felt incredibly valued by the organization and they invested in me as an employee. I had close friends at my job, I was very successful and felt fulfilled. I was on a great trajectory, but unfortunately, a divorce put me in a situation where I needed to move back to my home state. If it would have been at all feasible to stay, I would have. 

Right before I moved, my *dream job* became available with the same organization in my hometown. It felt meant to be. I was offered the postion and I was absolutely over the moon. I spent the next year in that role, which unfortunately, ended up being a total nightmare. There were HR violations at every turn, the chapter was bleeding money, I had a different supervisor every month, and there were some safety and ethical situations that made me feel I could no longer stay in the role.  My mental health was declining rapidly. I was heartbroken, but decided to find something else. 

The job search was *hard*, as I know it is in most markets right now. I ultimately made the decision to stay in nonprofit work, but explore a totally different skill set within my work. I figured it would be a great opportunity to become more rounded and build out my experience as a leader. I was offered a job that offered similar pay, and was comfortable with a lateral move in that respect. I've been there about 8 months. To be clear, I have never intended for this to be a super long term job (no more than 3-5 years). More just an opportunity to learn something new and then move on. 

Initially, the job seemed amazing. After a very stressful work situation, I appreciated the absolute freedom to work from anywhere, determine my own schedule and work independently. But over time, I've noticed some red flags. My boss, who initially seemed very kind, can be condescending and pedantic. There's no opportunity for growth, except to grow your revenue portfolio. Recently, I faced a situation where I asked if a change could be made to help me be more successful, I was enthusiastically told yes, and then the rug was pulled out from under me and that ""yes"" was revoked. Upper leadership is cold and robotic, with no desire to advocate for their team. I've been kind of left to my own devices to learn a specialized skill set. In general, I don't feel like I'm a part of a team or a cause in any way, and I'm feeling very unfulfilled. 

I'm just struggling. I have never been the kind of person to job hop, and have traditionally stayed at an organization for at least 3-5 years before moving on. I've never been a complainer, almost to a fault, but I feel like I'm stuck in this rut professionally. I'm in my early 30s and I want to find something that feels like my job prior to my divorce. Something where I feel fulfilled, like I have purpose, and like there's a trajectory for growth and some more serious longevity. 

Would it be bad to start looking again? Do I need to stick this out for a few years? The job market is tough and I don't want employers to think I'm not taking it seriously. I just want to find my place. ",Spare-Bake1218,1,1.0,2,1711527784,2024-03-27 08:23:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bowtb8/feeling_disconnected_and_unfulfilled/,3,2024

The little confidence I gain, he just puts it down by saying I did a worst job or just dumping my work to bin and doing the work by himself and then ask me to compliment him for the amazing work he did.

1boul60,Does System Control good?,"Hi guys, I (27m) just started a new job as a System Control engineer. Before this, I have 3 years experience as a Web developer. May I know is System Control demanded out there? 

As we all know, software engineering is quite popular out there. I also still have interest to do designing and coding during my free time. Initially, I was planing to be expertise in software engineering but due to some circumstances, I need to move to other place. 

Then, I got the offer from an airline company as a system control engineer (project based). The job scope is quite different. Rather than you do coding, you need to reviewing the HLC of the system based on the project requirement. 

Tbh, i am still loving my time as a sofware engineer. I was thinking to search to another place several times but people suggest me to stay & gain the experience first as a system control here. 

To people out there, do you guys think system control is a good job? At least, I can get new offer easily as a system control engineer when the project finish. 

Also, do you guys think I can go back to my software engineering life after I finish the project (2 years project) ? 

I am really looking for opinions. Sometimes, I want to leave but getting new & stable jobs nowsaday is hard. I also thinking, if the software engineer career is much better, I rather leaving earlier since I afraid my programming skills will loosen up.

I appreaciate any opinions. Thanks guys",FutureDazzling8265,1,1.0,0,1711518580,2024-03-27 05:49:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1boul60/does_system_control_good/,3,2024

The upside is that it's a full-time direct hire job with good benefits and I'm currently working contract, although with not as great benefits. It would be a bit more stable.

Would you consider this job considering my friend's warning? The job market isn't great right now.

Disney: 4 Days in Office (Friday Remote), Lasts through at least December, pays $21.70/Hour, NYC-Based  
Paramount: Option to be remote or in NY or LA, Summer-only internship (based off research, has the potential to extend through fall, but no guarantees). Pays $20.00/Hour. Already made offer and accepted.

1borpne,"Routinely recognized for quality of work, but no promotion in 6+ years. I want to ask for one, but I've never done it before and don't know what's appropriate.","I work in political marketing as the sole web developer and designer for a small, successful firm since late 2017. Our team has grown from three (I was the third) to about 10 full-timers and 2-3 interns during the on-season. Despite receiving two 20% raises and a title change, I've never had a promotion.  
  
I've won 12 industry awards for my work, which now involves handling 3x the capacity we had during my first year in 2018. My boss praises me and my work all the time, often to the whole team, but I'm still in the middle of our org chart with no direct reports or clear path for advancement. My work lacks the daily campaign involvement and camaraderie that my colleagues enjoy, which I think has created an issue of workplace visibility. Everyone hired since me has been promoted at least once, often twice, and I think their more routine involvement in in-person campaign work with our boss and clients has a role in that.  
  
Given our company's growth and my contributions, I believe a promotion to VP of Technology is warranted. This would position me for future expansion and potential leadership of a web development team, as we will probably bring on at least one additional web dev in the next few years. Is it appropriate to propose this promotion? Should I discuss it over a video call or request an in-person meeting? It always feels like I'm basically saying ""I want more money"" which is obviously true, but it's also true that I am passionate about both my work and the firm but feel like I am being overlooked and also underpaid compared to the industry standard. It's also worth noting that until we actually do bring on another web developer (which we have no immediate plans to), my promotion would have no actual impact on the structure or daily operations of the company as I would still be a one-man department and still have no direct reports.

1borhz7,"How much time for a job to ""count"" from the outside? Aka at what point does a short tenure look to hiring managers like you failed that job?","Example: Hiring manager sees that you clearly leveled up into your most recent job (say, from associate role at Company A to managerial role at comparable Company B, or from an associate role at a lesser-known company to the same role at a more prestigious company). But they notice that you only worked at the latest job for 4 months and now you're unemployed.

I worry this gives the impression that you may never have gotten the hang of the job/may have bitten odd more than you could chew. Obviously I gather more info and don't assume when I encounter this (I do some recruiting and hiring myself), but it does look a certain way to a lot of people. I'm always worried about getting fired early in my time at a company because it might look like I couldn't hack it. I'm currently in a pretty volatile industry and in a relatively new role so the anxiety is high. I don't want to leave but if I got fired or laid off I'd want to know if I'd need an explanation ready for how short my time was.

So my question is, at what point have you been somewhere a respectable or non-eyebrow-raising amount of time? What length of time can you compellingly say this was a step of your career and not just a blip? I realize this is subjective (and we shouldn't tell people when they can ""count"" a role, but I'm asking!) but is there a general rule? Like a 6 or 9-month tenure? A year, two? Again I realize anyone can assume anything at any time but I'm curious what people think.

1borhah,"Pulled in for a chat with HR for ""yelling"" at a coworker","Hi everyone. 

I am an individual contributor. I had a meeting with a manager last week about a reorganization in our department. 

I thought it went fine. We went back and forth several times on the responsibilities of management vs an individual contributor (I needed her decision on something ultimately), but it was a fine discussion. 

I found out this week that this manager went to HR after this meeting and said that I ""yelled"" at her. I was completely blindsided with this, because she never provided this feedback to me, during the meeting or after. 

I record most of my meetings just for my own reference. 

I reviews the recording of that meeting - I never raised my voice in any way. I have had 3 coworkers separately listen to the recording, and they agree. 

Now, I am being asked to come into a meeting with HR to discuss this ""incident"". 

I don't think anyone knows I have this recorded. At this point it is a ""he said"" vs ""she said"" but she is in a position of power over me being a manager. 

Do you have any advice for how to handle this? 

I'm not sure if I should be upfront with the recording and ask to have it reviewed, or just attend the meeting and see how it goes.

I signed a non compete and now no long work for the company. This was an electrical company just for reference. The company’s name was Captain Electric. This non compete was signed in march 2021 under captain electric. The company dissolved captain electric and became Palmetto Residential Electric on Jan 2023. 

Question #1
Is the non compete not valid for palmetto residential electric since it was signed under captain electric? I have w2 from captain and a different w2 from palmetto so it’s not like it’s the same company so to speak. 

Question #2 
Does a non compete need to be re newed every 2 years to be valid still with employment or once you sign it’s valid for the life of employment?

If someone can help me I got a job offer letter signed it ect and I really don’t want this non compete to hinder the job. It in the same industry but working for a builder and not another electrical contractor.

Plus, I've rocked it as an Accounts Receivable Manager, handling over 85,000 condo homes in Canada. Picture this: diving deep into AR and AP reports, chasing down outstanding balances like a pro. When I joined, the AR department was practically non-existent, but I whipped it into shape and snagged $500k from our owner program in just four months. 

But here's the kicker: my buddy, a 24-year-old CEO of a booming software development company, threw me a curveball while we were chilling and blazing. He's all about Laravel and software wizardry. After witnessing my hustle firsthand, he's like, ""Dude, how many sales could you close if given 80-100 leads?"" I hit him back with a solid strategy: vibe with the market, tailor the pitch, and make it relatable. It's like selling protein to a gym rat – once they see the gains, they're hooked. 

Fast forward two days of intense sales talk, and he drops the bomb: a job offer to lead his sales squad, build the team, and even throw in a partnership deal. He's talking big bucks, a sweet base salary, and a cut of the action. Now, I'm pulling in around 200k a year with my current gigs, but the prospect of shaping the future of his company is electric.

I've been rejected from two jobs I almost got for my inadequate of French. Both jobs were good. Since then I've tried minimum wage jobs but I can't even land a warehouse job. 

I am also an American citizen, and recently I have tried applying to any job in New Hampshire and Maine. I just got off the phone with an employer who told me, ""Why the hell would you apply for this job if you're not in America?"" despite me telling them I am a dual citizen who plans to relocate.

I feel defeated and at a complete loss. I don't know what to do. It is clear I cannot stay in Quebec as it will take me over four months to learn the appropriate French on a corporate level (The grammar is impossible man). And I think employers in the USA dismiss me for living in QC so I'll have to change my resume to be in the USA.

For context, I graduated two years ago with a degree in math/CS and was an ""analyst"". I did some math and programming in VBA at my old corporate job.

1booe2c,Titles and Pay in Office / Warehouse Environment,"I hope this finds you all well, I've never posted in this subreddit, but I really need some perspective after meeting with my boss. For context, I work in a nationwide shipping company on the logistic / accounting side.  


For the past 4 years or so, I get an annual review; usually I'm told that I need to do more but I'm not offered any promotion or any sort of rank increase. When covid hit I was put in the position to control an entire department by myself, again with no pay raise. Today, I attempted to professionally confront my boss on this during my annual review and I felt like I was in wonderland.  


He expressed that titles are meaningless and that I should *not only assume the role* of a manager or supervisor, but I should happily do so for no extra pay, because ""it's not about the paycheck."" I attempted to explain that in my past positions with other employers, titles = rank to adhere weight to a situation and also provide a sort of rally flag for newer agents to go to for help.  


 Rank can help diffuse a situation if a client is escalated or if a third-party vendor needs processes updated and needs confidence they are speaking with the right person. To all of this, I felt gaslit - ""no, titles don't mean anything.""   


As for extra pay, this man looked me in the eye and said to no extent of the imagination is it a thing where people who do more should get more. For example, he's expressed that I should get training on more applications or take other agents under my wing to train up, but I've still not received any kind of supervisor promotion - and I shouldn't expect one. He once laughed at me when I brought up being paid more to handle more in the company. ""Oh, should people be paid more depending on their responsibilities?""  


If I can honestly vent, the department heads I work alongside do not take criticism well. I'm usually tossed under the bus if I report issues that pertain to thousands of dollars being lost from misshipments, or other miscommunication issues. My boss expressed that I need to try to explain the error in a way that doesn't paint fault on any entity... which to me sounded strangely impossible. It's not like I'm kicking the door down and telling people they SUCK. I was accused of being unprofessional in an email chain and in the same meeting discovered that my boss didn't even read it... he just assumed I was abrasive because the email chain was long.  


Like.... you work hard, you accept more responsibility, you're normally supposed to get paid for it, right? I can understand that sometimes a company isn't in a position to compensate more - I know COVID really hit a lot of us hard, but my boss is telling me that this concept is entirely fictional even in the best scenario.  


And Titles are meaningless? I used to work for a grocery store and titles were how we stayed afloat and were organized, otherwise we wouldn't know who to call for help.  


I just feel lost today because I felt like, despite giving my all and working hard, things my parents and teachers told me would take me far, I'm told it's all false, and I know it's not.. but we don't have HR, nor do we have QA - in fact, when I brought up how I assumed Managers assume some kind of QA responsibility for agents under their review, the idea was laughable, apparently.  


Please tell me I'm not crazy. I hope all you internet strangers are doing well. I'd greatly appreciate any advice.

1bonrru,Do I take the promotion?,"Been at my current company in my current role for a little over a year and a half. Have been in discussions with my manager for a promotion to Senior level in the same role. Manager has said if my performance is similar to how I did last year, he can put me up for promotion at the next performance review. So far, business has been slow so I'm not sure I'd be able to replicate my performance from last year. 
Fast forward to today. This same manager just let someone go on another team he oversees. He then tells me that if I want to apply to the vacancy, he'll give me the job and promote me to the Senior level role immediately. The job description will be essentially the same as my current role but in a new product line. I expect with this promotion there will be higher level targets to achieve and a heavier workload being a Senior. With this lateral promotion, I'm estimating my base salary will also increase from my current 105k to 120-125k. 
Almost seems like a no brainer to me...More money, new title, learn a new product/skill, better opportunities if I decide to leave this company. Is there anything else I'm not seeing?

1bom9ir,Not Sure What I Want to Do - Feeling Lost in Life,"Hey, So for a bit of personal background I am 24 years old and Living in the midlands in the UK. I am a graphic designer who just graduated last year from the best graphic design university in London. During this time I also freelanced and worked with some of my coursemates who had projects I helped on, like for example I did all the 3D for a music video for a Hong Kong artist and the video was in Times Square in Hong Kong, I also rebranded a whole schools brand identity in Oxford on my own, and then my friend in Japan started a business so I went with him to Tokyo and worked there for 3 months. Then I started my own Ltd company and  work from home as they still employ me , along with some freelance work, making about 31k a year only 8 months out of university in the UK isn't bad, especially in the creative field. 

However I have recently just kind of been second guessing if this is what I want to do. Sure, I have done some cool shit, I just don't really feel like it is a well respected or valued career. In college (in the UK this is after highschool but before university) I did some engineering before swapping to Graphics and I have been wondering what It would be like if I had continued down that road. 

The UK makes me very unhappy, due to the cost of living, housing, goverment, the people, the litter, weather etc. 

I am very lucky that I have an EU passport thanks to Irish heritage so I could go and work elsewhere in Europe. The main country I would like to work in would be Switzerland, but when it comes to working abroad, most places want doctors, engineers, Architects etc. This also makes me second guess my career to make me want to have something that is desried everywhere and considered a high skill, high pay career. I have finished univeristy and student loans suck (like £70,000 with 4% interest, but doesn't effect credit and is wiped after 40ish years) so I don't think I'll go back to school, just not really sure on what I want to do or what I'm doing in my life to be honest. 

I have always had an interest in Tech, i've built a few PCs, want to build my own cloud system, etc so have always thought perhaps I could take a look at Software engineering, but it doesn't really look like my sort of thing. I think my best bet would be some sort of tech related job, but I don't know. I would like to do something that is sought after and is well valued and respected. The only other thing I did was a bit of engineering, I think about that but maths was always my worst subject and would defintely require me to go and get a diploma + degree so what? 5-6 years of school. I know I am young and could change career entirely but time feels like it is going so fast that It feels like I am running out of time.

Have any of you been in this sort of situation before? Some insight or advice would be really nice :)",xashujo,1,1.0,0,1711494573,2024-03-26 23:09:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bom9ir/not_sure_what_i_want_to_do_feeling_lost_in_life/,3,2024

1bolb35,Insecure after two toxic jobs in a row advice? ,"Insecure about job search after two toxic jobs in a row

Well the title says it all. I’m (26f)  currently looking for a new job after working for two toxic small business as an accountant both in the entertainment business management space.

 The first job my boss hated me to the point I could get no response from her nor did she address me. Her behavior led too about 3 of us leaving around the same time. 

 The one now started off well but turned sour at the beginning of the year. The culture was very the devil wears Prada like where the mood of one soured the mood of all and no one knows which way is up. Accounting is a job that requires transparency and fact which were very hard to obtain by the c suite which made my job very difficult   I was put on a PIP then told by my manager I was “set up to fail and no one should have to work in a Chaotic Environment like our department” when I resigned. It was so bad I resigned with no back up due to feeling like I was being pushed out by management. (16 people left in the 7 months I’ve been here. Firm of 70) 

I guess now I’m just really second guessing everything. Am I even good at my job? Do I have bad judgment in companies/ characters?

I’m furiously looking for a new job but there’s a part of me that is very insecure after being in back to back toxic environments. I left a 3 year stint at an investment bank I loved and was highly regarded to take the opportunities at the small firm and now I am not sure what I’m capable of.  Any advice?

1bol3e4,My boss is throwing me to the wolves ,"I just started as an IT specialist at an MSSP 3 weeks ago. Prior to this I worked in IT but in a highly niche role and I wasn’t doing any of this stuff for the most part and my degree is unrelated. 

My boss lives in a different town 2 hours away and wants me to manage the clients he has in my town. So I am basically expected to handle all of their issues. That’s fine, but 3 weeks in he still hasn’t given me access to many applications and systems I need to help them. I don’t even have a contact list for them. He hasn’t done hardly any on the job training with me and when I reach out, he doesn’t reply.

Yesterday I spent 5 hours setting up devices for a client and luckily I handled it all on my own without needing his input but he would not have responded if I needed him. 

Today I’m helping this client remotely and it has become clear to me I need some cross training on this issue. I cannot resolve it without his help. I believe that I can do it, but that based on my assessment, it can’t be done remotely. I’m not full time and the client is 45 minutes out as they are in an unincorporated area so I need his permission to log those hours and go out there. He is not responding and I’ve sent him 3 messages. He’s reading them and immediately going away on Teams again

I’m very conscientious and this honestly made me start crying. I just want to be able to help our clients and make a good impression. They are probably so frustrated with us for this and it feels like he is too busy to care. 

I’m not even sure if I want advice here, I’m just venting. The title and type of experience I’m getting are enough that it’s worth trying to stick it out. If I find a similar opportunity it probably won’t pay as well either. I’ve now walked away from my computer and am not doing anything because there’s literally nothing else I can do without a response from him and that’s so frustrating.

1bokkdd,Customer service sucks,"Hello everyone, I work in the parts department at an RV store. I am female, 21 years old with two years experience at this store. Originally I was hired as a cashier, but I had a strong curiosity to learn about RV's so my boss took the time to teach me. I got increase pay and I am in the parts department and I am proud. 
I love this job very much, I got very lucky to have this job considering I had zero experience prior with RV's. But I am slowly starting to hate this job and myself. Almost everyday, I am treated like crap. I don't know if it's because I look like a small little girl, I am not sure if it's cause I am female, maybe I seem rude or I am doing something wrong....idk. 
I get treated rudely by lots of customers, and I hate to say this but it's usually the older folks or military people that are the worse. I have to brace myself against every customer I come across. 
I don't like being treated like an idiot, especially if I make one small mistake. I hate it when I help someone and they think I'm wrong, when I know based on the knowledge I have been taught I got them the correct part. But they ask another employee who ends up telling them the same thing I did. 
I don't like being told that they would rather speak to a ""man"" to help them find a part. 
I don't like being told that they would rather talk with someone ""who actually seems to know what they are doing."" And in those cases, I am unable to help them cause most of the time I just need more info in order to get them the correct part.
Maybe this is more of a rant...but this place seems a whole lot terrible to deal with rather than me working at walgreens. Idk...maybe I just have to learn to deal with it.

Please I hope you see this, Because of my situation is really bad and as an emergency, I really need an opinion or advice or guidance or atleast anything that can help. Please thank you very much God bless you guys, If you can, anyone can help, in any way. 

As a 25 year old Kurdish entrepreneur immersed in the vibrant culture and economic landscape of Kurdistan Region, Iraq, I'm facing a critical juncture where my entrepreneurial ambitions intersect with daunting challenges. For the past 10 years I have been waiting to just get started, I've been passionately developing a business concept that leverages the immense potential of online platforms and the vast opportunities offered by the internet. However, despite my unwavering dedication and meticulous planning, a significant obstacle persists not just for me but for many aspiring entrepreneurs in our region: the chronic lack of accessible capital and financial resources. 

It highlights a stark reality where the absence of a robust and inclusive banking system, spanning governmental, private, and international sectors, severely limits our ability to turn innovative ideas into thriving businesses. 

Yet, the depth of our challenge extends beyond mere financial constraints. It encompasses systemic barriers, regulatory complexities, limited investment avenues, and a notable absence of tailored support mechanisms essential for nurturing and scaling our ventures. 

In navigating this intricate landscape, where ambition meets the harsh realities of financial scarcity, I'm reaching out for collective insights and innovative solutions. How can I collaboratively overcome these challenges and create an ecosystem that empowers and accelerates the growth of aspiring entrepreneur? 

These issues collectively contribute to financial stress and hinder the ability to meet basic needs and achieve financial security. That is, my only request is to borrow some money in any way or by any means from any source. 

The budget that I aim to borrow is not excessive or burdensome. Yet, the absence of adequate banking facilities and support systems leaves you stuck in a frustrating position, unable to pursue your aspirations due to the lack of a relatively small but essential financial boost. 

The main point is this: (Having a budget and money = Getting started and work). 

Please again ask you to advise and guidance. I eagerly look forward to your contributions and collaborative efforts.

I'm not really willing to take on any more work as is, but especially if they continue to pay me so poorly. While I wait to make my exit, how do I handle this situation?

1boiite,Do you think I could loose my position should I just suck it up and get my cdl? ,"First of all let me apologize if I’m not explaining myself clearly. It’s always been an issue for me.  Specially when I’m stressing. 

In August I got a small promotion I got a driver/dispatch helper position. I am a driver but of smaller vehicles I’m not a cdl driver. 
 
I was interviewed by my supervisor, assistant director and another manager in a different department. 

During the interview the qualifications stated 

Possess current Texas Commercial Driver's License (Class B) with P&S endorsement. 

I mentioned it said I needed to have a cdl which I didn’t have and really don’t intend to get it, if I was to decided it would be years from now, will that disqualify me? The assistant director said no everyone they are interviewing people who don’t have their cdl which was true they only interviewed me and two other employees. (There’s only two positions available) I said okay and we went on will the interview.

I ended up being one of the two who got the position, the payroll lady in our department was casually talking to me (it was only me and her in her office) she asked if anyone has  spoken to me about my pay? I said no not yet, why what’s wrong & that HR emailed me papers to sign and I was going to read them first and have them done soon. She proceeded to inform me that I would be getting paid as a cdl driver plus experience instead of my current pay plus experience also my assistant director and then messed up. They may insist on me getting my cdl but because HR has all ready sent the papers they couldn’t go back on it. 

(Normally when helpers get the positions they keep their pay but get experience added they are cdl drivers not small vehicle drivers.) 

I let her know I mentioned it in the interview, and they said it was fine, I asked her if she thought if would affect me later in the future she said she didn’t know. I asked should negotiate with them? Ask for a small pay cut since I’m not a cdl driver but I’m still a driver. She said it is what it is.

Sorry this is super long.

Two weeks  ago my supervisor called me into his office and said he wanted to get me a heads up that I would need to get my cdl or I would loose my helpers position and have to pay everything back (I’ve had this position since Aug) since it’s fraud. I informed him I asked our assistant director in the interview he was there (he said he knows), I mentioned it to HR when I filled out the paperwork they said I already filled out the papers got hired and that was that. He told me yes they thought it was acceptable but it’s not and it’s fraud. I needed to have an answer by the time my assistant director came back which would have been the next day. 

That was about two weeks ago. Now it is still on my mind, I don’t want to get my cdl and I don’t know what to do. My friend told me to let it be since they aren’t mentioning it. I’m wondering if I could go to HR  and fight it? Or find a way to keep my helper position without having to get my cdl. I want to go to HR and ask but I don’t want to seem like I’m throwing my bosses under the bus or doing sneaky stuff behind their backs.  Idk if my supervisor told me to kind of kind of “scare” me into get my cdl or if they are waiting til the end of the semester and not renew my helpers contract.

1boglic,Work promotion has me nervous,"So tomorrow I will be interviewing for a higher position at work. I have applied for this position 3 times in the last two years. This position is known as the ‘revolving door’ position. The people who take it either:
Move up to an even higher position within two years or leave due to job stress within two years. I’ve heard that no one has ever stayed in this position for more than 4 years.

So here’s where my fears are coming in. I am applying for this position for two reasons.
1) The Income. We are talking a 50K raise in salary. 
2) Family Pressure. My mother and partner both have been non stop talking about how great a position like this would be.

But the truth is? I don’t even know if I want it! I mean don’t get me wrong, one day this is my goal. This position is the same level as ALL my friends and even my brother! So how great would it be to finally reach that goal at my young age of 26! But, this goal comes with major (normal to some) changes. These changes include: working nights instead of mornings, working weekends and holidays and 8 days off a month instead of 12. Those are some pretty big cons as someone who is looking to just enjoy her life before any big commitments like marriage and kids, especially with summer around the corner!

But I know that if I don’t aim for my goals now, when the time comes where I need these goals to become a reality, I may never be able to achieve this goal again.

Not to much stress factors, polite management, somehow good job security( i mean it’s hard to get fired here), but our job contract may be terminated in 6 months if county is not going to renew it. County probably will. Anyway there is still plenty of job for a lower pay-check in this field 20-23$, but the job is kind of laid back one.

The job is overall great for my age. I definitely see a lot of opportunities to advance my career to get to 30-31$/h in 1-4 years, but this is pretty much it to this career. The dead end. Because above that only management positions(if i ever be lucky to even get one, it probably will be in my 30-35 yo) that also pay 30-40$. I love the job, but it’s hard to call it a career. There is not actual advancement and everyone knows it.

At the same time i have Bachelors degree in Cyber Security. Have no hands on experience, but about to finish certification Sec+ CompTIA. I’m not really passionate about it to be honest, but i can push it through. Then i will need to start in help-desk which is high stress low pay job. The market for IT is also highly competitive and to have IT career means to have most of the time stressful and high paying job with lots of education required. You basically study something all the time. But in future i might say thank you to myself that i haven’t chicken it out and actually pursued this career. 

I see a lot of rant of people about no jobs, people who just burn out from IT work on low paying jobs and thinking about quitting the IT.

At the same time, i see people who in their mid 30s trying to break into IT, since their job is dead end jobs they don’t feel accomplished in.

I also have lots of friends who are quite older than me making 80-100k in their IT careers because they just stick to it(they also passionate to the craft though).

I know you cannot answer this question, but i would be happy to hear about experience of other people. Have you made a career switch before and have you regretted it?

1bofvkf,Classic Carrot & Stick? What to do,"For background I work in a small mom & pop financial services firm, dealing in the divestiture of real property in a well known industry. I took my current position in July of 2022, I have no written contract or employment agreement just a handshake deal with the principal. I was in need of a Job at the time and a bit nieve so I agreed to start at $20/HR (flat rate no benefits) with the understanding that EOY bonuses ""$10,000-$50,000"" could be expected and would help offset the flat hourly rate and that additionally I would be bumped from $20/HR to $25/HR after 6 months. Christmas came around that year and I received a $1000 bonus (honestly I was grateful because I understood I had not been there a year). Here is where my frustration starts, I did not receive an hourly pay raise at 6 months as expected, but kept my head down knowing (thinking) I was working toward a large bonus at the end of the following year. I received a call from the principal in August of 2023 informing me that I had been working hard and that he would be raising my hourly rate to 25/HR and that contingent on the successful sale of the project I was working on he was going to ""make sure I was taken care of at Christmas"" with ""monies enough that should put you and your bride to be in a house"". Fast forward to December, due to various factors property will not close until late January 24 - I was assured that the ""christmas bonus"" would be coming after sale of property. Property closes and nothing occurs, finally I garner up the courage to ask about my compensation and it turns into a conversation about raising my hourly rate to $30/HR, although I am extremely frustrated I accept, and here we are in march remaining at 25/HR. I am beside myself and having trouble getting up to come into work every day, and hardly able to focus at the office, I want to quit, but am in no position to currently - I am curious if it is reccomended I tough it out until july to hit the 2 year mark for the resume?

1bofpv0,What can I do about this situation? Manager teasing me.,"My manager (28M) teases me (28F) a lot. Others get teased slightly but I get singled out a lot. I laugh, ignore or play along as I don’t feel I can do anything else. He has power over me so if I complain, can’t get promoted or be in managements good books.

He always teases my likes and dislikes, tries to wind me up. As an example we have a playlist at work, so I added some of the songs I liked and he made fun of the artists I like. He made fun of my favourite colour, things I like to do in spare time and rolls his eyes playfully.

We do hybrid working. We have to match our days where possible as in the same team so need to be in office together. I asked for new monitors. We had new monitors at work - 4, so I took one and started using it.. Was happy with it. Next day my manager took it and replaced with a less quality one and Slacked me it.

I tried telling him to be nicer to be as a joke, didn’t know how to say it seriously. I also tried earlier in the year saying he’s should be nicer to me as his New Year’s resolution, but he said no and that he’s planning on being worse. He is caring of me like after I had my car accident, wanted to go home safe with a lift and Christmas party in a taxi. 

Recently at work someone mentioned how their friend doesn’t want anything for their birthday but people don’t mean it. I said “people don’t mean that, for example on valentine day and birthday - it’s the thought that counts not the gift. Shouldn’t have to ask for specific gifts etc”. The two people agreed. He responded with “Better not try that with me”. Idk if I’m reading to much into this but why would he buy me a valentines gift? Birthday I get as managers do that at work.

We also were discussing paint balling for next team activity, he said all I would do is chase him. 

We were also discussing how long people take to get ready. I was little shocked as it takes me ages. He said “my name I know it’s hard to believe it takes so little time for me to look this good.”

These are just few examples, I just feel like he’s quite difficult with me in a playful mean teasing manner but he’s not like this with other girls in the office. He teases other people lightly yes, but I do feel targeted.

I don’t know how to handle this or why he’s behaving like this. I just feel like he really doesn’t like me so he’s teasing me like this. I can’t go to HR or change managers. I am trying to find a new job, but very difficult. Like I do a lot of good work, but he never praises me. My senior manager does praise me, but my direct never does.

1boeu0f,Expressing interest with a previous employer,"In early 2023 I was terminated by the company I was working for. While in my role, I designed a job that I believed would be both a good fit for me (asked to do so by my boss) and would benefit the company. At the time when it was designed, I was told it wouldn't happen anytime soon. And then two months later I was let go for a performance related issue (somehow a private message I wrote was posted in a group chat and I didn't realize it went there. It was seen by my bosses boss, who I will refer to as ""Steve""). 

At some point in March 2024, the job I designed was posted on their Career page. I want that damn job. I checked my termination paperwork and confirmed there was nothing saying I was prevented from being re-hired (I know some companies prevent re-application during a set period of time). 

I reached out to my former boss and asked him if he knew of anything that would prevent me from applying to the role. He said no except for that ""Steve"" is the Manager for it. If hired, I would report to him.

There is also a second issue. I'm in the US but the job is not posted as hiring in the US. It is set in an EU country. 

On Friday, I sent a LinkedIn message to ""Steve"" and asked him if he would consider me for this role based on my ability to ""hit the ground running"". I also addressed the elephant in the room of the reason I was termed in the past. 

So far, I haven't heard back. I don't even know if he has read the message. You might think ""You sent it Friday, it's Tuesday morning, wait longer."" but it's really Tuesday evening for ""Steve"" xD. I'm honestly just too impatient and am worried that they will find someone and hire them while I'm waiting to hear back. 

And thus becomes my request for advice. Right now, I have four options that I can think of: 

1. Wait a few more days to see if ""Steve"" replies. Hard to do, but at the end of the day, my odds of getting the job are probably 20% anyways (he didn't like me very much when this all happened in 2023. No, the message wasn't about him, but it was about someone that he brought into the company when he was hired). 
2. Send a carefully worded email to ""Steve""'s work email and cross my fingers. 
3. Apply to the job and cross my fingers. I know I'll get rejected, but my name will still be there. This might also trigger an email to him telling him that I applied. 
4. I have a few people within the company who are still there that offered to be references for me. Thus far I haven't taken any of them up on it (haven't needed them). I could ask a few of them if they would suggest me for this position.   


Open to other suggestions or advice.   
You have to understand, I spent 2 years creating this role and gathering the data to justify everything it would be doing. It's my work baby :/ ",Someasti,2,1.0,2,1711477026,2024-03-26 18:17:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1boeu0f/expressing_interest_with_a_previous_employer/,3,2024
1boeltm,How Do People Cope….,"This will be long but……

I got laid off a year ago and out of panic, ignored the red flags and took a gig I was under qualified for at a small business (Stupid! I KNOW! I KNOW! I was scared.) I am the only person in my department and I have 2 bosses who also own the company (I report directly to them, no boss above them) - we’ll call one Boss 1, he is extremely hands off (like, so hands off I don’t speak to him for weeks at a time, and this is not on accident or for lack of my effort) - the other, Boss 2, I coordinate with mostly. We’re a very small team, I have to wear a ton of hats and master of a lot of tasks. Despite being transparent at my interview with Boss 1 and 2 about where my skills lie and where I need support and them promising me the support I’d need, I find myself drowning in all the responsibility and chaos of the company. 

Boss 1 is constantly MIA and Boss 2 is either MIA or micromanaging me poorly (ie angrily reminding me of tasks I’ve already finished and sent to them for review, or insisting they be included in tasks/meetings, just to be outspoken in their misinformed opinion and thus confusing those actually involved in the project and ultimately going unresponsive for me/others to clean up the mess). Standards, expectations, and general office ambiance are determined entirely by mood and impulse of Boss 2. (One day Boss 2 is on time and greeting me as they come in, the next day they stomp in late muttering how much of a mess the office is.)

Essentially, this place is Boss 2’s emotional playground. There are little to no standard procedures, I get no support or help or time from others. When I ask, we just “don’t have the resources”. Boss 2 is too busy to elaborate expectations when assigning me tasks or Boss 2 will say something like “I trust your judgement” only to review my work and tell me a very specific image they *actually* had in mind that I failed to meet the expectation of (all said with the implication that because I cant read Boss 2’s mind, I’m an idiot. like “Well I really didn’t think I had to tell you I want things to look nice and uniform” or “I don’t know why you put xyz there, it’s never gone in that spot before and looks weird there…..”) When you’re already working over normal work hours (with a lot of other things on my to-do list) that feels discouraging and disrespectful at best. My attempts to address this issue are blown off with statements that imply I’m just a poor performer/and or stupid and I’ll eventually have to learn to sink or swim. 

Not shockingly, quickly after accepting the role I learned they haven’t been able to keep anyone in this position for more than a year at a time. I realize the position I took is essentially a scapegoat role and executive assistant (neither have to do with the original job description) but of course I realized this in one of the most horrendous job markets I’ve ever seen. I recognize staying at and changing the culture of this organization is not an option, but while I look for a new job I wear myself out trying to protect myself, document issues, manage up, stay calm/not have a breakdown, manage their time, set (and set, and set, and constantly have to uphold) professional boundaries, do the actual tasks my job asks of me (which that ALONE would keep me busy 8 hours a day) and then go home and search for a new job. How do people do it?  No matter how I allocate my time, I leave some part of myself vulnerable to the social undermining and/or technical errors I make trying to perform under the thumb of my boss’s emotional impulses and I dont want it to continue to eat away at me or affect my professional reputation by burning any bridges. Like I said, I’m looking for a new role but I’m afraid an outburst will come first……

I have read all the resources I can find and and listened to all the podcasts, and while I know I can’t control their actions, adding more responsibility to my own life to avoid the constant emotional backlash isn’t feeling sustainable either. I feel so stuck and hopeless - to make matters worse, I’m not willing to stoop to their level, but it also doesn’t feel like the professional route is respected, as Boss 2 is openly unprofessional at internal discussions and has a proven track record of not respecting professional boundaries. Most of my “professional” attempts to mediate and communicate with them both get bulldozed…. 

How do I not let it get to me? No matter how much I prepare myself every day for the impossible expectations, recognize its not personal and doesnt determine my worth….. it still hurts. I’m becoming increasingly paranoid and irritable in my personal life because its so hard to switch my brain on and off. At the end of the day, they’re not evil or malicious, I think Boss 2 gets some sense of worth by ALWAYS being the ONLY one with the “right” answers. No matter what tricks I use to try to cope, none of it seems to help me hold onto my confidence or hope I’ll get out of here without also adding to my exhaustion and already overwhelming mental load.

1boehqc,Promotion (but not really),"I work at a large corporate company, came here via acquisition of my previous company.  Recently, I was told I was getting a promotion.  Our company does things differently, but I’m basically becoming a “Senior XYZ”

Very recently, and in advance of this years compensation discussions, our HR sent out  an email to the entire company about comp.  Basically saying that there would be changes in the review - some roles pay ranges would be going down, less budget for annual raises, less equity granted.  But there were 2 things that stood out:

1.) if your roles range goes down YoY, employees base pay isn’t subject to decrease 

2.) promotion increase - there is a clearly defined MINIMUM increase to employees base pay if they are promoted.

There are no fine print, no notes about “exceptions”, etc.

Fast forward, I have my meeting with my manager.  I had known I was getting promo’d, just no idea on what comp would be.  Manager told me that, despite being promoted, my base comp would be going DOWN.  The reason being, that because we were acquired (keep in mind, happened multiple years ago) I was on different variable comp plan than the rest of the company.   But regardless, the explanation doesn’t make sense - not only am I not getting the MINIMUM raise, my salary is DECREASING…and again it said nothing in the email sent to entire company about certain employees not being eligible.  

I guess I am a bit frustrated and unsure what to do.  I think I have s value to the company and leverage, and they definitely don’t want me to leave.  90%+ of external hires have failed in my role since I’ve been hired.  Do I reach out to speak with HRBP? Do I just take my promotion and shut up? What would others recommend.  It is very spelt out in the email (from Head of HR) that I should be getting a raise, and very spelt out that in no circumstances should an employee be getting a decrease (let alone after a promotion, wtf?)

Thanks!

1boeh8h,I want to change my career. I feel lost in work-life right now. Any advice?,"Hi everybody! I hope this subreddit is the right place for my post. This is my first time posting here.  
In 2022, after graduating, I found myself struggling to secure a well-paid job in Italy. Eventually, I made the decision to move to Vienna, where I accepted a non-qualified job offering a decent salary. Despite the lower pay compared to the Austrian average, Vienna's affordability has allowed me to live comfortably and save money. However, I aspire to pursue a more fulfilling and challenging career.  
My background includes working on IT product launches and collaborating with AI companies, alongside obtaining a Master's degree in Management (Political Sciences). While my current job provides stability, I feel it's not aligning with my skills and aspirations. To bridge this gap, I've started taking courses on platforms like Coursera, to study the basics of Project Management theories and aiming to learn SQL, which seems to be in high demand in job advertisements.  
Although my current company has opened to the chance to move me to their office for a more qualified job (HR?), nothing is set in stone. Meanwhile, I'm witnessing my partner's rapid career progression, which leaves me questioning why I haven't experienced the same despite I studied more (don´t get me wrong, I am proud of my partner, I am questioning myself!).  
I'm eager to transition into roles related to project management or business development, which seem to be coherent my background and expertise gained in Italy. However, I feel a bit lost on the steps to take to achieve this goal.  
I need to learn German, but I'm uncertain about the next steps. I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or personal stories you can share. I'm incredibly ambitious and determined to overcome this phase of feeling stuck and frustrated in my career and my life.

1bodhhw,Advice on what types of alternative jobs to look at for a woman over 45 that is a marcom/ digital marketing professional and can't find work?,"I've been freelancing as a marketing communications/digital marketing professional for the past ten years, both because I had cancer, and I was also a family caretaker.  I also have a physical disability and can only do remote work, which is what I've been doing this whole time. 

I've had long-term prestige clients. I have a great portfolio of work. I have good references. I have multiple certifications, many from ivy league biz schools in digital marketing, content marketing and data privacy.

I need to find a full-time, in-house, remote marketing communications job with benefits now because I can't remain a freelancer at my age. It's too risky.

I've sent out close to 900 resumes since July 2023. I've had many second interviews. Nothing is working out.

**I CAN'T FIND A JOB.   I need some advice on what types of alternate jobs I should look for?** 

**I need to make at least $60K to support myself and an elderly parent.** 

**Any ideas?**

I've applied to everything in my field, projects on Upwork and even $15-$20/hr data entry and call center jobs. I'm overqualified for those and they rarely respond. 

Even when I cut a lot from my resume it's hard to hide the amount of experience I have, and a Google search would tell any perspective employer that I've worked at a higher level.

I've been near-suicidal a few times this past month. I just have no idea what to do. I'm, generally, a very positive-mindset person. 

I check the job boards every day and apply to anything relevant, including on Upwork just to have $ coming in while I search

I honestly don't know what to do. I've worked in my field for over 20 years, invested so much of myself to know my stuff. 

I never thought I'd find myself unemployable at this age.

My current boss is probably the most intense boss I have ever worked with. She’s perfectionist, she wants everything done fast, every task seems like an urgent task, and she wants it to be done well. I can accept that… except I’m only one person lol. I am now handling a new branch of an office, which is an extension of the old ones but new team, new projects.. there’s only two of us handling 1 dept. 

I once heard a story that the last person sitting on my role had no prior experience, so there was a lot of mistakes, both minor and major ones. So my boss was kinda traumatized with the situation and ended up micro-managing me, she overthinks everything (hence the perfectionist) and I’m really trying to make myself understand that I am not perfect, so I can only deliver the work best I can. I just need the right mindset to overcome it.. because i enjoy the work, the colleagues (they are genuinely good people), and my boss is so smart that I can learn a lot from her. I’m just trying to reframe my point of view so I can “manage” my exhaustion.",disdose,1,1.0,1,1711471225,2024-03-26 16:40:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1boceud/anyone_here_have_worked_with_an_overthinking_boss/,3,2024

1bobtyu,Moved around at a fortune 5 company,"So I’ve been at a large company in the us for about 3 years - the whole time I’ve been here I’ve been pushed around into different roles that don’t align with my goals but I’ve remained flexible because the end mission remained the same (healthcare product/program development). Every time I move, I am set back in terms of growth/promotion opportunities. I hit a breaking point 3 months ago when I was moved for the 4th time into a role (against my will) that is in employee engagement and L&D, something SO different from what I was doing and want to do. This is also a very risky area and I’m not interested in it/don’t want to build my career in this area. Any advice on how to get back into what I want to be doing (healthcare program/product development)? I feel like I need to leave the company because politics are involved and I feel like if I tried to move internally I would be met with a lot of pushback. I am very grateful for having kept a job during this crazy time but being in a job that isn’t intellectually stimulating (personally) it is very, very challenging to get out of bed and start my day. This is meant in no way to offend anyone working in L&D and Employee Engagement, I am just not personally interested in a career in this area.

1bo98vb,Feeling a little lost and a little scared. (Applying with a theft misdemeanor),"Hello everybody. First post so many apologies on any errors.

I am 25M with a bachelors in Computer Science and a minor in Communications. I graduated last May and have been working as an entry level IT consultant for about 1 year. 

Eventually, I realized that I did not see myself making enjoying a career in the IT world and I do not have a great amount of skill with coding. I excel with people and communicating technical things. After finding out about working in insurance claims and what the job entails, I saw it as a great fit. 

Had in in-road with an auto insurance company through a current coworker that I really liked and were well established. We matched really well and they sped me through the hiring process. I had a conversation with their HR department about my theft misdemeanor and explained everything about how I learned a lot from it and how it was my greatest mistake and how I have kept my nose completely clean since then. 

In short, I was really excited to start a new opportunity that would have payed me better and developed my career and I got the notice that I was not chosen due to my background check this morning and just feeling a little hopeless even though I still have a job at the moment.

Thanks again everyone. Any thoughts or advice on this would be greatly appreciated. ",Actual_Spite_549,1,1.0,1,1711463251,2024-03-26 14:27:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bo98vb/feeling_a_little_lost_and_a_little_scared/,3,2024

1bo8hlt,How to professionally tell someone they need to schedule a time,"Pretty much just the title. 

I often have clients reach out and say things like “I’ll call you when I’m on the way”; which wasn’t really a problem when I was working part time, didn’t have time for lunch breaks, and in office the entire time. However, now I’m only in office two days a week, I do take lunch breaks on those days, and I’m not about to skip lunch and/or worry about missing a client because I did take lunch. 

I know this should be simple, but I’m a huge overthinker and keep feeling like everything I say is going to come across as rude or as if I just don’t want them to meet with them. 

So far the best I’ve got is: Please let me know if there is a certain day/time that you will be coming by the office. As I’m only in office two days a week now, I need to keep my schedule from overlapping. Thank you!

1bo8cgi,How can I get my dangerous coworker fired? Update,"For one some people grouped me into the other employees saying that I was either enabling, especially purposefully and that I’m “a piece of shit” or something is just wrong. Incidents I have witnessed i immediately report to my boss, i have never seen a child hit. The most extreme child in bathroom incident was recent WHILE I was out of the room. I came back and noticed that she tried hiding the fact that she put them in the bathroom and I immediately reported that. I’m not in the room observing and then doing nothing. 
 I had made that post because I had made a suggestion that we should move our timeout into the open because of my concern with my coworker, she ended up agreeing and we changed it because of my advice.
When I called the police they asked if action was taken to combat what I had reported and I told him that the timeout was moved. He himself told me that it’s fine then because action was made and that my boss or manager should be the one making reports to the parents that will then make a decision. So for those saying that I was just basically sitting back and doing nothing, I was doing my job when I reported her to my boss and once again the stuff I was reporting wasn’t a child being hit or thrown, it was inappropriate behavior like calling a child “annoying” or saying to “shut up” and then the pushing incident. I never held that as a secret I immediately went to my higher up.
There are maybe 2 other ppl that knew something before me because I am NEW, who didn’t say anything because she has something mentally wrong with her and people like protecting some mentally disabled people and acting like they don’t have mortals. that is not me, I am the one making changes and hoping she can get fired so that I can eventually  leave in peace and not worry about my kids. I have experienced forms of abuse myself, I did my job and then asked Reddit for advice where I get more advice. Some realize that I didn’t know fully what to do because of training and I appreciate that and i appreciate the people who realize I’m actually trying to do something. 
Recording is off the table. Stuff either happens when I’m gone or is so quick and random that there is no time. There is no secret place to put a camera I obviously thought of that before. It’s also not a daily occurrence I don’t even recall the last time I had to report her because they had made some changes and it made a difference. also I’ve expressed a few times to her “not to do that” so I think she doesn’t do things in front of me because I’ve actually corrected her. Once again I’m not just sitting around and “enabling” I reported to my boss, changes were made, the rest lies in my boss hands like I was told to by an officer. 
I don’t know what is left of me to do besides report to my boss if she does anything again. Hopefully nothing drastic. I obviously want her fired. I’m not an enabler. The police basically told me to report to my boss they were even confused why I called them when changes were made.

1bo72c0,Next steps in my career?,"
Hi! I’m a 24F (please don’t tell me I’m so young and have a whole life ahead 🤣 point taken) and I moved from my small hometown to another european country alone to work at 18. I never went to uni due to both the cost and the fact that I didn’t want to choose without being sure, but I did finish the highest level of high school. After a few shitty jobs, I found a pretty cool one in a language travel agency and I have quite recently been promoted to Sales team manager. I’ve been in the company for 3,5 years and in the role for about 6 months, after doing the same tasks in an interim position already for a year.

Here’s the thing: I am not liking my new role, and I feel like there is nowhere else I can go because I never studied. Some of the main reasons I don’t like it is because I feel very micromanaged by the person above me, who has been my manager since I started working here. She is not the one that decided to promote me, and I get the feeling that she would not have if it’s up to her. Also, they barely raised my salary when they promoted me, and in January some other team members got a raise due to inflation but I was not included again. I honestly feel like they are using my age against me, like I have plenty of time to grow, but to me it is a very toxic attitude as in the end, they saw my worth and potential as a manager regardless of my age.

More than anything, there are things that I would like to get in the near future that my company is simply not flexible with, like remote work (I get 1 day a week), work from anywhere policy, part-time work, in general just more time for myself (even for less money I would accept happily). 

Lastly they are still expecting me to do all
my old tasks on top of the new responsibilities, which to me is 1. counterproductive, as they keep claiming sales come first but if I can’t do my new job and improve the team’s sales and just focus on my own sales, we will never grow 2. too much work and 3. confusing for the team. 

BUT, I do not have any studies, just this work experience, and I am very much struggling to find something I can do. I feel like no other company is gonna trust me in a similar role because they do not know me. It’s not like I don’t believe in myself, but it takes time to prove yourself.

I really slly feel like Ineed some advice on time-flexible and remote career paths, where hopefully my experience can already help me get a foot in the door. Very interested in project-based jobs. I am very open to starting my own company, the thing is that I fully support myself and I do not have much money left to save, also not having a stable income to pay rent and bills terrifies me s tiny bit, and within a year I would like to be out of here. I would love to do some studying this year to help my chances, but not longer than a year. So any useful and wanted course recommendations would also be amazing! I have completed a social media marketing course, and I speak 3 languages (English, Dutch and B2 level Spanish). Tourism, leisure and hospitality and real estate are some fields that interest me.

And I work 7-3 so I have a lot of day left when I am done. I also like that it's helping the community (a lot of my experience is in non-profit)

I don't mind the people I work with, but I am the only woman, which means I deal with a lot of sexist comments about how women don't work as hard as men, aggressive political views, and I have to dress in a way that doesn't show the shape of my body because if I don't, I can see that everyone talks to me differently. Same thing with wearing makeup- I can't or I invite weird responses. 

My boss recently said something that rubbed me the wrong way. Well, he always does because that's his personality. I know a lot of my role here is to entertain him which annoys me because I have a lot of skills and marketing background he doesn't take advantage of and I get bored a lot.

But he mentioned that he was considering cancelling our benefits program in the new year because he thinks it's a waste of money (especially since he doesn't think he should be paying it for the women currently away on maternity leave since she is not technically working).

Doing so is highly illegal since it was part of my compensation package (I spoke to an HR friend because we don't have HR here) so I am not too worried about it actually happening. But the fact he brought that even up is just so annoying and in his personality.

Now, I interviewed for a marketing agency and got a second interview. It's not a big agency but it's graphics, video shooting and editing, events, etc. And it's mostly from home and only in person for getting footage and events. It would only be an additional dollar an hour. The hours are 9-5.

I am comfy where I am right now. It is easy, I have a lot of personal time to myself after work because I finish so early. But sometimes I wonder if I am selling myself short. At the same time, I had some TERRIBLE jobs and I am scared of falling into another terrible one and losing my current comfort.

1bo599k,Internal transfer or just suck it in until I find a new job? ,"Mad the mistake of sticking around for 5 months for a job with no actual direction. I'm a UX designer strangely under the marketing department and I ended up doing grunt graphic design work and antiquated HTML coding because of a system the company adopted that is extremely backwards and limiting (everyone hates it). It doesn't help that the head of this department is also new and wishy-washy with lots of conflict of interest because he wants a promotion and is trying to prove himself. 

I have been closely collaborating with IT because of my duties and I like it better there. 

But in the past month I've been PIP'd by my current manager because of his unrealistic expectations and because his own job is on the line and has overpromised to leadership but is taking it out on us. I have been meeting deliverables, but not the small unrealistic expectations he wants (responding to messages within minutes, never encountering connection issues and if I so much as have faulty home internet, I'm expected to involve IT when it's not their problem) and I am also the lone coder and have no backup so I really am just alone while supporting graphics design needs of my other colleagues in the department. 

I have pulled out of said PIP with flying colours and he has commended me for being the only person to do that in his personal experience. 

I am now again in a tense situation with said manager because of him probably so stressed and in disarray and he said I did not respond to his messages within 1 minute. It's too much. 

I've been looking for jobs elsewhere but also want to know if an internal transfer is still possible/recommended given my situation?

1bo3y1e,I don't know what to do with my career life ,"Hello everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. Before I share my thoughts, I want to mention that I'm seeking some advice.

I'm a 22-year-old soon-to-be graduate in International Business, with a minor in Strategy and Business Development. My job experience so far includes working as a Sales Operations Specialist(Internship) at a startup in the SAAS industry and as a Guest Relations Officer at a luxury 5-star resort.

To be honest, I'm feeling a bit lost when it comes to my career path. Despite my degree and overall job experience I'm unsure about what direction to take. Specifically, I'm struggling to identify promising job opportunities in Greece that align with my skills and offer decent pay. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring remote work options to collaborate with international clients while staying in Greece. Is this possible?

I've had conversations with classmates who've landed internships in areas like business analysis, consulting, and corporate finance. However, my attempts to secure similar opportunities haven't been successful. While most of them tell me it was luck that got them there, I cannot find myself to be this lucky.

Recently, I've been considering a career in Project Management, but I'm concerned by the entry requirements, especially in Greece. Most positions seem to demand 2-3 years of experience, leaving me unsure of where to begin.

So, I'm reaching out to this community for advice. Are there any other entry-level positions that are currently in demand? And how can I expand my options and find my place in the job market? Where do you think it would be a good option to focus my time and get a certification or try to teach the skills needed by myself ?

I genuinely appreciate any insights or recommendations you can offer. Your guidance could make a real difference in helping me navigate this stage of my career.

Thank you all in advance for your advice.",bear2108,2,1.0,0,1711446607,2024-03-26 09:50:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bo3y1e/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_career_life/,3,2024
1bo3a4b,not sure which path to take ,"1. EKG Tech
2. X-ray Tech
3. Ultrasound Tech


i want to start by saying i know i really want to go into the medical field. i love helping people. but i dont want to be a nurse or cna. i want to find a little niche. a technician of some sort 

I’m deciding between these 3. My top choice is ultrasound tech but i heard it’s really challenging the school but most importantly it’s really competitive to get accepted into the programs and there is waitlists. and unfortunately i really don’t wanna wait years to get into it. 

Ekg tech school is much quicker and seems easier. but am i taking the easy way out? i feel like xray tech kinda meets in the middle of the 2 and im so unsure which way to go.

1bo399i,"I'm thinking of doubling down and pursuing a career in data analysis, any recommendations and advice?","I'm in my final semester of undergrad studying business technology management. I honestly thought I knew what I wanted to do career wise but these past few weeks have kind of made me question everything. Since the market is really poor right now and it's a bad time for new grads to land opportunities, I've decided to extend my graduation to Winter 2025 by taking one course in both the Fall 2024 and Winter 2025 semesters.  
  
I've thought about it and taken advice from friends and family and am thinking about doubling down on a career as a data analyst and maybe even one day transition into a data engineer.  
  
Here's my issue. I've been working as a ""data analyst"" intern for about a year now. But I don't think the work I've done is really that of a data analyst. I basically do lots of online research on certain public figures to make sure our database and records on said people are up to date. I do data input and update old info. I also use multiple online databases like salesforce, iWave, and LiveAlumni. I export the records I need into an excel file, use simple formulas to clean and sort the data, then swift through them compiling each persons info into profiles for other departments to act on. I'm beginner to intermediate with python and I'm beginner with SQL, but I haven't utilized either in my role. I just don't think I'm a quote on quote ""real"" data analyst. Of course I also don't really know what a ""real"" data analyst is, but whatever it is I don't think it's me.  
  
But since I have a years worth of experience on my resume as a ""data analyst"" I'm thinking of pursuing it as a career since I have a bit of a ball rolling for me. I'm thinking over the summer I take courses from udemy or something on R, SQL, and even an advanced Excel course. Hopefully with that I'll apply to intern level or new graduate roles around September and land something. A return offer from my current employer isn't an option sadly.  
  
With the job market being so poor at the moment as it is, I'm really stressing right now. If anybody has any experience, advice, or even know somewhere hiring and can give a referral that would be great. I've attached my resume so you can take a look, of course have redacted personal info.  
  
This is the link to my resume. This way of sharing it messes up the format of the education section so please don't mind that.

1bo2svf,How do you do it!?,"How do you all do it? I feel like I knew what I wanted to do and now I’m regretting every decision of it. I thought I wanted to be a nurse and bridge over from my paramedic. Had goals of obtaining my NP degree after working in the ICU for sometime. Really thought I truly had this all figured out. I left the fire department to join a hospital and realized how much I actually hate working in certain conditions. Let me first say that I do enjoy learning the medical side and do my best to try and learn as much as I can so I can be confident when taking care of patients. Here is my issue, I HATE doctors and how rude and patronizing they are. I can’t stand co workers and how everyone just talks behind each others back. The patients are horrible, I can’t stand coming to work with the motivation to help and treat patients and then end up just being cursed at, harassed by family members and dealing with petty complaints like STD checks. Can’t deal with truly sick patients who don’t even want you treating them and question everything you do even after explaining it multiple times. Can’t deal doctors who want to always give everyone a hard time. Truly gets really old quick and I never dealt with depression until I started working in the ER. Every time I’m here, I don’t talk to anyone and just watch the clock tick away until I can clock out and go home. I have extreme social anxiety as well and can’t stand dealing with the fear of having a critical patient in my room and everyone rushing to my room to help out. I’m decent at my job and get stuff done when I’m not rushed but then I get tunnel vision in critical situations and would have never guessed until I started working in the ER. I’m always comparing myself to others intelligence and then when I do something wrong, I look down on myself and think I’m not even meant to do this and I live with my mistakes. 

I’m allowed to go back to nursing school and bridge from my paramedic but there is a huge part of me that just doesn’t want to do it anymore but then I know I need to for a pay increase and be able to obtain certain goals of mine. I want to understand critical care and be amazing at it but I don’t think I’ll ever achieve it with my social anxiety and lack of intelligence. 

I’m 30 years old and I want to go do something but I feel stuck. I’ve thought about software but then I don’t think I’d enjoy it and have no real motivation for it other than the money. I can’t even think of anything else. 

How do you all do it? You all are way better than me. I can’t handle this crap. ",Seektruth2146,2,1.0,1,1711441869,2024-03-26 08:31:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bo2svf/how_do_you_do_it/,3,2024

1bo0qd0,Kept hanging after 7 interviews and then ghosted. Is this normal or am I overthinking this?,"I had been interviewing with 2 companies for Product roles. While both interview processes started around the same time, one of them (let's call them A) had 5 interviews while the other one (let's call them B) had 5-6 rounds.

As I progressed through the first couple of interviews for both, I realized that B's ""5-6 rounds"" meant 7 interviews, which meant that if everything goes well I will be done interviewing with A long before I was done with B. I let B's recruiter know that I am interviewing with another company for a similar role, and was transparent about the timing differences for which he agreed to expedite the process from their end. For various 'reasons' they could not accelerate their interview process.

When I was about to have my final round with A in a couple of days, I again told B about this situation and the recruiter assured that they will finish their interviews by next week. Their interviews took another 2-3 weeks to finish. After B's last interview (with the VP) I told the recruiter that A is about to extend an offer in another couple of days, and B's recruiter asked me to hold the decision until early next week as he'll ""definitely get back to me with the final decision"".

A finally made an offer early next, I had only until the end of that week to accept. There was no news from B's recruiter yet, so I called him and according to him ""...everybody loved speaking with you, and we are impressed with your experience...bla bla...BUT the VP still wants to finish talking to another candidate we'd been interviewing. The other candidate still has 2-3 interviews left, so we will only know of the final decision in another \~2 weeks"". I told him, I have no choice but to accept A's offer and keep waiting to hear from B. He agreed, and assured me that no matter what he'll get back to me in 2 weeks.

I accepted A's offer and 2 weeks go by. No response from B's recruiter even after messaging him directly a couple of times. Another week passes and after another message from my side B's recruiter responds ""...sorry I've been travelling so couldn't reply. We have made an offer to the other candidate"". I decided to not flip out and politely asked for feedback: ""what could I have done differently to present my candidacy better?"". I never received a reply. This was \~4 weeks ago.

As much disappointed and frustrated as I am at B for stringing me along for such a long interview process spanning over 3 months + keeping me hanging when apparently I was suitable for the position + not having the decency to give some feedback at the end of the process, I wanted to get people's opinion on how normal or absurd this whole thing is.",disguised4lien,1,1.0,0,1711433318,2024-03-26 06:08:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bo0qd0/kept_hanging_after_7_interviews_and_then_ghosted/,3,2024
1bo0b9e,Should I look for other jobs?,"Hello, I (24F) am conflicted on whether I should be looking for other roles. I feel very stuck doing office management/admin. I got into an admin role straight after undergrad because I knew I was going to do a masters so I didn’t want to go into a role that would be hard to leave because I had made a promise to myself to do a masters. 

I’ve recently completed my masters (which I did pretty well in) so I wanted to start looking for jobs outside office management/admin. However, a week ago I started another admin job because I needed the money as the job market isn’t the best right now. I’ve seen a few jobs going that I think I should apply for but I can’t get over this guilty feeling of potentially leaving this new job. It’s a smaller business and everyone is nice enough although I really don’t fit in. The money isn’t the best either so I don’t know why I’m struggling with this guilt to apply for other roles. I have a good amount of transferable skills, 2 degrees from a top university and some relevant experience so I want to put myself out there and find a career that I actually somewhat enjoy but I can’t get over this stupid feeling that I’m doing something wrong. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated (even if it’s harsh advice!)

1bo01xz,Underutilized at State Gov Job and Now my Boss Wants to Meet with Me - is My Anxiety Warranted?,"I finished grad school last May, got my job offer in September, job started in the first week of November. It's in healthcare policy, an area in which I had pretty limited subject matter knowledge, but had developed an interest in around the tail end of my grad program. Turned down a 72k job in contracts work for this position which offered me a starting salary of only 60k. It was less than I was hoping to make, but it was in my interest area, the benefits are great, and I assumed that government employment = job security. 

Turns out they hired me with only a vague sense of what I would be doing. They assured me that for the first several months I would just be getting a grasp of the language and concepts, and that the more substantive work would come later. Up until recently, I've done little more than grunt work and sit in on meetings. My supervisor admitted that they didn't have much for me to do. 

To me this was fine - I've used the extra time to bone up on topics pertaining to my job so that I can better understand the work we're doing and meaningfully contribute. I take thorough meeting notes, and attend any meeting I can. I ask questions often. It's Medicaid policy, so it's dense and complicated. 

Today I was informed that I made an error in our spreadsheet - basically marked about 10 things off as incomplete that were in fact submitted, so some of our grantees were frustrated, saying (correctly) that the documents we were requesting were already submitted. I acknowledged the mistake as soon as it was pointed out, and immediately updated the spreadsheet. I came into this mid-project, so my guess is that I erroneously marked those files as not submitted early on because I wasn't looking for them in the right file folder. I'm not entirely sure.

Shortly before I was informed of my mistake, my boss told me that she would like to meet with me in a couple of days. She didn't elaborate, and because it was over messenger, I couldn't read her tone. I told her sure, happy to talk, but then the anxiety started creeping in - had I made another mistake? Was I forgetting something critical to my work? Did they decide my position isn't necessary and decide to lay me off? Did I do something egregiously fire-able? 

I've always heard that it's hard to be fired from gov jobs, but is that true before your probationary period is over? I have about 1.5k in my bank and 500 in a HYSA, my finances are stable but relatively tight. If I lost my job tomorrow I'd be boned within a month. I just got my first paycheck in December, and am paying my dad back for the financial help he provided in the 6 months between graduation and employment, so I haven't had much time to save. Help?

1bnzwpc,Am I being Naive?,"I currently have an okay job. I wfh 9-5 M-F and I make 80k/year. I used to work for another industry (was being paid 10% more), but work environment was very toxic, so I moved jobs (despite the pay cut). When I was going through the interview process, I kind of didn't know exactly what I was going to do, but it sounded very technical, so I thought ""it must be a good deal)"". Little did I know, it was a support position. When I started the job, I realized what it was exactly, so I just kept going. 4 years in and I hate the job, but I love the people. It's relatively a small tech company, so I was thinking about getting an MBA and  trying a C-position within the same company. With that I can get other responsibilities that don't involve customer facing at all (that's what I hate the most about support). But am I being naive? 
If I want to get a raise and change responsibilities, should I just go somewhere else? 

Also, I have told my manager I would like to move on a different direction within the company, but I only get the other responsibilities but never the pay. I'm literally overworking myself taking all these extra work helping other departments to just receive a pat on the back at the end of the year.

Also, support is such a shit hole. I'm having to really rewrite my resume to showcase my extra work as if they were part of my responsibilities because people aren't just giving $100k/year to support. 

Anyway, I've made ""friends"" in the management circle, and my strategy would be getting the MBA, and market myself up (get one or two mentors from the same circle). Is this a long shot? Should I just leave?

A base salary of $40,000 per year will be provided or the following 3 options  


Compensation Options:

Option 1:   
A flat annual salary of $60,000, no incentives.  


Option 2:

● $75 incentive for each client successfully onboarded (signs contract).  
● A performance bonus will be awarded after signing up 300 clients. And a 2nd one after signing up 500 clients.  
● After onboarding 500 clients, discussions regarding an equity incentive will follow.  


Option 3:   
Equity Bonus Structure with base salary of $40,000:  
● For every 125 clients signing contract, a 0.125% equity stake is awarded.  
● Once you complete 500 signed contracts, a cumulative equity stake of  
0.5% is awarded, with the opportunity to reevaluate the base salary to $60,000 and  
increase the total equity stake to 0.75%.  
● A target of 1,000 signed contracts will lead to equity stake of 1.5%

1bnz9ml,"I hate my job, have a job offer to start at a new place Monday, but I love my supervisor","I work within a University, as a person who focuses on community engagement. Essentially I am a token piece the University parades around, while not really listening to Indigenous communities or having any capacity to develop projects that are community-driven. In fact, my supervisor told me the only job available for me in the future is her job, and she is training me to take over one day soon, when she moves on. She is also a person of color. Not Indigenous, but they treat us like a collection.

I received a job offer at an Indigenous-led public health center that I am currently interning at. I will receive my masters in public health in May, and this place has many opportunities for advancement. I am a published author, and I think this job may open up opportunities to write more. This job also allows for 3 days of remote work, and this would allow me to visit my grandpa more frequently. He is in the later stages of COPD, and I missed a lot of valuable time with him because of work. But the job would come with a $5,000 paycut. I was offered the position on March 11th contingent on me passing a background check, and I accepted. Considering I already intern here, I assumed it would be a quick process. But I have reached out to this place via email twice with no follow up, and my start date is set for April 1st. I didn't tell my current employer, because I didn't receive official word yet. And I am getting concerned they may withdraw the offer. 

Last Friday, my grandpa was in the hospital with significant CO2 buildup. They thought he was going to pass, so I went home Friday, and spent the weekend with him. I figured if I was starting a new job, what did it matter if I were fired? He wasn't doing well, but he improved over the 3 days I was with him, so I came back to work for an event. When my current supervisor saw me she asked how my grandpa was doing, and I broke down a little. I said better, but he's definitely dying.  She then asked, ""Well, what're you doing here?"" She told me family first, and sent me to be with my grandpa.

And now I am not sure if I should leave my current position. I've never had such a caring supervisor, and even if it feels like we're working for some evil system, I feel bad just leaving my supervisor with no one to fill my role. I know I've become pretty important to the program, but I feel like I'm betraying my ethics every day I work here. Also, I am not sure if I still have a job offer at the new place. I've reached out twice since signing the offer with little guidance on the onboarding process, and I feel like a nuisance at this point. Any advice? 

I should also add my current supervisor sent me a job app for the University, where I would advance in grade and take on more responsibility. She said apply as late as possible and say I have my masters so by the time I am interviewed I will have graduated. I am just not so sure I can mentally and physically keep showing up to my current position for that long. I hate the job and the values of the directors we work under.

1bnyvkw,I’m between 2 job offers and only have 24 hours left to decide.,"Hi everyone,

Just a little background about myself. I finished my Bachelor’s degree in May 2022 and finished up my Master’s in Dec 2023. I’ve been actively applying for jobs over the past few months without any luck, but when it rains it pours. Haha. Now, I have 2 job offers and not sure which I should go with. There’s a lot of small details that I’ll leave out to keep this post from being too lengthy, but it’s making it really hard to choose either or. I don’t have many people to discuss this with and only have a day to decide and I’m really at a cross roads.

Job #1
It’s a small development company with about 10-15 employees. Their portfolio is limited to 1 asset (maybe 5 assets). They don’t offer 401K and I have a feeling that their health insurance premium will be somewhat expensive. They say that there is room for growth as the company grows. I’m worried about how the company only has one asset and if they can  afford to keep me if something goes wrong. I can take the train to work so I’d save a lot on commuting to work. Some downsides are that I would work holidays and Saturdays but I get Sunday and a weekday off. Other than that the company seems fine. It seems to be somewhat laid back and flexible because of having 10-15 employees.

Job #2
It’s a more established development company with about 100 employees and well over 100 assets. They have all of your standard benefits and some other cool perks. This job had a lengthy interviewing process. It was about a 4 part process and each part being about an hour to an hour and a half each. There is room for growth but I'm not sure if the role they want me to grow into would be for me. I'd probably try to move laterally into a different dept if I stayed there long-term. I'd be spending more money on the commute because I'd have to take my car there. The management seems to emphasize a great company culture but some management people seemed a little red flag-y to me during the interview. The other people I met with throughout the process were great.

The starting pay for both are exactly the same. Except job #2 has a 6 month performance review for a raise with bonus eligibility.",ewrt13,1,1.0,11,1711426626,2024-03-26 04:17:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bnyvkw/im_between_2_job_offers_and_only_have_24_hours/,3,2024
1bnymt5,What should I do to enter the private jet/yacht sales industry? ,"Hello everyone, I have a longstanding passion for sales and interpersonal interactions. Lately, l've been particularly drawn to pursuing a career in sales within the private jet or yacht industry. While I recognize this ambition may seem ambitious, I find the prospect of overcoming such a challenge deeply invigorating. Unlike the automotive and real estate sectors, which have never captivated me, the luxury market holds a special allure.

I'm seeking guidance on how to transition into the private jet/yacht sales field, despite lacking direct experience in these niches. I'm open to relocating, currently based in Canada.

1bnxt1e,Data Analyst has grown to hate screens.,"29M in Toronto. Looking for people who have made moves from desk jockey jobs in office environments to something more tangible, which doesn't involve screens. There's something about them I've just grown to abhor. My little nightmare rectangle in my pocket and fuckign around online an hour a day is more than enough. 6+ hours at work, sometimes having to do a bulit at home too, it's not for me despite my aptitude for it.

I make 160k CAD + benefits, but even double wouldn't be enough to make me want to do this for another few years, never mind decades. Anything office based, screen heavy is just eroding something inside me. It's deadening and I want out before I'm a middle-aged husk. I feel like Wall-E that needs to protect the little plant inside me while it's still alive 😂

I stripped naked and jerked off at the office yesterday just to bring some danger and fun to proceedings. I think part of me wanted to get caught. Gonna do it again tomorrow.  I have my usual desk and an enclosed office I can go to, so I'm not really risking much.

I've got ample savings and intend to go adventuring across the US for a year, but then what who knows.

I think I want the complete opposite, Nature, outdoors, where life happens. Archeology, digging holes in search of cool shit, cataloguing it, but I know that's a hypercompetitive field full of enthusiasts requiring more school. Maybe an arborist. I'm open to anything.

1bnxhsw,How do I Break Out of Consulting?,"Hi Everyone! I (24F) am a first year Healthcare (Insurance) Consultant and I dread going to work everyday. Now this is my very first job out of grad school so this could be me being dramatic but there have been several things that have happened that have made me want to walk out. 

  
I regularly work 10 hours days without a lunch and spend 23 hours a week on average in meetings. I got reprimanded for multitasking during meetings and now that I have stopped, my days go even later into the nights and I feel like I barely have any time to cook, clean or live outside of work. I found out last week that the rest of my team has had to hire maids and personal shoppers to take care of anything non-work related which just sounds sad, and even more sad that I would do the same if I had them money to spend.

  
On top of this I am getting paid around 75K a year and I know the rest of my team makes significantly more. I feel bad asking for more since I am the ""new grad"" on the team and the other new grad they hired quit after a month and so they keep calling me the ""lucky duckling"" who gets to stay since they will never hire another new grad.

  
I feel undervalued, underpaid, and overworked and I have to get out of doing this. I have started applying for jobs, but I am terrified of experiencing anything similar or even worse. As I said I am a new grad so I'm wondering if this is normal and I just need to learn to accept it or if I can find better.

  
My qualifications are as follows:  
\- 4 years of work experience (Learning & Development Internship, Pharmacovigilance Associate, & Executive Assistant)  
\- 3.95 GPA Bachelor's degree in Health Science (Pre-Med)  
\- 3.92 GPA Master's degree in Health Informatics  
\- Certified Health Education Specialist  
\- Certified MedDRA Coder

  
What jobs do I seem to be qualified for? I have been thinking about trying to break into Pharmaceutical Sales, but want to see if I would even be qualified to do it. I am also thinking about trying to get a higher paid Consulting job but am worried about the work life balance. After covid the Pharmacovigilance jobs dried out so I'm not sure if that works either.

1bnvsc2,Should i leave just because i’m not happy?,"
I have a job and i’ve been with the company for almost 7 years now. They gave me a lot of opportunity to grow in the industry and iam beyond grateful about it. It seems as if all of a sudden I became tired of everything, especially pleasing people. (Iam working in a hotel industry). Because of the amount of work that I have to do and a number of other factors, I feel burnout and unhappy.

Reasons why: 
1.  Schedule time within our department is not fixed, so we often change our shifts, which I find very unhealthy since we do not have a fixed schedule time. My body clock suffers.
2. Spreading toxic positivity. In the beginning, they will encourage you, and then they will give you the burden/responsibility that comes with it. 
3. Lack of recognition and incentives.
4. The company will allow you to work over 10 hours a day and you won't get any appreciation or any small token in return. 
5. They will show support because they need you. 

I honestly want to find a new job. I want to try new things and enter a new field. But how to start again with a new career? This is my first job anyway.

1bnvqg7,Need to choose career path. Whats the best one for me currently?,"Currently: 30 years old, BBA student finishing my degree, no experience. EU country.

I have 3 options that I’m considering currently:

Option 1) I have a passion for product in tech industry so If I can break it from undergrad with a business degree is one of my main options. To eventually make my own startup. Cons: oversaturated industry, lack of technical background. I feel this industry is about contacts and network. Because clearly you can’t compete versus 1000 applicants in this industry.

Option 2) my other fav industry and passion is healthcare and pharma but probably I could need a Master degree or even several to work in this industry without a Pharma/Chem background. I’m interested in the Market Access and HEOR. Just the business side of this industry. To work in at a large pharma company and eventually doing my own boutique/consulting healthcare firm. Cons: lack of life science education (some companies requires) + requires to grad school (M health economics, market access).

Then my other and last Option 3) doing Med School and become Ophtalmologist (or ENT/Derma). Cons: This option will take so long (pre med, med school 6 years), then residency you gets paid at least and I’ll finish in my late 40’s. Expensive option. Puts everything in pause for my entire 30’s.

I'm 33 years old. I have no money and no prospects. Im already a burden to my parents. And I'm frightened.

In all honesty Ive been applying to jobs since January 2023, 1500 applications, a few dozen final interviews, no offer letters.

An amazing company, whose software platform I’ve been using for more than 2.5 years at my current role, has a job posting I know I would excel in. Despite there being hundreds of applicants, I was able to get an interview scheduled after reaching out to a networking contact. The interview was last Tuesday and went really well. As part of the interview, I was asked how much notice I would give my current employer if I was offered the position, as well as how soon I’m looking to leave and how many other places I’ve applied to. Since my current employer is a client of theirs, I wanted to play my cards well and told them since my role is pivotal, I would like to give them four week’s notice, but no less than 3, to allow time to hire and start training my replacement. I also told them that this is the only job I’ve applied for (which is true), since I’m looking to leave for a better fit and have always wanted to work for their company. Since I’m secure in my role, I’m not in a rush to start immediately if they need some time. They were very happy with this answer, and expressed that worked well for them, especially since I’d have at least two more interviews before being offered the position. They told me their staff that has interacted with me over the years have wonderful things to say about me and they’re definitely moving me into the second phase for a second interview, but the manager is on an international vacation and won’t be back for another week, so me not being in a rush aligned with their needs. 

In an unexpected turn of events, on Friday morning I was laid off and told that my entire department was being dissolved due to restructuring. I had emergency surgery a few months back that used up all of my PTO, so I was given a final paycheck for hours worked, and that was it.

Now, I am in a rush. I have no one to fall back on for emergency funds and need to start working ASAP and could use some advice. Do I reach out to my first interviewer to let them know my circumstances have changed? Or, do I wait until they schedule my next interview and address the topic during the interview? If the second is the best path forward, do I just look for gig work in the meantime?  This is the company I want to work for, and I want to make sure I handle this unexpected change in a way that won’t result in me becoming a less viable candidate.

Do you think it'd be worth it? I also want to mention that you have the option to come back to the states if you want at anytime. 

To add more context, you don't have any family or friends that live by, you're currently renting, you're single with no kids and are not happy where you live right now. 

I also want to say I completely understand that being ""unhappy"" where you are isn't always a good reason to move because a lot of times, YOU are the problem not your surroundings. I've given that piece a lot of thought for over a year.

I landed an amazing apprenticeship with a dance company where I understudy the company at rehearsals and performances two days a week, and I love it. However, this apprenticeship is unpaid. I dance for another company but that doesn't pay well (no dance job does tbh, but that's not the point for me). 

I don't mind the low pay because I have a solid job as a Licensed Massage Therapist for a national chain. I'm a very in-demand therapist with a large clientele and a full schedule. I make enough money to pay my bills, put money into my emergency fund and 401k, and travel (something I'm also very passionate about) a few times a year. However, I only work \~20 hours/week as an MT (\~30 hours/week is the max/full time!) due to my dance jobs.

I'm pretty happy right now, but I also wish I could travel more and put myself ahead financially (saving up for a wedding soon and eventually a house). I've debated giving up dancing as a job but keeping it as a hobby while also picking up other hobbies, but I'm scared I'll regret not performing while I'm young.

1bnt4ec,Afraid of taking time off work/looking for a new job for health/stress,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

Apologize ahead of time for the lengthy post. I've basically been working since I was 16 y/o (33M now) and was brought up with the mentality that you need to show your loyalty/that you can hold a job at a company to be an ideal candidate elsewhere (I know this isn't a solid mentality necessarily). I started off out of college in the insurance industry because I had a foot in the door (work comp claims - do not recommend). My tenure at that job was about four and a half years or so and it was honestly the worst working environment I had ever been in. I admittedly began caring less and less until I went on a PIP (was completely my own fault and I knew it was coming because I just couldn't stand being there anymore) and that PIP pushed me to look elsewhere ASAP. I was lucky enough to land a job at an underwriting company immediately which seemed to be a step in a better direction for my degree (BA in Econ) but I had to start back at the bottom and take a large pay cut while working in one of the highest COL cities in the States.   


&#x200B;

Fast forward about 5 years and I have never been more miserable. At both companies, I've moved up the ""corporate ladder"" and have done okay for myself but at the cost of work becoming all I wake up for. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that I've been able to hold jobs and there is one major thing I have stayed at this company for: my boss. I got lucky enough to have the one boss at a very frat boy culture company who is super kind, genuinely cares for others, etc. In short, he has done a lot for me and has cared about my health issues as well. However, the culture of the company (aside from being EXTREMELY frat boy) is that the grind doesn't stop, even if your own life has its struggles. I have been miserable here for a long time and I have been going through some serious medical issues in recent years. On top of that, my mother has recently been fighting cancer while my dad has had early signs of dementia. I've been in and out of doctor's offices a lot recently just for myself, so the added stress of being worried about my parents hasn't helped. 

&#x200B;

I wake up, work, try to relax before bed (all while constantly thinking about work), probably end up working again before bed, wake up and do it again. It's a 40 hr job but I end up being on my PC working weekends as well just from the pressure for underwriters to ""push premium"" aka more sales/more money for the company. On top of this, I'm also one of the few Middle Easterns in the industry that I know of and one of the last non-white underwriters at my company. This is relevant because I've also pigeon-holed myself in this industry to essentially be the punching bag of your generic arab jokes (i.e. a broker met me for the first time and his first words to me were ""Allah-la-la-la-la-la!""). Even executives at my company think it's hilarious to label me as a terrorist and I am partially to blame because I just rolled with it forever because if you don't, you have no sense of humor. These same types of executives have groped female colleagues who have told some of us that they have never bothered reporting it because one of them tried to step forward once and the company simply took their side/ignored the complaints (just giving color as to the people in charge of the company).

&#x200B;

I've more or less let myself become a slave to the systems at this company because I'm afraid of looking for a job when I see how many people struggle to find jobs now. I'm to the point I **desperately** need some time off work for my current health issues and I really want to find a new job as soon as possible. My only concern is that no underwriters seem to take any time off. If you do, you lose premium, management looks down on you, downward spiral from there. If I begin looking for new jobs, I would need to focus far less on my job which again, earn less premium, management looks down on you, etc. I feel stuck in this loop of HAVING to nonstop grind or I will lose my job. It wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't live somewhere so expensive. Moving isn't an option either as I need to be near both my doctors and my parents. I can't really move in with my folks either as the situation with my dad is too sensitive/complex. I do not want to come across as this entitled asshole who has a good situation and just needs to suck it up. I understand I am luckier than others who are in far worse predicaments. I just don't know who to talk to or what to do about my job anymore. I know I could survive for a few months if I just decided to up and quit today (this would be the best feeling ever honestly). I've put out a few applications and I've worked on my resume extensively but it seems like I read about or know so many people who are on the application grind and are struggling. I know I could be unemployed for maybe 3-5 months and be fine - I'm just terrified of staying unemployed in such a high COL city. At the same time, my brain is always telling me I would love a break from working so I can re-prioritize myself and my health while also having some extra time to spend with my folks. Seeking any advice on what a good step forward would be for me given all this context. Much love and I feel for anyone out there struggling to find a job or struggling with their current job.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - Feel stuck working and/or thinking of my job nonstop while having some serious health issues come up. Don't know whether I should just quit, find some way to work myself into the ground by working nonstop while applying nonstop, or just suck it up and continue at this job.",XRoYx,1,1.0,0,1711410475,2024-03-25 23:47:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bnt4ec/afraid_of_taking_time_off_worklooking_for_a_new/,3,2024
1bnt1eo,Transitioning from Mechanical Engineering to Remote Software Development: Seeking Guidance,"
Hello, Reddit community! I graduated with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering in 2023 and am currently working full-time in this field. However, I'm eager to explore remote job opportunities, with a particular interest in software development as it seems more rewarding. I'm aiming to specialize in front-end development.

Here are my main questions:

1. **Learning Coding:** Where can I find free or low-cost resources to learn coding for front-end development? I'm looking for alternatives to formal college education that will prepare me with the right coding language(s).

2. **Building a Portfolio:** What should I include in my portfolio as a beginner software developer? Where should I store my portfolio to showcase my work effectively?

3. **Job Search:** How can I land a job as a new entry-level software developer, especially in a remote setting? What skills and qualities should I emphasize to stand out to potential employers?

Any advice, tips, or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help.",Snaggyburrito,1,1.0,0,1711410266,2024-03-25 23:44:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bnt1eo/transitioning_from_mechanical_engineering_to/,3,2024
1bnstg6,Associate Product Manager (APM) vs Sr. Analyst?,"TLDR: Thinking of asking my HR Team if I can change my title to better fit my role from Sr. Analyst to APMz Am I taking a demotion in title if i do? Does this even matter?/Is it worth it to ask? 

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for someone with experience in product management to hopefully give me some advice since i’m new in the job market (also in Canada).

I got an entry level business job right out of graduation and I have been working as an analyst and was promoted to Sr. Analyst about 6 months ago (in total I have been working at this company for 1.5 years).

I entered into a rotational program, my first rotation was completely analytical, using company data to get performance measures. My two last rotations ended up being working under product managers who are working to develop app features for our company’s app. I am now permanently placed in the product team and no longer rotating (key: My company is not just about product management there are VARIOUS other functions and this is only a smaller subdivision) 

I’ve worked with engineers, designers, project managers and many many external vendors to develop app features, MVPs, etc. I use my skills in performance analytics, writing product stories, roadmapping, journey mapping, briefing, consumer research, etc. on the day to day. 

Because of my company’s promotion structure, the promotion path of people in this rotational program goes: analyst > sr. analyst > manager > sr. manager > director and so on. However, on the product team the titles are slightly different: Associate product manager > Product manager (jr/sr) > Product director.

Because i’m the only person on my team who came from the rotational program, i have a sr.analyst title but i work under a sr. product manager. 

I want to have my title changed to associate product manager because i feel it suits my role way more and it would help in career progression if I was able to better describe the skills I have with my title. 

I do analyze data but for the most part (80%) I do product management. 

My questions are: 

-Would I be asking for too much to get my role changed without a salary increase? 
- Would an APM position actually be considered a “demotion” compared to my current Sr. Analyst title?
- Does this actually not matter in the long run?",Dry_Mouse3568,2,1.0,0,1711409702,2024-03-25 23:35:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bnstg6/associate_product_manager_apm_vs_sr_analyst/,3,2024
1bnsk0u,Ditching teaching—Should I?,"Mom of two young kids. Never really wanted to teach. Fell into it. 7 years now. Have an M.S., not education major. Applied
and accepted another job outside of teaching. Hybrid. Pay isn’t that much better. 

Teaching pros:  love my school work environment and staff, truly a work family. Love my admin mostly. Summer break and thanksgiving, winter, spring break. A minute from my house. Get to be with my kids a lot. Less childcare pay. Off at 3pm if I don’t think about the work I’m not getting done. 
Cons: Hate the day to day grind. No accountability for kids, teach mostly bottom quartile, feel like I’m always behind, can’t get work done within contract hours- impossible, behaviors, not being treated like a professional, parents, feel like I can’t just teach there’s always another flashy strategy the district in pushing, lesson plans, total overstimulation at work, dealing with kids trauma- takes an emotional toll, total apathy with kids. 

New job pros: in my degree, science and field work, work at work and don’t take stuff home, cool boss, quiet to work on my stuff, my own office, hybrid so I can work from home a couple days a week, 20 minute commute, better and cheaper benefits for the whole family save money, more pay. 
Cons- will NEED more childcare till kids are older (early toddler and pre-k aged kids), won’t be home with them early in days and in summers, no summers in Europe to visit family for a while, longer days of work, child care expense may equal out with increase in pay so is it worth it?, have a small house so no dedicated office space in my house.

1bnsgcv,torn between 2 internships. this should be an easy choice because of pay but it isnt.,"this is probably going to get long.

background. i graduated with a bachelors semi related to engineering. i was working for 7 years in my degree field. i hated what i was doing. it was full time desk work. 40 hours a week in a factory behind a desk. going crazy. there was also absolutely no variation in what i did. i was designing the same thing over and over and over again with very little deviation.

i decided to go to real engineering school and am a junior in an abet accredited mechanical engineering program. (though im a junior, i still won't graduate until spring of 2026 so i have 5 more semesters.) i decided to come back so that i could broaden my horizons, try to get a job in some other kind of job field that involved getting away from a desk, whatever form that might take. field work or maybe even sales, idk, just 40 hours a week at a desk doing the same thing over and over is soul crushing.

the counselor at the school im at always sends out the same handful of internship openings every year, there's about 10 or so, all of them are around here (i hate this area and want to leave more than i want anything else in the world) and there are internship fairs that usually have another few opportunities but overall, the choices are pretty limited. so i have been applying to internships on indeed. i live in a small rural area with an engineering school and most of the internships we see are either around here or also in equally crummy rural crappy places to live or with an hour or more commute because there is no housing near the plant or factory (and theyre all plants and factories) 

i have been applying in Chicago, st Louis, cleavland, Louisville, Nashville, Cincinnati, Huntsville, Atlanta... places like that. real cities. for each new city i apply in, i look around on craigslist and facebook marketplace to find rooms for rent in the city and for the most part i am pretty certain i can find a cheap mattress on the floor to rent somewhere. 

so let's get to it, my choices. (caveat: one of these offers is solid, in hand, pretty much a done deal.)

place 1, the pretty much done deal... its a factory engineering department intern position. doing \*some\* of the stuff i was already doing before i decided to come back to school, but also with the opportunity to branch out and do other more paper-y analysis/process type stuff i think. this other stuff is stuff i haven't done before but it's the possibility for more variation in my day to day  (they were kinda vague) it's a factory that makes pretty much the same stuff all the time. the design of the things doesn't change but processes and fixtures and continuing improvement and all that. (again they were sort of vague) it's 25 dollars an hour, free room and board but a 50 minute commute one way and it's smack in the middle of nowhere. after school when i get my real big boy job, i don't want to live in the middle of nowhere. it's the main reason i wanted to come back to school, to be able to find a good enough job that i can live in a city. this is non-negotiable after i graduate. i will not live in the sticks.

place 2, (so before i get ahead of myself, i do want to say that this offer isnt certain at all and i don't know if there will be an offer but lets pretend for the sake of this post that there is an offer.) it's in a city. about 4 and a half hours away from home (this does not bother me at all) it isnt a desk job. i had an initial phone screen last week so they could set up the teams interview. i was excited even when i was just filling out the application. the place sounded really cool. the guy told me i wouldnt be sitting at a desk but that i would be out of the office traveling to jobsites actually getting dirty measuring and analyzing stuff with, like, a team of people. i presume helping with reports and so on as well (again they were a bit vague too) the company is big, they have locations in most major cities around the U.S. so not only does the job already come with away-from-keyboard travel type work but also presumably the possibility of relocation to tons of different places. this is awesome and depending on where i might be in the country, there might be the possibility of doing some actual pretty interesting cool kind of work. BUT it only pays 18 dollars an hour. and i would have to pay rent for 3 months. the commute would only be 20 minutes. i happen to have a family member in that city who will rent me a room for 200 bucks a month which is a pretty fantastically amazing deal but still not free, but still amazing. place 2 seems like the type of place i really really want to work for post graduation just because of the types of stuff they do. it's one of those companies where it's hard to tell what they do just by hearing their name because they do so much stuff.

so... it may sound as easy as ""do what you love, go with the one you think you'd really like with more long term potential"" (again, the offer hasn't been made but we're assuming for the sake of this post that an offer \*may\* me extended.

i need money for school. i have no clue how im going to pay for any of next year. ive been paying out of pocket the whole time since because i already have a bachelors degree, im not eligible for pell grants and i already have a bunch of student loan debt from the first time, i cant take on any more. im working part time to help with tuition but summer internships are how i pay for the bulk of my school. i was only able to pay for the rest of this semester out of my tax return. 

i think i would really really love place 2, it sounds like exactly the kind of thing i was imagining doing when i decided to come back to school. it sounds like a place i can see myself working at and it seems like there are lots of possibilities to maybe move around. but the internship is likely going to leave me short of being able to pay for school next year.

place 1, i think, would be boring, mostly more of the same stuff i was already doing (so why did i even go back to school) with \*possibly\* an avenue to learn how to do a few different and varried types of things both during an internship and full time if they want to hire me after i graduate. but it's in the middle of nowhere. i cant see myself being happy there. but during an internship,i would be able to save much more money to pay for more of my school next year

TLDR:

place 1, boring, not what i want to do, will be a higher paid internship with free room and board in a place i'll hate

place 2, sounds fun, like the type of stuff i dreamed of working on/with when i imagined what a real engineer does for a living. if hired post graduation, ability to relocate to a place worth living in, a real city. (i grew up here in the boonies and i freaking hate it, every bit of it) but it's like 2/3 of the pay for the internship and i don't know how i would pay for school next year.

1bnqwss,Do you think it's possible for me to negotiate some remote/WFH with this work situation?,"basic question: i was hired for a job thats not remote but the department is expanding a great deal so is my best shot at going remote in this department in this company to kick a\*\* & become as valuable as i can to them to negotiate some remote time?

  
for more context ill keep it very brief because i realize this is not a top-tier post, my account is rather new & im not sure ill get much activity on this anyways, so here goes:

  
i started a job where the training for it is about 6 months long, can be done remote about 1/2 the time & after the 6mo it is 100% on-site. the trainer who i meet with 5 days a week and spend about 4hrs with each day, is a pro in the industry & he does training for the new guys. thru meeting w/him, ive realized that even when i get on shift in person, some of the duties could definitely be done remote. i dont want to give away the industry but i work with a lot of EE's & PE's so a bit of it is in the electrical field. 

  
as i said, the department is expanding & they need all the help they can get. yes my position on the company budget is for in-person shift work but (think electrical components go haywire & they need someone on-call to take the report) and initially i asked some of those in the industry (on reddit) & legit all of them said ""this job could never EVER be done remotely blah blah blah"" even though now im finding that most definitely, some of it can be remote

  
question is, with the trainer who's retiring, i cant replace 30yrs of experience he has but i know i can add some value there eventually so, should i try to make myself so damned valuable to the company that they'd consider some remote work for me eventually? or is my better shot to find a job that is already 100% remote? tbh, a full-fledged WFH job would prolly mean i need an EE degree, which i dont at all.

It started when I left school at 16 and pursued an equivalent qualification due to my poor grades. I completed it and then decided I wanted to learn a trade, either plumbing or electrical. At 18, I started working at a warehouse to save up for a car and tools. I worked there until I was 19, then attempted an electrical trade which didn't work out. I lasted a month and experienced many depressive episodes because I had no other career paths and hated the work. Eventually, I was fired for a trivial reason which messed with my head and led to an accident for which I had no insurance, resulting in $15k in repair costs out of my pocket. 

I returned to my old job in the warehouse to pay off debt, but now I feel stuck with no clear goals ahead. I'm working, saving as much as possible, while investing. These may be the darkest times of my life; I feel like I'm wasting my potential at a young age.

I feel scared, lonely, and like a failure. I have older siblings, but they work dead-end jobs and have miserable lives. I hate admitting this because I love them, but I don't want to be 30+ years old, unmarried, and working for nothing.

My hours are super flexible, usually putting in about 3-4 hours of work daily, and there are days I don’t even work. I manage to perform decently, hitting above average when I really put the effort in. There was talk of a promotion a while back, but with new management stepping in, that opportunity vanished, along with any real chance of moving up anytime soon.

The kicker? There's a vibe that my current role might not even exist in the same form a year from now. Despite all this, I’m pretty content. The work-life balance is unbeatable, and financially, I am doing great, earning 6 figures..I’m doing alright without the extra climb up the career ladder.

So, here’s where I’m torn. Given the potential for my role to evolve or dissolve, combined with a stagnant promotion landscape, should I just keep enjoying this sweet setup while it lasts? Or, is there a smarter move to ensure I’m not left in the dust if things shift dramatically?

&#x200B;

I have a remote job.  I make a lot of money.  Benefits are really good.  But I'm not doing shit.  I'm literally bored af.  Normally, I wouldn't complain - most people would not.  But I feel useless as hell and am so not used to this.  I've been with the company for 6 months.  My boss loves me and pretty much leaves me alone.  Crazy that I'm sort of complaining.  But I'm prior military and am bored out of my mind.

In my slow downtimes (90% of my work day), I watch/learn new skills.  I've subscribed to coursera and am almost done with a Cyber certificate.  But not really sure how useful that is.  My field is in Program Management.  Faaark!!!  I know I should be glad, but most days, I just end up cleaning my house.  I watched Avatar on Netflix and finished it in ONE DAY!!!  Geezus.

1bnnu5t,Lost my work ethic and hate myself,"Like many others, I had a job I loved in my early 20s that I probably dedicated too much of myself to. I worked in textbook publishing. Great boss, sort of the father figure I never had. I was the first one in the office and usually the first one out due to efficiency, not for lack of opportunity. 

Two years on the job, I learn my role is being cut from 8 down to 3. Only, the layoffs start top down. So we are forced to wait six months to find out who will be let go and who will have a chance to reinterview for their job. My boss gets more or less the same job back and gets to make the call on who he hires, so he hires me. Added responsibilities and (what then felt like) a good raise. But the whole process of waiting those six months was the most dehumanizing thing I've ever been put through. I felt and feel bad about it, but I really didn't care about my job after that. I still tried, sort of, but I couldn't be bothered to invest emotionally the way I had before. 

About a year later, I get into grad school and my company will pay, planning to use it as an opportunity to move on and get a (mostly) free education. Then the pandemic hits. And I learn how little work I can do to skirt the lines and keep my job, getting another raise while I'm at it. 

My long-term relationship ends about a year into grad school. That was the for the best, but still mentally draining to pick myself back up while juggling career dissatisfaction and a growing belief that this career field I'm getting an advanced degree in isn't for me. I start to use weed, a lot. I meet the LOML, a much more intelligent and career-driven person than I am. As I'm finishing up grad school, I choose to work on a master's project (not required to graduate) that I legitimately enjoy, despite it being too much work. Late 2022, I get the news I'm going to be laid off again - and they will still pay for my grad school. I actually dance in my kitchen I'm so excited. F that company. 

Spend five months in 2023 looking for a job, find something in the same industry but a different niche. I'm surrounded (virtually) by people who are so happy to be here that I'm continuously in awe at how toxic my last situation was. But I feel like I didn't take the initial training seriously enough due to burnout, and now I'm so far behind where I should be - nor do I truly want to be here. I have the skills and experience to do this work - but it is not what I want to do. I will find any excuse during my unmanaged WFH day to get distracted, and I hate it and myself. I used to pride myself on my work ethic, and I don't know what happened to it. I have responsibilities to my partner that I know I can't fulfill if I can't hold a job, but I'm so terrified of wasting my life working in an industry that I'm so burnt out on, even if everyone at this company is happy to be here.

1bnmp9l,Interviewing while employed but Hours cut from Full to Part time should I tell potential employers and How?,"Should I disclose and How?

I (38F) worked as a live in caregiver for 15+ years (15 offically 2-3 prior unofficially) then for an independent living agency for about 10 months until a medical condition caused me to leave. The medical condition has sense been treated surgically and is much improved. In late February I moved to the next town over due to housing availability. Last month I was Hired as full time housekeeping at a nursing home, however there have been some issues with the nurses aides and even my supervisor, but the last straw was the schedule for next month when I'm only down for 11 days work at 7.5hrs a day for the entire month as they have hired another employee set to begin April 1, Also they know I carpool with another employee on weekends and have ensured we do not work the same weekends any longer. A week ago I got a voice mail as it was during work hours from an Assisted living facility to call for an Interview as an Assisted living aide I looked at their add and the pay rate listed is $2-4 an hour more than I'm making now and more in line with my experience. I'm also having issues with the housekeeping chemicals aggravating my asthma. I applied to this facility before I was hired by the current company I work for so do I disclose? I was out of work for 10 months prior to my current position because of the medical Condition and surgery recovery as well as the move.

I also have an interview at a local bank where I applied after getting next months schedule how do I tell them I'm leaving due to reduced hours, my health and conflict with the nursing staff?

Edit: the independent living agency would gladly hire me back but my vehicle died in the last few months and I cannot work for them with out transportation.

1bnly6u,Consultant exit strategy - Tedious client hiring process ,"

Hi everyone, 

I am working for some consulting firm for an insurance company as a project manager position in Europe(senior soon at my consulting company). I have been working for my client for almost 2y. And they still keep promising me to hire me since september 2023. Always telling me That I am working so well and so on. 

However when i asked them why It took so long they said there was a a clause in the contract that prevented them from hiring me.  

But also that they had budget constraints. 

But at the same time they also made some offer for a consultant from my team in the past few months. So they are kind of bs me

However i know they will have big problems if i leave since i have become an expert on a lot of topics and It would be sooo much time consulting for them to find someone else and learn / understand the technical environment / projects. 

=> How to put pressure on them ? Should I discuss with my consulting company that l want to leave. Should I find an offer some where else ? This next step would be a crucial salary upgrade i dont wanna miss. 
Should I quit to put pressure ? 

Any feedback would be very much appreciated 😁 thanks !

1bnk0os,Need advice - sexual harassment in workplace,"Hi everyone

I recently put my notice in my job (service industry) due to the manager of the company sexually harassing me. 

I made the owners aware last fall of the first incident (inappropriate touching) what was going on, and it temporarily got better. 

This past weekend I was working with him, and he somehow found a way to wrap his hands around my neck, kiss my head, and kiss my neck. 

In all of these situations, I froze up and was not able to stand up for myself or tell him off. (I get so mad at myself for not being able to defend myself but my body just doesn’t react how I want it to)

I put my notice in the next day, and again informed the owner of what was going on. I have no faith that anything will be done since the owner is an older man himself, and didn’t take my report seriously enough the first time. 

Is this something I should report to a sexual harassment hotline? 
Is it worth reporting? 
What would an investigation look like? Would it bring me more problems than relief? 

I have no idea what to do, and honestly would rather let it go but I don’t want another young woman to encounter this and let this manager continue to get away with it. But again, I was told this would happen in the service industry so I just feel stupid. 

I would appreciate any advice here! 
Thank you

1bni9zm,Attempted to find a new career and start over and I failed. Now what? ,"I work as an audiologist in the medical field. Ever since the beginning of my career, actually even throughout grad school, I never felt right about it. It wasn’t something I had ever shown interest in but I needed to do something and choose a career instead of spinning my wheels for years. I’ve been in this field for over a decade now. I have been so unfulfilled and unhappy and always fantasized about leaving audiology and doing other things. The problem was I never knew what else I wanted to pursue. I switched jobs several times hoping I could make it work. I hated each new job more than the last and long story short my mental health fell in really bad shape. I finally decided to seriously pursue other options and look into several other fields. I saved up and quit my job last year so I could focus on it full time and get some clarity. I researched heavily, took courses, spoke with people in other fields, started seeing a career counselor. I’ve taken endless amounts of personality quizzes, career tests, all kinds of assessments. After all that I still haven’t found anything else I can do. Now I have decided to go back to practicing audiology again because nothing else panned out. I can’t explain how much I feel like a total failure. I feel like a jackass now for even trying. I am very grateful that I have an actual career and degree to fall back on and I could take that time. But I was really hoping for this career change or in the least a rare niche job in audiology I felt I could stand, and now going right back to where I was just feels so unsettling. I’m afraid that in no time my mental health will slip again. In the time off I had where I could tell myself I may not have to be an audiologist anymore I felt more like myself than I have in a long time. I guess this is a bit of a rant and vent on my part. I’m just not sure what to do now.

My coworker is literally abusing the kids and has been for years. Keep in mind that I work in the age group of (1). Friday she locked a kid in our bathroom in the DARK for misbehaving. She's pushed a kid for pushing, yanked kids, called a brown kid the nword with the hard r,(my sister experienced this years ago not me so it wasnt reported) pushed down on a kids teeth, pushed a kids forehead with her finger, etc. I have told my boss. She's not fired. Her other coworkers know, and didn't say anything because she's somehow mentally challenged. She's sneaky tho. She knows what she's doing is wrong and is secretive and will be on the lookout. She's dangerous and even tho I have mentioned those things to my boss, the Incidents, she hasn't been fired. Probably because I haven't been there as long and her coworkers don't report her. It pisses me off. These kids are in danger. Sometimes I'll see her looking up from behind the changing table where the timeout is and I'm scared. I don't know what she's doing there. I hate that they aren't doing anything. They say ""they'll keep watch"" but they can't and won't. Every teacher is trapped in their own rooms that's how a daycare works. There isn't a hall monitor.

1bnhd3u,Career in design or food / nutrition? Or both?,"Hey everyone! I'm feeling a bit lost in my career path and would really value some objective perspectives. I'm a woman in my late 20s living in a city in the Midwest.

After high school, I delved into graphic design and started my own business specializing in branding for small to medium-sized businesses. However, with the rise of Canva and AI, I'm noticing a decline in demand for graphic design services. While I still find some enjoyment in it some of the time, my passion is dwindling alongside the demand.

On the other hand, I have an insatiable passion for food and nutrition. I'm constantly researching ingredients and their health benefits, and I recently completed a nutrition course and became a certified coach. Experimenting with cooking, and cooking nutritious meals brings me so much joy, although I lack formal culinary training or experience in a professional kitchen environment.

I've been brainstorming ways to merge my passions, such as pivoting my design career towards the food and nutrition industry, starting a blog (though I'm aware it could take years to gain traction), or collaborating on cookbooks with chefs and smaller restaurants in designing them or even perhaps assisting with recipe development / lending a hand. Or of course, just focusing on one thing. I just can’t decide which one or what titles to be searching for. My husband is incredibly supportive and prioritizes my happiness over high-paying jobs.

I'd truly appreciate any advice or perspectives on this journey. I feel very torn and unsure of where to even start looking!

Hi all. 

A little background about me first. I’ve graduated with a degree in Psychology and WGST as well as a minor in communications, with a desire to go into something like HR or Diversity and Equity. However I am not looking to enter into my field unless I start working on my degree. 

So for now, my goal is to save money and move out within a year or so, as well as save money for a surgery I need and for getting a masters degree. That puts me around 3-4 years. So I stumbled upon insurance and decided that I would like to obtain a license. Problem is, I don’t know which license would be best for my goals. 

Do I obtain a Life and Health insurance license, or a Property and Casualty license? I’d prefer to work flexible hours within my first year but I know that depends on the company. Based on your experiences and what I’ve shared, which do you think is more suitable for me?

1bncbpo,Was just promoted. My current manager is not great and I will need to leave. But when?,"Manager came in a few months ago. I’m almost positive he had nothing to do with my promotion. But as we were waiting to fill her role, I was asked by my senior director (who worked closely with my manager that left, and worked with our team during transitions) what my goals were in the coming year (2024). I expressed I wanted to make senior and was willing to put in the work where leadership felt it wasn’t quite senior level-ready. Well, time went by, I worked and was granted this promotion. It’s standard in my company to announce the promotion before it happens- my announcement went out 3 wks after i had been made senior. Not to mention it was so, so basic. Insult to injury, I guess.

New manager is terribly insecure and even worse, a micromanager that claims that is not the case. But even this early on, has her eyes set on Director. Asks for feedback but when I or anyone gives it, she shuts it down. I pitched a great idea at one of our meetings, and it was shut down without reason. The next day she has an idea that is awfully similar to what i’d proposed, withe some minor tweaks. 

I’m starting to go mute. I have to think twice about what I say. I don’t like this. I enjoy being collaborative and a problem solver. I’ve been at this company for 6 years, through different roles, and i’ve never had management like this.

1bnbit7,Honest advice? ,"

Hi Team. 24M seeking career advice. 

Here’s the situation, upon finishing school I did the expected thing and jumped head first into a university degree, specifically getting a bachelors in law as well as business majoring in accounting. 

Throughout University I worked a number of casual jobs and had a paid internship at a law firm in the holidays. 

Upon graduating, I accepted a full time position at said law firm. I was exposed to a number of fields including criminal, commercial, family and property. I specifically enjoyed solving problems with a tangible outcome. 

Throughout my first year post graduation, I became surprised at the “low” level of pay the majority of lawyers (excluding big law) receive considering the hours and dedication. For example, my salary was sub 60k, and my peers  were between 60 - 100k, the upper end consisting of lawyers with 10 years post admission experience. 

At the time, I wanted to set myself up financially and decided to leave the role, in pursuit of a higher paying job. I ended up taking a job as a heavy machine operator in a coal mine, with triple the salary. Please understand this is not gloating, I’m merely setting the scene. I’ve invested my money and bought a house within 2 years, this would not have been achievable in my previous role. 

Whilst I enjoy the work and it’s accompanying perks. I worry that there is no set career path for me, There seems to be a significant divide between management and ground staff within mining and I worry that there is little upward mobility in terms of career path for me.

I seek a career with a clear path and ability for progression. However, I do not wish to practice as a lawyer. I’ve considered obtaining a certificate or other certification in project management, as mentioned previously I enjoy working with people and solving complex tasks with tangible outcomes hence PM is of interest to me and seems to offer excellent career progression not to mention great remuneration.

Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation to me? How did you and what skills did you use or attain to market yourself to another audience? Are there any other career areas I should consider? 

I’m not deadset on the above and open to suggestions or advice

1bnamdd,What should I do with my career? pls help,"Hi, thank you for deciding to read this.
I'm an 18 year old male med student in a middle eastern country (our med school start after high school, but first you have to be one of the top 1 or 2 percent in the national exam, which i studied very hard for in my 3 years of high school), been going to med school for 7 months in my home city, chose this course because it looked like the best option for my career and chose my home city so that i could keep living with my family and won't need to go to a dormitory in a faraway place.
As things stand now, i will have to study medicine for 7 years, meaning when i graduate, i will be 25. In my country medschool graduates need to work 2 years for the country with low pay in rural areas, and after that they can work as a gp (general practitioner) which is still, low paying. 

We can sign up for residencies, but first we have to give an extremely difficult exam which requires years of study, all so we can be specialists and get a higher pay. Residents here are generally extremely overworked and underpaid, having to work 100 hours a week without holidays and getting a pay, unbelievably so, equal to that of an office worker who works 40 hours a week and has a two day weekend to rest and spend time with family. As one can expect, suicide among some residents isn't unheard of.

And so i can't see myself going through residency. I will most likely end up being a gp.
The gp market is kinda saturated and considering the upcoming 60 percent increase in medical school admissions, I will most likely end up working in faraway rural areas, away from my family and social group.
I don't even want to talk about Ai, I know it won't replace doctors but it will make their work more efficient, meaning a doctor can do more. It's not hard to see that leading to a decreased need for doctors and especially for gps.

Currently about 10 thousand gps in my country are not practicing medicine and have been seeking other careers. Many gps are thinking about immigration.

Immigration is an option I'm not very interested in and considering my country's literary worthless currency, I will end up selling all my assets to get a chance at it and even if I go through all the exams and get accepted, I will end up working in an unfamiliar country, far away from family and friends and likely be subjected to discrimination, all so I can have a higher pay.

A good work life balance in my life is one of my dreams and I can't see myself living as a doctor who works 60 hours or more a week with barely enough free time to enjoy his hobbies.

I'm someone who gets attached to spaces he lives in, like a cat. I get stress out thinking about having to live outside my city in other countries or rural areas and such.

I get that I'm thinking too much about an uncertain future, but I can't help but do so when all the odds are against the kind of life I want to live.
What kind of life do i want to live? I want to live in my city, with family and friends. I'm not obsessed about money and as long as I can sustain myself and live a decent life with a job that has a good work life balance, have the opportunity to spend time on my hobbies such as reading books and light novels and manga and etc, I will be satisfied and happy.

I've been depressed thinking about having to study and work hard for years, all so that I'll end up having none of which I mentioned above. I came first in my class during the first term of medschool, but since starting the second term and learning about the kind of life that awaits me, I have barely been able to take look at my books. I'm currently worried sick and have insomnia thinking about the future I don't want.

So what to do? I may have a second option.

But first let me thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading so far. It's the first time I've decided to talk/write about my worries about my (highly sought after) career.

I don't know why people still want to enter medschool, but I think it's about the media constantly feeding this information to teenagers and their parents that once someone is accepted to medschool, they have nothing else to worry about and that they will live the dream life with an extremely high paying and high prestige job.

But about that second option, i have a big brother about the age of 30 and he has an advertising company that is doing well and has lots of customers. I helped him around for 2 months as a summer job once. They do different marketing and advertising jobs for different companies. Lately I have heard him saying that he didn't have enough trustable and competent workers and he once asked my retired father to help him as a sort of manager to lead others with some specific jobs. He sometimes gets extremely busy with his work because he is the only one in his company that can do some certain jobs, like installing advertisement banners and Bus wraps and etc.
So one option is leaving medschool and going to his company to work and learn stuff and improve myself.

I know some people who have left medschool to pursue other careers. Hell, my barber is one of them.

I'm afraid of leaving medschool because of how my parents will react. They believe I'm pursuing a very rewarding career which is many people's dream and that i have a very bright future in this line and such. I can't even think about how doing this may make them disappointed and sad. They were really happy for me and it hurts my heart thinking about making them sad by leaving medschool, but I dont want to live a future in which I feel miserable for continuing this career.
Also there is the debt I will have to pay for leaving, which is a lot, but still manageable.
If i continue medschool for another year, I will lose the option to quit because of the increased amount of debt there will be.
I can pay one forth of it with the money I have and will have to ask for my parents' help to pay the rest, which sound like a nightmare. I can supposedly work in my brother's company and eventually return the money to my parents. 
Speaking to my parents about this and quitting and having to pay the money is frightening to me but having to force myself to live an unwanted future seems even more terrifying.

1bn9hlf,Is it worth going to a job in another country in hopes of moving to a better one later?,"Hi guys, I, 30 software developer, was born in a backward country. My family wasn't poor but isn't rich either. The people of my country are unkind to the likes of me (queer). So my dream has always been to move to Europe, which is more tolerant of people like me.

I have recently received an offer for a job in Malaysia and they will help me relocate as well. There aren't many relative financial benefits to my current job, although Malaysia is far more economically stable than my country. However, they are intolerant of people like me too.

I'm planning to take the offer and move to Malaysia. My impression is that it would be easier for me to move to Europe from there.

However, everyone I have talked to has told me that they think I'm doing something unnecessary. They say I can go directly to Europe. 

It's not like I haven't tried. I don't have the finances to go there without support. And no company seems to be willing to take me. Although I might indeed get an opportunity if I keep trying, is it a reason to let go of this opportunity?

1bn8xp9,Is Internal Mobility without changes in contract or salary considered as Promotion?,"Hey, Reddit! I've noticed a trend where companies flex the number of ""promotions"" they've given out over the last year. Though, many of these so-called promotions involve transferring employees between different teams without any changes to their contract, salary, or work hours.  
  
Take Customer Support roles, for instance. Imagine a representative who deals with account-related issues - things like password changes, managing various two-factor authentications, handling account recovery cases, etc. Suddenly, there's an opportunity in another team, say the billing team, which needs an extra hand and they start a so called ""promotion"" opportunity where existing Customer Support Representatives from other teams can appy. This transfer is then labeled as a ""promotion.""  
  
From where I stand, these moves don't quite fit the traditional definition of a promotion since there's no alteration in contract terms, salary, or even job title (you remain a Customer Support Representative still). It seems more akin to internal mobility, doesn't it? Yet, these transitions are often hailed as significant career steps. This situation raises me the question: What really counts as a promotion? Would you consider such transfer as a promotion?  
   
I'm would really love to hear your take on this. Should internal mobility be regarded on the same level as genuine promotions, where there's an actual change in role, salary, and contract terms? Is this approach a healthy way to foster career development, or is it merely a means for companies to showcase their commitment to employee growth without the commitment to matching rewards?

1bn89ks,Apply for internal role or not?,"Hi everyone, I am considering applying for an internal role but am not sure it is a good idea.

I am currently working for a UK employer for a role that has no progression (my collegues have been in their roles 3-5 years and have never been promoted due to the way the team is set up). Salaries are also incredibly low and pay rises are currently suspended. In the future, they will be exclusively attached to performance (the KPIS that have been set up are however not achievable). 

Last week, a collegue from another team suggested to apply to a role in her team. This role would allow me to progress after a while and it would also be a bit more money compared to my current salary. I had a look online and saw that with this role I could also in the future apply to a lot of other companies and a lot of these job are well paid and remote (I had to move to Scotland as my partner got a good job there but unfirtunately, there is nothing in my field here. I did get other job offers, but it was all for roles in London that would have required me to come to the office once or twice a week).

So I currently feel really stuck in my work situation and there is no way I could improve it due to the location.

Whilst it seems like a good idea to apply for the internal role mentioned above, my partner mentioned a few cons yesterday:

1) I have been only for 9 months with the current employer (contract says that I can apply to other internal roles after 6 months, but still)

2) I would have to ask my boss for permission to aplly to that new role and he might say no (this is not unlikely as I found out that it took them ages to recruit me for the role I am in now and due to the low salary I would be hard to replace).

On top of that, there's also the chance that I might not get the role (assuming my boss would allow me to apply) and I worry now that either way this would impact my relationship to my boss as he might think I am at flight risk and then this might totally limit my option to progress in the team (should that option ever come).

&#x200B;

So I would appreciate some advice on what to do now, and has anyone ever dealt with a similar situation? Thanks!

1bn80w5,Thoughts on Quitting,"Hey there everyone, I'm in need of some advice, opinions, words of wisdom and whatever else may apply 😅
Well, let me start off by saying that I recently started working as a teacher* but I have been doing plenty of things that are not expected of a teacher (e.g.: staying at lunch and helping to feed kids) because my bosses kind of force us (they give us ""warnings"", if we get 3 of these we're out) to do such things (among other things)... Also, we don't have any recess (it's not a school) and so we don't have time (and aren't allowed to eat inside the classroom) to eat anything other than lunch during our 9h shift (but kids have their lunch and snack time normally) and we can't leave our class unattended, so we can't go to the bathroom either, unless another teacher watches our classroom and theirs at the same time.
It has been a very stressful job for many reasons that I'm not going to write down in this post and I've had to start on meds because I have panic attacks everyday before going to work, sometimes also having them while working...

The thing is... I worked so hard to get this job that I feel like a failure for wanting to quit and work somewhere else

TL;DR: worked hard to get job and it's not what I expected (overworking, can't eat or go to the bathroom, no recess), even had to start taking meds because I have panic attacks before going to work and sometimes also while working.

The job I currently have is quite client relationship based in healthcare  and I question whether I am cut out for this work. I like helping people that’s why I chose healthcare but the fact that my boss is doubting my abilities is making me feel incompetent. 

I feel like I’m going to get fired and am so easily replaceable since I don’t rlly have much strong skills. It makes me feel very unstable in my career like I’m going to get laid off very soon, then I don’t know what other jobs to apply too. 

I’m questioning should I just apply for research or policy roles that are more introverted? I have no experience tho and that’s the problem. I feel so lost and stuck in my career. Like my introverted personality stops me like I should be more loud even though I’m just a quiet person. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

1bn6nsh,Need Help Deciding Internship,"So I'm almost done my Digital Design diploma, finishing it off with a practicum. The decision to choose what kind of internship I desire is up to me and which company. Currently I have two options and conducted both interviews already with paperwork in the meantime:  
1. A Start-up App:   
\- Looks and sounds legit  
\- I would be strictly working in figma, most likely.  
\- Definitely more UX UI orientated, wireframes, user flows, prototyping, etc  
\- Only one designer to guide me through the next 8 weeks  
\- This designer is not super experienced, maybe 3 years total. but her work like hi-fis and prototypes looked really clean and professional   
\- My work would probably be cleaning up the hi-fi and maybe producing my own iterations  
\- Most likely wont be able to use my whole arsenal of skills like, illustrator, indesign, photoshop. Learned a lot of skills in my program: Digital design, Marketing, and coding. (front-end)  
\- Unpaid, Small bonus at end  
2. CHLAVM, A Virtual Museum:   
\- Funded by the government I think  
\- Not 100% sure how I will be working in vr but she seemed confident in guiding me with new ways to work in vr  
\- Less UI / UX, more use of my other skills like adobe suite and possibly new programs they are willing to teach me like blender and other software that integrate with vr. (Maybe user flows)  
\- A plethora of different teams to work with. I could definitely learn more different skills here. Lots of experienced artists, designers, and coders.   
\- My work will be creating the visual aspects of the vr domes, I think more art directed but im not sure, it was hard to grasp what i was going to be doing exactly.  
\- Will probably integrate more adobe applications, less figma (i love figma), and my own creative direction.  
\- Unpaid, no bonus  
Both sound awesome to work with, but can't make up my mind. I've always thought about working with VR as I think its future of UX / UI but at the same time working with apps seem like better experience to gain if I want to find a job sooner. I don't think the startup company will hire me at the end of the internship but not 100% sure, same with the VR Museum

1bn5mpz,"I keep getting stuck in roles I don't like, what should I do?","I have been an IT support technician or some variety of this job for over a decade and I can't break out. I have always up to now enjoyed helping people with technology and solve their issues, but this has not really advanced my career in the way that I thought it would. 

I graduated in 2012 with a bachelors degree in IT from a small county college. I struggled to find a job after college for about a year. Then I got a job at a charity where I was a field technician. I stayed there for 5 years but there was no advancement at that time. I struggled to find a job after this. A lot of my experience was good, but not industry standard. I didn't use most of the business or tech tools that many of my colleagues in IT used on the job. 

Fast forward a few months I got a job at a small business but was fired after not being able to mesh well with the team. I once again struggled to get a job so I had to go back to retail, and then a sales job in technology. 

Then I got a job at a county jail doing their IT. This was enjoyable and pretty social but again no advancement. I actually applied to this job a a year before and got beaten out by one candidate.  I left that job after 2 years because my skills were again stagnating. 

Now I am a government contractor at the airport here just running scripts to restart software and losing all of my technical support abilities. I'm also not getting along with the supervisor on my shift because we have very different ways of thinking and doing things. 

I think my problems are twofold: 

1. the industry is quickly moving way above my head and I feel like I am and always have struggled to keep up. I feel like I only get hired on less technical teams who need someone urgently and these companies don't have access to the higher level stuff I actually want to do. And I urgently accept because I want the $$$ to live. It takes me at least six months if not longer to get a job offer. 

2. A lot of higher level IT jobs require teamwork and working on complex problems. If you make a tiny mistake the whole company could come to a crash, or a service goes down, it's up to your team to fix it but they won't listen to my ideas because I'm always level 1. Yet it's still a stressful situation to be in just fielding tickets and sending errors up to those actually fixing the issues.  So this makes me feel more like a loser. I've NEVER felt respected in this industry, people barely say thanks after you fix their issues.

I'm pretty tired of trying a bunch of technologies, getting a bunch of ""entry level"" certs, trying to figure out where the market is heading, trying to learn that software on my own. Only to be told in jobs and on job interviews that you aren't good enough. There's loads of people with more experience than you. We just need you in the chair answering phone calls. We don't care that you have a home lab or this cert. Don't rock the boat and do it our way. 

I still like technology, thought about other things I can do with technology but that seems to even be more work/studies like going back to school for a master degree or equivalent self study sessions.

1bn5f59,is it stupid to want to switch from an office job to retail or waitress?,"TLDR at the bottom.

I work an office job 8:30 - 5:00, and while there are (a few) benefits about my current job, there are so many negatives. 

1 the shitty PTO. I get 38 hours a year and it accumulates. most of that just goes to doctor appointments since they’re only open during hours I work. if I get sick enough to not come in or want to travel, I will have to take those days unpaid

2 I’m kind of on call 24/7 and am expected to follow up with clients when meetings take place after hours and on weekends to make sure everything is going smoothly. I also have to deal with after hour emergencies. I usually end up working extra 3-4 days a week and sometimes this dictates my sleep schedule (I’m a natural night owl but sometimes this makes me have to wake up early on weekends, so I’m chronically tired)

3 zero benefits besides the PTO mentioned in point 1

the first 3 points are kind of me being picky, but these last 2 are dealbreakers

4 I’m not going to lie, it’s a bit sus some of the things they’re asking me to do. I am not confrontational by any means and am a people pleaser, but some of this stuff was past my limit and I had to say no because I wasn’t comfortable and didn’t feel it was ethical to do what they were asking. and no there is no HR to report this to - this company has 4 employees and 2 are the owners 

5 the stress is causes me. I have imposter syndrome and constantly think about how I am such a horrible employee and every little mistake I make, I anticipate being fired. I dread going to work and often hallucinate my work phone ringing during off hours (and also obsessively check it for missed calls). I wake up in the middle of the night stressed that maybe I forgot to do something or made a mistake at work. I just feel like I’m always at work and even when I leave, I’m just anticipating something work related to come up or needing to check in with clients. it feels like I never get a break and I’m just very anxious but also generally unmotivated about life since doing what I do now just causes me stress and a general feeling of dullness. obviously, some of this is just me and will follow me at any job, but I’m like, “is it worth it to stress this much to make a little more than minimum wage?” (under the liveable wage for my area too). I’m starting therapy next week but it is expensive so I need more money but with the hours I have to work and the unpredictability of it, it feels impossible to get a second job.

the pay I get now is $4 more than minimum wage in my city I live in (if I assume 40 hours a week and convert my salary to hourly), so if I looked around, I’m sure I could find something that paid similar (especially if it involved tips). I’ve worked 3 different customer service jobs in the past and have about 2 years of experience.

I’m also considering something in mail sorting and delivery since that was my job during college. also, I intend for this job to just be temporary until I figure out what I want to do next (this includes relocating). regardless of if I quit this job soon or not, I’ll be quitting by the end of the year as I plan to move across the country.

TLDR: my current office job has zero benefits and I am on call 24/7 and caused me an immense amount of stress. I don’t get paid a liveable wage and since I’m always doing work outside of work, I can’t really get a second job. I’ll be quitting this job regardless at the end of the year to relocate.",tears_of_an_angel_,5,1.0,9,1711342157,2024-03-25 04:49:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bn5f59/is_it_stupid_to_want_to_switch_from_an_office_job/,3,2024

1bn4y3g,Really lost and need help,"Hi I made this account to make this post because I’m really lost and need some advice I’ll start with that I’m a 21 year old guy who was never really a school person so once I graduated high school I just got a job and for the past three years I’ve just been working as a cashier at a local store while living with my mother who is very supportive of me. Lately I’ve been really stressed and depressed and scared honestly about my future. Obviously my job is not going anywhere and I could never live off of it, it’s  just something to do with my time and make some money while I figure my life out. As far as careers go I’ve never really had anything that’s stood out to me as something I’ve wanted to do and to be honest I don't really care what I do I just want to be able to live and be able to afford the basics like rent for an apartment and food. So basically what I’m asking and I want to know is if there are any career paths I can go down or look into with  the skills I’ve gained from my current job mainly being customer service and money handling, or what are if there are any jobs that require no degree and will train people without experience for said job upon being hired. And before you reply while I'm in good physical shape the military is not something I'm interested in. Thank you for any advice or responses in advance.

1bn3gtq,How can i leverage experience in a niche industry to get access to positions that can broaden my experience in my field?,"

I am a recent graduate with a B.S in biology. I have 2+ years experience in cannabis research/cultivation and have attended rigorous training programs/ conferences in geoscience and cannabis research. I have a passion for learning and personal development and desire to explore other opportunities in the plant sciences/ biotech spaces. 

I of course have been applying and hardly hearing anything back from companies or internships. I currently work for a cannabis startup and don’t see much room for growth nor a space where I can make a contribution to the company.

It’s getting to a point where I feel I might need to start making a portfolio to highlights skills for positions I have been applying for.

1bn3aaj,A career for assertive extroverts that need to work with people e.g. public defender,"How can I work as a public defender or another career where I connect with humans?

I will choose a career that values my enthusiasm for speaking to people and working in a team, as I prioritize interpersonal collaboration over technical skills. 

  
For example, public defenders engage with clients, district attorneys, judges, clerks, and so on. 

Before the economic challenges posed by the housing and mortgage crisis, I gained admission to New York State Bar and represent clients in NYC housing matters. However, the crisis disrupted typical recruitment for entry-level positions that had benefits, a consistent income, and paid enough to cover my studio loans.  


Plan A - Find the few law firms or non-profits and that hire entry-level attorneys with admitted to the bar over 10 years ago.

Do you know of any of these organizations?

Plan B - Do What You Are by Paul and Barbara Tieger exercises suggests that as an ENTJ, I should find a career for assertive extroverts who thrive on challenges and excel at organizing and motivating others towards achieving goals.

1bn1m5f,Should I stay at my job or am I stupid to even second guess RUNNING away?,"Hey you guys,

writing from a throw-away for obvious reasons. I am thinking about quitting my job to take another offer and would like to ask for your POV on whether I should go for it or not. My circle of friends and my colleagues at work all have different views; each of them being somewhat biased due to the stories I shared or by first-hand experience. So please let me elaborate on my situation and buckle up guys, this one is WILD - am I a victim of Stockholm's syndrome and should run as fast as I can?

**My current job**

Currently, I am working in a boutique M&A consultancy in the Netherlands. I have started as an intern and have already been promoted twice to Consultant. So far so good - but here comes a small excerpt of the experiences that brought me to my current situation. I am quite emotional as I am writing this, so please forgive me if some things seem incoherent - I am happy to elaborate if needed.

* As the previous team that I got to know during my internship churned out, I was given responsibility for projects early on. Of course, that was super challenging, but in the end, it was a good learning experience. Unfortunately, I had to learn a lot of things the hard way and teach myself, which is why things crept in that I do because I don't know any better. However, all projects have gone extremely well so far and have been praised effusively by customers. In the end, I still felt overwhelmed, but I thought that was just part of the deal.
* After managing several projects and having an excellent track record, I asked for a promotion. For this, I needed two referrals, which I was promised by the two newly hired managers I worked with the most. I was completely shocked that, in retrospect, they conspired to deliberately rate me lower. They both admitted this and after much discussion and sleepless nights, I finally got what I wanted. From then on, I was constantly criticized on a level that I had never experienced. They emphasized at every opportunity how incompetent I was, but I continued to be given project leads and successfully completed them, and in some cases even won new customers.
* Suddenly one of the managers started badmouthing me (and other colleagues) to other colleagues and telling untruths. He went to people and spread lies about things I was supposed to have said - which has really affected some relationships that I, fortunately, was able to save. In the end, he had to leave the company, but we were still shocked and especially I felt some kind of resentment towards the company but did not want to give up everything I had worked so hard for for so long.
* The manager who stayed has developed into a real micromanager. The projects had to run exactly as he wanted them to, although the previous approach was absolutely unproblematic and appreciated in advance. Some things also made sense and were implemented directly by me, but for other things the manager was unable to provide a clear rationale, but rather referred to good ol' faithful ""because I say so, because I have more experience than you"". Meanwhile, whenever something went frong when I implemented his suggestions, he got a curious case of amnesia and threw me under the bus.
* In the meantime, many new colleagues were hired and many of them were promoted before me despite poorer annual evaluations (and despite me onboarding them). Although I achieved all the KPIs, when I asked what else I could do, I was told ""nothing"". Almost the entire company had already noticed the unfairness and tried to comfort me that my time would come. So I spoke to the HR team and shared my displeasure, just asking for an explanation - something they could not provide. In retrospect, that was a huge mistake. I suddenly had a conversation with the management and the HR team, where I was told about the company culture and that my ""resentment"" didn't fit in. After all, it's their decision who they promote and sometimes you have to let go of long-standing employees. Shortly after, I had my annual review where I was showered with praise and ultimately promoted ""because I more than earned it and am an integral part of the team"". It still had an aftertaste.
* Now, I am still constantly criticized, compared with other people, and simply not respected. The management is constantly trying to pass on their mistakes to me and any form of communication is ""gratefully accepted"" but ultimately not implemented. In my regular coordination meetings, I made dozens of suggestions on how we could work together better, but improvements were only marginal.

**So here's the issue:**

I really really really like the rest of my team, the projects I work on, the working hours, and pay, but I feel like I am mistreated and not respected. That is my first job after uni, so maybe this is just how the cookie crumbles and I need to toughen up? I somehow think that I am branded and that the now dysfunctional working relationship has become quite toxic. I somehow still think about staying at the job and just ignoring the noise to keep the things I really like. Something in me really wants to turn things around and leaving the place feels like a loss. There are 99 reasons to stay, and the mistreatment from management is the only thing speaking against it, although it really affects my self-esteem and happiness.

While I was working at that company, I think I rage-applied approximately 5 times but have always canceled the recruitment processes. Two weeks ago, I just wanted to test my market value and was continuously praised for my competence in job interviews. Of course, I know that this is also part of the hiring strategy, but it felt good to be appreciated. In the end, I received an offer that was around 15k above my current salary but will need more work - that I am not scared of.

**What would you do?**

Sorry for the long block of text.

I know I am the one to decide, but do you also think that I am mistreated, or am I just a special snowflake? Were you in a similar situation once? Please share your thoughts :)

1bn0cey,Should I leave a job I love?,"Should I leave a job I love???

Trying to keep this short and sweet...

A couple years ago I almost left the small NFP I work for as a finance exec for another job, due to feelings of being overworked and concerns about the long-term success of the organization due to the CEO and other managers coasting and lacking strategic direction. There has been slight improvement in this since I came forward resulting in short term happiness since I decided to stick it out at my current job but not enough to alleviate long term concerns.

The industry the NFP I work for is in will be facing many challenges in the next few years and as much as I love the mission and my day to day job and the flexibility, pay and perks, I am concerned that my dream of retiring from the organization either in my financial role or as the next CEO is becoming more unrealistic. 

Another job opportunity has presented itself and the salary is 10k more, better benefits, seemingly more active CEO and team as far as strategic planning and implementation. The job is in another industry that does not do as meaningful work for the community so I know I will be lacking passion there but is still a NFP, which is important to me. I would also receive a large payout for leaving my current job which would help set me up financially for next steps in my personal life that are quickly approaching (marriage and kids). I would acquire new skills and connections so if this job didn't work out, I could more easily find another job in the future. I know I am topped out in my current role and this job offer salary wise is extremely competitive and I won't find many other positions in the small town I live in that could pay similarly in the NFP world.

1bmyy0b,Something seems fishy at my job.,"Hi, I seem to have found myself in a weird situation with work and I'm not sure how to move forward. 

From the start, I found out pretty fast how unprofessional and unethical the place is, but I desperately needed a job. It wasn't until I was tasked with working with financing companies on the companies behalf that red flags started to be raised. It was my job to find out what certain banks would need from us in order to partner with us to offer third party financing to our customers, gather that information, and submit an application and supporting documents to the banks. 

One particular bank asked for information on a bunch of other businesses that were found linked to the address/business owner during their discovery/research, and 2018 tax returns. Relatively standard information when working with reputable financial institutions, I am assuming. However, when I told the manager I needed this information in order to give the bank everything they needed for our application, he got kind of weird and told me to cancel the application with that particular bank. I had been working with them for weeks at that point to get our company signed up with them, and as soon as they asked for those two things, he said to forget it. It was just...odd. 

I started doing homework of my own because I didn't like the way he reacted so strangely to something so simple. I was able to find through public information that the business owner has many active business licenses registered to the office, but there is only one company there. Some were renewed as early as this year, but you can find nothing about any of these companies through web searches, social media, etc. 

The manager (the one who acted all squirrely about the tax returns) also has multiple business licenses in his name that have been active for years, yet there is no information on the company to be found. Public information also led me to discover that the owner and manager where I work are both listed together on 90% of these licenses. 

Is this potentially some kind of fraud? Money laundering? Tax evasion? Is it nothing, and I'm just reading way too far into things? There are a lot of other red flags I've noticed at this company, but this one has seriously stood out to me.

I really don't care what anyone else is doing, not my business, but I don't want any part of someone else's trouble, either.

My pay was crap though, less than £20k a year and I realised nothijg, not even a role change would get me a lay increase and I left for an opening at my current company where I've been since.  
I've been here nearly 2 years now and feel I have had a good run of MIM, and am now thinking about my next step. I'm not fed up of it, I just keep getting this nagging feeling of whether I could be doing more and whether I want to keep doing it forever. I enjoy being in the technical discussions and have my own stuff at home that I dabble in (a micro server which I run a few linux VMs on for streaming / media storage) and recently a few conversations with people encouraging me to go for ops if that's what I wanted. It does interest me, and my company encourages people to move roles, train and offers mentorship programs which I've apparently been put down for. My TL has said he'll support me 100% and thinks I'd be suited for a technical role. A few peers with both technical and non technical background say I have potential and that I would be suited for it.  
I originally wanted to be a tech, but my company fucked me around. When I left the Helpdesk, I was supposed to be stationed with the Platform / Server Build team, but because they needed bodies in Service Management I got left there instead. So MIM was kinda my route back into being a tech.   
Now, most people in my role usually tend to go one of several ways:  
Change / Problem / other areas of Service Management (as per ITIL)  
Client / Account / Service Delivery / Management  
Project Delivery (ie Project Management / Servjce Transition)  
Ops / Team Leadership (my manager has said this is one route I could go if I wanted, as I'd be the next candidate for leading out team when he moves on)  
Of the above, the only two that somewhat appeal to me are Project Delivery or Ops Leadership, both of which I feel require some technical background anyhow.  
I've known two people who have gone from MIM to hard tech roles. One was my.old colleague, who had background as desktop / 3rd line support and service desk > MIM > Solution Architect. The other was a veteran helpdesk guy who went to MIM > helpdesk / 2nd line support TL > technical architect.   
I have a decent salary, and unlike if I was interviewing for another company I have the opportunity to move sidewards while being able to keep my salary / grade and potentially learning for a new role. The way I see it, the worst case scenario is that it doesn't work out, and I go back to being a MIM. If it does work out, then I have multiple options ahead rather than just MIM / Management.  
Am I wrong for wanting to go down this route? Am I wasting my time? In terms of a technical role, I was generally interested in the Infrasttructure / Server Side of things rather than Desktop or Application. At least this way I feel I'm taking advantage of the opportunity to learn while I'm young-ish (late 20s) rather than being pigeon holed 10 years down the line ",TheUrbanisedZombie,1,1.0,0,1711318379,2024-03-24 22:12:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bmx3e7/am_i_wrong_to_want_to_move_internally_from_an_it/,3,2024
1bmvu30,Why Should I Stay In Social Media Management?,"Hello Reddit Readers,

I’m stuck in between a hard place. I’ve been in a creative field for over 10 years! I’m starting to feel burn out by doing the same tasks. What would you do if you were in my shoes? I work and also freelance in the same industry. I sometimes deal with lofty clients. I fear my love for content creation has come to an end. Any thoughts? I think this is one of those jobs where you become an educator or write about it and that’s the point of where I am at. I’ve lost all interest in posting and keeping up with the joneses.

1bmvgtf,"My coworker has been overstepping my boss and mistreating me, should I address it with him?","I, 26F, have a coworker, 27M, who has a higher seniority level and is acting like a toxic boss to me, despite the fact that we both report to the same boss. His behavior is enabled as our actual boss is based in a different country and can’t oversee our day-to-day interactions. This reached its peak in the last two weeks, in the context of a work trip and two new interns joining the team in that time period.

Here’s what he’s done to me in during the work trip:

- He was very strict with the team’s expenses (even though our boss is chill as long as we don’t spend anything crazy), to the point in which he told me to “get off my high horse” in front of others when I suggested we take an uber to the office instead of walking.
- He took a silly joke I made very seriously and humilliated me by making other people join our conversation to share with them what a dumb thing I had just said. I tried to explain that it was a joke but he made it seem like I was lying about it.
- He also made me clean up his coffee cup because he had something important to do and supposedly didn’t have time to do it himself (I know it was dumb to agree to it).

On top of how he treated me on this trip, he’s been overstepping my boss when it comes to the onboarding of our two new interns. We work at a company that’s mostly remote but he’s decided that our interns should work on site at least 3 times a week. He’s implied that the rest of the team should go to the office at least twice a week to keep them company. I really don’t think my boss is aware of this. I’m worried, as I live far from the office and this would really affect me financially. 

What should I do? He has a lot of allies in the office, he’s been there since he was an intern. I can’t declare war on him. 

Should I address the mistreatment with him privately? Should I say something to my boss?

The rest of team are juniors too and would never speak up, I’m worried they’d even tell on me to him if I breached the subject.

Please help!
Emma.

1bmv72a,Infuriated Mechanical Engineer,"I am a recent Graduate from Georgia Tech in mechanical engineering. To be honest, I feel like I was lied to about engineering as a whole. First I was told engineering has great job security as it is in demand and always needed. So why is the pay so low? Why are there so many layoffs at my previous company, including myself? I want to see my return on investment and this career just isn't doing it. The starting salary of $65k is BS - I didn't study communications; we spend numerous nights studying around the clock and stressful days; some of us even feared we wouldn't see our friends the next day (and I'm not referring to just dropping out of school which is 60% of Engineers). My school has such a high reputation, is competitive, and they even close the rooftop study areas before finals due to the effect engineering school has on students. So now I sit here watching all the business majors make 6 figures starting when they actually had a life in college that was healthy. 

I currently cannot find a job after submitting 3k+ apps since October and suffering through school. I have a loan to pay for the next 10 years and I have tried networking with dozens of people and recruiters. I don't understand what the deal is with people ghosting you after they tell you ""I can find you a job,"" or ""send me your resume."" I send follow ups days and weeks later and they never get opened - RUDE. I got my resume polished up by 8 different people; I know the job market is terrible right now but this has been months of searching. Everyone I graduated with found a job within 3 months and they were all engineers. I don't expect to be rich, but I want a nice stable life and to not be struggling. Is there some kind of curse on me? Should I have went into finance so I could actually make real money?

Most of all, is anyone else in the same boat?

1bmv657,Job interview,"So I have a job interview tomorrow at an accounting office. I'm a first year student at uni. And my parents kind of talked me into this job. They're like very very excited, but like the past 3 days I'm just feeling really depressed about it. My parents are a bit controlling in that matter, like with the best intentions. But still. 

Actually this whole year I've been feeling like shit. Last time I was actually happy was last summer, I worked at this small restaurant at a camping on a small island and I also lived there. It was great. And I kind of thinking about doing something like that again, but then like maybe doing something like that abroad. 

The thing is I already know I don't want to take the job, although it may be good for my career. And instead focus on what makes me happy, because I know living the way I live now isn't sustainable for me. But then I still have the job interview. 

So should I go to the interview or just cancel at the last minute. Like I probably want to do something in that direction in the future with my career, but at this very moment I'm just not ready for it yet. So it could be a great practice for future interviews, but on the other hand I also don't want them to offer me a job or waste their time. And an other reason I don't want to go is because it is literally exam week this week, and because I have been feeling stressed and depressed about all this I havent really learned at all, so I really need to learn for my exams or else I am going to fail them.",lilaqcanvas,2,1.0,1,1711313619,2024-03-24 20:53:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bmv657/job_interview/,3,2024

1bmu3rf,Asking for a raise as an intern?,"Hey all! I'm a video production ""intern"" at a mid sized IT company. The reason I put intern in quotes is because I've been working in this role for about a year and a half now and am pretty much treated as a part time employee. My manager and team trusts me and let me handle pretty much any assignment they would handle. I graduate in December, and it seems like a full time role is pretty guaranteed. I currently get paid $25/hr which is what I've been making since I was hired. I feel like it's time to ask for a performance review with my manager and maybe even his manager and lead that convo into a raise request!  
  
I guess my questions are... is that appropriate to ask for, how much should I request, and what do I say? I was thinking a $3 raise (pulling me up to $28/hr) knowing that it may be a bit more than reasonable. About 4 months ago, there were some layoffs due to a industry wide struggle so I am hesitant to ask (especially since I've never had a raise convo before). But I guess my thought it, even at a $3 raise, it's only a matter of $5,000 or so a year for a large company.

1bmsb8j,"How do you deal with people who ""volunteer"" for industry events for career benefits, but act as though they are purely altruistic?","I've had two situations in which people volunteer for industry organizations, clearly for work benefits, but act all holier-than-though, creating the impression that they're doing so only from the goodness of their heart. 

Have you come across these types? How did you deal with them?

\#1: people volunteering for the local Chamber of Commerce.  Of course the sole goal is to make contacts, gain industry knowledge and perhaps win new customers.  However, those people claim that ""we're here only to help others"".  Right...

\#2: a guy who runs a local business accelerator program.  He has his employees fill most of the volunteer slots, and he has his clients be some of the businesses who are helped by the program.  Yet he claims to other volunteers that ""you can't even check email during the program; you need to be totally devoted to this, and if you aren't, you won't be invited back.""  Well, of course, you and your employees can be 100% devoted, but if I am taking time off from work to volunteer for it (also of course in the hope of winning new clients), I will need to be responsive to work needs.

TL; DR: Anyone who volunteers for a business-related or industry event is of course doing it for whatever career benefits may come of it, but volunteers who do so but claim that they are volunteering solely out of altruism are really hypocritical and tiresome.",CraftAccomplished784,1,1.0,4,1711306602,2024-03-24 18:56:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bmsb8j/how_do_you_deal_with_people_who_volunteer_for/,3,2024

I really need some career advice.  Last year I was laid off from Hyland (IT field) and while I took a new job this year, it's become a major source of stress and dissatisfaction.  
  
**The Problem:** My current job in logistics is a terrible fit. It has:  
  
Horrible work-life balance (overtime, nights/weekends)  
High stress and a noisy environment (difficult with hearing loss)  
Low pay and benefits (worse than my previous job)  
Uninteresting work (doesn't utilize my game design skills)  
Toxic work culture (unsupportive colleagues)  
My Goal:  Transition into the gaming industry, where my passion lies (game design degree).  
  
**My Challenge:**  Balancing the need for income with building my game design portfolio.  
  
The Dilemma:  
  
**Stay and Suffer:** Some advise sticking it out for a year to avoid appearing like a job hopper. This allows for income stability but delays my career goals.  
**Quit and Focus:** Others suggest leaving ASAP and dedicating time to my portfolio, but then finances become a concern.  
Additional Factors:  
  
I want to move out of state, but my current job doesn't offer remote work options.  
Limited PTO makes it difficult to visit family (e.g., see my 92-year-old grandmother).  
Questions for the Community:  
  
Given my situation, what's the best approach - stay short-term or prioritize portfolio building?  
Are there ways to improve my portfolio while still employed (e.g., evenings/weekends)?

1bmrlrv,Need Layoff/New Role(s) Advice,"Hi everyone, I could use some advice as I am still new to industry, and I am in a tricky situation with an unstable startup at the moment. Right, so I have been in my lab tech 1 role for 1.5 years post-undergrad at a small startup, and I have learned a lot of new laboratory skills on top of training (eleven people), and additional supplemental research techniques. This is on top of some more basic research work I learned in some summer undergrad stints. I believe I proved myself overtime with my quality of work, and commitment to building a great team. However, unlike everyone else on the original team, I am the only one without a promotion. I believe this was due to a mixture of being so new to the field, getting off on the wrong foot with my boss, and by the time I proved myself, it was well passed two promotional periods and into a layoff one for the entire company. Even so, I have felt the need to grow since noticing an RA opportunity last summer in house which I applied, interviewed for, but did not receive. The director wanted two new team members with more experience. That’s understandable. Eventually, a new director was added to another research team this year who showed better promise. However, our layoff period crept up before any new roles could be considered. So now...I have learned everything as a tech...taken on too much responsibility...cannot get promoted...and until the company goes under in 3 to 6/12 months...I am stuck. Additionally, like everyone else here, I have been applying to other companies for awhile to no avail. While this appears grim, I have some good news to note in my situation. 1) In case anything happens, I am so thankful to say I have grown my savings after some good budgeting since last year. 2) Chem Manuf actually wants to recruit me to be their senior/lead tech due to my background knowledge in my department/their need to fill a now empty role that they cannot hire externally for. Now although it is risky to consider the switch as 1) The role is volatile to a layoff by the summer. 2) There probably won’t be a raise yet more responsibility – this whole ship may very well sink soon anyway. So why not learn as much as I can in the meantime and become more employable? Moreover, although it's not an RA gig, I have learned that gaining manufacturing skills could be great as it opens doors beyond Biotech. Additionally, my body is starting to take a toll as a regular tech, and this new role would be more desk work with a better fitting team. The manager even said if I find something better she would support me jumping elsewhere. Finally, the cool part about this company is I can always learn new techniques from the R&D team during my downtime. Overall, I think having a new role & chem manuf skills would look most employable on my resume instead of being a tech 1 for 3-6 more months. Should I jump to Chem Manuf? Should I request more pay and job security given the role’s increased responsibility and volatility? Is it easy to explain to a new company how you were in a new role for only a few months before the company went under? Thank you for reading my long story.

I live in Florida, USA and would like to stay here bc I have family here. I have mostly worked in retail. However, I've been working for the state government for the past 15 months as an employment security representative. In my job, I assist people with their unemployment claims, and after interviewing the customer, depending what their needs are I refer them to our services. We are a career center so we offer professional networking, workshops where they can learn how to create a resume and how to nail a job interview, and pay their Coursera subscription so they can expand their skill set.

I don't know where my skills would be transferrable, or what skills should I gain in this day and age.

I'm open to any kind of job. I'm ok either working with people or by myself. I have never had like a preferred job that I would like to do. I'm open for remote jobs. I prefer the typical 8am-5pm M-F job, but I'm open to any schedule. Ideally, with a minimal yearly pay of $41,000 due to the cost of living in my area. I consider myself a fast learner. And due to AI, the job would have to be one that cannot be replaced by it.

Since I'm looking to have at least a month (20-30 days) worth of vacation days, I'm also open to work as a contractor. To my understanding, 1099 jobs cannot assign specific schedules. In my perfect world, my employer would allow me to take a month off all together before my first year of employment, but I know those are not the norm.

Currently making £77k base sdr in an AI company. I want to get to £500-1m a year.

1 - do really well at my current company and they could move me?

2- convince anther company in the US to hire me? 

3- move to another company known for moving people to the US?

What’s the best option here?

1bmovcz,My dream job ghosted me-advice?,"I got interviewed for what I would consider to be a dream job for me, or at least a step closer to it.

Keep in mind that I don’t live in this city, so I had to couch, serve and stay in Airbnbs for about three weeks to take these interviews. The position that was my top choice was at a high school, the interview was about four hours long, I toured the school, met with about 12 to 15 different people (including student leaders), and was told I would get a follow up email to meet with the head of school later that next week-I sent a thank you email immediately following the interview. Three weeks have passed, I sent a Follow up email, politely requesting an update. But then I got offered a position at my second choice. I let the school know, and still no response. During this time, they have taken off the posting for the position I applied for and have hired other people for different positions, but not the one that I applied for.

1bmoltu,Should I tell my boss why I am quitting? (CW for suicide mention),"My current job is horrible. Management is the worst type of micromanagers, constantly nitpicking everyone after every interaction. They also are extremely insensitive towards employees needs; a coworker needed a week off for very personal private affairs, and my boss just casually put in the office wide teams chat the entire reason out in the open, which this coworker has said they didn't want her to have done. The job itself is also horrible, and me and my team are overworked.

This has all had a bad effect on me. The horrible treatment from staff even pushed me towards suicidal ideations for a time about a month ago (Ive seen help and am fine now, dont worry). But being there at all made me realize I need a new job ASAP.

Now I have a new job lined up and will start soon, and I plan to quit completely this week (no 2 wreks notice, Im just gonna leave). Im wondering how much of this information I should share, vs just saying 'Im leaving for a new job'? On the one hand, I dont want to overshare personal stuff for fear of it being leaked again, as well as it feeling too manipulative towards them.

I’ve been in my role for 9 months and the workload has been excessive. I’ve never had this issue in my career with not being able to manage a heavy workload but I’m literally doing the job of 3 people. I’ve sat down with my manager to discuss my heavy workload and his (admittedly temporary) solution is to pass off some of my projects to a team member that works in a completely different sector. This won’t be possible when said coworkers busy season approaches shortly. 
To exacerbate the situation, my company cut 401k matching with no reinstatement date or plan mentioned. No bonus or raise is expected this year. I’m in commercial (office) real estate which is rapidly becoming a dead industry. 
I love my office mates and my manager is fine, but how many times do I bring up a heavy workload without viable solutions before I throw in the towel and move on?",give_it_a_goog,2,1.0,2,1711296882,2024-03-24 16:14:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bmohei/burnout_from_heavy_workload/,3,2024
1bmofve,"Boss leaving, no backfill, no promo, what to do?","I've been at this company for over 5 years and will now be on my 5th manager in that span. 

None of the people that were on my interview are still working at the company.

Bosses boss (who has been at the company less than 6 months and is partially the reason for manager leaving) wants the remaining 2 ICs to split departing managers responsibilities with no salary bump or promo.


Manager who is leaving - it's not all together shocking, due to bosses boss who was hired 6 months ago overlapping on some of managers responsibilities, but somewhat of a surprise with timing.

Have a history of poor managers at this company with current departing manager being the lone exception. Needless to say, a bummer that they are leaving.

Want to continue being an IC with no interest in stepping up to the departing manager's role. My role is much more operational in nature and I have no desire to be a people manager.

Can already sense a bias for the other member of the team who is remaining with some favoritism by departing boss's boss. 

Boss's boss seems disinterested and giving me a vision or keys to success with the new state of the team.

Seemingly being asked to increase workload with no real insight to what I'm already doing. We're already understaffed and individually I'm already doing the work of about 2.5 people. Not a ton of bandwidth to take on more so some things will have to drop or slack.

Trying to find a new job, but my role has a lot of general skills and requirements that are a little ambiguous for a specific opportunities. Having trouble finding something that I am clearly qualified for that really matches my skill set.

Not sure what to do but I ain't convinced someone to move into a new role, can't really afford it reduction in salary and I'm not sure how to proceed. Updated resume and LinkedIn and really shooting in the dark at this point. Any advice or feedback would be super helpful here. Thanks!

1bmnhv3,Am I doing something wrong,"I am currently working a very poorly paid data engineering role, that has an insanely high workload where i constantly have to do unpaid overtime. I graduated from a well renowned university in 2022 with a masters in computer science and AI (a 2:1).   
I couldnt find a role for a year after I graduated and the one im in, i feel is fairly bottom of the barrel, I work wil people younger than me that dont even have degrees.   
I justified accepting this role as 'experience' and that I would have an easier time finding a better role with some experience under my belt as well as my masters degree. 

But here I am, after a year working at this company, looking to move on to a better role and I find myself in the same position I was in a year ago.  Unable to even get responses from any good positions. 

I have been networking and growing my linked in, as well as upskilling within my field for years. My current boss even acknowledges as much. just this week ive had a meeting with him where he tells me my performance is far and away above anyone else at the company at my level, and as such, he will be putting me as the project leader for a few of our new clients. Essentially giving me the responsibilty of the senior engineers, but without any of the pay benefits or other perks. 

I have all this stuff on my cv. My experience and client handling skills, as well as the level of responsibility i've taken on on top of my qualifications. And yet I struggle to even get an aknowledgement from any applications ive made. Ive even paid for my CV to be proffessionally reviewed, and I now have a few iterations of it that i tailor even further to specific roles. 

Even reaching out to the generic application enquies email for larger companies I have been applying to have in 9/10 cases resulted in no response, and in the cases they do get back to me, its a generic 'please see our open positions' response. 

Although i'm trying my upmost not to show it, this is most certainly causing me to enter some sort of deep sadness. My partner says ive been changing a lot recently and I dont have the heart to tell her this is the reason. But in my head I cant get over the fact that if I had forgone a formal education and remained in my awful highstreet role, I would be making over double what I am currently. 

As such, I am at a loss for what to do. I have done everything in my power to become qualified and employable, have the experience under my belt, and yet am stuck in a near minimum wage role surrounded by workers who dont have half my output or qualifications, with a boss who refuses to promote me, but no option to quit because I would become destitute.

1bmnak2,Crushed…job proposal given to another,"I’ve worked for the same company for over a decade. Over the years I was promoted to manager and have been one for 8 years. I’ve been actively working towards a promotion over the years by getting my masters degree, certifications my job wanted me to get, countless leadership classes, etc. Every year I get exceeds expectations for my annual review, have been told I’m a top performer, and never had any disciplinary issues. When reviewing my experience/skills and the duties I perform I realized that I was being underpaid. My only way for a promotion at my current level was to propose a new department since my boss was content where they’re currently at.

I took a couple months to prepare a proposal for a new position that would give me a new department and a higher title and a raise. I did tons of research and aligned the position with our company’s strategic goal. I presented the plan to my boss who was impressed and then they had me present it to their boss who is part of the executive team. They seemed really excited about my proposal.

My boss’s boss came back with a development plan on me creating this department but I did not get the title/pay I wanted. I was told that for them to create that position it would have to be approved by the board and they would have a better chance if I started it as a manager. I’ve been given a year to develop this department with the caveat that the company is profitable at that point. So no promises. They did say I was underpaid so they increased my pay to match other employees at my level. So I was being paid about $10k less than my peers for the past 5 years. I did ask them if there’s anything I need to work on to get to the next level and if there’s anything holding me back and no one can tell me anything other than that position is just not open yet. My boss keeps telling me to not focus on the title but I was kind of offended by that since I was told I couldn’t ask for a certain salary because my position is not in that pay range.

This past week my company announced a reorganization and they’re bringing back an employee that left a year ago. The problem is that this person got the job I proposed for, even the title. I spoke to my boss’s boss about how their duties will be different than my proposal and from our conversation it sounds like they will be taking things from my proposal but they’re not totally sure yet. It seems like they’re basically seeing how this will all play out. Or maybe after a year they will tell me that my department cannot happen due to the economy and take all my work planning the department and use it for this other person.

I feel so crushed. I feel like I was lied to…and was played. I’m having a hard time thinking rationally about this and I don’t want to get emotional at work but I am really upset and have been thinking about this all weekend and cannot calm down.

1bmmxgv,Am I going about this correctly?  ,"
Hi all. To cut a long story short I’m cfd engineer. (Computational fluid dynamics). I’m 27 years old. 

While I have a lot of interest in this field, it’s extremely niche. And something I hadn’t considered when picking the field was how you have to job hop to get the salary you’re worth. Meaning my earning potential is very limited and I’m often looking at relocations if I want to change role. I’m not happy with my current salary. 

So I’ve been looking at software engineering. I use python a fair bit at my job for analysis and I’ve been pushing to be put on a development project. I’ve recently finally convinced them to give me a c++ development project with a months worth of funding. So that’s great. All of this is with the goal in mind that I could shift industry later to being pure software development. 

But is this the right move? Will hiring managers look at this experience and think I’m a good fit for a role? I get very nervous about being stuck and never making any good money. And I’m 27 now

1bmk8gu,should I just completely leave?,"So about 4 months ago I got this job. My mother was in direct contact with the person who hired me (gas station connected to carwash), and when I received a call, she asked me if I wanted it. with no hesitation I said yes and she told me to bring down proof of ID.

My promised schedule would be Sundays-Wednesdays, 7AM - 2:30PM, simply because my mother was my transportation at the time. I couldn't work nights because my nephew needs to be watched, and because I didn't want my mom to go home, then have to come pick me up again cause it would just be a waste of gas.

Around December things got out of hand. My boss had asked me to unexpectedly work a double shift that day. I was able to because on certain days there would be times where I could drive a family members car, and I had wanted to get to know my colleagues better so l had stayed. Either the next day or a couple days later, my schedule had changed. Two weeks later, a golden coworker gets fired and my schedule changes again.

Since January 2024 the schedule has changed 5 times.

This month I had a talk with my manager about everything he was doing. Him asking us to change shifts after hours (11PM-4AM. HE HAS TEXTED US AT 4 AM), being a conflict of interest because while i was sick, he walked to my moms job so he could get a hold of me, telling me to take the day off for extremely small things — i.e. me having menstrual cramps or having a slow day — and denying me a raise when I asked*, and the ONLY thing he said in response is how I don't act like a team with certain people (I refuse to help these people do their task because these exact people have an hour late MULTIPLE times resulting in me opening the car wash BY MYSELF! that is their consequence from me as a manager on duty, plus it takes 15 minutes for them)

*I currently make 16 an hour, but everyone else is making higher than me, and my boss tells me when him or my assistant manager is gone that /I/ am in charge, so I am technically considered a
shift lead. I asked for a dollar raise and got denied — AT FIRST my boss said it was because I don't clean the trench, yet he knows about the surgical procedure on my wrist - but then he turned it around to sound more professional (because yes, I looked at him in absolute anger and shock when he said that) and said because my role is solely focused on sales, yet I am washing cars and taking care of things that aren't in my job description.

1bmk2aq,should I just completely leave?,"So about 4 months ago I got this job. My mother was in direct contact with the person who hired me (gas station connected to carwash), and when I received a call, she asked me if I wanted it. with no hesitation I said yes and she told me to bring down proof of ID.

My promised schedule would be Sundays-Wednesdays, 7AM - 2:30PM, simply because my mother was my transportation at the time. I couldn’t work nights because my nephew needs to be watched, and because I didn’t want my mom to go home, then have to come pick me up again cause it would just be a waste of gas.

Around December things got out of hand. My boss had asked me to unexpectedly work a double shift that day. I was able to because on certain days there would be times where I could drive a family members car, and I had wanted to get to know my colleagues better so I had stayed. Either the next day or a couple days later, my schedule had changed. Two weeks later, a coworker gets fired and my schedule changes again.

Since January 2024 the schedule has changed 5 times.

This month I had a talk with my manager about everything he was doing. Him asking us to change shifts after hours (11PM-4AM. HE HAS TEXTED US AT 4 AM), being a conflict of interest because while i was sick, he walked to my moms job so he could get a hold of me, telling me to take the day off for extremely small things — i.e. me having menstrual cramps or having a slow day — and denying me a raise when I asked*, and the ONLY thing he said in response is how I don’t act like a team with certain people (I refuse to help these people do their task because these exact people have been an hour late MULTIPLE times resulting in me opening the car wash BY MYSELF! that is their consequence from me as a manager on duty, plus it takes 15 minutes for them)

* - I currently make 16 an hour, but everyone else is making higher than me, and my boss tells me when him or my assistant manager is gone that /I/ am in charge, so I am technically considered a shift lead. I asked for a dollar raise and got denied — AT FIRST my boss said it was because I don’t clean the trench, yet he knows about the surgical procedure on my wrist — but then he turned it around to sound more professional (because yes, I looked at him in absolute anger and shock when he said that) and said because my role is solely focused on sales, yet I am washing cars and taking care of things that aren’t in my job description.

and that’s another thing, I DIDN’T EVEN GET TOLD WHAT MY JOB ACTUALLY WAS UNTIL I STARTED WORKING. I did NOT complete my training paperwork until a month into this job.

Summary: Have been working for several years has been moved to a new role due to a mandatory move without any choices but heard some other colleagues in my old role were given a choice to move or stay I had initially started as an apprentice at 16

I had been moved around early October 2023 with training onsite for a week then to officially start but mentally wasn’t stable enough to start due to stress and anxiety. I had then got a sicknote until I got better & returned. Once I returned I had fainted after being there for around 1 hour

Since then I have been on sicknotes under stress/anxiety & other symptoms

I wanted to know what would be my best solution I had already tried to ask for reasonable adjustments to return to my old role which was perfect for me but couldn’t be put in place they had only advised a phase return to the new role with buddying in place for listening to calls

I have been having monthly meetings online & now to be put into a capability formal meeting with an operational manager

I have tried to look at internal vacancies but nothing popped up but I also need to be onsite for at least 12 months before they consider that

So only options I believe to have is to either resign or return. Is there any other possibility for any other options you may suggest to be put in place?",Zoro234665,1,1.0,0,1711272780,2024-03-24 09:33:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bmgu5a/should_i_quit/,3,2024

1bme5cy,I feel like the only path I have is self employment.,"I am in a really rough place mentally at the moment. I can barely sleep, at most I get 3-4 hours a night. I am in my mid 20s, have a background in media and procurement and public service. I've done a bunch of different things, but never managed to crack 40k due to living at home during the pandemic. I couldn't find work in my field of study (political science and media) so I got jobs where I could.

Over the last 18 months I have been losing my eyesight due to glaucoma, and even though I have never been able to drive things look extra bleak at the moment. I reached out for ""employment counseling"" with my local commission for the blind, and it was a disaster. Going into it, I was told they try to find something within the career field someone has studied, or similar enough.

 I had suggested massage therapy, but the counselor shot it down. They took a look at my resume, told me ""you don't have any keywords on here"", laughed in my face when I suggested I'd find a job in anything I had previously done, and could only suggest selling timeshares as a job prospect. I told them that I was open to remote work. I asked if there were any hiring fairs specifically for disabled people, since the last place I lived (Washington DC) had those from the DC government. They told me ""we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to apply"".. I want to rip out my hair.

Various ideas keep running through my head. Start a contracting company? Cool, but what about transport. Go into the Randolph Shepard program? Again - public transit doesn't fucking exist.. It's not as if these people would even pay for me to get into that program. I could go back into media or writing op-eds, but that doesnt exactly pay money does it?? It's not as if I can live off of $50 article submission payouts. 

 When I suggested MT work my casemanager told me ""I've done this multiple times and it never turns into full time employment"".

I just feel so fucking lost. My parents are supportive in letting me stay at home, God bless 'em, but they have no frame of reference for how services like this ought to be.

Please tell me there's more to life than sitting at home selling timeshares? I know rationally I can do other types of jobs, but there is such little support and next to no empathy from people who allegedly have experience in getting people like me back into the workforce.",govexplainedYT,3,1.0,7,1711261698,2024-03-24 06:28:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bme5cy/i_feel_like_the_only_path_i_have_is_self/,3,2024

If I'm offered the position I plan on explaining this to the company prior to the test, I'm sure my doctor would be fine with filling something out that they said they were fine with it if needed but I don't know if it matters. I was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder after a first time seizure basically. I doubt they'd give me a perscription for it though as it's legal all around here, and my doctor knows I'm not partaking and I'm responding well to the medication.

1bmc53d,Job change from field sales in large high tech to sales manager in small distributor company,"I've been in lab device sales for a high-tech B2B company for 2.5 years, after spending 5 years at a different place. Right now, I'm waiting to hear back about a management position at a new company. My current company is huge, with 6,000 employees globally and 100 in North America. The last place I worked at was bigger but paid poorly. I have a MENg degree and recently started an MBA part-time because I want to move into management.

The new company is tiny, only 15 people including 2 field reps and 3 inside sales folks who handle orders. They're a distributor, mostly dealing with stuff that doesn't exactly get me excited (it's simpler but sells in higher volumes). Still, there's room for growth. They want me to be the sales manager, reporting to a new GM who's young, friendly, and super passionate about growing the company.

The new GM and owner liked my international sales experience (Canada and US) and the fact that I speak three languages. They were impressed by my track record of smashing sales targets (150-160% over budget) and think I can help them grow big time.

Right now, I'm making a comfortable $120k base salary with potential commissions of $50-80k and $25k for travel. Plus, my company matches my RRSP contributions by 8%. The new job will probably match my current pay, though with slightly fewer benefits (insurance and RRSP).

The new gig involves hiring and coaching, setting up KPIs, expanding the CRM, and managing a sales territory. Travel-wise, it's mostly 1-2 day trips, which is way easier for me as a parent of two little ones compared to my current job's one-week or every-three-week travel schedule.

I'm worried about not meeting expectations in the new role, not being thrilled about the less high-tech products, and feeling stuck in my current job without a clear path to management.

They want to have a work retreat early/mid-April and have been alluding to it for a while without ANY concrete info on dates. It would just be a smaller team gathering of ~15ish people, but the potential to see more people on larger teams I work with in the office (I’m remote, but some folks live near HQ and go in often, and I’m on cross-functional teams with them). 

I feel it would stunt my career growth at this company which would suck, but also I am desperately trying to leave (horrible PTO, no sick days, no maternity leave, super low salary). Going would mean boarding my dog (for about $300) and the annoyance of being on a work trip for a job I hate. I’m also incredibly insecure about my physical appearance right now and I’d be miserable seeing folks who just know me as a little box on Zoom where I can control angles lol. 

Would you suck it up and go on the off chance you stay at this company longer than you intend to and could make some good connections? Would you sit it out and claim you didn’t have enough lead time to be able to go on a cross-country trip? I think they’d be totally understanding if I said that. 2 weeks is not really enough time to plan for being away for a week (for me, anyway).

I never went for CS/CSE because I had (less so now) such low self-esteem that I never thought I could compete in majors that were crammed with people and that I could never really understand any aspect of a computer because that's what ""smart people"" do.

1bm964u,Job change,"I've been in lab device sales for a high-tech B2B company for 2.5 years, after spending 5 years at a different place. Right now, I'm waiting to hear back about a management position at a new company. My current company is huge, with 6,000 employees globally and 100 in North America. The last place I worked at was bigger but paid poorly. I have a MENg degree and recently started an MBA part-time because I want to move into management.

The new company is tiny, only 15 people including 2 field reps and 3 inside sales folks who handle orders. They're a distributor, mostly dealing with stuff that doesn't exactly get me excited (it's simpler but sells in higher volumes). Still, there's room for growth. They want me to be the sales manager, reporting to a new GM who's young, friendly, and super passionate about growing the company.

The new GM and owner liked my international sales experience (Canada and US) and the fact that I speak three languages. They were impressed by my track record of smashing sales targets (150-160% over budget) and think I can help them grow big time.

Right now, I'm making a comfortable $120k base salary with potential commissions of $50-80k and $25k for travel. Plus, my company matches my RRSP contributions by 8%. The new job will probably match my current pay, though with slightly fewer benefits (insurance and RRSP).

The new gig involves hiring and coaching, setting up KPIs, expanding the CRM, and managing a sales territory. Travel-wise, it's mostly 1-2 day trips, which is way easier for me as a parent of two little ones compared to my current job's one-week or every-three-week travel schedule.

I'm worried about not meeting expectations in the new role, not being thrilled about the less high-tech products, and feeling stuck in my current job without a clear path to management.

I'm really torn about whether to go for this new management job. Any thoughts or advice would be awesome.",Own-Presence-1053,1,1.0,0,1711244673,2024-03-24 01:44:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bm964u/job_change/,3,2024

I'm in Germany on a contract where the notice period is ""3 months end of month"" (pretty standard here).

The new contract is being sent to me on Monday, but my boss is away this entire week on vacation: so I can't arrange a meeting with him to tell him directly.

I guess I just want to know the etiquette here and to sanity check my plan: which is to have a meeting with an HR rep on Tuesday to tell her in person, and then send an email to her and my boss with the official resignation inside.

Obviously it sucks because I respect my boss a lot, he's a stand-up guy, and I would have preferred to tell him in-person (or at least in a virtual meeting): but this is the best I've got without disturbing his vacation.

1bm3q99,Which path do you think fits me better?,"I am highschool student in Europe and I am getting close to the point where I have to choose studies and university.

I am great at exact sciences like math, IT and physics, I also like history and geography.

I am a big fan of sport and my dream job is to be part of professional basketball/football team, participate in training, follow them through the season. I am considering physiotherapy or AT, but I don't like biology and studying those 2 is just 100% of biology. 

I also consider being a coach, maybe even working with children, but I am worried that even with my experience in sport, I still have too less knowledge in those sports to be a coach.

Being a sports team manager seems like a really perfect fit for me, but every 2nd person is studying management and getting a job with Management degree would be a nightmare.

Those 3 professions is one career option - sports, it's what I am sure I would enjoy because of my love of sports adrenaline.

The other career path would be using my strengths and studying engineering, where it would be much easier getting a well paid job than even getting a place in sports team. I enjoy physics, IT and math, but I lack practical experience of engineering and have no clue what the job is and would I like it, but it tempts me, because of my great ability to think the way out of the problem, that I also enjoy doing.

At the same time my old boss reached out to me and asked me if I were interested in a position at his company.

A little info about the two job.

Job #1
1. Good salary
2. But far away from my town, so long commute 
3. Full responsibility of all the financials (I think could be stressful but I think I could grow alot)
4. They say I should expect to move into management role after a year.
5. Some possible red flags. High staff turnover within the department, however they mentioned they have ""the right team now"" but I can see from linkedin the current staff have been employed there less than 6 months.
6. Smaller company of 200 ppl. And their financials are good on paper.

Job#2
1. Good pay, only a little below job#1, but still a good pay increase.
2. My old boss works there and I have an excellent work relation with him. Back then he moved into a new position, and I found another job also afterwards, but we still kept in touch.
3. One of my old colleagues also works in this company, and he also came there due to my old boss, so that's also a big plus for me.
4. Close to home so short commute.
5. Will be creating financial models and reporting which I would find alot of fun. Ok opportunity for advancement when I asked them.
6. Low responsibility and low stress I reckon.

Some background of me. I have a degree in accounting, but also have a good interest for tech. I got family and kids. I like to challenge my self and grow, but at the same time I don't want to burn out with high stress jobs.
Currently employed in a large company.

Alot of arrows are pointing towards job#2 but I am also afraid of missing out on some big growth and advancement that job#1 might be able to give, however it could be more stressful.

I was wondering what other career options are there for people who want a steady job with growth, benefits and work life balance? I understand there are downsides to every job, but I’m open to pretty much anything and looking into any fast track certifications or apprenticeships that can land me a job relatively soon. I’m extremely motivated and ready to apply my efforts and learn I just need something to commit to. 

I have great communication skills, can adapt pretty quickly, relatively tech savvy (definitely not coding or IT) but I feel competent enough to learn most things. I know this is a broad generalization of my skills but would appreciate any career advice from those with experience in programs or tracks that lead to a steady job. 

Cheers everyone! ",Affectionate-Golf178,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1711220692,2024-03-23 19:04:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bm00ax/career_shift_at_27appreciate_any_advice_on_this/,3,2024
1blzupa,how to handle,"started at a new company 8/2023. you must be in your role for 12 months before applying for another role internally. i got a new supervisor in 2/2024 that’s incredibly difficult and has made me reallyyyyy dislike my role. 

this week i saw a job posting for another dept. that im highly qualified for and combines two of my main skills/experiences and is at least 15k higher in salary. 

there is a loophole in the policy that if you can get your current supervisor to “release you” from your role via letter/email, you can apply before the 12 month mark.
 
what are your thoughts and suggestions for how to proceed? ",almondmlkgirl,1,1.0,2,1711220327,2024-03-23 18:58:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1blzupa/how_to_handle/,3,2024
1blzikp,Has quitting without another opportunity lined up worked for you?,"Hello everyone,

I’m curious if anyone has quit their job for the sake of their mental health and how it worked out.

I am looking at the idea of quitting my job due to the amount of stress and problems it creates. My wife and I working for the same employer, there’s a lot I could go on about but I’ll make it simple. To start, I commute over 60 miles in LA traffic. This makes my commute in itself almost a full time job. There seems to be issues with my wife and I being married (to the company, not between us) even though we work at different locations. This job is in line with my passion/hobby and has single handedly killed every ounce of passion I have, to the point where I sold something very dear to me due to having no interest in it anymore. I have almost no personal life or time for friends. I also worked incredibly hard on my mental health, and I feel myself losing all the progress I’ve made due to the stress and anxiety I feel at this job. This isn’t the quality of life I want. The only upside to this job is the money is good and I have accomplished a lot of goals thanks to this job.

I want to quit just to focus on myself and recharge, the burnout I feel is insane. I think it’s time I put myself first and not my career. I thankfully have the money to survive for a while, but no income is something I’m not used to. Has anyone quit for themselves and have you regretted it or were happy you did?

1blzef8,I Need a Reality Check On 2 Paths I'm Considering,"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm a web developer who's tired of the whole corporate grind. It's time for a change, and I'm finally taking the leap to start my own thing.  
  
I've been grinding away in the corporate world for quite a bit, and I'm tired of the repetitive nature and the monotony that comes with it. I've always had a desire to forge my own path as an entrepreneur.  
  
After considerable brainstorming and research into potential businesses, I have managed to narrow down the list to 2 options:  
  
Path 1: SaaS Business.  
  
This appeals to my developer side. The idea of building something scalable that can provide value for other businesses or individuals while generating recurring revenue sounds awesome.  
  
Path 2: E-commerce.  
  
This option allows for more creative freedom. I could source and build an online brand. Plus, the potential for fast growth is there.  
  
I know that there more to these 2 businesses that what the gurus promote on social media. So those of you who have experience with either SaaS or e-commerce, or have been in a similar situation, I'd be incredibly grateful if you could give your advice.",-Nagazaki-,1,1.0,0,1711219188,2024-03-23 18:39:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1blzef8/i_need_a_reality_check_on_2_paths_im_considering/,3,2024
1blz4s3,Advice for my next career move?,"Which company to go with for my next career move?

Hi all! I’m having a bit of a conundrum in terms of my next move for my career so I was hoping to get some advice here.

A bit of background: in January I got laid off from my job of 2 years. They told me it was downsizing but there was definitely more to it than that. I’ve been unemployed mostly since then (some part time work to fill in time and money but that’s it). I work in Data Analytics, and recently I received 2 job offers in that field:

One is for Publicis Groupe as a Senior Data Analyst, which is a hybrid role and the office is in the downtown area of my city. This role is full time and direct hire, pays about $90k (about 5k more than what I was getting).

The other is for CBRE, but it’s a contract to hire (6 months, though early conversion is possible but rare). The contract rate is $44/hr but it is full time and is fully remote. When I get converted to perm there’s a high chance of a pay raise as well if not at least pay matching to about $90k. 

Benefits wise both are good. The CTH (contract to hire) does offer contractor benefits that are solid but they don’t kick in for 60 days (which sucks but they said that is how they do it). The perm opportunity has benefits that kick in day one. Looking between the internal benefits of both CBRE and Publicis Groupe they are both very good though from what I’ve read CBRE is slightly better, though I would not have that for at least 6 months. 

I’ve done a lot of research into both companies and have asked a lot of friends and family. They both seem similar but CBRE seems to have slightly better reviews overall. I know with Publicis Groupe I would be working with clients to some degree so that is a factor in terms of work life balance vs CBRE which does have clients but I would be working primarily internally. Also one thing to note is that while with Publicis Groupe my title would be a Senior title the pay doesn’t seem to match that which I’ve heard from reviews they tend to under pay people.

I’m hoping to get some more opinions here, primarily about the two companies and what work loads tend to look like, etc. before I make my final decision. Both jobs are slated to start in the next week so I need to make a decision by Monday. Thanks in advance for any help, will provide more info if needed!

1blyks2,Pricing analyst position internally or externally?,"YOE = 9
TC = $118k

Hello.

I've worked mostly in national defense in finance. I've hopped around different finance functions, and have decided I want to dive deep into pricing/proposals (hopefully to become a manager).

I current work at a small business units in one of those huge defense companies....

i had an offer to switch divisions to a pricing analyst position, but my director sweet talked me saying one day we will have a pricing department and  he can position me to becoming the manager when it happens. (He price matched my offer).

I agreed. 1.5 years later... I've been working in building processes, and just learning more to become ready.

They announced the new department. I applied. I did not get the manager job. It was passed to someone else with more pricing experience.

I'm bummed. I get it, the other guy had more experience.... But I'm still disappointed.

So now, my director is telling me to apply to the analyst positions he is hiring for.

I have since applied externally; and starting to get interviews scheduled. Projected salary would be $120-$135k.

So not a huge bump switching companies...

I'm not exactly sure what the best path is for my career

Case for staying at current company: I know the current processes, and they are implenting a bunch of new ones... It might be painful learning a whole new system... But I could learn a lot.

Case for joining a new company: I can come in and learn the already existing processes. Start fresh. I have a feeling it'll be less painful since it's an up and running department?

I don't know what the best choice is here. Both are WFH options.

I wanted to beautify my cv and my linkedin profile and I started by writing a book-report-like articles for every major project that I've completed so far. I am also somehow socially awkward except if I am talking about my interests, like everyone else of course. However, I get nervous and anxious trying to explain specific projects. I suffer from impostor syndrome all the time and is hindering me from becoming proactive. It makes me look incompetent and I feel depressed about it.

These days, I am doing my best to get out of my skin and get used to presenting myself. I attend events that enables me to speak to strangers and tell something about my life. Now, I want to get organized.

My steps so far for my desired portfolio is:
1. Summaries of the projects and roles I took (industry, typebof company, my role, my skills used, learnings, hardships and solutions)
2. Powerpoint presentation of industries (ex. Bag manufacturing/fashion industry, hydrogen plants, etc.)
3. Ideas portfolio (like a brief thesis, or a theoretical industrial plant design)

1bluiuq,"Laid off, now boss wants me back. Advice?","Some background - I was laid off last week after being in my company for almost three years.

The reasons were vague and both me and my coworkers did not understand the decision of laying me off. I am one of the oldest employees (early stage startup) and I am a key person in the majority of projects.

One of the employees they kept quit due to instability and the fact they joined a few months back, making management not look good on their decisions.

A few days after this employee quitting, I was offered the chance to go back. They want me to sign a document to nullify the termination letter I signed last week. Since I did not sign my severance package document I lost the chance of receiving that.

Now I am thinking of being strategic about coming back. My boss really wants me back and believes it was a great mistake to lay me off, which means I have some leverage.

The coworker that quit was currently making 20% than me, which means in their calculations to determine the amount of layoffs they had budget for a salary that high.

Do you think it’s appropriate for me to ask for a 15-20% raise using this opportunity? If so, how would you approach this conversation?

1bluell,Need advice for my younger sister,"We are in the UK and she is 16 - about to finish her first year of A-Levels (English Lit, Media and Philosophy). 
She’s unsure of what she wants to do. She is going down this path because she has a feeling like she is *meant to* go to the university because “what else is she supposed to do”. 
She doesn’t have any specific interests except for film and that’s what she is planning to do at university. 
The thing is, our family (myself included) know nothing about the industry. I’m under the impression it’s about who you know and not the grades - and we know no one. Moreover, she doesn’t like studying nor she knows how to study, she’s currently working at C/B level. She definitely has a chance of getting into uni - Trent, Brooks, Anglia Ruskin (I was got BBB and got all 3 so
i’m sure she is capable). 
What I’m worried about is that since she doesn’t like studying and she will go to an ok university for what it seems like a not very employable degree, then there’s so many things that can go wrong. How will she do well if she doesn’t like studying, how will she find work in the industry after? I’m
worried she will get herself in debt for nothing and have to start to build her career at the age of 22 from scratch.
For a person like her though - what options does she have, how can I support her and help her. I want to give her some sort of guidance but I’m in Software Engineering and that’s something that she’s definitely NOT interested in.

During her studies, she worked her ass off as she was so excited to be the best she could be and join an industry she loves after leaving one she didn’t. Now, however, the games industry is seeing headline-making news as studios are laying off staff en masse, and it's been months of sending literally thousands of applications and portfolios but usually without as much as a response. Her self-confidence and motivation are crushed, and I am watching her spiral. She said to me the other day “I just wish someone would give me a chance, I would work so fu&$\*ing hard for them”, and I really don’t know what I can do to help her.   


I’m used to being the one who can fix a situation, but this is one I have to watch from the sidelines and it’s a terrible feeling to feel powerless. It’s hard to watch her work tirelessly still on sending out applications and respond to ads, getting on recruiters’ radar’s and watch for the replies that aren’t coming. She’s not trying to land a massive role with huge salaries, she literally just needs to get her foot in the door.

1blml22,"What can I do about a toxic manager? (small company, government work)","Throwaway account because this is way too detailed. For context, I work for a company that subcontracts their employees out to customers who come to us with their work needs. Most people in my company have a government security clearance so we can be subcontracted out to government orgs. Though we’re all technically contractors, we have no issues charging 40 hours/week because there’s always a wealth of projects we’re getting assigned to and more work to be done.  
  
My opinions about my manager since I started working here have slipped from positive to confused to outright disgusted. He seemed okay at first, like someone who genuinely cared about me, maybe a little socially awkward, but it didn’t take long for me to start noticing things. The main one is that he’s chronically disorganized and forgetful. He asks for emails in advance of when we will be taking time off, acknowledges the emails when they arrive, and then forgets we’ve taken time off once the day(s) come(s) and starts harassing us over Teams and phone calls to ask where we are (doesn’t matter how many times we remind him). He tries to be your buddy and get on your level, but won't retain any information about you as a person or your wellbeing. He’ll forget a conversation he had with me that morning by the time the afternoon comes around. Worst of all, he constantly forgets what *he* says. I almost had a meltdown a few weeks ago because he’d moved me to one project 100% (which was a major relief to me) and then a week later *completely forgot that conversation had ever happened*. I was genuinely worried he would put me on a different project I didn’t want because he’d forgotten his own project management. I get that the big news of my week won’t be the big news of his, but how could he forget which projects he’s placed his employees on? He will also constantly shift people on and off projects, which makes our day-to-day lives unpredictable and makes us look bad to our customers. (He always blames it on external forces, of course.) We don’t get much say in where we are placed.  
  
He tried to “mentor” me and train me up in some software I’d need to use for our customers, and a lot of the advice and training he gives is outdated or just flat-out wrong (I network with other people in my field through our customers, which is how I discovered this). I have other project leads through our customers who I’ve started to go to whenever I encounter issues or need some guidance, since he’s proved his incompetence in my eyes. When he found that out (not sure how), he bristled and told me to only come to him about that stuff. Except, of course, he’s rarely available. Which leads to my next point — he simply has too much on his plate. Our company is small, but we still have over a dozen or so workers who he’s managing by himself. The only “management” above him is our CEO. He’s in charge of managing all these workers, who are spread across several states, along with the occasional work he gets from the customers and whatever it is managers do that keeps them in meetings all day. If he’s forgetting basic stuff with me, I can’t imagine what sort of dysfunctional relationships and mishaps he has with all of them. He's constantly 5-15 minutes late to our 1:1s or just doesn't show up at all, but of course, if he signs into Teams before I get online, I get a message saying, ""Where are you??"" (we have no set start/end times) and an email reminding me of our WFH policy. He’s also a landlord when he’s off the clock. The dude just has too much going on and, in my opinion, lacks the self-awareness to realize he needs better tools (or another manager) to help manage it.  
  
His behavior became especially atrocious these past months as he put his favoritism on display. Currently, I’m on his good side, but it’s a very tenuous position to be in. I’ve crossed into his bad side before (can’t remember now what I did), and as soon as that shift happened it felt like he did everything in his power to micromanage me and bring me down until I did whatever he wanted me to do. He claims he’s “good at reading people” and gets “good vibes” from me (okay), but even that is not enough to stay in his good graces.  
  
He started edging out our older coworker (60s) a couple months ago in what I can only describe as a baffling series of events. Here’s the summary:  


* He pulls “Lindy” (my older coworker) off her main project, tells her not to contact anyone from the project team anymore because they “didn’t like her work” (this is her first time hearing any feedback like this and it comes as a surprise. She isn't offered the chance to do better, no PIP)
* He takes Lindy’s clearance away (the clearance allows her to work on a lot more projects for the government) with no explanation
* He doesn’t try to find other work for Lindy. Our other former manager (who is transitioning to retirement) places her on one of my projects, but the work is expected to reach a lull around mid-March until August or September
* The lull has happened and Lindy now doesn’t have any work to charge to. She has to stay at home, unpaid
* While all this is happening, my manager contacts me (and presumably a few other employees) to let us know our company is going to be hiring some new people and to send references their way
* Lindy quits this week because my manager is not finding her any work.  
  
I had lunch with him and a few other coworkers the day after Lindy told me she was quitting, and it was hard to keep a straight face as he continued to push this narrative about the company needing to hire more people, especially people with a clearance, about how there’s sooo much work to be done, about how he doesn’t recommend working directly for our customers because being a subcontractor is better (he started shit-talking an employee who left last year without naming her directly, saying she now “has no work”), and do we know anyone with a clearance who’s looking for work? What do we feel are the pros and cons to working for this company? How could the company improve? I couldn’t tell him the worst con to working at our company was sitting across from me at the table. I also didn’t have the nerve to bring up how Lindy had had the clearance our company so desperately desires before he took it away. I didn’t mention how Lindy had no work to charge to before she quit, either. (Btw, when they were first training me up and there was a lull in finding work for me, they gave me a job code to charge to 100% until they got the ball rolling. All Lindy ended up getting was a code for 4 hours/week.) I just tried to hold my best poker face and echo whatever my other coworkers said.  
  
Before Lindy quit, she and I talked a few times about how our manager is disorganized and unpredictable. She tried to warn him about issues on the project he eventually took her off of (pending deadlines, customers not doing their end of the work, too much work, leading to a bottleneck), but he conveniently forgot about those until whatever happened to make him remove her from the project. She even brought HR and the CEO into it at one point because she was so stressed about the work. In the end he still took her off the project.  
  
I expected there to be some sort of PIP for her if the criticism about her work being unsatisfactory was actually true, but nothing like a PIP ever happened. My manager remained opaque about the whole ordeal whenever she asked him questions. She didn’t even try to question why they rescinded her clearance because it was apparent he wouldn’t provide any clarity. Then he completely edged her out.  
  
My question is, is there anything I can do about this man? Everyone I’ve spoken to about my work environment has told me this isn’t normal. But I’ve also read that I shouldn’t try speaking up because it will ultimately end badly for me. It’s even trickier because we don’t have middle management, just the CEO. We don’t even have HR. HR is just a single person. If I spoke to some of my coworkers and found out they had issues with him as well, and we rallied together, would we be safer?  
  
I would look for other work, but I feel loyal to our customers who have been mentoring me in the wake of my manager’s disaster. I feel compelled to see my projects through. Plus I can’t afford a pay cut or any sort of economic instability.  
  
  
TL;DR: My manager is an egotistical control freak who edged out our older employee for reasons unknown, and none of us know if we’re going to suddenly end up on his bad side and be next. What can I do?

1bllm0y,HELP! Urgent Career Advice Needed?,"Need some career advice, I’ve been made a job offer, North East UK. The job offer is a Project Lead role in my current field, it’s only £500 more per year than I am currently earning as a manager, however it’s mainly remote, cutting out a 45 minute commute each way (total 1.5hr each day). Only catch is it’s 12 month FTC, the company is known for keeping on its FTC employees after the contract length, however as someone who is currently on a permanent contract and always has been, the prospect of a contract role is daunting. I also feel like the salary isn’t enough more than what I’m currently earning to warrant the risk of ‘contract’ work. I’d be saving about 2-3k a year on commute. The job itself sounds a lot more interesting but I can’t get past the risk of a 12 month FTC vs my current permanent role. Hiring manager has told me it’s pretty unlikely there wouldn’t be a permanent role after the FTC for me in some capacity but find it hard to go by that. 

My current role is pretty flexible (work from home 1-2 days a week), only negatives are that it’s a 45 minute commute there and back, and the job itself is pretty boring! 

This new offer is at a company I’ve always wanted to work for, however I don’t know if I can live for the next 6-8 months in limbo wondering if I’m going to have a job at the end or not, or if in the current job market I would be better off just holding out for another permanent role closer to home.

1bllbvb,I got rejected by the manager yet she recommended me to a completely irrelevant team's managers in the same company. Did I lose this role to an internal applicant?,"I applied for an internship in a major company in the financial industry, they had 4 distinct teams for internships: accounting, investing, finance and technology.  
I was in the final round of interview with the investing team's manager, and have very strong credentials (below). I must mention though, the interview was scheduled with the manager *and* a senior associate from the team, but the senior associate didn't join. (The manager also said I was the last to be interviewed, so part of me is wondering how was decision made if I was only interviewed with the manager?)

  
**Credentials:**  
\- volunteered in an investment related institution and received education on investing/securities/stock market

\- checked the boxes for technical skills required and the extra skills they see as an advantage (a few programming languages and knowledge of relevant software)

\- showcased my detail-oriented nature and matched the analysis / problem solving skills required utilizing relevant job experience I have had in the past

\- strong motivation and a quite unique minor in college relevant to the investing position

\- strong motivation towards the organization and specific reasons on why the investing role

Of course I agreed, but I think it is quite obvious that my experience is not in line with accounting *at all?*  
Firstly, I didn't even apply to the accounting team, so I should lack motivation in their eyes. Secondly, I have no experience in accounting nor studies in it, which does not make sense on their side either.

1bll0iw,"No Manager One on Ones, only skip level meetings for last quarter. How would you read this?","Hoping for some help with perspective here, whether I should be concerned or it is positive.

Since November-ish I have been having weekly 1:1 meetings mostly with my manager’s manager, so skip level. Now this is partially driven by a real messed up experience I had during a big re-org last year. I expected us to chat regularly for some time, maybe monthly or something, but it continues to be weekly.

The side of it I’m not sure how to read or whether I should be concerned by is that I have little to no dealings during this time with my direct manager. She’s stopped setting up 1:1 meetings all together with me, even the quarterly ones we are supposed to have around goals. I am on a highly visible project, so it’s obvious what I’m doing/delivering.

We, my direct manager and I, have a goal of getting me promoted this year which along with high performance requires being more visible amongst higher levels/C-suite leadership. But I didn’t think that would mean my own manager would be completely hands off with me. I’m also getting mostly communication about my projects from her via other people on the projects, which feels very strange.

I have had a few issues in the past with bully bosses and harassment from seniors and quite frankly I believe the world is changing and employees (including myself) do not want to put up with the abuse from upper management, which is prevalent in the majority of jobs that I have had.
I am currently studying Business Management and Sustainability with The Open University as well.

Question:
I consider myself an ethical manager and I am firmly on the side of employees. I have applied to be a union rep and I’m in the process of becoming one however it is unpaid. I would love a paid career advising and protecting employees from harassment, micromanagement and abuse of any kind, similar to union reps role.

1blj611,Business acquired - not sure if I should stay or leave,"We were recently acquired in Q4 of 2023. We’re a small company, with about 30 employees. My position was essentially a GM position. I worked closely with sales/customer service and operations and was included in most all decisions and certainly any/all company strategy. 

The new owners are coming from a different industry altogether and have promised me a litany of things… such as naming me president, giving me a raise, and the fact they would not be in the way at all. Safe to say… none of those things have happened. Matter of fact, they already named one of the minority owners as president. 

I’m pretty frustrated with them not coming through with their promises… although to their credit, Q1 of 2024 has been brutal for us so far… but on top of all of this, they haven’t sought my advice on hardly anything regarding the business.

1blh8jh,Should I drop out to pursue a good full time job offer.,"Hey everyone,  
I'm currently a junior in college, majoring in Electrical Engineering with a focus on computer electronics, at a well-respected engineering school in Colorado. For about a year now, I've been working part-time as a software engineer, and my employer has already made me a standing job offer that I can accept at any time. The salary is very appealing at $85k.  
Despite my academic path, I have realized that I have no desire to pursue a career in Electrical Engineering; I've found my passion in software development instead. Given this, I'm contemplating whether it makes sense to drop out of college now and continue working. Completing my degree would mean working part-time for a longer period, which could delay my full-time work experience.  
I'm leaning towards the belief that practical work experience will be more beneficial in the long run. However, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts and advice. Would it be wise to focus on my career now and potentially finish my degree later, or should I stick it out in college while working part-time?",BeefHit22,2,1.0,2,1711160527,2024-03-23 02:22:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1blh8jh/should_i_drop_out_to_pursue_a_good_full_time_job/,3,2024

The other employees are a CFO and an accountant. The company is just starting out, they are remote and the office is under construction and slated be finished late summer. 

They offered 80k, it's full time in office and they do not offer a 401k and 2 weeks vacation (I currently get 16 days). I plan to counter a bit higher to account for the lack of 401k and match. But the thing I'm really wondering about is startup related stuff like equity or shares of the company. Afaik the company is owned 50/50 by the CFO and CEO. Are there thinks I should pay attention to or negotiate for in this specific scenario?

## Background

Two days ago I got this message from a LinkedIn recruiter (no profile picture and little uploaded information):

>The Mouth of Sauron: Hi Frodo, your background looks awesome for a Engineering Technician opportunity we’re working on @ Barad-dûr project Nazgul (managed service opportunity) in Mordor. So I’m reaching out. Let's connect about this + future positions. Kindly send me your resume at [TheMouthOfSauron@theRing.com](mailto:TheMouthOfSauron@h10capital.com). The Mouth of Sauron!

Two months prior, I received a similar message but I assumed it was spam so I ignored it. However, this time I responded by sending my resume.

Within 5min I got another email detailing the role and asking me if I would be available for a call sometime in the future. Which I agreed to.

Then 2hours later I got a call asking, from a different person, if I was available for a 15min phone screen. Again, I agreed and they went over the position and asked about my resume. They were happy with what I said and told me they were going to ask their program manager (Sauron) if they should proceed with a technical interview.

30min later I received an email and meeting invite for the next day for a 30min technical prescreen. Which I accepted.

In the technical interview, I get asked just 2 simple question (one about circuits and another about programming). The questions were elementary so I got both correct; then I was asked:

>Sauron: Were those stupid questions? You would be surprised how many engineers fail these tests.

The remainder of the interview went well, and Sauron told me my rights as an employee, and they I shouldn't expect for this position to be a long term role; that it would be in my best interest to move onto to better things once the opportunity arises. Finally, he told me that of the candidates it is between me and one other person, and I should hear back by late evening.

That evening I get told that I will be getting the official offer sometime in the morning. Which I received.

## Question

Let me preface with saying: I have never worked in industry before, I just graduated from my undergrad in December and got accepted into an online masters program that I started in January. I have been going all out trying to land a job/internship which I have now sent 214 applications and talked to dozens of people. However, I have not gotten a single interview yet. And now, all of a sudden this high-paying job as a contractor for an A-list company gives me an official job offer in 72hours. Something seems off to me, but I am not familiar with the interviewing process or employment agencies.

I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with employment agencies, or if this generally raises any alarms. Any information helps.

Thank you.",sparkinski,1,1.0,2,1711157316,2024-03-23 01:28:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1blg5co/recently_got_a_job_offer_as_a_contract_hardware/,3,2024

I will be graduating this summer with a Chemical Engineering degree that I do not wish to pursue. Now the startup is very small sized (8-10) employees and I was pretty much the early hires of the company. I wish to pursue management consulting and just for a year, I have the option to join the startup as CoS (they offered me to join upon graduation) or join a Management Trainee Program (yet to find one) at a FMCG and then join consulting. In the MT program I will be rotated in different business functions but if I join the startup I will be working closely with the CEO and might be able to learn the strategy part of the business that interests me but I am reluctant to join it as the startup is not any famous one.

1blehhs,Should I go back to previous employer/field after 5 years?,"Hi, looking for advice.

Graduated from undergrad about 10 years ago with a business degree. Interned at a couple of corporate accounting firms while in school, wasn’t crazy about the corporate environment. When I graduated I eventually took a job at the Apple Genius Bar. Worked there for 4 years then got called from a job lottery for a state job as a bus driver. Ended up moving across the country and did basically the same job again but in a different city. Long story short I abruptly quit that job last fall because of housing/roommate/crime issues where I was living, but soon after took the same type of job in a new city but then left the job because of a hostile work environment and feeling unsafe at work, given all the assaults that happen these days, plus the schedule being so up and down. Some days you work early mornings, other days late nights… it’s just not conducive to having a happy, healthy life in my opinion, even though I love driving, serving the public and meeting new people. Overall it’s been 5 years since I’ve done a job besides CDL driving. 

So my question is: what do I do now? I’m thinking I should try and go back to Apple but I am getting really sick of working weekends/holidays. Granted it was my favorite job and I loved being part of a team that worked well together and helped people (at least, that’s how it was at my store), but I don’t doubt that the place has changed in the years since I’ve left. I also think maybe I should try to get some IT certifications like Network+ or CCNA. Or do both? 

Also, a friend of mine said he thinks I may have ADHD since I keep switching jobs/can’t decide what to do. Not really sure what to do with that information though?

But jobs that have to do with numbers or rules are often seen as boring. I guess that could include things like data entry, statistics,   doing taxes, insurance, writing manuals, etc. If you have a job that is more often than not considered boring, do you also think the job is boring? If so, how do you stay motivated? I suppose some could say the money is a motivator but does that help in the moment, as you're filling out forms or entering numbers into a database?

Since starting my job, I've only met with the contractor twice to go over two specific types of reports. The owner and I haven't done any onboarding. She collected the tax forms I filled out, but otherwise we haven't really spoken.

Most of the issue is that she left for a family vacation last Sunday and will return from it this Sunday. We are going to meet in-person Tuesday. Before then, I want to create a list of questions about all the things I don't understand such as the billing clients, guidelines for social media and blogs, and how to best use all the different programs she has.

My boss (A) called me in the other day, and explained the situation and said that I was a great employee and argued my case to his boss (B) and his bosses boss (C), and they ultimately decided they’d give me the raise due to my great performance next month.

I was very grateful and thanked my boss, A, and said that I was appreciated.  

My question is, should I be thanking B and or C too?  I see and talk to B once every couple months, and I’ve never had a conversation with C but we’ve exchanged hellos in the hallway and we know eachother by name.

I saw him the other day and asked how he was, but it never crossed my mind to thank him for the raise.

Anyways, I want to have a good name and reputation at this company, so I don’t want to seem ungrateful.  Also, I’m a bit socially awkward and not really aware yet of what’s acceptable and expected in this professional corporate environment.  

Is thanking my boss enough hopefully? Or should I make a point to thank the others involved in the decision?

Interviewing for a larger company I used to intern with that is in many ways a “dream” company, at least I enjoyed my time there and it would look good on my resume as it aligns with future opportunities. My only reservation is that the pay is less (it also has no benefits) than my current role, and it’s in an industry where financial rewards come much later, rather than sooner than the one I’m in.

Am curious on anyone’s guidance between weighing the heart of following your passions (dream company) or the mindfulness of staying in something that might be more financially rewarding in the moment? And also deciding what’s right for you anyway? If I even get the offer lol….

However one of the other managers keeps publicly firing out the criticism at me, and does not think getting all of the above as a postive but focused on the cab as being to large, I said to him today what makes you happy as Notting seems to make you happy you wonted a new network your getting it with the best of the best? Are you happy with your life ? During the meeting as you just focus on eveything negative with no thank you, we are all human we all make mistakes, we can get another cab but a replacement will be large still and I have another use for the cab anyway. And we do not work as a team.

Based on the above how should I have handed the reaction ? As being honest I focused on the negatively, not being happy and did cover my mistake and said we can fix

I have a degree in IT that I obtained back in 2021 and got laid off in beginning of 2023. I was working in sales and customer service jobs just to fill the gap for sometime while continuing to get back into IT. 

I got in touch with one of my old friends from college and he uses some very shady tactics to get candidates tech jobs. This includes completely falsifying work experience on their resume and Linkedin. Specifically stating to not change anythin on Linkedin after he updates it with BS just to get interviews. Hes made me study WS cloud fundamentals to prepare a little for it which I have done. He also Proxies the interviews which is all something I would have said hell no to in the past but because of my dire situation, I was willing to see through all this to get a role. The roles hes applying for me are in the 90-100k$ salary range which is clearly something that I am not experienced enough for but whatever. 

I recently did an interview for an Entry level telecom engineer position and got the job and told him I think Im going to pass with his shady recruiting techniques which will probably get me blacklisted in the database and prefer to get experience ethically and without sugarcoating my resume too much as he is doing. 

He still calls me again saying an interview has been scheduled for monday and wants me to attend if I am still interested. He just wants his cut of $1500 he will be earning every month off me and is basically trying to social engineer his way into getting me to work under his payroll. Oh and since I am going to be mentally handicapped going into this Advanced Cloud engineering role where I have no clue wht I will be doing, he offers 3 months of job support to assist which makes no sense cause why not do the damn work yourself? I rather do something whole heartedly anyways, Im just that type of person, I dont care about a high salary, what I do care is integrity.

1bl95x6,"I want to quit, but I can't. Pros/cons and advice would be much appreciated.","I’ve been in a job for over 5 years now and I want to quit but I can’t commit to doing so. I’ve lost the urge to go above and beyond. I’m burnt out. The hours are long and the work life balance is non-existent. Almost half my team has quit in the last 6 months and I’ve contemplated leaving for the past two years. In fact, at one point I did say this was it and they threw more money at me to get me to stay. Nothing changed as far as the work life balance since then. My family and friends (and even people who I have interviewed) have all told me I look worn down at times which i believe is a consequence of work.

Financially, I can support myself for several years and I would make every effort to minimize costs where I can. I think it could be an excellent opportunity to take an extended period of time off 3-6 months to enjoy life. There are places I want to travel to, events I want to go to and I’ve already spent a lot of time planning. 

Ultimately I’m finding it extremely difficult to simply pull the trigger and quit. I have a high paying job ($150-175k/year including bonus) with a steady income. On top of this, it’s foolish knowing I have no other job currently lined up. I feel confident in my skill set when I do decide to apply for a job again but it’s scary feeling like there’s a looming recession and employment may become much more difficult to attain.

I’m looking for pros and cons and maybe some guidance if anyone has anything to share from experience.",cdplaya4lyfe,1,1.0,2,1711139107,2024-03-22 20:25:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bl95x6/i_want_to_quit_but_i_cant_proscons_and_advice/,3,2024
1bl92xi,Advice for law graduate who did not pass the bar,"Hello, 

I graduated from law school in 2021 and have struggled with passing the bar ever since. I have worked in a policy job (1.5 years) and a compliance job (1 year) since then. I was recently let go. 

I know I should attempt the bar again but it is expensive and time consuming. I certainly have it in the back of my mind. 

But what can I do as I look for jobs in compliance + policy now? I get a lot of odd looks from banks, insurance companies, government agencies etc. because most people working in policy and compliance don't usually have a law degree. In the previous job I held, I didn't feel like I fit in as everyone was 5-6 years younger than me, fresh out of undergrad/college. 

Any advice on how to best approach this situation is appreciated, including any certifications or skills that would improve my chances. Even advice on how to network, how to explain my situation without coming off as a ""loser"", etc. 

Thank you

Note: I have about 1 year savings to figure this out.

1bl87zj,A risk worth taking ?,"Hello everybody.  Looking for some advice here.   We live in Ontario and I currently work at a pretty much dead end job at a food processing company as a secretary.   

They've asked me to do many other things that aren't part of my job description but since I'm a team player I've done them.  They've now become part of my daily tasks.   
Last year they gave me a 1 percent raise , and scolded me for trying to make environment in the office nicer (secret Santa , decorating, small birthday events ).  

This is a pretty toxic environment, manipulation, sexism, and shit talking runs rampant.   (On international woman's day my HR manager said inappropriate things to me about it being nice that I have whole a day just cuz I have a vagina ) this is just one example.  

I have a job offer with a much much larger company.  Offering much more money, and much better work/life balance, and I much better work environment.   

Problem is.  It's a 1 year contract.  

My thinking is this will open up better opportunities but I have a child and a husband and if I don't have a job it's a problem. 

My husband and I both believe it's a risk worth taking.  Just wanted to hear some other thoughts.

1bl7t3d,Do I stay with my current role (not permanent) or take a pay cut for a larger company? ,"Some context: I work close to home, 5 days in office. I earn a good (not great) salary, pension, benefits, small team that I like, etc. 

My role is good - but due to the nature of the industry (without getting too specific) while I am technically a “full time permanent” employee, I am tied to my boss. When he retires, I am essentially out of a job - and this will likely happen within the next 6-10 years (it’s a 100% guarantee at some point that my job will be gone - this job is not forever, and I took it knowing that ). There’s not a ton of room for growth (if any at all) unless I were to move 1/1.5 hour away to the closest large metro city, which I am not going to do. So it’s not a permanent job, and there’s not much, if any, room to move up and earn more/gain more experience. 

A week ago, a former boss of mine at a previous, different role reached out. He is now a project manager at a large, established company in a medium-sized city 40 minutes from me. He wants to hire me for a role. I find the role appealing, and he was a great boss - but it is a 12 month contract, and I would have to take a pay cut ($5-$7k approx.) initially. The role is hybrid - 50% in office, 50% WFH. 

With this new role, while a contract, there is lots of opportunity to get extended, move to a different role, get permanent, etc. and make more money over time, have more long-term stability. What should I do? Should I take the risk and the pay cut for more long term growth and stability, or wait it out at my current employer?

TLDR: do I stay in a comfortable, decent paying job that will be 100% gone in the next decade, or take a short term contract role, with a pay cut, but that is with a well-established company, with lots of room for growth, with a former boss I really like?

HR then came back with 83k instead. They said that they knew it was 2k short from my expectation but this was the best they could for me. 

I then asked if it was possible for a 2k sign in bonus instead just to at list meet me halfway and they replied instantly saying they have never offered a sign on before and that it was not possible.

1bl705p,Should I go to collage for Civil Engineering or something else?,"Hey everyone! I'm currently diving deep into the sea of potential majors and considering my future career path. I've been closely looking at the [NVCC Programs](https://www.nvcc.edu/apps/advance/programs.aspx?year=2023), with a particular focus on a B.S. in Civil & Infrastructure Engineering, complemented by a minor in Environmental Engineering.

**Ideal Job Traits: A Wishlist for the Future**

I'm envisioning a job that not only fulfills me but also aligns with my personal goals and values. Here's what my ideal scenario looks like: (The more check boxes the better)

* Living and working in urban or suburban settings, despite the higher cost of living.
* Supporting a family of four comfortably.
* Flexibility to work hybrid/remote and sometimes outdoors.
* Opportunities for career advancement.
* Security against being replaced by AI or outsourced labor.
* Contributing positively to society, particularly in environmental and conservation efforts.
* Stability, with the agility to move between companies for better opportunities, especially during economic downturns.
* Freedom to choose between government and private sector roles.
* Travel opportunities, both domestically and internationally.
* Working autonomously or in small, dynamic teams.
* Utilizing design, editing, and markup software.
* Access to entry-level positions post-graduation.

**Education Pathway: A Balanced Approach**

As for my education journey, I'm leaning towards:

* A well-rounded curriculum that challenges without overwhelming.
* A supportive environment with a low dropout rate.
* The ability to secure a job with just a bachelor's degree.

**Fields of Interest: Evaluating Options**

I'm open to exploring several fields, each with its unique appeal:

* **Mechanical Engineering**: The versatility and focus on building societal infrastructure are attractive, though it seems more challenging than Civil Engineering.
* **Industrial & Systems Engineering**: Seems less abundant in job opportunities compared to Civil/Mechanical Engineering.
* **Information Technology**: Not keen on programming, and the job market outlook seems daunting.
* **Marketing Research, Data Analytics, Finance, Accounting, Economics**: Drawn to the analytical and financial aspects, with the potential for high earnings and a relatively easier educational path.
* **Political Science/International Relations**: A broader interest in how societal systems operate and interact on a global scale.

1bl453j,"Despite promises, the new boss exploded everything","I am a marketing department creative director with decades of experience. My boss of many years retired recently and the company hired a replacement for him. During his interview process, the candidate met with our small team and said, ""Don't worry — I'm not the guy who comes in and explodes everything. I think you are doing great work here, and I just want it to continue, and make sure you're happy"". Good, right?

In the short time he's been here, he has ""exploded"" almost everything, from unimportant things like the decoration of our workspace to more important stuff including the organization system of our files to the way we track projects and the definition of our roles. Part of my responsibility is to be the gatekeeper of our brand. Contrary to what he told us while he was interviewing, he is suggesting radical changes to our branding. To be honest, it's much harder to pinpoint anything he \*hasn't\* altered.

He is a nice guy and seems smart, and  I understand that it's his prerogative to do all of this stuff. But I feel deceived by his promise and I don't trust him. I've switched companies before and I knew there would be an adjustment period, but I didn't expect anything like this.

I am approaching retirement age myself. I previously loved my job (it took my whole career to get here and to find/shape a role that really exploits my talent for the benefit of the company and satisfies me creatively) and had no desire to retire. Now, I am just hoping I can hold on for 5 or 6 more years.

Just one example of many:

The previous marketing chief would tell me that the company wanted to push a specific product or service and ask me to come up with creative for it. I would produce 3 or 4 designs (since I grew to understand that he liked options). He would tell me what he liked and didn't like about them and then I would refine the approach until he signed off.

One of the first things that my new boss did was to hand me a detailed sketch of some creative he wanted, down to exactly which elements to include, the text or graphics for these elements, the fonts to use, the line breaks, the colors, and exact placement of everything. (My previous boss explained our working relationship to him, so he was quite aware that this would be a major change.)

I didn't say anything except thank you, then sat down and spent 3 minutes producing the creative to his specifications. But I didn't enjoy it (his design lacked any of the personality we have spent the past 8 years building into our brand but, again, he's the boss).

I am also a supervisor in the department, and I would never hand one of my designers a sketch like this. I've done a good deal of commercial directing, and I know that the worst thing you can do — at least at the beginning of the process — is to tell an actor specifically how to say a line. For starters, it would crush my people's souls. But on a purely selfish basis, I would be depriving myself of the opportunity to exploit the talent and experience of those designers and potentially to be surprised and delighted by something they create that I had never thought of.

I've been in this game a long time. I can change the style of creative I produce to meet his preference, but I'd appreciate the chance to do that. I'd prefer something like, ""I find your designs to be too image-heavy and busy. Can you try something a little simpler, maybe text-based? Show me what you've got!"" over being handed a complete, detailed design to reproduce. 

When I try to talk to him about the big branding changes he wants to make (I always ask people, ""What problem will this solve?"" or ""How will this make things better?"") he is vague. I am open to change, but I don't appreciate change for change's sake. He likes to outsource, and a lot of what he suggests we outsource is stuff that I am responsible for creating.

My stomach has been in knots for weeks. I'm feeling underused, disrespected, and unseen. But it would be hard at this point in my career to move to another company.

He just sent an email asking for one-on-ones with the department leaders so we can talk about our roles, ideas, and job satisfaction. I see this as an opportunity to get on the right track, but I'm also dreading it.

How honest should I be?

1bl3bsl,How to interview after being Fired for performance?,"I was just left go after  year for poor performance. This is my second job out of college. I’ve been in the work force a little under 3 years. 

I was working for a large beverage brand in the cpg space. Over the last year I hit a wall. Some work I really excelled at but I missed small details on other work. It’d be things like font size, decimals displayed, axis labels. 

I’m taking full responsibility for it on my end. I’m pretty disappointed in myself and quite embarrassed. I really want to put together a plan on where to go from here. 

How do I handle this in an interview? I know better than to bad mouth my company and coworkers but I don’t know what to say in an interview. 

I’m worried if I’m totally forthright in an interview I’ll start the next job under a microscope and it will make me a less desirable candidate. 

Do I say I had a personal issue come up?

Do I make up some story about restructuring?

Do I blame complacency and say it won’t happen again?

How would you all handle it?",throwaway2606_,5,1.0,9,1711124694,2024-03-22 16:24:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bl3bsl/how_to_interview_after_being_fired_for_performance/,3,2024
1bl2rmu,Were you where you wanted to be career wise in your late 20s?,"
I’m 27 and realised I’m just nowhere near where I want to be. 

I’m slowly moving in some sort of direction I like. But I’m realising financial reward is also something I see success as and I’m nowhere near where I want to be in that area. 

I wanted a highly technical job and I’ve got that. But I haven’t got the money aspect  and I feel like I’m in the totally wrong industry. 

I feel like I’m almost too late to change without it having a huge impact on my life now. Like I think I’d have to quit, move some where cheaper, do a second masters etc. 

Maybe I’m just over reacting but is this as bad as it feels?

1bl27c2,Career help please!,"Pivot from real estate agent into ?

For a little context; I have been in real estate for 17 years and I have closed everything from farms for millions to small trap houses for $5,000.  Part of my issue and why there is such a gap in the value of properties I have sold is my geography, in western Kentucky it’s really hard to specialize in say commercial, or farmland, or residential only, as there just simply isn’t enough available listings or business in each segment to justify not selling a house because I specialize in commercial.  

With the success has came burnout and a lot of education on things to do and not do as I build my next venture or go to work for a company or brand that I can be all in with.  

Part of my education that has come through self reflection is the fact that I have determined my sales strengths and weaknesses, as well as my strongest marketing abilities.  Below I will say what I am masterful at as well as what I am the worst at in hopes that the people of Reddit can give me some direction. 

Things I suck at:
1.  Top of the funnel marketing to include but not limited to basically all things awareness: billboards, content marketing, etc. 
2.  Calling people when you don’t really have anything to tell them. 
3.  Moving people down from the awareness section to engagement. 

Things I am excellent at: 
1.  Bottom engagement section of the funnel, talking to folks 1 on 1. 
2.  Recognizing opportunities in this stage and grabbing the low hanging fruit and converting them immediately.
3.  Objections handling and patience to hear their objections out. 

Ok, so what would be a career pivot or a niche that pays decent commissions where you could work with warm leads or people you don’t have to warm up.  I’m not looking for anything that is necessarily easy, however I am wanting to work towards my strengths.

1bl1uek,I feel weak ever since my dad died.,"I'm 30 years old and have no drive/ goals anymore,  I have a good job, good team members and I get paid well - but I have no drive to actually move up in my career/ life.

My dad took his life three years ago and before that time I remember being so full of energy and always wanting to strive for more more more - nothing scared me.

I get why my dad did what he did, it took me a while to understand that this is not anybodys fault. It's something he felt he needed to do and I get that now.

6 months after he past, I landed the job I have now. This is the place I always wanted to work throughout my career, I remember being extremely miserable when I started because I felt he was missing out on this experience - he would have gotten a kick out of me landing this job. 2 months into the job and my mental health really started to slip, my manager and HR were kind enough to tell me to take all the time i needed off so I took a little over a month to process my dads death.

I don't really know how to explain it but I see colleagues/ friends go hrough life literally just blazing through and always wanting more. I'm incredibly jealous of the goals they have, I don't have that anymore since my dads suicide. I feel stuck and just want to yell it on top of a mountain that ""I wasnt always this way"" I feel the need to want to explain myself to people sometimes, but I never do. I'd say a good chunk of people at work know what happened to my dad but nobody really knows how to support me and thats fine - because they simply can't imagine themselves in this situation.

I don't know why I'm trauma dumping here, I just feel stuck in my career/ life ever since my dads suicide and It just sucks how hes gone but he also took part of my life with him as well... God only knows what the future holds because I surely have no clue anymore.

Anyways, thanks for listening to my rant... if anyone has any advice or words or wisdom I appreciate it.",BowlingBall_0912,95,1.0,46,1711120969,2024-03-22 15:22:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bl1uek/i_feel_weak_ever_since_my_dad_died/,3,2024

1bl1ag0,Which path is best to enter Humanitarianism?,"Hi everyone!  
  
I've posted this in a few different places as well but in the hopes of getting advice from as many people as possible I decided to post here as well, hope that's alright. I'm currently looking at different Masters programmes in order to enter either development or humanitarianism, although preferably the latter.  
  
For this, I figured that health might be a good way to enter the field. However, I don't have much experience or overwhelming interest in the field, and have been warned by a current humanitarian worker that doctors and healthcare professionals from the 'Global South' would be competing for the same roles as me. This is dissuading me from health slightly, and so I'm now thinking about doing a more open Masters, although I know it is important to specialise to find work.  
  
I am also aware that language skills and experience in areas such as project management are also important, so am considering the opportunities to build these skills alongside study.  
  
And so essentially I have four possible strands to go down in order to get into the field:

&#x200B;

1. Complete a Master in Public Health in Humanitarianism in person over 1 year at LSTM, then hopefully use contacts from there to find a job. There is a small chance of being able to conduct a field-based dissertation in this degree, which I'm very interested in, but it's very competitive. 
2. Complete a Master in Public Health in Humanitarianism online over 2-5 years in a much more internationally renowned institution, LSHTM, and again, hopefully use contacts from there to find a job. This Master in particular caters to those already in the field with a lack of internet access and limited time, and so has no set schedule and adjustable dates. Because of this, alongside my studies I'd like to either find experience working in a local charity, international internships, or even travel to regions of interest and work on my language skills. I have experience travelling in the Middle East and Africa so this appeals to me a lot. This I hope would also make up for the programme being less likely to provide field experience, although they do have links with international organisations that they state may be used for partnerships on an individual student basis if appropriate.
3. Complete a Master in either Humanitarianism or Africa and International Development - less specialised but more broad, both of which also come with the possibility of placements with partner organisations
4. Attempt to find work in local charities/internships and attempt to build experience this way before going for a Masters.

I know, its a lot. The most versatile option is number 2, as in this time I can hopefully build myself as a person, and relevant to experience, and so while I'd gain a degree slower after I gain one I may be more employable. The others are much more specialised.  
  
Also, I've been told many times that networking is very important when doing a Masters. All of these courses have extensive alumni networks, although number 2, while not being in person, has its own platform for alumni to contact each other on. It would also mean meeting different cohorts, although via Zoom calls and WhatsApp, as full time students may choose to take modules within this degree. The cohort of this degree is expected to be 50-60, so although I may not meet them in person it's still a  
large body of people to communicate with. The others are in person, but have often much smaller cohorts and less formalised alumni networks, so regarding networking I'm not sure if it would be better to be in person or not.  
  
I hope this isn't too large of a question to ask. Hopefully from this you'll gather that I've spent a lot of time thinking about this and exploring the various options, and have come to a bit of an impasse. Health as a specialisation I chose somewhat arbitrarily, although I do think it's interesting, and am not sure what else is possible to specialise in via a Masters programme, which I know is pretty much a requirement to work in humanitarianism. Luckily money isn't so much of an issue to me as with a loan, working full time in the holidays, and with friends in all locations providing me with free/cheap accommodation I can essentially choose to go wherever is best for my career",Due-Analysis1347,1,1.0,0,1711119559,2024-03-22 14:59:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bl1ag0/which_path_is_best_to_enter_humanitarianism/,3,2024

1bl0dsv,I am 32F..What kind of work should I do?,"Hi,

Just.. if you feel I have made bad decisions I’d really just prefer constructive feedback.

I did really well in high school and got a full scholarship to college where I majored in psychology and anthropology for my bachelors. You need a masters really to continue with psych which I didn’t pursue.

Upon graduation I just worked in a busy specialty coffee shop in NYC, which helped me get over a lot of my social anxiety. I became a store manager and made a decent salary and learned a lot about the coffee industry, supply chain, etc.

I wanted to live on the West Coast and at 26 I had the opportunity to move to Vancouver, Canada for a while and worked in / managed a cafe there.

I met a guy who did work with boats and shellfish and started doing that during COVID when cafes were ordered closed. I ended up helping manage the business, worked from home a lot, filed applications, did bookkeeping, and went out on boat trips with him to do work. The working on the water part was pretty cool, and the flexibility of being self employed.. but he ended up cheating on me a few times and we broke up.

I am back in my hometown, in the suburbs close to a big metro area, 32 years old… I’d say I regret derailing my “career” for a guy but not sure how much of a career I had..and I really had fun traveling. But I have basically no savings and I have no idea what to do next. I would love to have a home and a family one day .. if I met the right person.

I found a cafe job for now while I adjust to being back.

I am not sure what kind of work to do. I am a little tired of working in the service industry in coffee shops, working late hours and weekends. Maybe I will adjust back to it and this just a grass is greener thing.

But it seems like there are a lot of decent jobs out there, I feel like I could be “good at” a lot of things. I’m kind of exploring my interests.

1bkypri,[24M] Should I talk to my manager about my coworker’s nosiness?,"I’m on good terms with a coworker we’ll call Beth [30F]. We work on different teams in the same department. We’ve recently been mandated to return to the office 5 days a week (though it’s loosely enforced). Beth welcomed this change, much to my annoyance.

Beth often has a lot of free time because she “finishes her work too quickly”. Apparently, she spends a lot of it tracking people’s online statuses, who’s WFH or onsite, and even looking at the current work of other teams. I know this because she often talks me about how she disapproves of people’s “excuses” to WFH. And she also constantly talks to me about the work and online status of another coworker on my team (Nia). 

Now I’ll admit, Nia does not pull her weight, is regularly late, watches YouTube on the company PC, and is currently not adhering to the RTO mandate because our manager is out of town. And is probably just shaking her mouse at home. But somehow, I am more bothered by Beth. I cannot fucking stand nosy people. And I also don’t like how eager she was to return to the office lol.

I had prepared well the expected questions for the role and few questions were similar. However, I fumbled real bad during the interview. I feel that I spoke only in keywords and was incoherent. 

In one question, when asked how will you make your reports do an X task which might be difficult to achieve? I directly said that from my own experience, I had faced a similar issue when a Y task was put in our KPI. I said that during that time, I felt task Y was unethical and shouldn't be done. However, later I understood that Y task was needed to be done. And I had to stop acting reactively and more proactively. That ultimately ended well. So I would tell my reports to just do the job and worry about the outcome later. If needed we will tweak the workflow later if needed.

I’m completely confused and would love some advise:

1. I was headhunted for an exec role by a smaller enterprise company. They’ve offered me more money, a remote role. But it’s a less “cool” and potentially more painful job. 

2. I love my current role. I have a lot of trust in my company, and it’s a key role for the team. My manager and I don’t get along, but that’s not been a problem in terms of my reputation and standing with broader leadership. 

3. After receiving the offer, I mentioned it to my skip manager and manager, saying that while I’ve got this offer, I love my job and would love to find opportunities to grow within my current role. 

4. That has not resulted in a concrete counter offer or even curiosity about what the other role may be. My skip asked for what I wanted - I mentioned career growth in the form of a people manager role and a potential location move. She was very complimentary of my skills etc and said we want you to stay, and said that what I asked for was possible, but only in the medium term - aka end of the year. I didn’t position any of this as a negotiation, and maybe that was the clumsy part. 

5. I want to think that this doesn’t mean I have to quit my job and accept the other role. Our company has been in a tough spot for a bit. We had layoffs recently, and it’s felt like there’s very little room for growth. I don’t know if I’ve shot myself in the foot through this whole episode. 

I’d like to stay, but I’m scared that I’ll be seen as a flight risk/ will lose trust with my team. 

What should I do? Should I take the new offer? Is my current role no longer worth working on?

1bksf7z,Is it appropriate to ask to speak with others on the team after receiving an offer?,"Hello,

I recently applied for a position and had a 30-minute interview with the team lead and two senior teammates. The interview went well and I learned a lot about the role, but I still had a few questions by the end and did not have time to ask since we were going over (i.e. work life balance, etc.) 

I just received the offer letter this morning and was honestly surprised since there was only 1 round of interview. Would it be appropriate for me to reply something along the lines with:

""Thank you so much for the opportunity - I am really excited and look forward to joining the team. Before I accept the offer, would it be possible to connect me with others on the team so that I can learn more about the role and team dynamic?

I go today, and I’m told to fill a 75 ML cup - the only problem is I really didn’t need to pee so I only made it to the 50 ML mark. I ask them if I can get some water and try again, they said no - if I drink water I have to toss that sample and re do it. Whatever, I can’t pee so I do it. Try again, pee even less, and am told that I should just come back and try again tomorrow. I say alright, they call me when I get into my car and say hey get a new code from your employer because you can’t use the one you used today. OK. I email them, they say they’re going to help me, then a little while later I get a call from HR that Quest Diagnostics said that I REFUSED TO TAKE THE TEST!!!! I was in complete shock.

I knew it would be gut wrenching because I am by far the hardest worker at my company. The first year I was there, I received employee of the year and at 1 1/2 years, I was promoted due to taking outside certification tests. 

However, I have consistently found throughout my time there that I am considered the company mule. All escalated or complex cases are passed off to me- to the point where I have the highest case load out of any of my colleagues and I have found that I get paid the least. I received a 2% raise this year and my caseload has continued to grow. 

That being said, I wasn’t actively searching for a new job because of my company culture and all the knowledge I have gained but alas another company came in offering me a 30% raise for a case load that is 10x less, fully wfh, and guaranteed no OT.

I informed my supervisor who told me he needed a minute to process and to talk to some people and he would get back to me. 10minutes later the VP calls and starts offering a 32% raise, to reduce my caseload, and allow me to WFH permanently. I declined (like 10x) and she told me to name my price. I advised my mind was made up but someone has now said “the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t know” and now I’m wondering if I made the wrong choice.

I have told them how overwhelmed I was back in December and they told me they would move some of my cases then which didn’t happen. I feel if they knew they couldn’t lose me, they would have been more proactive in making sure I was compensated fairly. Any opinions or words of encouragement pleaseeee?

1bklw8n,"Got counter offered, need advice","Needed some clarity on whether or not I’m making the right decision.

I’ve been working at Job A for a little over a year as a temp. Pay was decent (51k) and is allowing me to gather some needed EXP on my resume. I have learned a good amount of skills/technologies and I have gotten to the point where I and management know that I am a pretty strong performer and lead the team throughout the week. I get along well with coworkers and am well acquainted within the team. 

However, the commute could be better (usually 30 minutes each way), there was a high amount of turnover (multiple people quitting or being fired due to issues with how our management runs things. I myself have no issues and get along well enough with management), and I feel like my career path is limited if I stayed in that specific position for too long (typical rule for IT field I’m told). I’ve also been directly told that I’ve essentially maximized my current role and to be able to get more access/experience I would need to be directly hired by the company themselves while studying more on the side. I’m already planning on getting a few certs and getting promoted or getting out of this entry tier regardless of whatever happens.



I have a job offer from job B that came in about 2 weeks ago. It is a much smaller company and would be a much smaller team. It is a pay decrease (47k), but is essentially what I’m doing now with a few extra additional responsibilities. It is fully remote though; this caught me off guard as I assumed that remote was something that was ending. So far, they have been transparent with me- they were fine with me needing a 2 week notice, they sent over the teleworking equipment and now all eyes are on my start date next week. Some perks of being remote would be having more time to study, saving on car wear and tear, etc.


Prior to this week, whenever I had asked for or mentioned raises, I would usually be met with firm “no” or “we can’t do that” by both companies. However, when I mentioned a few days ago that I would by ending employment there, it unleashed chaos in all directions. A manager from the temp agency reached out and said he will try his best to get a raise if it means I will reconsider. My own manager got involved and now it has gotten to the point where they counter offered to $62k, effective next week. I directly asked where this money has been all this time, and my manager replied that the temp agency agreed to take a smaller cut of the $$$ in order to retain business and not be left scrambling for a trained replacement.

Now I’m stuck in a limbo where I could stay with Job A and temp agency (both of whom I’ve had good relations with for as long as I’ve known them) for a little longer. Or jump ship to Job B and enjoy remote work while being able to save up money, studying more, and enjoying the perks of remote in the short meantime until jumping ship in a year or less for what I really want to get into? (Security side of things)

How would I go about answering “why did you leave”.

A price then gets put forward by someone in the team, and it’s now my job to explain it and quantify it to the client, even when I know it’s wrong, making me look the fool.

1bkiwzp,Career Decision Dilemma: Balancing Opportunity and Loyalty,"Hello everyone, I'm a 25-year-old guy.
I have been working in the HR department as an assistant for around 3 years.

Where I handle the leaves for the group and release or stop salary action from the leaves side only, and please note that I don't have any degree.**

Everything was going with flow until today. 

The group manager called me and, my manager (his boss), and he said to me that within the group someone is resigning and the job opportunity/change is available. 

So would you join there under new manager and different section under hr, and we will give you increment the day you will join there.

Now I'm confused, as the current manager has taught me everything from a to z.

The current manager was like i have to find a replacement and you (i/me) have to train him and verify his payroll leave-related work for some months until the new employee will be adjusted.

The current manager told me that he will not let me go but he said when the group manager said about the increase in salary.
It is your right and your decision as the increment is involved..


Please advise, thank you...

1bkin5v,Stay in current role or switch to trader ops?,"Looking for some guidance.

  
Background for context: BSc Mathematics from a non-target UK university, graduated with a First Class.

  
I am beginning an interview process for a Junior Energy Operator role at Hartree  Partners, London. From what I understand this'll be a trade ops role running admin work for a team of around 15 traders. They advertise a maximum salary of £35,000. I need to get an idea on career prospects if I decide to fully invest myself  into this process since I'm currently employed at another  company (completely unrelated to commodities/trading/quant work)  also making £35,000 a year.

  
My current job is pretty stress-free and I  basically always work from home, and do next to nothing except when  necessary, allowing me the freedom to learn and do what I want 90% of  the time. However, this is a pretty boring job. I work for a small team that got acquired by a global analytics company,  building/training classifiers. I use a tailor-made platform to flag  positive/negative documents which then train an AI to detect similar  ones from a database. This work is tailored to customer's needs. It is  not engaging at all and doesn't require any analytical knowledge  whatsoever. There's a client-facing side to this role, in which I  present results etc, and in the future will be given my own accounts.

  
I  honestly don't know what career progression looks like beyond becoming a  full fledged consultant working with clients etc, which I don't see  myself doing. I've used the time granted to me by this job to up-skill by developing  several technical projects in C++ and python in the hopes of jumping jobs. A  considerable silver lining is that recently I was given access to their  global SQL database which has afforded me the freedom to experiment  with data analysis and build whichever projects I want, from whatever data I can use from their database.

  
I keep asking myself if it'd be worth the career change given I'd be paid the same amount. What would my future prospects look like? Will I be stuck as a crappy  assistant for the front office team forever? Could this role lead me to pivot to more lucrative positions? Is it worth negotiating a higher salary given my programming knowledge, and if so, what would a sensible amount be to ask?

  
Another super important thing to consider is that I'm planning on going back to study a good master's at a top university come September 2025, to potentially get into a quant position. For this reason, maybe it'd be better to have Hartree on my CV rather than the current company I work for, as I feel the experience gained would be much more relevant for my future applications than what I'm currently doing.

  
Thank you all in advance and I look forward to hearing your opinions.",_y0shi_guy,1,1.0,0,1711058010,2024-03-21 21:53:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bkin5v/stay_in_current_role_or_switch_to_trader_ops/,3,2024

1bki9nr,"Mentally career stuck, what do I do?","Hey all, I’m not necessarily the best at writing this type of stuff nor asking for advice so please bear with me. I’m stuck in a mental dilema and I’m not exactly sure what to do which is why I’ve came here.
 To start things off I am M25 and my Fiancé is F27. She is currently 16 weeks pregnant with our first born. Due date is late August / Early September range. She is set in her career as a dental Hygenist (9 years in dental as a whole) and I am an IT data hall engineer. We make OK money for where we live (North East US) and have very minimal debt (small CC revolving debt + $50k on our condo mortgage). 
Here comes the issue, I hate my job. I’ve been here for 6 years and I’ve seen minimal growth and small pay increases over the years with a lot of other company pros + cons.  I am the number 1 on my team and everyone under and above comes to me for various issues or concerns etc. I work with management, consulting, and many other teams/ outside personnel daily while still managing my own tasks (which is outside my description but OK I think?). My direct manager has been beating around the bush for years now with promoting me into some form of direct management and/or project management but there always seems to be some (BS) reason as to why “it’s not the right time.” Meanwhile, I consistently exceed expectations, receive commendations for my work + “attitude” and go above and beyond to make myself stand out from the rest. Yet I am treated like the rest down to the core.  There is a lot more of the typical work-place jibberish that you all could probably assume happens so I don’t want to bore you or ramble. I don’t know if I’m being delusional or just plain complaining, but I’ve now started to develop a feeling of dread coming to work.  I look at my fellow team that does minimal work and minimal effort while I bust my ass everyday to receive the same raises and praise and harbor overall anger in my body.  I do not feel it towards them, if it works for them I am truthfully happy because they’ve figured out how to work the “Work
System.” There are some pros, I get generous PTO (30 days per calendar year) and I’m fully paid whether I come in early or leave late with compensation for any overtime.  Also due to being who I am, I can sometimes dictate what tasks I will or will not do (within reason + emphasis on sometimes). I just feel like I’m not individually valued as an employee and truthfully it sucks. 
This was my first company post community college so I don’t know if I’m still too young and naive to realize what I have here or is it time to look elsewhere for anything related or not. Where I specifically live, there are very few Data Hall jobs and it is the only field I know since I got my Associates degree so it is hard to look for other work. I have recently went back and have began the journey to get my Bachelors degree in Business Management with a minor in Information Systems. To trail back to above as mentioned my fiancé is pregnant.

Considering looking around and applying to Project management or any management really in the IT field (it’s mostly hybrid and remote from what I’ve seen/heard)(It also would pay a lot more).

I just want to hear some advice from any and all who will share. Sorry for the rant and its potentially unstructured content.

1bkhuj8,Torn with new Offer,"I'll try to be brief.

  
Been working at my current company for 10 years.  Have done great things for them and they really like me (I'm in IT).  That said, the company has struggled of late and I've been promoted only once and have gotten paltry raises.  Also, the culture at the company is pretty rough (giant company that runs things extremely lean).  Anyway, the job I do itself is not fulfilling and I constantly assume new work and am a manager (which I don't like) and a HUGE amount of work is coming up (but not a lot of pay).  
So, I started looking and recently was offered a job at a different company that essentially matches what I make now, is less responsibility, and is in an industry that is more interesting to me (still a big company).    


I accepted their offer and went to quit my current job, but, was told by my supervisor's boss that they don't want me to go and now they may be willing to offer me up to 30% more than my current salary (I came up with that number when they asked me if giving me more money would allow me to stay).  They are working on details, but, there is a chance I get that, which scares me because I think my boss might make my life a living hell and I'm kind of checked out.  
Here's my dilemma.  I'm not excited about staying put at all and even though my new job and company may suck, I feel I owe it to myself to try it....But...I do like money, and I can tell my wife likes the idea of me making way more money.

1bkhkbb,Is it unfair that my hours are cut so that another coworker can make up hours for company benefits?,"Hey, so, at first, I didn’t really think nothing of it, but a coworker of mine has been getting allot more hours than me so that he can qualify for company benefits before his 1 year anniversary. 

I reached my 1 year anniversary a couple months ago, and I got there because I didn’t call out once. Not that I’m overdriven or anything, but I really had no reason to call out. Now, I suppose it wouldn’t matter to me if we weren’t part time, but bc we are, hours are you usually a make or break for the end of the month to support bills n rent. As a consequence, I’ve been feverantly looking for a second job. 

The whole process has been positive, actually. I’m excited to some of the places I’ve applied and have my fingers crossed. But, another coworker had brought it to my attention that i was having less hours because of the coworker aforementioned, and another (other) coworker has updated her availability, which means my hours take another hit. So, it got me thinking…

I have not called out once, I get on very well with all my coworkers and bosses, and I’ve only ever had a few issues during my employment- which were technical corrections rather than serious oversights, if you will. 

But the other coworker has had a history of calling out, switching shifts or going on long vacation periods. Does anyone have any advice/ insights?

Background: I am currently done with coursework and really on the tail end of my analysis prior to starting the writing process of finishing up my M.S. thesis. It's been a long road and I'm glad that I have stuck it out this far. The plan is to defend at some point over this upcoming summer.  
  
I recently got a great job offer at a very competitive salary with a company that wants invest in me in terms of certifications, trainings, etc. in a location that I would be happy to live. It's pretty much the ideal opportunity at this current point in my career. More than anything I want to say yes, but the job would start in the next few weeks and I'd have to move partway across the country. They fully understand that I want to finish my M.S. and would allow me vacation time to defend, write, whatever.  
  
The flexibility on start date is only a couple of weeks sadly.

My advisor and I don't have the best relationship, he is quite busy and relatively uninterested in my specific work. I would be happy to move into a part time role and would no longer need to be paid, I just want to take the job and also get my M.S.

1bkg49l,How to manage changing sector (from govt/charity to private) and changing profession/function (from policy to other)?,"I'm mid-career and all my significant experience has been in govt agencies and not for profits. My previous jobs have ranged across research, strategy, programme management, and public policy (most recent). And I've mostly worked at science and technology organisations, though my academic background is arts/humanities. I've thrived off change and new challenges, but probably wouldn't be suited to environments that are slow, conservative or hierarchical. Am in the UK, but happy to move if there was relocation support.  
  
In order of aspirations:  
  
(1) I would love to move to the private sector to increase my earnings. Despite my career stage, my savings and pension contributions are very low and I'm not yet a home-owner. (Did a PhD instead...)  
  
(2) I would love to move away from policy to strategy or programme management. Policy is often a ""subject matter expert"" role which can get narrow, whereas strategy and programme management feels like they might create more options for the future through transferable skills.  
  
Possible blockers for these:  
  
(3) Private sector careers seem to be functional (eg Comms professional, Product professional) rather than by transferable skills? So as a generalist, I don't know if I can compete against folk whose CVs are focussed on a specific function / profession. (Flexible generalists seem to be more the norm in govt and not-for-profits, because of being under-resourced.) Maybe some sort of Consultancy?  
  
(4) Might be hard to change sector and function at the same time? In which case - which should I change first?  
  
I'd be grateful for advice on managing the change, and also to hear from anyone who has done something similar - especially anyone who has switched out of policy, or switched from govt/charity sector to private sector.",Tchoqyaleh,1,1.0,0,1711051853,2024-03-21 20:10:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bkg49l/how_to_manage_changing_sector_from_govtcharity_to/,3,2024

I placed a PO for a rush shipment but didn't realize that it was prepaid. And in their defense, they did email too to say it was prepaid but the email got lost in my ever growing inbox. Well, I end up forgetting about it. Well a week or two passes and I get asked where it is, I tell them ""oh let me follow up it should be here"". That's when I find out it was prepaid. I authorize a rush shipment but it's too late, my manager is being screamed at which leads to me being scolded. I call the company to ""pick them up"" but they are already on a truck which will take 3 days.

1bkf7r9,Route to mental health career?,"
Hello. Im just curious on what master’s some of you have gotten that have led you to where you are? Like the routes you are taking/have taken?

I have a BA in psychology and am currently looking into master programs. I always said I wouldn’t go to grad school when I graduated undergrad in 2021, but I changed my mind after working at a crisis stabilization unit. I worked with alot of mental and behavioral health professionals like LCSWs, PMHNPs, LPCs, BCBAs, Psychologist, etc. There was a little bit of everything. Working there made me realize why I fell in love with psychology, again.

My goal is to become a Psychologist with a focus on ABA(possibly). There was one that worked where I worked (The crisis stabilization unit) and she was absolutely amazing. 

Now you maybe wondering why I want to be a psychologist? Well, there are alot of reasons. I like assessments: I’ve had the privilege of watching some assessments being completed and learning about them through both my past work and school. I like research. I like the idea of figuring out why we do the things we do and how these thoughts have an impact on our emotional well-being. I also have an interest in behaviors and how certain mental illness and use of substances have an impact on our thought processes and how we function. I’m in an abnormal psychology class right now and it’s- by far- my favorite class.

 I understand that some go straight out of undergrad into their PhD. That’s just not how the cards are rolling for me. My GPA is fair and the only research experience I have is what I did in undergrad for classes like experimental psych and for my advanced capstone over grandparents families. I’ve tried for over a year to get into a RA position at colleges around me (UK, WKU, UofL) but I’m have no luck. They’re either not taking anyone for their labs right now or they are not responding. I like the experience and know I would have no shot getting into a PhD program, right now. I’m trying the best that I can. I’m currently taking classes at a community college to get my GPA up a bit, as well as gain recommendation letters.

I’ve talked to some people who have many degrees: one who got a masters in ABA and a PhD in Clinical Psych, one who got a PsyD and became an PMHNP as well, one who is an LCSW and a PMHNP, one who got a masters in CMHC and got into a PhD Clinical Psychology program but then decided not to go. 

I know a master’s is my best bet, but in what?
I’m curious on the path’s that people have taken! 
Also, If you have any idea on what other careers sound like it would be up my alley, I’m open to suggestions!

1bkeodj,"Based on my Strengths & Weaknesses, what sort of job would suit me?","I took a career analysis test on [jobtest.org](https://jobtest.org).

My strongest traits are Time Management and Attention to Detail. Other strengths are Problem Solving, Strategic Thinking, Communication Skills, and Organizational Skills.

My biggest weaknesses are Financial Management, Marketing Knowledge, Statistical Analysis, Computer Proficiency, and Technical Skills. It also said my presentation skills were weak, but I personally think they are average or slightly below average.

I am 31, male, and have a BFA in Fashion Styling (yes that’s a real major, yes it’s completely unnecessary for the field; wish I knew that before getting the degree, but I was young and dumb). I have experience as a freelance fashion stylist and assistant to other stylists for photo shoots and events. I also have almost 6 years of retail experience at a fast fashion store in the men’s sales, kid’s sales, and online orders departments. Mostly the online orders department. Our store is the best in the region (the NYC metro which includes NYC, North Jersey, and Connecticut) for online sales, despite being a smaller New Jersey store. This is mostly due to me and the small team I’ve trained being extremely productive in that department. Still only making $17.85 (the maximum for sales associates) an hour and part time.

I hate the instability of freelance styling and assisting. Been trying to get more into a high end retail sales role. I’ve had interviews with Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus, but I am open to other careers as well. Live in the NYC metro, but would prefer something within a 30 minute drive from my suburban North New Jersey home.

1bkej77,Drama at work. Not sure what to do next.,"I (35f) work as a supervisor overseeing the clerical unit at a law office. The clerical team has one senior office assistant, four office assistants, and two extra help staff.

I’ve been at my position for the last year a half. When i first started, my direct manager informed me that there may be some tension because the senior office assistant (let’s call her H) had applied for the supervisor position but didn’t get it. During my first two weeks at the job, H did not really talk to me, she would walk by my office and didn’t say a word. I was trained by another supervisor who worked at one of our other offices, she told me that H is really nice and just takes her awhile to warm up.  I eventually got along with H and I thought we would be able to work together and collaborate on projects and processes to improve the work flow. I was wrong.

H’s sister works in our office as the office manager (we’ll call her P). 

Over the last few weeks, I’ve had to make some pretty tough decisions, between letting go of one of the extra help staff, moving another staff member to a different office, etc. 

Last week, one of my staff members let me know that H was telling another co worker how I play favorites, and that basically if I don’t like someone, i send them to a different office. First of all, the managing partners and hr make the final decisions on staff moves, second of all, being moved to another one of our offices isn’t a bad thing. My other staff confirmed that H was going around spreading false info. 

I talked to H about what I heard. She asked me who told me this info, i didn’t give specifics and she blew up and said that whoever told me is a huge liar. I let her know that any gossiping or spreading of misinformation will not be tolerated. She started crying and walked off, she immediately ran over to her sister, P. I should add: i had a conversation with each of my staff regarding gossiping and spreading of misinformation and how it needs to stop. HR was made aware and i made sure to document it all.

P walked by desk and gave me such a nasty stare. Since then, P will blatantly ignore me, but chooses to be super nice to other clerical. It’s uncomfortable. h and i will have very little to no small talk unless it’s absolutely needed for us to talk.

not sure how to move forward..

1bkdufq,"Considering to leave audit profession to pursue studying Chinese, thoughts?","Hi looking for some insights and advice on my career plans.

Background: I'm a CPA in the audit field nearing 2 years of experience  I'm not really happy with the stress, long hours, and no work-life balance every year during our Busy season, but on the bright side, there's a lot of opportunities gaining experience from this. But I can't really see myself to be in this industry for long and I'm considering other plans.

Plan:  One of the plans I'm considering is to pursue my passion, which is to study Chinese, become fluent, and pursue a career related to being a bilingual. I have a deep desire to be fluent in the language so I have been learning the language the past years through local learning centers and self-study. Currently, I assessed myself to be on the conversational level. So I believe what can help me is an intensive learning program and an opportunity to practice the language.

Opportunity: Recently, I came across an opportunity offered from various universities from China/Taiwan offering a 1 year Chinese learning program. they also offer Scholarship which covers the tuition fee, accomodation, and some fixed living allowances if granted. I'm definitely going to apply for this. The earliest the program I can apply starts on September 2024 or if later then in 2025

Dilemna:
Ideally I have to get the scholarship to make the financials worries less. But i have saved an educational fund for this kind of opportunity which can cover the tuition fee if at worst I can't get a scholarship. I also have some other savings and emergency fund left.
But grabbing this opportunity also means leaving my job, spend a significant amount of my savings, and take a gamble on myself on where this venture will take me in the future. 
I am heavily considering this since aside that it's my passion, I have this optimism that if I succeed in this venture, having Chinese proficiency plus my work experience will help me lead to more opportunities. 

Objectively, is this a good decision to pursue? 
Assuming the tuition fee is the same and there's scholarship, where is better to study, in China or Taiwan?
Maybe you can also give advice on what can I do to earn after I resign while I pursue this passion of mine. 

Thank you for reading this long post. I hope you can give me advice.",Jukujo_Hunter,1,1.0,0,1711046269,2024-03-21 18:37:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bkdufq/considering_to_leave_audit_profession_to_pursue/,3,2024

1bkdgji,Is workplace culture worth 10k/yr?,"Hey all, I am a new grad, and have two job offers pending.

One is with the company I currently work for as a Linux infrastructure platform admin. The culture is great, everyone is very friendly. Pay is 70k/yr. The manager is known within the company to be a good person in general.

The other is with the canadian military. It pays 10k more (~81k/yr), however I am very worried about the culture. It's for an IT project manager position.
The interview process was non-existent and I was basically the only candidate. It's taken them 6 months just to get me the offer. When I visited the base, I noticed the workplace is overwhelming male (despite my username, I am a trans women, still working on it lol). There were unhappy construction workers doing visibly unsafe work right at the guest check in. My interactions with HR have been mediocre to negative, between them giving wrong instructions and being generally a little rude. Benefits are slightly better though.

I have two main concerns; I love technical work as much as I love ""people"" work, and I fear project management will complete remove me from this.
Second, obviously, the culture seems not great at the military.
Third, the money and career growth. 10k more feels like a lot coming from being a broke student! Project manager feels like a great title to make me qualified for a lot of future roles, but so does infrastructure platform admin.

tl;dr: Do I trade ~10k for an unknown quantity of culture and career growth?

1bkc9u2,Can't find an appropriate way to make a living,"Long story short. I've tried a variety of jobs in my life, but in my country, employers tend to squeeze the last drops of your sweat for a cent (they wouldn't give you one if they could). Since the inflation has began it is kinda getting really depressing to keep working for extremely low salaries. I've opened a small business at the moment, as i did a few years ago, but the situation here is getting worse each day, the math is not working anymore as it used to be. The business partner, who is responsible for earnings has no clue how much everything costs in my country at the moment. But as I said I don't want to tell my whole story now I just really need Your advice. I know i'm really good at automotive spare parts sphere (i used to work in spare parts shop as a sales manager) I was able to find every imaginable thing possible from the schemes and client comments given (my colleagues would never spend time looking for such things) I help my friends diagnosing problems with their cars and help them solve it (for some of them im the first guy on their contact list even if we live in different cities). I have two cars and I don't know when was the last time I gave it to a mechanic. I do stuff on my yard by my own. The last time i changed a timing belt kit on my DOHC car. I'm too slow to work as a mechanic (i did work as a diesel mechanic once), since i love everything to be done precisely and just perfect so spare parts sale manager is probably the best choice for me. Now there is another question. I live in Europe and I would like to try to work for the US companies remotely for example. Or for some other company outside my country that would valuate my efforts. I actually love chatting more than receiving calls, so it would be perfect for me to contact clients in such form. Is this possible or not?

1bkc36s,"I was offered a ""confidential"" yearly bonus with an accompanying NDA","I'll try to keep this as vague as possible.

Our company recently conducted its annual performance review for 2023, which involved filling out a self-assessment form followed by 1:1 meetings with our manager to discuss the grade we were given. At those individual meetings, it was announced (to all employees apparently) that due to the financial constraints of the company, nobody will be paid their yearly bonus. Obviously, everybody was outraged and we ended up deciding to consolidate our concerns and questions regarding the review process and submitting them to the company. 

2 days later, I was called to the COO's office. To my surprise, I was told that I would be an exception to the bonus freeze, with strict instructions to keep this information strictly confidential, emphasized at least 3 times. Taken aback by this, I could barely react, so I just said ""thank you"" and left. Today, HR sent me the bonus agreement, together with an NDA form I have to sign, requiring me to keep all information regarding this (performance review process, bonus, etc.) completely confidential.

I do need some extra money but I feel extremely uncomfortable accepting this, resenting the secretive nature of how it's being done and shutting me up about it with an NDA. I am still extremely unhappy with how the performance review was handled, and I feel like I'm participating in something unethical. Another important detail is that at the 1:1 meeting I was given an average performance grade, accompanied by the explanation that there are (unfortunately) only a couple of people in the company who can receive an excellent grade and I wasn't one of them. This further shows that the grades we were given are completely pointless and the company offers bonuses under the table to a number of people (""high performing employees"" they say but this is not reflected in the performance grade). 

I'm extremely conflicted about whether I should accept this and the company is pushing me to sign the document + NDA form by tomorrow.

1bkavzn,Engineering License / Career Question,"Would a PE license in one field lock me in that industry?

I got my mechanical BSME degree a few years ago and worked a rotational engineer program after that, and eventually ended up in this civil structural engineering team as I found it to be the closest in relation to mechanical engineering (out of the different roles in my company since it’s an electrical substation company) and would give me related experience I could transfer over to mechanical again later on (for example, structures in aircraft and aerospace).

My heart still lies in mechanical engineering, which I intend on switching to in a year or so. The reason I haven’t already switched over is that my partner is in medicine and will be matching into residency in the next year, and this structural engineering position is remote and has allowed me to chance to live where I want, which will be crucial when we move in the next year. My plan was to stay in this position until they match for residency, and then look for a new mechanical engineering job in the new location we move to, but recently my boss has approached me asking me if I’d like to go ahead and take the civil structural PE exam so that I can get it out of the way.

Would going through with taking the civil structural PE exam later hurt my chances at getting back to the mechanical field in a year and a half? I know that within the mechanical fields, a PE is not used that much outside of HVAC, which I am not interested in going into - while the civil structural PE license opens you up to a whole new world of structural design etc. So, my assumption is that the civil structural PE will be more useful in the long run anyway and may be more worth to take, but I am also anxious that I may lock myself into a career path I did not intend in the beginning.

I would love to do structural work in the context of machines and spacecraft/aircraft. Buildings are fine too but I am really only in this area at the moment to collect relevant experience to do similar work in a mechanical environment. I also am intending to do a masters degree in mechanical engineering anyway once I switch into a mechanical role.

I’m generally an anxious personal and I over analyze the future so I wanted to get some thoughts/reassurance from the internet. I can’t really control my location situation at the moment due to my partner’s career in medicine, so please let me know what you think:

Will taking the civil structural PE exam hurt my longer term career eer path in mechanical engineering?

1bkal3u,"I hate my job, I need advice","I hate my job and need advice

Hey, I have been working as a contracted engineer for a big automotive company for about 6 months and I hate it. I took the job since it was the first place to get back to me and I knew that I wanted to be in the automotive industry (New Grad). 

There are major three reasons why I hate it. 

1. I feel like I have too much free time where I’m not doing anything but sitting waiting for my day to end. I just kind of feel like I’m wasting time and the day goes by so slow.

2. I feel like the work I get is not difficult. It’s not that I am smart by any means, but I feel like I’m barely learning anything. (Please don’t think I have some sort of superiority complex)

3. (Biggest Reason) Since I am contracted, I don’t really feel like I am part of the team (Left out of a lot of social events and I don’t have a desk that is designated for me so I just go away in some other area). Kinda feel like I’m treated as an outsider. Maybe there is some hope at the end where I can get out of contract, but the last one who did it took them 4 years. It pays well imo, especially since I just graduated college, it pays my bills and helps me save for random stuff and retirement, but I always come into work feeling like I hate this place.

What should I do? Find a new job, hope that I will be out of contract, talk to my higher ups?

1bkaf2m,Engineer Burnout: Finding the Sweet Spot Between Design Work and Work-Life Balance?,"Hi fellow redditors!

**TL;DR:**

I'm a very burnt-out early-career mechanical engineer trying to find life balance and pick a career path forward. I like design work, but can't figure out how to make it sustainable.

**Background:**

I graduated college 2 years ago with a BS in ME and a minor in CS and started working immediately after graduation. I work at a small company (the name of which I'd rather not mention) as a mechanical engineer primarily doing design work. We do engineering design services for pretty much anyone doing pretty much anything. My job is highly technical. Typically my workflow is: get given a project and told who the client is, go meet with them to figure out what they need, design it, order it, make it, test it, deliver it, document it, etc.

In terms of experience, it's everything I could have ever dreamed of for a starting position. I have been given just as much responsibility and design work as every other engineer in the company, and my work ranges from machine design to hydraulics, pneumatics, microfluidics, high-precision calibration tools, manufacturing equipment, and robotics. I also get to do minor machining jobs from time to time in addition to software engineering work, so quite varied. I've done really well at my job and receive glowing performance reviews. I don't regret picking the job as a first position.  


**The problem:**

I am so, incredibly exhausted and don't see how that's going to change in my current role. I'm performing really well, but simply cannot seem to keep to 40 hours a week. I feel like I'm constantly working overtime, and a lot of it. I feel like there's always a design that takes way longer than you expect or your Solidworks won't stop crashing or a client review to prepare for early the next morning or...a million other reasons. I go to work the majority of days not knowing if I'll be home by 5:00 or 10:30+. Living and working like this is simply not sustainable long term.

Part of this is definitely due to the type of work I do and clients we work with, but given that I've seen some (not all, but quite a few) people at my job manage this pretty darn well I know that part of it is me. I'm afraid that because of this I might be in the same predicament anywhere I go, and so I need to be very careful about how to pick my next role.

&#x200B;

**My personality type:**

I value routine probably more than anything else in my life. I meal prep all my meals for the week, go to bed super early any time I'm back from work early enough to do so, and if I had a fixed schedule I would wake up every day at 5:00 and workout for 2 hours before work (I was regimented like this for a short period when work died down and it was fantastic). 

I work really, really hard in whatever I do and am detail oriented to the point that it gets annoying to me that I can't let stuff go (and is probably a contributor to why I work so many hours). I definitely don't feel like I'm anything special when it comes to smarts, but I'm no dummy either -- I had the highest GPA in my graduating engineering class, but that was probably just because I would pour every waking moment into studies. 

I love to build stuff at home -- I have a laser cutter, a vinyl cutter, a 3D printer, a large set of hardware and fasteners, tools, etc. I like making stuff, and my work has made me a better at that. I do enjoy learning about cool mechanical systems and building up technical design skills when it's not stressful. Recently I've had less than zero interest in this due to how burnt out I feel.

I am the least bored person I know. If I won the lottery tomorrow I would quite my job and pursue about 50,000000000 hobbies I never seem to have the time for.

&#x200B;

**My dream role:**

I'm terrified of going into some role where you let all your skills dull and just stagnate or are good at something only the company you're at actually cares about. I want to stay employable throughout my life. On the very, very seldom occasion that a project at my current work doesn't have to be completed on a fast schedule or budget, I also enjoy the design work quite a bit and find some enjoyment learning about new systems and designs. I am not set on doing design for sure, it just seems great if I can find balance in it. If I felt confident I'd stay employable in a non-design field of engineering I'd be fine switching.

**I want to go to the office, work hard for 8 hours and genuinely contribute, and feel 100% okay with leaving at whatever stopping point I get to and go enjoy the rest of my day. That's it -- I would be the happiest person ever with this.**

I don't want to be freaking out that I need to spend 6 extra hours working on something that evening because someone didn't give me information I needed until the end of the day, or because Solidworks decided to have a bad day and crash 10 times, or that we just found out an item from our design just went out of stock and we have to re-do the design TONIGHT otherwise we won't be able to meet schedule.

**Question to all of you:**

I'd love to hear about your guy's experience with design work and balance. Is it really the case that I have to pick between jobs that make your skills dull but give good work-life balance and jobs that let you learn at the expense of working overtime?  


I'm curious if any of you have managed to navigate this successfully, especially if you were struggling in this area at one point in your life.

1bkadem,Career Advice,"I am in my mid-20s and graduated from college a few years ago, studying Business and Communications. I have been working in an HR entry level position between 1 -2 years at a midsize organization with a small HR department.  
There are several elements I enjoy about the current situation, such as:  
Data-driven projects, satisfaction from helping employees, hybrid work environment, 40-hour workweek expectation (Monday – Friday), extremely limited travel, job security, quiet office environment, individual office space, opportunity to advance education  
However, there are some downsides in the current situation, including:  
No opportunity for advancement, lack of challenge, limited flexibility of daily work hours, few  
employees who are my age  
There is nothing driving me away from the current situation immediately, though the consistent lack of challenge and advancement opportunities has me interested in exploring other options. I have obtained industry certification and do not have full-time professional experience outside of HR. I am open to career opportunities outside of the HR field.  
I have researched and applied for various HR positions (mostly Generalist-type positions) in my  
geographic area with no success. I am somewhat interested in higher education and have explored  
college academic advising, college career advising, etc. as options; unfortunately, I have not read many positive reviews of these professions. In taking career assessments, I have identified an interest in Conventional career types.

1bk9fpa,"Going for my Masters, but how can I make good use of my Bachelor in the meantime?","I'm currently about to graduate for my bachelor in HR. After my Bachelor i'll go for a Masters in the same field. It will take me about 1.5 years to complete but I don't know if I can (and should) make good use of my Bachelors in the meantime.

&#x200B;

I was thinking about sticking around at my current internship, but today I heard it wasn't possible because the company lacks the budget. I could try and search around for a summer job in HR, but I don't even know if positions like that exist. I think they're very rare to be honest. On top of that I only have 4 weeks in which I can work. After that I have to go back to university.

&#x200B;

I could set myself up to be more attractive by sticking around as a part-time function of 8 hours per week. But this is risky. First of all I'm the first one in my family who goes for a Masters. I don't know how hard it will be or if I'm even capable to do it. This makes me hesitant to such propositions. On top of that my school schedule will vary wildly, so it might be possible that I won't be able to work during certain semesters.

&#x200B;

I already have a side job that pays well, but it's just a basic job in a distribution centre. I feel like it will be a waste of my degree if I don't make use of it in the meantime while going for a Masters. I also might set myself up to be less attractive for future employers if I don't get some work experience at the same time. I also have 1.5 years of experience as an intern right now and this experience will slowly go away over time if I don't keep working in the field. On the other hand the side job is exactly what I need. I work on saturdays, I can work a bi-weekly schedule and it's very easy to take a day or week off. I can also choose to work more if I have the time.

1bk94wr,Career change out of engineering ,"I am a 25 year old female chemical engineer working at an EPC firm. I got this job straight out of college and have worked here for 3 years. I enjoyed my this position at first, I think because I was learning new skills, and then it became repetitive and mind numbing. In college I had 2 internships: process engineer at a chemical plant and material development R&D engineer. I hated working in the plant, literally dreaded going into work. The R&D job was better but still was glad when it was over.  

I somewhat enjoyed school, I think due to the fact that I was learning new things, but I was never particularly interested in chemical engineering specifically. I chose engineering because I am smart in the math and sciences, and because my dad was an engineer. It was a practical choice because I knew it would lead to a stable career. I had a creative side growing up, I even went to an art high school for some time. I really enjoyed creating things with my hands but I was deterred from pursuing anything creative as a career from my parents. 

Now I am at a crossroads: I am incredibly unfulfilled by my job and it’s driving me insane sitting at this desk 8 hours a day doing work that feels meaningless. The pay and benefits are fantastic, but I feel no passion for this. I look at the senior level engineers and have no desire to be in their positions one day. Since I have no passion for this, I also feel as though I’ll never be as technically proficient as some of the higher level engineers because I don’t care enough to retain the knowledge required. 

I am thinking about straight up quitting my job to do something, anything, different. I am at the point where working as a barista even sounds more appealing than this. My husband could support the both of us financially while I figure out what I want to do, but money will be tight. We have no kids, so that helps. 

I am wondering if anyone has felt this way about their career as an engineer and if they made a change. Is it too late for me to be thinking about a career change? Is it normal to feel this way? Am I just being impractical and annoying?

1bk8do1,I was hired to work for a very small IT business and my boss has been extremely difficult to reach since I started?,"I’m working in IT as a specialist for an MSSP. I worked in IT at my last job but it was very niche (backend GIS) and though there are transferable skills, it did not prepare me fully for what I’m doing here. Also, every organization is different and uses different systems and configurations so I will always need some time to get up to speed. My educational background is unrelated. 

The company basically consists of myself, my manager, an assistant, and an intern. So the only person who can train me is my manager. 

The thing is, he’ll disappear in the middle of us doing something. This is only my second week so I still need a little bit of presence from him for now. He won’t respond to any of my messages and will just send me a paragraph of what he’s expecting me to do that day, assuming I understand all of it and he disappears.

Certain things I’m doing actually require he be present so when he disappears, I’m no longer able to continue. As an example, we were going to enforce MFA for a client yesterday, which I have not done on my own and I’m just getting access to all of the admin portals we use, so it would be risky for me to do it without him. He just fell off the map, possibly he did it on his own without me, but that was important training for me. We both work remotely in different cities so I handle his local clients here in person when needed and otherwise am at home. That’s the plan anyways.

There’s no documentation or a training portal or anything like that. I have some experience in technical writing and I love to write so I have been working on our documentation. And I can ask ChatGPT questions and look up documentation to read. So I don’t want the impression to be that I can’t occupy myself and figure some things out, I can. But I hate being thrown to the wolves so early on because I’m conscientious and I’m inevitably going to make more mistakes than I otherwise would and I’m very hard on myself for that. 

I actually like this job. It’s very unique. I was specifically targeting MSP’s and MSSP’s in my search because I want to work with many different types of clients in different environments. I think my bosses trajectory is also very interesting and I am excited to learn more from him. But I am one of his first onboards so I think this is all new to him. Is there anything beyond what I’m already doing that could possibly make this process smoother for myself and also future hires?

1bk7ykl,Colleague got a higher raise than me for same experience ,"So this is my first full time professional job, none of my family are in the same type of work as me so I can't really ask them for advice. But I've just found out my colleague, when he joined, was given a raise 3x more than me after three months, he had the same experience as me at the time and I'm just a bit confused as to why? For background my company puts you on a temporary contract for the first 3 months before deciding. For him that included an (imo) substantial raise and a job title change. For me I kept the same job title and originally they wanted me on the same pay until September (when my review is) but I mentioned that min wage is going up and it was extremely close to what I was currently getting, which is when they gave me a slight raise that equals to like £25 extra a month 😭. Should I say something about this? I feel like the raise is far too different to just wait it out until September, with my pay now I can't go out or buy anything other than necessities really and if I had the raise he had this would've been so much better for my situation. For more context I work in a very male dominated career and I'm a 22f in the UK.

I began applying to a bunch of places and although it was a little slow at first, I was offered a job with a huge non-profit pretty much immediately. I accepted the job offer because it was the first offer I got, even though it only pays 55K and I was making 66K and struggling before my layoff. I live in a very HCOL city so 55K isn't enough to live off of. 

  
I am set to start the job with the non-profit on April 1. However, suddenly I am getting interviews left and right. It's going to be hard to schedule interviews if I'm working for the non-profit because it's a typical 9-5 and I can't take time off during my first week or call in ""sick"" to attend an interview. 

  
Are there any ways around this without having to turn down the non profit? I don't want to turn it down right now since up until now it's my only confirmed offer. However, the other 3 jobs I have in the pipeline pay 70K or more. Is there a way around this? What would you all do?

1bk7rg0,I've been working for over a decade as a fiction ghostwriter. What options do I have for a career change?,"I've spent the last decade writing creative works. Most of them have been some form of romance, with a few different genres sprinkled in. I've been fortunate in this time, being able to charge a decent amount, and having worked with some of the biggest pen names on Amazon, but I'm looking for something more stable. The quiet months can be devastating when full time freelancing. 

I still plan on sticking with a few clients that I have at the moment. I don't want to stop writing completely, but I want to change my day job while keeping my top clients.

Information that's probably important:

I never went to college or university. 

The only other job I've held was selling safety equipment for mines but that lasted less than 6 months and it was before I took the writing seriously. 

I've approached blogs, magazines and various copywriting firms but without having been able to dedicate time to learning non-fiction and article writing, I wasn't able to get a steady job. But on that note, if there is anything else, I'd like to look away from writing as a career form. 

I'm turning 30 this year. Still young enough to find something new to sink my teeth into, but with too many responsibilities to start from scratch with entry level jobs. (I live in South Africa, and the minimum wage here is atrocious).

I'm torn between choosing from these companies:

1. Government Office (related to military)
It looks good on a resume, but it's onsite, so it might be a bit costly for me. However, I worked so HARD to fulfill all the requirements needed. I need to pass through initially 8 different clearances and fill out lots of documents. They said I can start tomorrow. No allowance will be given. It has a curriculum for OJT.

2. Company aligned with my program (Private Startup Company)
I might get exposed to the work environment, but the allowance is low, only 3.3k. I might start by next Monday.

3. Medical Company. The allowance for the internship is quite big, but the thing is, there's no senior that can guide me. I can do self-study, though. I might also start by next Monday.

1bk5x7p,What should I do?,"Hi,  
I wanted to make this post to get some opinions about which career option should I pursue.  
I currently live in Finland and have completed vocational studies in IT, focusing on software development. I have a spot reserved for me in a university of applied sciences to become an engineer in the same field. These studies give me the option to focus on one of two branches:  
1. Software engineering. Starts with the basics and progresses into a wide variety of fields, including machine learning / AI, industrial IoT as well as cloud technologies. The possible career paths are mostly software engineering and related fields.  
2. Cloud infrastructure. Consists of a deeper dive into cloud technologies as well as a deeper understanding of networking. Systems used and focused on include Microsoft Azure as well as Amazon AWS. The possible career paths are sysadmin, as well as practically all other networking related fields.  
The other option that I have is re-applying to become a robotics/automation engineer. This option would give me the understanding of robotics and the needed software skills to work with them. The studies also include courses in AI development. If I choose to go this route, I won’t lose my spot for the other university, so practically no harm done even if I don’t qualify, other than the extra hours used preparing for the evaluation exam. The possible career paths are engineering roles in industrial as well as service-based automation.  
I am very much into tech and any of these paths will give me a possibility for a career that I am more than happy with. I personally am more drawn to software development, especially in the AI space, but my worry is however that the huge number of junior software developers as well as the growing concerns about AI’s impact in the field could make finding entry-level employment difficult when I finally get to start my career in 4 years. While no-one can predict the future, I would like to ask fellow students as well as experts alike, what does the future look like for these fields and what would you do in my situation?",Hour_Technician73,1,1.0,0,1711025917,2024-03-21 12:58:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bk5x7p/what_should_i_do/,3,2024
1bk5q0x,At a Crossroads - leave WFH for Hybrid?,"I moved to a city and started working at a company in 2016. I had two kids (2019 and 2021) and was in the office 3 days a week Pre Covid. The company was fantastic overall, but the department I was in was tough. Over worked, pressure from C suite overseas, long hours. But deep down I enjoyed the work I did. 
In 2022 I switched departments to something outside my field, and managed 8 people. I was really good at it but it didn’t challenge me at all and I felt like I wasn’t going to advance financially or in the company very quickly. I also hated the commute as we were back to three days a week in office. I didn’t get a raise to now manage 8 people.

So late 2023 (a year into that role), I left for a fully remote company and went back to my original field, but not a very similar role. My pay is up about $22k from the job I left. Benefits are mostly the same. 

The problem? I am BORED to tears. My original stressful role kept me busy, excited, and engaged. Probably because the building was on fire half the time, but anyways. My management role wasn’t challenging but still it kept me busy, I was respected, and I liked the work. This role- I am forgotten about it seems. I have asked for more work but I just feel so unmotivated because it doesn’t interest me. I could be researching, developing my skills, but I just sit there on my phone because I don’t care about the job. I am pretty unattached six months in, haven’t connected with people (I’m trying), and with two meetings a day and 3-4 hours of work MAX, I am just like…. What am I doing here!?

If you’ve made it this far - I’ve reached back out to my old HR contact, and while I don’t think I’d go back right away, I’m considering going back to the department I was originally in, or at least another role at that company. Part of me feels like it would look bad (I mean- I’ve only been here 6 months and won’t be making any immediate moves), but everyone knew I left on good terms. I’m worried I’ll need the flexibility I have with WFH though (my old company was very understanding of having kids, appointments etc) and just don’t know what to do with myself 🥴 Any thoughts?

It's maintenance rather than problem-solving,  procedures rather than critical thinking, and no math. All of this opposite of what I wanted out of engineering.

I can't believe club experience is worth more but that's  beside the point. This job, while not design, is very related to  the specific sector/niche I want to stay in. So the experience  with the current job is worth something for a lateral move to  another company. (I would think anyway.)  

I want to move on now for a few reasons: mainly I'm worried  about losing my math skills. It's like a language, use it or lose it.  (I'm exhausted there very little time to hone those skills outside  of work and there's no substitute for the real deal) Physical  location - it's the only job I applied to that keeps me in my home  state. I desperately wanted to move to start this new chapter.  I am also concerned about my safety. It was not mentioned  how dangerous the job could be when I was hired. Now, l'm  concerned for my team. They desperately need my position to  work out long-term. I would feel terrible taking on all the time  and training to bail on the team in a year or even 3 after a full  cycle. Full training takes up to 2 years to be a full functioning  member of the team.  

So l feel I need to add the few months of my new job to my  resume to catch recruiters' attention and possibly make the  move as there are tons of opportunities as I keep an eye on the  job market.  

Do I add my experience and start applying, knowing I will  have to explain the quick move? (Which I think are legitimate  reasons recruiters might respect)  

My sector is somewhat niche, do I worry about this coming  back to my manager somehow?  

Thanks for any input.

I recently landed a high paying entry level job at a bank for a graduate trainee programme. I'll be skipping from another bank to this coming one in April. Before that, I've been freelancing as a tailor. Enjoyable work, but the anxiety of waiting for the next client is nervewrecking.

 I understand that it is an extremely valuable opportunity, and I've been praying for this for months on end. I just worry that i find little to no interest in banking and from there idk what should i do to motivate myself?

1bk41gr,What's the better choice? Do I puke silently in my office or be rude to my co-worker? Is there a third option?,"I share an office with a co-worker. In usual times, it's constantly   
\- loud yawning without any actions of covering his mouth

\- loud grumping of things that doesn't go/work well (example of a morning with his mouse malfunctioning due to a need of battery change, i hear: fuck this stupid mouse, fuck this seriously i can't work with this mouse or bloody hell this is really annoying the shit out of me etc etc etc) 

\- loud sniffing of his constantly blocked (?) nose

&#x200B;

He took some days off last week so I had three whole days where it was silent bliss and i was able to work very very efficiently! (Didn't realized how much the noise were actually affecting my productivity).

&#x200B;

Yesterday he was back and he's having a mild flu and lots and lost of PHLEGM. Not only the noises were back, but now he's coughing, clearing his throat (again very very very loudly) of all the stuck phlegm in his throat, his nose or whatever holes that he possess.  
Little bonus, he came in reeking of ALCOHOL! i had to open all windows and doors to not have the smell barring into my nostrils even though it's windy and 12 degrees Celsius outside.

&#x200B;

I'm a bit germophobic but since I really don't want to be a difficult person (and I just started in this company September last year) I was keeping it quiet, blasting my earphones off the whole day just to drown the usual noise.. But I can't do this anymore.. Help..  


There's no other available office, the only place left is the office kitchen or the company owner's office.  
The Co-worker is a senior of the company (both age and status).

1bk3i5n,Please someone save all my effort from being wasted!,"I work for a call centre, I've spent the last two years here very happily and made a conscious effort to try excel at this job. As a result of this my manager recognised my ambition and started giving me extra responsibility, including managing other call handlers complaints, training people, hosting meetings and acting as a general advisor for our team of 25 on all things to do with the industry we operate calls for. As someone relatively young I enjoyed this feeling of responsibility and also relished the opportunity to genuinely help people out. I pride myself in the number of people who have ended calls with myself stating that I've made their day or saved them from rough positions.  
However, recently they have advised us that we are all to move to a new sector of business where we will be expected to work either weekends or night shifts, here. They accept that many of us won't be able to do this, myself included for personal reasons I've got people I need to look after that I can't if I work outside of the typical M-F 8-4 / MF 9-5 that we work currently.  
The entire time I've worked here I've gone above and beyond both for the people who call in and my teammates, having trained & re-trained 90% of our current team at one point or another meanwhile I've not been trained by anyone aside from the initial training. A lot of colleagues view WFH as a chance to do absolutely nothing, and if that's what they want to do I genuinely hold no judgement, I get completely why that's what some people want and more power to them.  
Here's where my frustrations lie, now we're leaving we've been informed we're not going to be provided references from our manager directly but instead a generic 'reference team' who will just confirm the time that we worked here. So now the hundreds of hours I've spent helping my team, helping customers whilst my teammates have hung up on people, been openly racist (which I've reported repeatedly), cussed out customers on the line amongst many other issues are in the same position. To a future employer we will look identical seemingly.  
Which devastates me considering all I've done.  
I've asked my manager if she could provide one herself and she advised she's been told it has to be done through the references team.  
Should I chalk this up as a learning experience for future roles to not go above and beyond if I'm not 100% certain of my future there and become apathetic?  
Is there any way I can advise my manager that she can provide me a 'personal reference' or other I can use?",chandlerbingbongbing,1,1.0,1,1711017422,2024-03-21 10:37:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bk3i5n/please_someone_save_all_my_effort_from_being/,3,2024

I have built the management systems using the laravel and vuejs but that wasn't much complex like I haven't used the advance features of laravel like  Task Scheduling , Real-time: Broadcasting, Echo and Pusher, notifications, web sockets, broadcasting however I have used many topics related to advance auth third party API integration advance eloquent jobs and queues but now looking to explore more as a laravel developer so on a part time basis I want to build the web application in which I can use many advance laravel features.  
So the e-commerce application has come to my mind but that could be too lengthy as you all know and it will not be unique though  
The reason why I want to build the system is to polish my skills to the advance level cause currently I am working at a place where they don't use the advance features of laravel (although not all the companies use the all the advance features but I want to explore to called myself a senior developer) but there are more opportunities like I learn many javascript concepts here and the integrations of AWS and S3 now the next goal here is MERN since the laravel is my primary skill so i am more concerned about that.

1bk2dza,Is it possible to renegotiate salary after giving first number before offer?,"Hi everyone!

I live in Europe and am currently interviewing for a new remote job based in a different European country from where I live. I’ve found it kind of difficult to gauge what salary to ask for in comparison to my location in Spain where salaries are much lower and based on Glassdoor info for my role. 

I realized afterwards when I stated my desired salary in my first HR interviews that it is actually around 5k less than what I should have requested based on market averages. I know giving a number at first is bad practice but I just didn’t ask for their range first and said I wanted “around” with the idea I could review their benefits when officially offered and ask for me potentially if they are lacking. Obviously not ideal. 

I’ve just been offered the position based on the original number I gave, but would I have any potential to raise my original ask or am I locked in now? The salary I asked for would be a good jump from what I’m currently earning but I hate to leave money on the table.

1bk288u,Manager feedback was that I am not transparent and creating unhealthy competition in the team,"I have always worked as an individual and recently moved in to the role of Team Lead from the past 8 months now. My manager gave me feedback that I am not transparent and creating unhealthy competition in the team. He told me not to be insecure about others overtaking me. He said he is happy with my work but I need to work on my leadership skills and be open.

I am feeling like I messed up in my role and the team does not accept me as a lead. Since I have this individual contributor mentality I think I need to overlook everything and not relegate work. I am also worried that others might mess up and then blame will be on me. 

BUT, I have always seen that the team is always involved in all major meetings and knows the details about the progress of various activities. I try to involve them in all discussions and activities even when they have shown disinterest - **just to be transparent**. There was a certain activity in which I did not involve anyone because it was not that much important and was an additional task. Many times team mates have told me to decline additional tasks due to work load. I appreciate them for their smallest support and involve them in higher management meetups so that they are also highlighted. I ensure I treat my team members well because they deserve it and try to be as accommodative as possible but I feel the reciprocation is missing.

Due to some personal issues I do have some insecurities inside of me and the ruthlessness of corporate culture does not help either. I have also felt that I was being sidelined due to lack of transparency from my manager. There is a person in my team who I feel is a bit manipulative. I must say that the person is talented and is the most experienced person in the project. There were certain decisions taken by my manager in which I was not involved. Recently, team structure was formed in a way that on the surface one would feel that the team has been divided with multiple leads. This lead to me believing that I am being sidelined - may be I was insecure and should have communicated this. 

This can be because I have trust issues or may be a poor communicator. In my corporate life I have seen people getting sidelined for simply being too good and like an open book. I fear that I also can be taken advantage of. 

But if people have pointed the competition and friction between me and the other experienced person then it must be true. Also, that person being less experienced than me automatically gets the benefit of doubt. I am totally aware that I do need to work on my leadership skills since I am new to this role. May be I have to act more maturely but I feel I messed up and now the team perceives me like an insecure controlling chap. I do not want this and am really confused.

I don't know man how to work on this is issue. Your insights will help me.",KesaRishi,2,1.0,0,1711012072,2024-03-21 09:07:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bk288u/manager_feedback_was_that_i_am_not_transparent/,3,2024
1bk1pf3,Feeling lost and off track ,"Hi All, 

Sorry for the long post. Will try and make sense of this as much as I can. 

A few years ago I was working in my dream industry being involved in a streetwear business at the head office where I also managed the retail stores. I left this business to pursue my own clothing brand, up until Covid it was going really well and I was incredibly passionate about it. Online was selling well, and I had managed to get the brand into 20 or so stores. 

Once I left the business to pursue my brand, I worked in sales roles across tech and eccomerce for about 3 years.

During Covid, I was the only person running the business. I was doing everything myself. Once the pandemic well and truly took off I had several issues arise such as wholesale accounts not paying me, issues with stock and ultimately cash flow issues. I took the time to reset and re jig the brand as I could not get any stock or income ( I also lost my fulltime role due to Covid) 

Fast forward to today, I have not gotten the business back up and running as I feel like my priorities have changed ( pressured to buy a house etc) and I am stuck in this cycle of sales roles when my passion lies with brands and fashion… 

People say to re start the brand, but I’m not sure what is holding me back.. I think it’s the cost side and other people my age being married with a house etc.. I would love to get back into a fashion sales role as well. 

I feel like I’m incredibly stuck and have lost my identity and have no idea where I am going?

1bjzwgo,"New employees doing the same job but higher title, higher pay? ","
Where I work at, our department implements different lines of business. Each line has its own team who specialize in that line. Our department has 3 main titles that we use from the job catalog - Coordinator, Analyst, Lead. 


Historically, in the past the Leads were client facing & senior level. Analysts were mid level, they did both client facing and simple backend. Coordinators were entry level. They support Leads primarily by doing the backend work for their projects. They also support Analysts when they have more complex projects.


A few months ago, the line of business that was all Analysts kept saying they watched a dedicated Coordinator. They didn’t want to do backend anymore. Managers posted for an Analyst. One was hired and after they started, they adjusted the role to now be backend only - basically the Coordinator job. But higher pay, better title. Now they have hired another Analyst in that same line of business, the job listing was for an Analyst title & pay, but all of the actual job role & responsibilities was the same as Coodinators in the other lines. 


So, now we’ve got 5 people all doing the same job, but 2 are being paid quite a bit more with an Analyst title. The other lines of business Coordinators are bothered by this, it feels very unfair.  I’m one of the Coordinators & I’ve been here for a few years. I’m not sure if I can even bring this up to the manager, or if I’m better off just finding an exit out of the department.

Joined a bunch of innovation and bussiness case challenges back in college days and won a few. Student Council VP and led other leadership positions too. Joined school of 42 and passed it as well and also realised I hate full fledged coding. Got a graduate program placement in a major telco in technology strategy department and it's been 1.5 years. Here the work is mostly dealing with new technologies and check how to leverage it for the company which I love doing.

Okay so my life goal is to build companies / have my own tech startup. So now just trying to gain some experience. Most of my colleagues are saying in my department the work is slow, go somewhere else and get more exposure. The issue isI don't actually know what I really like. What I hate is coding all day and not a huge fan of dealing with alot of data analysis. But the idea of dealing with any new exciting technologies has always been very very interesting to me. So doing some coursera courses to pick up tensorflow. I even thought of enrolling to either a CE or CS part time Masters or Degree. I also applied to oversea jobs in tech related field for more exposure and money too. 

I hope you see my dilemma and how confused I am LOL. If I should go apply jobs at startups to prepare myself for the life goal. Or get a CS or CE degree and apply jobs into the AI/ML/Drone/Robotics kinda field to prepare myself for my life goal. Or I honestly sometimes really ask myself if I really like coding AI/ML stuffs also. I don't even know if I should become a Subject Matter Expert or consider civil service or already go start building companies. But what I know for sure is I love technology and good at managing people and getting things done.

1bjz66z,Need career advise.,"Hi I'm 30M need your honest life advise 'coz I think I desperately need one. I did my engineering in E&C, I was a bright student in school days but in college I just hated the environment and engineering in general. I used to play music since my teenage also I played with good names so when I graduated I decided to be a full time musician, which I am till date. In 2015, I did work as RF and DT engineer for like 3 months then I felt this is not the thing for me. So I left job and pursed music. I made decent amount too.

In 2017, out of the blue I was diagnosed with CKD. My kidneys failed and eventually in 2018 I had to undergo a kidney transplant surgery. I'm doing fine right now. But there have been instances where I got sick on my gigs and it makes me heart broken. Recently, my doctor started a medicine for my anxiety too, as it effected my physical body.

Since, August 2023 I'm not doing great in my personal relationships and my musical career. I also sing(drums are my main thing), I want to put out my original songs and perform them. But due to health issues, relationship problems with my spouse and anxiety about future, I feel like I'm lost. Feels like I should do a course like MBA or a part time job, something which can give me a stable career as being musician I'll always travel around and since I'm a Renal patient I need to take care of my food and water alot. Everytime I fell sick, it feels like I'm starting over again. 

My wife is a Nursing officer at civil hospital. Nurses have good career and pay abroad. I sometimes feel like I should move abroad and do a course that would give a new start.

The last I worked was from june 2015- September 2015. I haven't worked since then in a corporate environment or say a job. What are my chances to have a good stable career if I pursue this path as I'm skeptical since I've haven't work for almost 9yrs and please guide me what should I be doing at this point. Should I follow this path if yes, then what will be the best track to follow. You can put other advise and suggestions too,which can be best for my situation full time/part time/courses like MBA,etc. Keep in mind these things.

1. I'm a kidney transplant patient(I'm immunosuppressed)

2. I did engineering and work both in 2015, I've been doing music ever since.

1bjxhbf,Completely lost on direction ,"I’m 31 and have had like ~25 jobs. Not even joking. Some for only a few weeks because I couldn’t stand it. Many were when I was younger. I’ve worked in food service, I’ve worked at a number of factories. In 2017 I got into landscaping and did a few seasons. After being broke from lack of work during winter after a few years, I decided I wanted to get into construction. I started out doing home remodels/ mainly painting. These were in the hood and I didn’t get paid well. I eventually got an offer to go union as a painter. It didn’t really work out, I basically was given very basic tasks (hauling 5 gallons etc) and started at the very bottom. Last thanksgiving they laid off me and 35 other guys.


Since then, I have been doing carpentry with some nut case. It is extremely brutal. We work long hours in poor conditions, often in the cold. He is an angry, hateful man. He will make 3 mistakes I will have to fix. I don’t say anything. I make 1 mistake, he flips out. Casual talk when nothing dramatic is happening is him degrading me.


No idea where to go or what to do. I feel crushed and lost. Like I don’t have a path. I feel like a failure.


I’m currently trying to get back into a factory I worked at for about 6 months between landscape and construction. The pay is good for the work and I remember it being somewhat laid back. There’s lots of overtime and good insurance which I need both of. However, I have had a very difficult time contacting hr. An hr representative from a sister plant reached out to me, but this is 45 minutes away and my shift would start at 5 am. If I get back in this company, I want to do it right, I want to work there for a few years and get them to do tuition reimbursement to send me for a welding certificate. If I’m waking up and driving 45 minutes at 4 am I’m not gonna be sticking around that long, I know myself. 



Please help, any suggestions on what to do or where to go is helpful. I don’t necessarily want to go back to manufacturing but I’d gladly go back to the plant I worked at in a heart beat if they took me. I can’t do construction much longer, it’s soul crushing. These jobs don’t even really offer to pay that much for what you’re doing.

1bjvvn4,Did I mess up this salary negotiation early in the process?,"I'm currently speaking to two recruiters about two different opportunities. During the first conversations, I always ask what the salary range is so that I know I'm not wasting my time.  
The first recruiter gave me a pretty wide range. I told her where I wanted to be, which was honestly on the lower end of the range, and then she said ""ok we'll say $xx much"", and said a number $5 below the number I gave. I didn't argue because I didn't consider this the official negotiations. Anyway, after that conversation I got an email with a loose description of the position and the dollar amount she mentioned specifically highlighted, almost as if I was now agreeing to this as if it were an official offer. Now I have an interview scheduled and I have no clue if I'm locked into this dollar amount she put on the email, or if I can counter assuming I do eventually get an offer. Has anyone experienced this? Did I screw up and put myself in a box now?  
The second recruiter did something similar but this one didn't give me a range, he told me they were capped at X dollar amount and I said ok. So I'm not sure if that one can negotiated. He also sent me an email with the job description and the dollar amount he mentioned specifically highlighted.

1bjvdps,A Considerable Percent of Coworkers My Age Seem to be Growing Fed Up of Our Company's Worsening Dynamics [USA],"This post has to do with my younger coworkers and I (2.5 YOE), who from my observation, all share a disdain for many of our medium-sized engineering company's policies. I focus on this demographic because the dissatisfaction seems considerably more fervent among those entering the workforce, but I do notice it throughout to some extent. Our younger workforce is knit fairly closely, and obviously many of us discuss things amongst ourselves frequently about our company that have been growing more and more distasteful.

I guess what I'm trying to better understand is how we, primarily my demographic of engineers, can position ourselves better when upper management seems to care less and less as certain situations grow worse. Of course we can find a new job or learn to deal with it per typical advice, but I, and many others, do seem to enjoy many aspects of working at our company, but would surely like to see benefits at other companies implemented here. I'm sure it's unfeasible to expect any real change, but given that there seems to be some underlaying unity among my coworkers, I'm curious to hear some insights.

Short of actively going out and polling other engineers, which would clearly be risky, I've gathered that three of the most pressing realities are:

* Unpaid hours & lack of flex time: While this isn't as much of an issue for my department, it's not uncommon for other workers to have to work 50-60 hour weeks and not see that in the form of overtime, PTO accrual, or transferrable hours
* Pay: Though industry-wide pay has seemingly been struggling over the past few years, our company's pay still falls below our local competitors, and raises remain meager despite healthy financials that the company boasts about
* Shrinking benefits: Our company has reduced their 401k contribution by \~0.5% every year since shortly after I started working. Again, something that contradicts the prosperous message that our company shares, and I'm not sure if/when this, among other benefits, will come back

I'm omitting a few other policies & characteristics (RTO, some cultural aspects, etc.), but all of them have been making most of us angsty and questioning the rationale, especially over the past 6 months.

My immediate teammates are the ones whom I discuss these things with the most. We nearly always agree about these struggles. The further I branch out, the more difficult it is to gauge if this frustration is as strong and unanimous, but nonetheless, coworker friends from other departments seem to mostly share the same sentiments to some extent.

It is clear that there is an elephant in the room, especially for coworkers around my age, and I'm not sure how to approach it. I don't want to be a ringleader, but seeing some improvements for once would be spectacular given that I want to stay at this company. Again, I'm probably just being some naïve junior who doesn't understand why things are the way they are, but with how shared this feeling seems to be and with how much appears to be growing from what I've begun to witness, I hate the idea of letting things get worse. How can I approach this on a personal and on a group level?",Sensitive-Soft-1579,2,1.0,8,1710986781,2024-03-21 02:06:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bjvdps/a_considerable_percent_of_coworkers_my_age_seem/,3,2024
1bjvbl9,Will my title be worth anything if I only stayed for 1 - 3 months?,"I recently landed a Director of Operations position in a struggling company. I figured out why they are failing and I am facing some challenges already during my training.

To give you some context, I was hired by the CEO himself based on a recommendation from the former COO of the previous company I worked in. While I feel confident in my abilities to handle the responsibilities of the job, I'm encountering resistance from the person tasked with training me.

For instance, instead of hiring additional staff to alleviate workload pressures, I'm being stretched thin, working 10-hour days, six days a week, and frequently asked to fill in for vacant positions I barely have training in. (I recently got sick and, as punishment for missing a day, I'm being made to work on my only weekend.)

Despite expressing my concerns and suggesting changes to improve efficiency, it seems like my feedback falls on deaf ears. I'm beginning to doubt whether my efforts in bringing productivity will mean anything.

Is this type of thing technically allowed nowadays?  


I am asking because recently I had someone (we'll say Bob) ask me to be a reference for someone (we'll say Scott). If Scott did not put me down as a professional reference, is it okay for Bob to be asking me for a reference about Scott? Bob knows that I know Scott because there is a question on the application about ""anyone you know within the company"". Does this make it allowable to use me as a professional reference?   


Scott is great and I'd have nothing but good things to say about him within a professional reference, but I don't really like the blurred lines between professional references and just contacting people who were not put down.

I had just left my retail job after the company I was working for decided to let me walk rather than pay me, so I took the opportunity to intern with the company.

I have a little bit more than 30k saved up, I still live at home with my parents (cause reasons), I really want to go back to school full time and finish my bachelor's degree and go to law school.

I am also studying for certs and working on homelabs for the chance of getting a better job in IT, although this is just me being afraid of being seen as someone who wont learn in their job so im working on this stuff just because im in that industry although I realize I dont like it. So this just makes me feel fake and also like its a waste of time. 

My friend told me to just go back to school full time, get leadership experience and internships in software as thats my end goal. I am doing courses for programming rn but I am lacking experience in clubs and internships as well in this path. 
I basically just feel stuck with no way efficient way out. Obviously committing to IT makes the most sense as the easiest career path, but I hate it. 

Ideally I want to transition into a job without a phone ringing and work on programming in my free time, but it seems like thats not going to happen, or maybe im just pessimistic. 

Can anyone offer any advice? Maybe my thinking is just incorrect.",Material_Twist_2520,1,1.0,0,1710976577,2024-03-20 23:16:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bjrlrc/stuck_between_fields_and_what_to_focus_on/,3,2024

1bjp5cw,How to deal with nepotism and injustices at work?,"Hello everyone.  I'm in the final months of a professional internship at a big company in Europe, and I've been dealing with immense stress due to injustices I've been experiencing. I've been completely ignored and belittled by my supervisor, and the few tasks assigned to me came from colleagues who weren't obligated to do so but were sympathetic to my situation. Besides that, I've been completely sidelined.

Despite repeatedly demonstrating my capabilities and hinting that I can do much more, little has changed, leading me to believe there's no interest in valuing me.

There's another intern on the team who already knows he's staying with the company, despite having fewer skills than me and an unsuitable personality for the role he'll be performing. He's receiving all the opportunities and projects due to significant favoritism within the company. This person will soon move to the same office as me, which intensifies my frustration and disgust. My colleagues constantly lament the injustice of me leaving without being given opportunities to prove myself, while this toxic person is about to join the permanent staff. Despite showing countless times that they lack much of the required competence, they continue to be praised by management. It's not that I claim to have all that competence; I have my flaws too. It's just confusing to see this distinction in treatment between us.

Dealing with this is pushing me to the brink of exhaustion. I'm probably giving too much importance to something that's temporary, or maybe the problem lies with me, idk. But I feel exhausted and discouraged by having daily interactions with many other interns who have meaningful work, and by thinking about my bad luck with the team and how I've almost wasted 9 months.

I'm considering whether I should start looking for another job and an environment where I'm valued, and just leave as soon as I have something, even though my colleagues have advised me to try not to leave on bad terms and see if I can tough it out until the end.

1bjoiv8,Should I switch paths?,"for context: I graduated college a year ago with mid grades and a degree in graphic design. I never really enjoyed design and just finished the degree in the hopes that having a degree and a portfolio would be enough to land me a job where I could then do some professional exploration and perhaps pivot into something that better suits my skills. What a fool I was. 

Now, a year later I am still serving at restaurants and I secured an unpaid, remote internship mostly designing instagram posts (I hate it). Ive applied to about 40 jobs in the past 6 months, I have gotten 4 interviews and only one offer (the internship I have currently). I feel like I have really given it my best shot, Ive talked to industry professionals and had them look over my portfolio, I have redone my portfolio and resume about 4 times (I'm currently re-doing it as we speak) I even had LinkedIn Premium for a little bit. It's really brought me nothing but frustration and angst. 

I have started to realize that while one of the things I really want is financial security and a high paying job, I really hate being stuck at my computer. Some of the jobs I apply for don't even have an office, you're just supposed to do all your work from home. It depresses me that my future will likely be mostly seated at a desk in front of a screen designing social media graphics on canva.

I know there are other options out there for me but I am having trouble even imagining where to start looking. There are plenty of other things I am interested in, even in the design world but they are so outside my skillset I cant find a reasonable entrypoint.

1bjobzl,Can the community give me their take on outright lying on my resume and LinkedIn about work?,"I have a career spanning about 13 years in my field (advertising), and nearly 20 years of work since I was a teenager. In 2022 I broke my pelvis on another continent. In 2023 I had to have a hip replacement (semi-related to the injury). This has kept me out of work for nearly two years. Unfortunately, I was also laid off during Covid. I spent about 10 months working at the Director level between 2021-2022, but that's my only work experience since 2020. 

This work gap seems to be killing me. I'm coming close to 100 applications without a single phone screen. I've seen some professionals who think my resume is very solid, but I'm currently getting it rewritten.

Friends are suggesting I just outright lie and make up work to fill the gap, using them as ""clients."" The problem is, I have a large professional network on LinkedIn (500+), and my injury, lack of work, and new job hunt has been made very public. My personal feelings are that if I commit to this lie, lots of people that could vouch for my work will now be able to see a clear and blatant lie on my resume, with ambiguous clients that don't have any websites.

I feel this would be eliminating my most qualified leads for finding work, as my network is now going to see that I'm lying, not even a white lie, but a blatant, huge red flag lie. As someone who has hired before and offered plenty of recommendations, I'd be very unwilling to stick my neck out for someone with that grandiose of a lie on their profile.

My friends are saying it's no big deal, but I feel like this is the kind of thing you do in your early 20s when no one is going to know any better, not something in your 30s when you have experience.

1bjn45r,"General Accounting, Law, Tax, Personal Finance","Long post. 

Background: 
- B.S. Accounting and Finance
- MBA, International Business
- Licensed CPA
- First years of my career spent in public accounting tax and 4 years auditing taxes for the IRS
- Been in corporate accounting/finance for the past 9 years

I’m 41 yrs old. I currently work in Industry as an Accounting Manager for a pretty large company. However, I have always wanted to go to law school. I first looked into it over 10 yrs ago. The “timing” has never been the best as I had a child and was a single mom. Fast forward to today that child is 21 and I’m happily married and have a 6 yr old. I also have a 13 yr old (my husband’s daughter). I’m really struggling with what’s next for me. Not sure if it matters but I am an INFJ. I just did this personality test and was absolutely blown away with how accurate it was, it was actually a little freaky. Either way, INFJ appropriately labels me as a person that has A LOT of interests and sometimes those interests are not related at all lol. So here’s the dilemma, I work in corporate and also run a side CPA business doing bookkeeping and tax work. I want to go to law school but absolutely DO NOT want to go into big law. I want to relate law school to what I do now whether it is estate planning, tax attorney something of that nature. The goal would be to get fully out of corporate once the business replaces my income ($120k).

But, I also have a really strong interest in personal finance and have thought about how I can relate that as well or maybe even separately. I have a passion for it, dealing with my own financial struggles and being a minority and knowing wealth building is a real roadblock for my culture.  Maybe the CFP is an option or another personal finance certification. Admittedly, I’m a person that over analyzes, over plans and over thinks and I just see too many posts of people who say law school is a scam, it’s not worth it, lawyers are miserable etc…. So I think that’s where my hang up is. Also, I’ve been asked if law school still fits my future goals as they have changed in the past years. I feel that it does if I want to do estate planning/ tax attorney. Lastly, I thought possibly I would find a program that focuses on tax and really hone in on that part of my business. I’m decent at it, but it has been awhile since I’ve focused solely on it, so I could really use a brush up. Sigh, if you can’t tell I also have ADHD which is likely why this post is so long, and I can be all over the place. It’s a real struggle and something I am pretty embarrassed about. I just need help on if I should let go of law school at this point in my life. I worry about being worth it at my age, but would absolutely encourage someone else to go no matter their age. Or should I focus on continuing down the path of the tax and personal finance aspect of building this CPA firm.

TL/DR: 41 yr old CPA Accounting manager trying to decide if law school is a good move as it’s been my dream. Or if I should give up on that and focus on building my boutique CPA firm, adding in some personal finance as some of my service offering",ND_ADHD,2,1.0,0,1710965594,2024-03-20 20:13:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bjn45r/general_accounting_law_tax_personal_finance/,3,2024

My first job right out of college I was working for someone and it was extremely horrible where the PI’s wife was mean and yelled in the first week that I worked there over a mistake I made. I quit after 2 weeks and got another job because it was so terrible I cried to work everyday. The next job I had the manager was terrible (he recently got fired) and was extreme micromanager. I kept that for a year and then got another job at the same company in a different lab. There was rampant sexual harrassment in the lab and I didn’t feel safe with certain coworkers. I left that job after a year of putting up with it and being miserable. Now this job I have had for almost 2 years and overall the company is good, pay is good, and I love my manager (now, I just got a new one) and most people are nice but some of my coworkers are just blatantly rude. 

One of my coworkers is senior staff level and is such a perfectionist and acts demeaning if I make a mistake or try to help and it’s not perfect. My husband thinks I should look for new jobs and he thinks the way I am treated is so disrespectful but I just feel like I’ve had so many bad experiences it makes me hesitant to start all over again and take my chances that a new place won’t be worse. My manager said that I should tell her if I have a problem with someone cause she knows how he can be but it’s very against my nature to snitch on people and I feel like all it will do is make the situation worse. I am also level 1 engineer and he is staff engineer and is way more important to the company than me. 

It makes me wonder is this is biotech thing or a woman thing or are my standards just too high? It seems like everywhere my husband works he is treated with respect automatically. (Husband is a PM in tech) He has never had a single issue like this. I am literally so nice to everyone, always am polite, always willing to help and literally never try to step on anyone’s toes. Idk if this is more of a vent but does anyone have advice on dealing with this? I have anxiety as well so when people are rude its hard to not take it personally.

Hi all I’m a 28 F living in San Diego. Going on 29 in May. I’ve hit a point in my life where I want to choose a career path. I’m tired of working entry level jobs and want to grow somewhere. The problem is I don’t know what to do. I have over 10 years in customer service. Experience in healthcare, specifically admin work, front desk/receptionist. Experience in coordinating events and serving in restaurants (which I’ll never go back to). I’m currently temping as an admin for the city which is coming to an end in May. 

Unfortunately I cannot go back to college at this time. I owe my school $4k and they will not release my transcript unless I pay in full or a good chunk. Which I don’t have. I completed about 1.5 semesters so I don’t have a degree (learning from this decision heavy right now)

I’ve been looking into getting a cert in something as that seems to be my only
option to educate myself at this time (hands on learner) But everything I see doesn’t interest me. I’m good with people and children. I love making others feel good and giving them an experience of some sort. But I also don’t want to be people facing anymore. Humans are exhausting. Idk I’m just rambling at this point. 

I’m a very fast learner and adaptable to almost any environment. Hence why I’m having a hard time figuring out what I want to do.

 Employees keep leaving, high turnover. Another (different) engineer gave their two weeks just last week. That makes it even harder for me to get fired now. Anyway, I would like to work on my side hustle full time (renovating houses).

I make about 5k/month. Unemployment would be 1k/month. I'd rather have some income that than nothing while renovating houses. The payoff would only happen after I sell or refinance.

1bjivmx,Would you switch jobs?,"I was only 3 weeks into my new job when I received a LinkedIn message from a recruiter for a similar role. Meanwhile I’m not dissatisfied with my current job, I’m considering the switch. Here are my thoughts and please let me know yours:

Base salary would only be $2500 more but with bonus could be $8000 more.

I don’t dislike my current job. I’m only 1 month in but it’s been very chill so far. I’m only busy maybe half of my day which I suppose is a good and bad thing. My boss is very nice, we get along and he’s not the type to breathe down my neck. Also, I get my own office here which is great. This is a small company, the office staff is maybe 15 people. Meanwhile everyone is nice, none I would consider my friends as they are all 40+ and I’m 24. Might seem trivial but this is also a really old and ugly office. I’m more interested in the products the new company manufacturers. 

The only real negative part of my job is that it’s really far (1 hour w/o traffic, 1.5 hour with traffic). The position will move to WFH 2days/week after another two months but in the office everyday rn. The other company is closer and WFH 3days/week (40 min no traffic).

Not sure what to do so please let me know what you think.

1bjih2q,People never ask questions in meetings and then have no idea what needs to be done.,"I work at a start-up as our Software / IT support. Some of my time is spent developing apps or other support systems to help automate or speed up workflows significantly. One issue I am running into all the time is people attending meetings I prepare for heavily, and no one has anything to say at the end other than they're on board with the new system. This is all great, but the issue arises within the week. I will have several people complaining that the system is too hard to use if its an app or if its a policy that involves other teams doing work the teams will complain they didn't know what to do.

This drives me up the wall so much because they never approach me before the issue escalates to this level. I don't smell and I don't bite so I am completely confused why things are constantly getting to this level. I take time to make sure my apps are simple and the entire process is documented for reference. At this point I feel like I'm just being pushed out of the company and its depressing to see around three years of work go to waste.

1bji87m,Advice: Accepting Low Salary/Reneging Low Salary Offer,"Hi everyone- my question is two parts.

Like so many of us, I've been on the hunt for my next full time role for months. I actually left my last (tech SaaS) job in search of greener pastures in industries that actually excite me (and had a good deal of freelance work lined up to hold me over, so the risk wasn't as bad). I've always known that I wanted a FT position, however, and have been searching for it since. Needless to say it has been unbelievably rough, money is tight, and I'm burnt out from the search, rejections, ghosting, etc.  


So I finally landed a job offer! It has a decent title, great benefits, and is on a great team. It's not an industry I particularly care about, but I realized pretty quickly in this market I couldn't be picky about that anymore. Unfortunately, the salary is very low for the role and area the job is in (Seattle- HCOL). It's less than I was making at my last FT role and is not even the median salary for roles of this title in this area. My rent is astronomical and I have student loans, etc. so it was really important for me to keep my old salary at least. I negotiated and they gave me a few thousand more, but it's still way under what I asked for, and doesn't come close to the industry average. I will also say I experienced some condescending language in the negotiation process as well, and was only given a few days to make my decision. In the end I accepted, because I cannot afford to not have a job anymore, and there are some good parts to the position.

Here's where my conundrum comes in. I have been interviewing at a company that is in my target industry, that would pay me 15-20K more. I just had my 2nd to last interview this week (the day I had to accept the other position) and it went really well. The recruiter at this place is aware of my position and did everything he could to expedite the process for me, but unfortunately they still have a process to follow, which of course I completely understand, so I am waiting on next steps. As you can imagine I was not about to not accept one position for the chance of another, especially after how often we've all been burned in this market.

I am looking for advice on:

\- If I end up keeping the role I accepted, how do I move past my disappointment over the salary? I am not anticipating this place gives large raises or increases in compensation for promotions, according to their Glassdoor.

\-If I get this other offer from the other company, do I renege? I am so unbelievably anxious over the thought of doing that. I am about 10 years into my career and I've never been in this position. I've seen other posts regarding this topic that say ""companies can do that to you without a second thought"" which I fully believe. Still, I'm terrified of the longterm implications of doing something like that. It would also have to be a phone call. Any advice? Of course I don't have an offer yet but I would feel better preparing myself in advance just in case.

1bjhvtw,Do I keep being Batman or time to go Bane?,"
Hello all,

I’m using a throw away for obvious reasons.

I need some career guidance. (Sorry in advance for the length and bad grammar - used a lot of talk to text.)

I started this new career in August 2022. I should’ve known right away that there was going to be problems when I received no formal training of any kind. I literally started just receiving emails asking me to start addressing problems.

Should be noted this is a leadership position leading a team of 12 people , I’m completely responsible for my part of this business. Everything from the staff hiring, on boarding, all the financials, etc.

After about six months, I started to really get things figured out and implemented a number of solutions and fixes to a series of problems that were happening here. As a result, my team generated the highest revenue, and EBITDA that it ever has in its history during the 2023 year. I have the title of a supervisor and in reading the job descriptions, it was very evident that I was doing the job of a manager. Now I’m normally not the one to get super hung up on titles, but given what I had accomplished in very short time I felt that my compensation was lacking, and I believed that the best way to get more compensation would be to get promoted to a manager.

Beginning last summer I started to ask my leader what I needed to do to achieve the manager title and pay that I believe is more in line with what I’m doing. He stated that we would address it but months went by and we never did. I brought it up a few times throughout those months and got the same reply. finally, at the end of the year I sat down with him with the job description, and said that I believed that I was meeting the current job duties of a manager, and since we hadn’t had any form of plan that I had been operating off of the existing job description to try to achieve the manager role and wanted him to review that. I was trying to manage up.

This is where things get interesting. Our company has a large gathering every spring where leaders get together and discuss company vision, do trainings,  meet and greets, build relationships, etc. My boss informed me that I was not invited because nobody below a manager level was allowed to be there. I attended as a supervisor last year but this year they cut back on who could go and supervisors were not allowed.  He stated that he asked upper management for me to be allowed to attend but they declined.

As you can imagine I was quite upset by this and it was amplified by the fact that I started asking last year what could be done for me to attain the manager title. I didn’t care about the title until the company chose to not allow me to participate in leadership trainings that I believe I have earned. To be clear I do the same job as other managers in the company. I am only at a supervisor level because it’s enabling them to pay me less. To be more transparent, I do a lot of things my boss should be doing. He is the textbook boss who has 1-2 years left in his career and is basically checked out at this point. He leads the sales team and has had a constant revolving door because he won’t train them and just expects them to figure it out. I have tried to help them and two of them stated in their resignation letters that they sent to the entire office that they would be staying if they worked for me. I also have taken steps to keep two other key team members from leaving in my tenure. 

My boss has informed me that he expects me to be his replacement and at one point I believed him but now I don’t know. 

I finally had my review two weeks ago and my boss informed me that he has a plan in place now for me to be promoted to a manager by the end of 2024. When I expressed my displeasure about the fact that it’s being drug out he became upset and said that me being “upset” wasn’t a characteristic of “manager”. I almost walked out right there but I bit my tongue however I can’t even look at him without being instantly pissed. He has extremely low emotional intelligence and thinks things are fine. They aren’t…. I’m seething inside. 

My question is this. AITAH? At this point I am doing my job but I have stopped all above and beyond activities. Others in the office have noticed because they are asking me what’s wrong and asking me if I am planning to leave. I haven’t said anything to anyone but I guess it’s obvious in my body language. If I leave it will be a crippling blow to this office and would have far reaching effects. I am (was) the only real leader in the building. I know those last couple sentences sound arrogant but they are true. The only reason I haven’t walked out is because I do care about my team and the other teams as well. 

My boss is the highest title in the building. His boss is 500 miles away and only two months into his role. He is clueless as to what’s going on here. 

Do I stick it out and try and replace him? Do I discuss this with his boss who is only 2 months into his role himself? Or do I just walk away and let in all come down?

I’m so confused and angry.

He tells me within 10 mins of getting back from lunch that today is his last day and he has to vacate the office in 15 mins. This is the type of boss where we would talk about sports, family, life etc. We would just text about random stuff outside of work or even go to sporting events and such.  I really enjoyed working for him and we were talking about growing our team together. He was showing me the ropes on promoting and pretty much being his right hand man. People on our team and others in the office stated he was pretty much helping me take over a lot of the marketing. I’ve been here a year and a half in which the book of business has increased another 30%. As we were talking he stated he’s not trying to “poach me” with air quotes but stated we will have a a discussion in the near future about building his team at his new gig. I trust he will but I’m conflicted on to stay at my current roll or find something else in the meantime time. There are other managers I can work for in the office but don’t really see myself fitting in because of their personalities.

1bjgnw5,Advice on reaching out to contact for open roles ,"Hi! I had a contract role with a large company within my industry. They gave me great reviews and extended my contract once. After the extension the company had mass layoffs and had to let go of all contracted workers at that time.

I kept her email on file and emailed 5 months out asking if she anticipated any roles opening I would be a good fit for. She replied pleasantly and let me know there were no openings becoming available anytime soon. 

I since aquired another contracted role but it’s outside of my industry and I would much prefer the previous role. 

It’s been 8 months since my last email. Would it benefit me to email again in the hopes of staying on her radar or could this come across as desperate and annoying?

1bjg7tp,Can't figure out if I should leave job I hate after less than a year,"Moved across country about a year ago. Started this new job that is essentially remote 95% of the time (new office that they're trying to build out, long story) further, the company is very focused on sales, optics, etc and in the 10 months I've been there, they've fired 3 people (which for a 80 people firm is quite a lot). Commute is long, upwards of an hour because of traffic

I've been looking for gigs since I'm just not thrilled. Even though 10 months isn't a long time, I'm just fed up with the culture and as a new person to a new city I'm downright lonely. 

Met a firm that seems to be more ethically aligned to me in a lot of ways. Problem is, it's a startup, only a 4 man crew. Good news is they're profitable, and the commute is so good I could literally walk, which I plan to do. 

My issue is the anxiety of switching jobs again, to a role that would by definition be a gamble. I know switching jobs after 10 months is already a bad sign in the future, but having this one fail quickly too looks even worse. I can't tell if I'm just freaking out or if there's merit to this paranoia.

1bjel35,"Feeling lost, bad run of luck, decisions, and in financial chaos","TLDR; I have about 4 weeks of savings left before being broke (not including credit cards). I feel like I made a serious of bad decisions and been quite unlucky. How do I end this rut.


Been working in my industry for 15+ years, fairly senior, not management, and mostly in IC type roles. Salary was circa £95k with a small bonus (10-15%) attached.

Start of last year I was made redundant a few months after upsizing everything (family, mortgage, car). To make matters worse, we invested heavily (and some, by maxing credit card debt) into redeveloping the house as it’s quite old whilst I was out of working thinking I’d get a job pretty quickly. 

I invested my redundancy money into a close family friends company as it was about to sell and I would have made 4x.  

The company didn’t sell, and the stock market has crashed. If I sell now, I’ll lose 3/4 of my investment.

The industry I work in had a series of major redundancies last year (even with the major players in the market) and getting back into work took many months.

I finally landed a job, I took a pay drop just to get back working - £70-80k. And although not perfect, the job fitted quite well with my experience. 6 months later, I don’t pass probation and told its due to performance yet at no point prior had my line manager made any comments to this effect during our weekly meetings. Nor did I have any clear objectives! Stunned to say the least.

Im now facing a situation where I don’t know how long it will take to get a job and start earning again. The industry still hasn’t recovered. 

I will get my last pay check tomorrow but that will be wiped out pretty much with bills etc.

I can downsize the car but it’s going to cost me £1-2k (which I don’t really have, unless I add to credit card) as the dealership says it’s in negative equity. Not to mention the £500-£2k deposit for a new car. 

On the job front, I have a few interviews lined up. Paying £60-70k but in an area of the industry where I have limited experience. A few years ago I wouldn’t have even made these interviews. So that’s one positive. 

Really just feeling lost at the moment. Just need to start earning, I’m applying for driver jobs just to get some money coming in to support the family. 

Any advice on someone feeling down.

I've recently secured a new job in my field, and as a result, I'll be leaving my current position in the back office of a not-so-loved corporation.

1bjeesa,"I'm so annoyed by my new job, I don't know what to do! Help!","Hey guys I need some advice. 

So I left my previous job to continue my education. Because it's me and I'm obviously on God's shit list, I wasn't able to finish school. It took me about 5 months to find another job. 

The first couple weeks were awesome! I was hired as a full time Medical Assistant, and I loved it. Here's the issue:

Last week they decided they wanted me trained on front desk. When I say I can't stand the front desk position, I am not exaggerating. It's the weirdest system ever and it's like my brain rejects it. 

They are a family practice/chiropractor office/urgent care office. And they use two different systems for their office. Once side is for the chiro and family med appointments and another side is for the urgent care. 

These two systems do not talk to each other. Meaning if a patient comes in to be seen in the urgent care then want to establish as a patient that means that you have to create two different charts for them, one in each system. And get a release of information or exchange of PHI signed in order to pull their information from one system to another.

Not to mention I have one trainer in the morning telling me one thing, only for the afternoon trainer telling me to ignore everything the morning trainer said. Hard to when she is literally breathing down my neck while also being insanely absent at the same time. 

The phone rings non stop so she goes to answer the phone and find a computer so she can help whoever is calling. So I'm by myself bullshitting my way through the check I'm process. 

Then I have another MA that loves to jump my shit for not knowing what I'm doing. The stress is really getting to me. The other front desk people have the bonus of knowing the patients and can pick out a patient with an appointment vs one that's just in for a weekly shot. I do not have that luxury. 

I'm supposed to be getting ready for work at this moment but I'm so annoyed I don't want to go. I was not hired for front desk. I was hired for MA. And worse the provider is talking about everyone rotating so I'd spend a week doing family medicine MA, a week doing urgent care MA, then a week at front desk. I'm profoundly against this. The sheer amount of extra steps, clicks, and paperwork is ridiculous. And not efficient at all. 

I really want to quit and find something else, but that was a long hard 5 months living by the grace of God. 

I just don't know what to do. Yesterday I about walked off the job before the owner handed me a $20 and said ""yesterday sucked ass, so here, lunch is on me."" And this was a life saver since I've been working here three weeks and still haven't seen a single pay check. So money is seriously tight.

1bjdlhm,moving out of engineering? ,"hi! i’m a 27 yo chemical engineer in the southeast. i have about 4 years of experience and make around 100k not including bonus. i am burnt out of engineering. without going into management, it appears my pay is going to cap out around 120-130k and that is just not enough for homeownership on a single income anymore. i also want increased geographic flexibility (most of the jobs in my industry are in the south and midwest). i really want to be able to move west of the rockies but job opportunities are more limited, very competitive, and do not pay enough for the cost of living out there. so i’m looking for advice for a career switch. i’ve considered moving to the EPC (engineering procurement construction) side of chemical engineering but the pay is worse than at a plant.

any ideas? or skills to start working on to transfer out?

1bjd2n5,I need help deciding between two jobs.,"So I've been given the opportunity to make a lateral transfer in my company, but I'm feeling very conflicted on what path to choose. For reference, I've only been in the workforce a year after graduation, I'm 25, and in STEM. It'd between my current job (Job A) and another opportunity (Job B)

Let me tell you the rest of my pros and cons, and you can tell me what you'd choose.
-
-A is half remote, while B is onsite (maybe) 25%, but more likely 10%. This means more money spent on commute, as well as reduced work life balance.

-There's no pay bump for the new position.

-I have my own office (well, half of a shared room) whereas the B role has cubicles (less personal space).

-My current role is generalized, where the B program is more specialized. although there are other projects I could take on.

-I'm not really passionate about my current work. But definitely feel like I would be on Job B.

-I haven't been feeling really happy in my current role either, but it's unclear whether I'd be ""happy"" due to a change of pace in the new role.

-I feel like both roles are useful to society which I value, although I think B wins in that battle.

-The B role is ever so slightly closer to the office (but only by 1 mi/a few mins of commute unless I get a new apt in the next couple of weeks substantially closer)

-My current role has a familiar environment and people, which isn't the case in the new role (could just be a comfort zone issue but idk)

-If I take the new role, it'd start as a rotation until December, at which point I can decide to come back to A, stay there at B, or expand to more generalized role in that new group.

-My current group is small/medium (10-15 people) that I interact with regularly, whereas the new role would be 5 I think. Would have to interact with them a lot more though due to bring onsite more. 

-The new role due to its nature has more potential to overwhelm/overstimulate me. I think I'm autistic and I've been feeling burnt out in my current role even though I have a decent work life balance. So I'm scared of burning out in the new role.

-There's less pressure in my current role compared to what itd seemingly be like in the new one.

-I feel like my career would have more direction on B compared to my current role.

I know this is a lot of information to contextualizr but picture you were an ambitious young engineer trying to change the world, but also trying to keep a balance with that ambition. What would you choose?

I was pushed to my breaking point and then had things that going on in my life and stuff told directors in confidence used against me ending up with me in the emergency room and fired just after coming out hospital when I informed them I been signed off on the sick. 

I spent the last 8 months out of work working on managing concerts and publicity for local artists both locally and internationally while also working on some community projects and courses, while I sorted myself out having pushed well beyond my breaking point. I am trying get back in work but gap and the work I done since being departure from what I done before, I am struggling get any interviews with Operations roles and having burnt through majority of saving getting new flat is out question. 

Inspired by work I done over 8 months and just wanting a change getting away from where I lived past 30 years, I want transition to project management ideally working contracts with companies so I can move about and at least have novelty of experiencing new locations to make up for complete loss of security in my life as well as long term be able to take on a few big projects a year, so I can then be financially position to do one or two community projects a year.

1bjcjdn,Unsure if I should consider a career change to a higher paying job,"I’ve been working at this company for over 6 years now, and frankly I love my job. There isn’t much to complain about except for the lack of career progression and also monetary remuneration. Everything else is really good. I have good colleagues, nice managers and the work politics here are practically nonexistent. The reason why I even stayed in this company for so long is due to all the positives I listed above.

The reason why I’m considering a career change is because I got my degree certificate about a year ago, and even then, my company who is well aware of that didn’t give me any form of increment of promotion. I spoke to my manager about this and he told me that this is just how it works over here. Right now, I’m earning an acceptable amount but definitely on the lower end compared to other fellow degree graduates. Also, even though I’ve been here for 6 years, I’ve only received a promotion once during my time here, with barely any increase in pay.

Another reason why I’m considering a career change is because I recently broke down at work due to family and work stressors. My colleagues were nice to console and offer me support, however I learnt today that a manager told her staff that I am crazy. This fact is weighing heavily upon me and I’m not sure if I can see myself working here as happily as I used to before. I’m not sure if it relevant but that same staff the manager talked to actually had a mental breakdown at work and became violent. I’m wondering if perhaps the reason why her manager told her about me is so that she wouldn’t feel so isolated. That staff definitely started talking to me more on friendly terms since then.

I really like my job as it gives me opportunities to grow personally and professionally. It also is quite flexible in terms of working hours and I don’t feel like I need to be in my toes and worry about being backstabbed at work.

What would you guys do if you were in my situation? Would you consider a career change as well, or just stay in this company as it’s a pretty decent place to work at?

Unfortunately, since the new president took office in the country in December 2023, the situation has become more complicated and I am forced to work on a dating application. I really don't want to do it, I just need a little help until things get better but I don't have anyone to give it to me. I know that God is great and I will get out of this situation. And I know that there are still good-hearted people who can help my cause. House rent increased by 300%.
There is hyperinflation, devaluation. Everything increases every day except salaries. I'm desperate. I am attaching my emails for anything you want to know. And my cell phone number. I don't know the characteristic. I'm in Argentina, Buenos Aires, Ituzaingo. Thank you so much.

1bjb49s,2 things I did to instantly raise my interview rate,"It's not uncommon to see job postings with thousands of applicants these days, the job market has become very competitive to say the least. Here are two hacks that gave me a huge advantage when I was job hunting last year and that I think everyone should be implementing.  
**1-Customize your resume for each job application, add important keywords and skills from the job description**  
This can feel tedious at times but totally worth it. Most recruiters use software that automatically rejects your application when your resume doesn’t contain certain keywords or skills from the job description. If the job description has a skill or program that you kind of know you should still include it in your resume. If you end up getting an interview just review that skill online (read about it, watch YouTube videos) a few days before the interview in case you get asked about it. It’s widely known that the majority of job posts exaggerate the skills/experience you actually need for the job anyways. For example in programming many job posts “require” years of experience for tools or frameworks that came out last year 😂. So before applying, look at the job description and see if there’s anything important you should add/replace in your resume. Download the new version of your resume and send that one. I was doing this manually at the beginning of my job hunt and started using [jobSyncAI](https://jobsyncai.co/) once I stared applying to more jobs to automate the process.  
**2- Write a short email to anyone in the company (can be the CEO if the company is small, or anyone in the team where you would be working).**  
The email should be concise, let the person know that you’re interested in the company and why, but more importantly mention how your skills will bring value to the company. You’ll be surprised by how many people reply, sometimes they’ll ask you for more information, like a portfolio and in turns into a back and forth conversation. This is how I was able to get a remote job last year.  
How to get anyone’s email  
Some people recommend sending this type of messages on LinkedIn direct messages, but this wasn't very effective in my experience. Almost no one replied/saw the messages. I think a lot of people get spammed on LinkedIn messages which is why most don’t even check them.  
But if you’re able to reach out via someone's email inbox, that's a different story. Here’s how you can get anyone’s email:  
First search for the company you’re applying for in linkedIn. In their LinkedIn page you’ll be able to see who works there. Look up their name in [RocketReach](https://rocketreach.co/), they’ll usually give you 2-3 email addresses. Send the email to all of those to maximize the chances of your email getting seen.  
Besides those two things try to apply to 10+ jobs per day. Don’t get discouraged by rejections or if you get ghosted. Once you start landing interviews you’ll build up momentum. Good luck with your job hunt, I know it can be a stressful time but you’ll get there if you put in the time 💪.",Volunder_22,1,1.0,1,1710933841,2024-03-20 11:24:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bjb49s/2_things_i_did_to_instantly_raise_my_interview/,3,2024

1bjaitb,Salary/terms negotiation options?,"Hi everyone,

My senior colleague is getting fired after XX years at the firm because of his poor performance. The firm is not looking for a replacement. I will be taking over the department’s responsibility. What are my terms negotiation options?

To give you some background… the senior colleague was performing poorly since I joined the firm. Due to this fact I was already taking most of the responsibility and the management relied on me anyway. Nothing is changing much for me, because I had to “babysit” anything he did anyway and the management knows it. Now I will become the only one responsible.  

I am worried, that the fact of being the only one responsible now is not enough to justify any terms/salary negotiations. I am talking about corporate where money/budget is usually not an issue, it all comes down to your negotiation skills and arguments. However, I feel like I am already payed well according to my experience, education compared to local statistics. 

What are your thoughts?

I do think job #2 will be more intense and feeling a lot of imposter syndrome potentially going into a different area of the bank. Given their interview process was so quick, I’m also inclined to believe that underperformance will lead to a fairly swift termination. However if it goes well, there is a lot of career opportunity. Whereas, job #1 is safe, something I’m familiar with, and seems like a supportive team.

- potentially starting a family within next 3 years
- more of an introvert

1bj9ymd,Internship Salary Question,"Hey everybody,

So I recently got a paid internship for a large worldwide company of about 30k employees. This internship is in a new city 3 hours away from my hometown, I have been fortunate enough to have been offered a place to stay at low rent until my internship ends. I very much like this company and enjoy working there, I have learned a lot in a short time and have become able to handle my tasks, and often find myself doing schoolwork, as I have usually done my work in not very much time. I only started about 2 months ago at this time, my internship hours are finished technically, so I will get my degree. About a month after I started, I was offered a full time job, but nothing is signed. I did verbally accept this. Less than 2 weeks later, my co-worker got fired (My boss said he was not fulfilling his duties adequately anymore, I dont have much more context than that).  My boss offered me his job full time after a trial period of 2-3 weeks to see if he would need to hire someone else to help me out. I am imagining that having him hire someone else means I would be fired. The cost of living in this city is much higher than my hometown, and I would not be opposed to going back there and finding another job.

Naturally, I would ask for a raise when becoming full time, before my co-worker got fired I was going to only ask for about 10% more, but now that I would be taking his job on pretty much by myself, I feel more comfortable asking for more. There aren't that many of us in the tech department so I would be the only one doing certain jobs for 6 offices across the province. With all that said, I am thinking of asking for double or more of the salary, which I realize is ambitious, but I would also be okay moving back home and getting a lower paying job somewhere where cost of living is lower. Also I would be taking on twice as much work, which I can prove. My boss keeps saying I am doing good work and seems excited to want to keep me on. Again, nothing is in writing yet as of now, and I am starting my trial period later in the week, as my boss wants to see how I can handle the job for a little bit. I just want to know if what I am asking is ridiculous

Happy to answer clarifying questions, it is late as I am typing this.

TL;DR: I am an intern at a large company getting offered a full time job as a system admin level 2 in a new city after coworker got fired, I am his essentially his replacement as he did train me. I want to ask for double my salary, is this a terrible idea?",CanadaEhThereBud853,1,1.0,0,1710929404,2024-03-20 10:10:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bj9ymd/internship_salary_question/,3,2024

There is just so much unnecessary stress and nothing I ever do is good enough for anyone. And to top it off, I have no work life balance.

1bj7y50,Leaving the Design Field for Hospitality,"Hey, so I'm at the crossroads in my career. I have a degree in graphic design and 3 years of experience. My last agency was struggling to find clients, so a bunch of us were laid off. It took me over a year to find my current design job. 

I've been there about 3 weeks and I absolutely hate it. The job is really low paid, around 30k a year, 40 hours a week, no remote options, no flexibility. On top of that my boss is a micro-manager and very intense. We have an open office, but everyone is just sitting at their desk, not talking or interacting with each other. It's a bit boring and I really don't like sitting and staring at a computer all day.

I have a friend that works in restaurants and he gets so many job offers with so many benefits. He recently got a job in F&B at the Hilton Hotel and he earns more money than me, more flexibility and hotel discounts, etc.

My job offers me literally nothing. So just for fun, I applied to a bunch of waitress jobs in hotels and immediately got 2 interviews. They also pay more than my current design job, have opportunities to grow, much easier to get a job, discounts on hotels, transportation credits, etc. Plus I'm afraid of AI taking all the design jobs in the future anyway.

Idk, am I crazy? I've worked in many hotels and restaurants in my youth (I'm 35 now) and I always enjoyed the hustle and bustle, the fast pace, always having something to do, etc. When I'm at work, I want to be busy, I want the time to go by quickly. I know it's no dream job, but is a good idea to switch? 

Any advice?

Thanks in advance!

1bj6bo1,How would you approach this situation? ,"I have a complicated situation and looking for advice. First some background, I met my wife while she was in grad school 5 years ago. She is working on her PhD, and one year ago we found out she matched for her internship in a city across the country. This internship would be for one year with a possibility of a second year for a post doc. I had been doing well in my career, but ultimately it was just a job to me and not something I was passionate about. My wife is very passionate about her work, so I decided to quit my job and take a role in a new industry as my old employer would not allow me to work remotely. We did not want to do long distance. 

I ended up finding a remote position at a company based in my new city. One of the main reasons I accepted this position was due to it being fully remote knowing that I would likely be moving again in a year or two. However, a month after beginning, our company announced that we had to come back into the office May 2024. This wasn't an immediate issue since I live in the city.  I just earned a promotion this month and things have been going well. I have a good relationship with my manager as well as a few members of the senior management team. That being said, I don't really like the work much and don't see myself wanting to stay in this industry long term.

Recently, my wife accepted a post doc position in a new city and will start in August. I will be moving with her at this time. Due to my relationships with the management team I was able to negotiate continuing WFH through the end of 2024. This is only because they were understanding of my situation being told the position was fully remote and then having that taken away so quickly. (The people involved in my hiring were unaware of the imminent WFH mandate and advocated for me). I am operating under the assumption I will not be granted permission to WFH at all in 2025.

I am starting to look for a new job in the new city, but I am looking for advice on how to approach my exit with my current company. Obviously, I don't want to quit until I have something new lined up. Here are some of the questions I am considering: 

1. When should I notify my employer that I will be moving in August? Although I have negotiated to WFH through the end of the year, I do have occasional work events that I need to attend in person. I won't be able to hide that I have moved. I don't want to ruin any relationships by keeping this from them too long, but also know they will start looking to replace me as soon as they know because we are very busy. The corporate culture in my company makes me very sure they will not allow me to WFH permanently,  but if they don't have a suitable replacement it could potentially extend into 2025.

2. If I do not have a new job lined up by the end of the year and they have made clear I cannot WFH in 2025, do I quit or just continue working and make them fire me? I prefer not to go this route as I have always valued my relationships and everyone I work with has treated me well. If I leave before they have a replacement lined up I will be really adding a lot of work to people who are already over worked. At the same time, I know this corporation would let me go without thinking twice if it would help their bottom line. I also prefer to not have ever been fired. Is this a question employers ask when applying for a job? On the other side, everything from an HR perspective moves painfully slow, so I could be buying myself an extra few months of employment.

I appreciate any advice anyone has. As much as anything, I wanted to write this all out to help process my own thoughts. Right now I am leaning towards notifying my employer of my move a few weeks before and try to push off any conversations about what the plan will be once 2025 comes. Of course I am hoping to have something else lined up by then, but I have the opportunity to be more picky this time around that my wife will be making a real salary at her post doc compared to the approximately $20,000 she is making annually for her internship.

1bj5551,Do I take the job? Or run the other way!,"

I have the opportunity to work with a small business in the wedding industry on the weekends. I already have another more solid job lined up so this was just to do something with my other skills and make more money. So I’m asking for advice on how to proceed to see if it’s worth it. Or if I should let this go and find a better place to work for, or do it myself because I have the skills to open up my own business. Any thoughts and comments welcome. 

For this business, I did one day of work in the field and one at the office as a trial to show him the work I could produce. After finishing the project we were going to discuss pay and scheduling. 

First day I arrive early and get set up, the other girl working with me says that our boss messed up and forgot to give her something so we had to start our clients ceremony 20 minutes late when she received the tool. We go over time and I don’t think much of it because I focused on my responsibility. The ceremony was beautiful and I did my job. 

Second day I’d set up a time with my boss to come into the office to finish up the project because he needed three hours with me. I arrive early to find that no one is there. I call and he says he’s on the way and that the assistant should be there soon. I waited 40mins for her and she didn’t know I was coming. I barely had the chance to talk to her before she had to go grab a client from the waiting room so I sat around waiting even longer. In short, during the two hours where I tried to do work, I was given a computer that had no space on it, and the wrong memory card that didn’t have my stuff on it. When he showed up at 1:20pm he went straight to discussing finalizations with the client. Then eventually I had a chance to ask him how much he wanted me to do and ask for direction. As I’m working on my stuff next to them they’re discussing different events and plans, etc. One hour in they are discussing a specific event related issue which turns into a large argument about a single thing that turned into multiple wrong things happening within the business. Mid argument the boss pauses to apologize to me and discloses that they are in a relationship, have a baby together and that he’d fire her if this were a regular employee. It lasted ten minutes with me sitting quietly trying to focus on the work and tune out the argument. It was a mess, but he did ask her multiple times to talk to him professionally and go over the problem like coworkers but she couldn’t keep her cool. But also she had some good points about his lack of organization and professionalism as a boss and claimed that he keeps making her look bad to clients because of it. Eventually it dies down but soon after she screamed even louder and said she couldn’t take it anymore and went silent, another customer knocked at the door. Unhappy she comes to pick up her products and boss gives her half and says he must’ve left the other stuff at home and doesn’t have it for her. Client leaves dissatisfied. Soon after, boss calls out the gf and states his disappointment then chose to leave He asked me to call him afterwards and he’d review the work and discuss pay and I told him I could in the evening. 

I did my work and luckily got it done before I had to leave to another commitment. He called at 8 to say that he cut the girls hours and that I’ll never have to see her again because she will be working from home and won’t be in the field or office any longer. Also stated that she has anger issues and abuses her power of being in a relationship with him. He apologized again but didn’t really take responsibility for much else. Nonetheless he was bad mouthing his gf and employee to an interviewee (me). So I’ve noticed a bunch of unprofessionalism and disorganization within the business. 

He the stated what a beautiful job I did and that he loves my work. That he needs me and wants to make sure I’m comfortable with continuing how things were headed. I told him I needed time to think. He asked to give him another chance because I’m so cool and he needs my skills and stuff like that. No money offer has been made from his end for me to continue working with him though. 

I absolutely love the position and the work I did was awesome but idk if it’s worth pursuing because of the rest. 
I spoke with my parents and friends about this and I have my own thoughts too that I won’t be disclosing because I want an outside view of the facts to see if I’m making the right choice.

1bj4g4b,On the fence about quitting my high-paying entry level job (2 years in) due to undesirable location & working in a field I’m unsure I want to be in long-term. Too risky or OK this early in my career?,"To keep things brief, I graduated in May 2022 with a Mechanical Engineering degree. Went to the career fair during senior year and got an entry-level job offer for a manufacturing company. I didn’t have much previous experience so it was my only and best offer.   
  
This job actually had me work in a few of their locations (different plants in different states) as a “rotational” program to increase my skills as an employee in the company. The incentive was that they provided free housing along with normal pay due to the relocations. This was enough for me to immediately say yes without thinking about my future career.  
  
The program lasts 2 years, and at the end I’m sent to a “permanent” position at one of the plants I worked at. I would be starting this permanent position in July, and they are offering a salary increase to 92k and a sign-on bonus (since now I have to pay rent somewhere). Not sure what the sign-on bonus is yet, but from what I hear from others it should be between 5-10k, (I keep it if I stay at the company for a certain amount of time). From the start of the program, they already told me which plant I will be permanently going to, so I don’t have a say in moving to a different one of their plants if I wanted.  
  
While the benefits of this offer sound great, there are issues 2 issues I have with this final position:  
  
1. Job - As I said, I picked this job without actually thinking about what I want to do with my career, what field I want to work in, or what I even want to do with my engineering degree. At this job, my title is a “Quality” engineer. For those unfamiliar with quality engineering, specifically in automotive manufacturing industry, I don’t do typical engineering work like designing things, rather I just deal with production problems, root cause analysis, customer complaints, and having to “educate” people on mistakes they’re making. I did get to work on a few projects that felt more like engineering tasks. I didn't research about quality before signing up, but going online, reading mechanical engineering subreddits, and other engineering blogs, not a single person has anything good to say about quality, and that it will end up being a dead-end job. And unfortunately a lot of people say they get sucked-in when staying too long, and they are unable to switch fields and end up stuck in quality. Even at my company the quality departments of all the plants are constantly losing people as the work sucks, and I know from talking to other employees that my work will only suck more if I stay long term. Especially at this plant, they struggle to hire there due to the work and location, so that’s why they are offering me great pay just 2 years out of college. Since I'm still in this entry-level position, I haven’t been given massive responsibilities, so my work has been fine these 2 years, but I know that if I take this permanent position, I'll be bombarded with more crap to deal with. I don’t want to get too far into this field and end up stuck in it, and have no transferable skills to a different field. Despite working for 2 years, I feel like a “mediocre” engineer and not sure how to get into a new field, nor even what field to get into.  
  
2. Location - This plant is located in a very rural 4,000 person town. Another town of 9k is \~30 minutes away, a town of 30k is \~50 minutes away, and the closest big city (a few hundred thousand people) is \~2 hours away. My first half-year with the company was actually in this rural location, and it sucked. Absolutely nothing to do (ok with me cause i’m boring), but what sucked was having no friends. Didn't make any friends in the small 4,000 person town my whole time there. Not really anyone in their 20’s there. It was ok my first few months since I could occasionally drive to my college 2 hours away for the weekend, but now 2 years out none of my friends are there anymore. So I will literally have no one. After living there for half a year, I am certain I don’t want to stay there long-term.  
  
I will say however this is a good company. I like 90% of the people I work with/have worked with in the different locations (maybe 50% in this rural location), but I just know that the work will get harder if I stay, and I might get stuck in a job I don’t like.  
  
Part of me wants to try it for 6-12 months to see what it's like and reap the beneftis of higher pay, all while having the mental closure that I can leave whenever I want. I know other engineers would love a high-paying job in a LCOL area, and I could also use the higher salary when negotiating for a new job when I decide to leave. But again I fear the work will be too much and I know the longer I stay, the less transferable skills I will have and the less likely I’ll be able to go somewhere new.  
  
I’m still young (25) and only 2 years out of college, so I feel like a job hop this early in my career wouldn’t be a red flag on my resume. Although I fear realistically I wouldn’t be able to find a job paying as well, and a pay cut would suck. And I’m not ever sure how to go about finding a new job as I got this one while I was still in school. If I decide to leave, I have 3 months to decide what field I want to work in, where I want to work, and how I would find that job.  
  
Worst case, if I quit and don’t have a job lined up in July, I have at least 12 months of savings for all my necessary bills (not rent). My parents are completely fine with me staying with them as long as I can pay my bills. But again this is not an ideal scenario.

1bj44jd,Anyone in the music publishing business?,"
I want to get my foot in the door and am looking for some direction. I’m a musician, I  produce and mix, and I’ll even do personal foley projects for cartoons I find on the internet.  

I’m as sharp as I can be without a law degree about licensing, rights, types of contracts, foreign monies and sub publishers, PRO’s (I’m personally with BMI). 

I’m really wanting to get into music for tv and video games, but more so on the business side of things. I have no degree, so it’s much harder to even email a professional and ask for an opportunity.

What’s my best bet? Write some music, shop it to publishers, hope for a placement and get started that way? I mean if that’s the answer then I’m already on track lol. 

And just for some context, I work with local rappers in a hardly existing music scene. The plan is to build something from nothing though lol",SodaFried,1,1.0,0,1710905602,2024-03-20 03:33:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bj44jd/anyone_in_the_music_publishing_business/,3,2024
1bj3dc9,How do I navigate this situation? Independent contractor to employee.,"     Hey everyone, I have been working for this company for two years now as an independent contractor. About six months ago, I asked to become an employee, which would come with a raise and more recognition, which would help with career growth within the organization. They said Yes, and they will start the process.

     We have a parent company they have to submit this request to. Week after week and month after month, I have heard that the parent company is slow and asking questions, and so on and so on. 

     I just found out today that they rejected my first request to become an employee because my job is not supposed to be inside any of the companies our parent company owns. After all, they own a company that is supposed to handle this specific department. Now, my company is saying it is no issue, and someone in the parent company has advised them to request me as an employee with a different job description and title that matches my asking pay. 

     I love what I do and enjoy my co-workers, but I see this as a hindrance to the main reason for asking to become an employee, which was for more recognition and career growth in my specific department. 

     How do I navigate this situation? Any advice is welcome.",BusIcy6195,1,1.0,0,1710903299,2024-03-20 02:54:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bj3dc9/how_do_i_navigate_this_situation_independent/,3,2024

1bj1lsf,I told prospective employer about my restrictive covenant with current employer- he wasn’t concerned so now my question is do I tell my current job I’m leaving to go to a competitor?,"As the title suggests- I told someone I interviewed with (who happens to be the owner) about my restrictive covenant today.

He then went on to tell me that the guys that started my current company actually started at his firm so if they send him a letter he’ll just tell them to “f off”.

Now my question is, do I tell my current employer where I am going when I resign? Even though my prospective employer seems to have my back, I don’t want to burn bridges with them or open myself up to future litigation. 

My current employer has helped me grow in this field tremendously and I have felt very loyal to them in the past (my prospective employer has tried to poach me twice now) but at this point my caseload there is unmanageable (10x what it would be at my competitor) and I got a 2% raise this year despite my case load doubling. In addition, I found out individuals with less experience, that I trained, are being paid more than me.

1bivsgx,"Got a promo, how to ask for a chance to negotiate pay?","I got promoted to a senior role at my company.

HR just sent me a personal action form I am to sign with the new pay.

I see that the new pay is significantly below market rate for the new title (from viewing glass door and talking to people I know in similar roles). In fact it does not even beat inflation in the last 2 years, meaning that I am getting promoted with a pay cut in real terms...

How to I politely ask for a chance to discuss my compensation? We are fully remote, so I think it will have to be an email to HR. Can you help me word this in a tactful way?

We are a smallish company, and some colleagues have had video call meetings with HR and our CEO about this. I am trying to set up that conversation.

I must also add that I have good reasons to ask for more. I have taken on significantly more responsibilities, and my performance was consistently excellent according to client feedback. I also reached a point where I would be really difficult to replace in some of our client projects, as I am the only expert in that particular field.

Thanks!

1bivpud,I need help deciding between two jobs.,"So I've been given the opportunity to make a lateral transfer in my company, but I'm feeling very conflicted on what path to choose. For reference, I've only been in the workforce a year after graduation, I'm 25, and in STEM. It'd between my current job (Job A) and another opportunity (Job B)

Let me tell you the rest of my pros and cons, and you can tell me what you'd choose.
-
-A is half remote, while B is onsite (maybe) 25%, but more likely 10%. This means more money spent on commute, as well as reduced work life balance.
-There's no pay bump for the new position.
-I have my own office (well, half of a shared room) whereas the B role has cubicles (less personal space).
-My current role is generalized, where the B program is more specialized. although there are other projects I could take on.
-I'm not really passionate about my current work. But definitely feel like I would be on Job B.
-I haven't been feeling really happy in my current role either, but it's unclear whether I'd be ""happy"" due to a change of pace in the new role.
-I feel like both roles are useful to society which I value, although I think B wins in that battle.
-The B role is ever so slightly closer to the office (but only by 1 mi/a few mins of commute unless I get a new apt in the next couple of weeks substantially closer)
-My current role has a familiar environment and people, which isn't the case in the new role (could just be a comfort zone issue but idk)
-If I take the new role, it'd start as a rotation until December, at which point I can decide to come back to A, stay there at B, or expand to more generalized role in that new group.
-My current group is small/medium (10-15 people) that I interact with regularly, whereas the new role would be 5 I think. Would have to interact with them a lot more though due to bring onsite more. 
-The new role due to its nature has more potential to overwhelm/overstimulate me. I think I'm autistic and I've been feeling burnt out in my current role even though I have a decent work life balance. So I'm scared of burning out in the new role.
-There's less pressure in my current role compared to what itd seemingly be like in the new one.
-I feel like my career would have more direction on B compared to my current role.

I know this is a lot of information to contextualizr but picture you were an ambitious young engineer trying to change the world, but also trying to keep a balance with that ambition. What would you choose?

1biv4us,My coworker is annoying and makes me resent working with her,"I’ve been working at my job for 9 months now. It’s just me and two other people working out of a luxury retail store. The person that I’m referring too “Sarah” works in Sales and I work as Sales support.  

“Sarah” has actually become a person that I do have some form of adoration for but she has some very sketchy ways where I don’t know if it’s her own insecurity rubbing off or what. She consistently refers to the store as “her store” “my store” “my my my.” She has been with the company for years so I understand, we also make money off of her sales but this complex that she has is beyond annoying. Whatever comes after irritating.

For reference, I have very good relationships with management and HR.

However, I don’t know how to go about asking my employer to sponsor me and create a position that may not potentially exist. Likewise, I’m not really sure on how to approach the situation and convince them to fund my study. The course I identified is online and can be done in my own time, the company also have a government levy to upskill their employees. Also, if there was a possibility for them to sponsor me in a different field I would still be interested.

1bit5j1,I feel lost,"I feel a little lost

Hi everyone. 

As the title says I feel a little lost with my professional life. I'm a 31M, living in Ontario. In 2013 I went to University where I got a degree with honours, in Poli Sci. After graduation, I managed to get an internship at a credit union. After a year and a half, I managed to get promoted to full time cashier, and a little after that I got promoted to cashier supervisor. While working there, the customer service aspect of the job really took a toll on my metal health. That's when I decided to pursue a dream I had in Univeristy, which was to work as a Wind Turbine Technician, to eventually open my own business in South America. 

So in 2020 I went to college (technical college) where I got a diploma in Electrical Engineering and Energy Systems. I graduated last year. After a lot of attempts, and a couple of interviews, I still haven't managed to land a job in the wind industry. I have been working at a factory in the electrical department, and the salary and atmosphere there isn't good. I wanted a job in the trades so I can work outside with some adventure, now I'm stuck in a factory. 

When I had the dream of being a wind turbine technician, I was single, and was willing to go to the middle of nowhere to work. During my studies I met the girl of my dreams and got married. Now I can't up root her life to come live with me I  the middle of nowhere. 

So what should I do now? I'm feeling lost and I feel like I'm holding my wife back because she had a great paying job and I can't keep up with what she wants to do in life.

I feel like it's too late for me to go back into any other job, except staying in the trades. And starting a new trades job somewhere else usually means I have to start from zero again, especially with my 1.5 years of experience in the trades.

I have started to expand my job search, like government office jobs, or working for institutions like the Canadian Border Services Agency.

I just don't know what to do now. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!",StunningMushroom5300,1,1.0,0,1710877157,2024-03-19 19:39:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bit5j1/i_feel_lost/,3,2024
1bit4iv,"Barely any training, lots of overtime and physical stress symptoms.","Hi everyone! 

I am in need of some advice because I’m really struggling in my new job. 

I started back in Nov ‘23 and was really looking forward to it. In my career it’s the natural progression to go into the role I am in now and I was really excited because it’s with a well-know company with an amazing reputation…(I thought)

When I started I was given next to no training other than to read some guides, jump on a few Zoom calls, do some mandatory training (fire safety etc) and shadow 3 appointments with my colleagues (we are client facing and work within the equality act to provide reasonable adjustments to people with impairments). 

At the time I felt that it was a bit premature because I only work part-time and therefore had less time and training than all the full-timers but trying to show what I can do, I got straight into it. 

Now almost 5 months down the line, I am working as if I am doing full-time hours and doing huge amounts of unpaid overtime (this is the standard set by management), I still haven’t been trained on everything despite asking repeatedly if someone could explain some of the very complicated processes to me (considering I am client facing, it makes me look incompetent), the team meetings are on my day off so I miss vital information and have to constantly scramble to watch recordings to make sure I don’t miss anything (no one tells me otherwise and processes change daily). 

I was annoyed enough today to ask for help from you guys because a colleague spoke to me really rudely for not doing something properly that I have asked THREE TIMES to be trained in. 

This whole situation is giving me physical symptoms linked to stress, I have spoken to my manager about it and nothing has been done to support me so I’m at a loss right now.

Does anyone have any advice about how I can approach this situation with management? At the moment I’m really angry but don’t want to lead with any emotions. Also to top it off, I have ADHD which doesn’t help! (Probably should have lead with this!) 

Any advice would be really appreciated! 

TLTR:
I’ve started a new job part-time I thought I would love but 5 months in I’ve not been adequately trained, working huge amounts of overtime and becoming unwell with stress.  I have told my line manager but nothing has been done. What do I do?

1birzzk,What would say is my job title?,"My current job title is “Database Analyst”, but that’s not accurate at all to what I do. I can’t code and can barely run SQL inquiries (but will be developing that skill a lot in the next couple years).

Background:

I was brought on to my firm a few years ago to basically administer the DMS and CMS programs we use. Run of the mill stuff - permissions, trouble shooting, imports/exports, advanced reporting, data views, page layouts/designs, automated workflows and vendor relations as the primary point of contact with the CMS’ of those programs. Firm was on the smaller side when I started (50-60 employees)

Where I’m at now:

Same as above, but for a LOT more vendors (HR software, AI document production software, claims warehouse software, central mail, etc.). If it’s on a computer, I have admin access and am “the guy” to go to regarding them. I built our virtual mailroom, I was the project lead on a migration of our accounting systems, in the middle of two more migrations, etc. I still do level 1-2-3 help desk.. I’m working with our TP IT contractors to get our SOC II. I helped land a large client this summer by demonstrating our tech and reporting services we could offer. I’m everywhere. Our firm has doubled in size (~120 employees) with no hiring slowdown in sight. My direct supervisors are the COO and the managing partner. I’m in a weird purgatory of management where I’m a manager to one person in every way but title. Leadership tells me I will have more direct reports in the future. 

My situation:

Got a raise last year. Will get a raise this year. But next year I’m planning on pushing for a large raise. In the meantime, I asked if they could change my title to more accurately reflect what I do. In reality, it’s so it’s easier for me to research median wages in my area. 

My question:

What would you guys call me? How would you angle it for the most lucrative non-coding career path? I am a fairly ambitious person and my goal is to one day be a CIO (lofty goal, I know) somewhere. I’d like for recruiters to start approaching me for jobs I’m actually qualified for, so I can try to leverage those into a raise in the future. I do not plan on leaving this firm for the foreseeable future. I love it there.

I currently work as a social media manager for a small engineering components supplier and absolutely loathe my job. I have no passion for marketing anymore and sitting at a computer working from home every day is slowly driving me insane. 

I want to go for a full career change while I’m still in the first half of my 20s. I’m thinking something more hands-on. I’ve always had a passion for mechanical engineering and love learning how machines work and think maybe a career in hydraulics, aerospace or automotive engineering would suit me well.

However I’m running into some issues that are swaying me away from some of these career paths.

• I worry that cars going electric means the mechanical cars that actually interest me will become rarer and rarer until being a mechanic becomes too many wires, computers and software stuff 

•many design and engineering jobs require a degree

•£40k seems to be the average top-end salary for people who went into a trade with an apprenticeship. And I would like the opportunity to earn more than that one day without having to be in an office.

•I would join the RAF to learn aircraft maintenance but can’t join the military due to a peanut allergy.

1biqmp8,Joining a Seed Level Start up,"
Hi all! 

I am currently a CSM at a smaller healthcare tech company and was approached to interview for a newer seed stage start up (healthcare tech AI company) and would love some advice on if this is a good move or not. I am not well versed in the start up world, so any advice or feedback is helpful! 

I was interviewed by the CFO and here is the details she shared: 

- They currently have 12 employees- all of the founders are college friends and I would be the first “official employee” (in her words) 
- They have been around since 2019 and received their first level of seed funding this year for 2.5 million and have about 2000 partnerships with medical facilities around the country. 
- I inquired about growth and expectations for future funding, and was told they are different from other start ups as they are  “already profitable” and not expecting to need another round of funding. They “exceed” their targets each quarter. 
- the pay offered was quite a bit lower than expected, I countered with a more comfortable range for me and was told they don’t really have a budget for this and she will try to get approval.


My concern is that all the answers to the  financial questions seemed a bit too good to be true. I don’t mind the hard work that comes with start ups as I believe the company is great and would be successful in the industry, but am hesitant in this economy and job market to make the jump and potentially get laid off.

Any thoughts or advice on future questions to ask would be so helpful! Thanks in advance! ",Solid_Ad3860,1,1.0,2,1710871060,2024-03-19 17:57:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1biqmp8/joining_a_seed_level_start_up/,3,2024

1biqd2o,Internship and full-time offer question,"Hiya! I'm a '23 graduate that recently got an offer for a helpdesk role that a cousin referred me for. I had a public trust just clear today, and I was just asked what date I'd like to start the position at.

While waiting for my PT to clear, I was approached by a company with an offer for a cybersecurity engineer internship that'd get me where I want to be career and experience wise, as well as offering much better working hours and a hybrid schedule (The helpdesk role would require 2 hour daily commute 5 days a week at an expense of over $284 a month for public transit and parking, not counting gas, VS just a 40 min - hour commute at most for maybe 2 or 3 days a week for the internship)

After an assessment and multiple interviews, I think I have a good chance at landing the internship, which would start at the end of May. I'd also have a good chance of landing a full time offer after the internship, and the pay for the internship is not so much of a decrease compared to the helpdesk role.

I had a talk with the internship company today (I let them know about the other job prior) and we talked about how there'd likely be conflict, since these companies are competitors in the same industry. They also said that they'd be able to finalize the internship candidates by next week, which is a bit of a wait, since I just got the email from the job offer I cleared for to choose a date.

I let the recruiter at the internship know of the finished process at my job offer, with my public trust being cleared, and they said they'd talk to the team today and get back to me tomorrow with more information.

I want to rescind the current job offer for the new one, given all the benefits, but I still don't have a concrete acceptance for the internship yet, and I do have to get back to my hiring manager at the job with something.

It's likely I wouldn't able to be employed at that company while also having the internship accepted. 

In the probable case I do get the internship (if I get a notification soon), what's the best way to go about talking to the first job before I choose a starting date, so I don't have to waste their time with onboarding and training, or possible non-compete issues.

Most likely I'll just have to wait until tomorrow to just see what the team at the internship says, and if they choose me and can get a letter in writing to me before I formally accept the initial position, but I'm still stressed with the timeframe of things.",thatsniceman,1,1.0,0,1710870393,2024-03-19 17:46:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1biqd2o/internship_and_fulltime_offer_question/,3,2024

1binfw4,Swapping Majors Senior Year of College?,"I'm 20 years old and am going to a great public university. I have already gotten an associates degree, and I am working towards my bachelors in financial mathematics. I have had a passion for finance in the past, but through some life events, my ethical and personal view points have changed to where I do not want to work in finance anymore (not dissing on anyone in finance). I work at a non-profit, where I work on computers and automating daily operations to make life more efficient. For example, I coded an inventory database that uses barcode scanners and APIs to keep track of items since our warehouse moves items quickly. Frankly, I have developed an obsession with computer science, because I realize the power of being able to create anything with these tools. Someday I want to go to grad school (probably for computer science), and because of that I have been getting involved in research at my university, but I think I should swap my math major from financial mathematics to applied mathematics, given that the coursework is way more applicable to computer science. The issue is that I have 3 semesters left, and if I swap to applied math I will extend my time at university to 4 semesters. Another issue that befuddles me is I am likely to want to change my major again, as when I find something I am passionate about, my passion usually dies out after a period of time (I have been doing computer science for a year, and I still love it, which is different than finance as my passion died out after a few months).

I finished most of an advanced degree in physics way back, had a mental breakdown and didn't finish over COVID and can't make myself return both for the mental aspect and the physical lab requirements, in person is essentially not an option for a number of reasons and you can't pass anything without it.

I'm on social support payments right now, and discounting volunteering at a graveyard in highschool and one placement in a niche chemistry lab I technically was supposed to be paid $200 for, I have never had paid work of any form. I have a small amount of Excel and coding experience (miniscule), a rusty but moderately broad mathematical education (multivariate calculus and systems of linear equations sort of level, finished all pure maths requirements for my degree but couldn't keep up with the lab hours on the practical classes), a decent understanding of English (high marks in English Studies and a couple of minor competition wins way back in the day), and a body that's not well suited to most work environments carrying a mind with such obvious and pervasive mental health issues that my in person presentation makes all the aforementioned basically useless. These issues are getting treated but unlikely to improve to the point of not being such major impediments, especially not soon, and money would really help in treating them let alone just giving me a better quality of life.

Because of my situation, I have been applying for online work extensively. I have a consistent quiet room, computer, phone, stable internet, and a willingness to work at any time. I have been applying to phoneline and support work (I tend to present better over the phone/with a script and cannot be picky with this level of requirements already baked in), transcription services, data entry, entry level technical roles (if it doesn't require a direct qualification in the description I just go for it hoping my previous light technical experience and ability to assimilate new information decently well can carry), and any other various miscellaneous remote jobs that aren't leadership or highly specialised in areas I am unable to learn on the job so to speak. I have heard nothing back but one headhunting role which, in the interview process, revealed several sketchy elements to their business including that they were not actually looking to fill a remote role and just put that up to, and I quote ""get the punters in"" and one company that consistently puts up ads in my area despite being located interstate... And similarly not actually being remote so it would require me to move to a place I have no support to come in to the office anyway.

1bilkil,Applied for two jobs at the same company. Received one offer; never interviewed for the other. Too late to switch? ,"I interviewed for two different jobs at a company - one a multi year full time contract, one a multi month part time contract. Both jobs I was qualified for in different ways.

Because it involved relocation, HR quickly directed me toward the long term contract and I just received my offer after a month of interviews. For the part time contract, they seemed surprised I was willing to relocate for it, and never interviewed me past the screener call. Not sure if it’s because the first team was interested in me or because the hiring manager for the second team wasn’t.

I have given this thought and I am not prepared to leave my city for two years. Would it be too late to pivot, and ask about the second job, after receiving a written offer for the first? I was advised to wait until I had a written offer, but now am kicking myself for not bringing this up sooner.

Otherwise, they mentioned a probationary period in the offer, and I was curious if it’s standard to try to negotiate remote work after the probationary period, given the relocation involved. I would be negotiating it now in response to the offer.

1bik87t,Career change for stability and health ,"I have been in aviation for almost 20 years and an aircraft mechanic for of those 13 years. I’m almost 40 and I don’t currently have a degree, but am looking to enroll in a bachelor’s degree program in the next month or two. The problem is, I am not sure what I should work towards. I have too many interests. I would like to put my skills to use and while I would like to leave aviation, I need to be able to make about what I’m making now as I am my own source of income. 

I enjoy research and data, but I don’t know any programming/coding. I like having problems to solve/puzzles and I don’t mind working with numbers, and I don’t mine paperwork.  But I also enjoy the social sciences of why people are they way they are. Human factors safety is a thing but doesn’t seem to be alot of jobs. 
A big part of my job is researching regulations and safety data (kinda like recalls) and seeing what affects my aircraft and tracking those as well as when certain tasks are due on the aircraft and at what intervals. When we get a “new” plane, I get to dig through the mountain of logbooks and manuals to make sure all the work has been done timely and what is due next and when. Plus I get to continually track all that across a handful of planes and make sure we stay current and airworthy in inspections and paperwork. I also still do maintenance on the planes. But I definitely want to get away from the wrench turning side of things. 

The only options to move at my company would be management or engineering and I really don’t want to be in charge of people. Software engineering would not be bad except for the hours and the layoffs. 

I am looking at the following degree options:  computer science, data analytics, software engineering, accounting, business management, psychology, mathematics.  I am open to a minor or double degree and masters. I just don’t know what the best route to take is. I’ve looked at job postings that interest me and statistican, research psychology, financial and business analyst and operations analyst all interest me. 

I do need something that is able to be remote or hybrid because my physical mobility is not great anymore. I really want a move to a more stable field as well. Aviation is quite volatile and I’m tired of having to look for a new gig every couple years. I need to be able to earn at least 80k from the start. I’d like to go government (faa, cdc, or state) but they want degrees usually.

1bij3we,I’m 20 and I’m shakey about my career (software engineering),"I’m in need of advice, I’m almost finished up with my second year of college and I’m extremely shaky about continuing this degree as I head to my four year university.

I’m 20 years old and I can barely code anything yet besides the simple projects my professor gives me. 

I have an extremely surface level knowledge of C++ and Python and I don’t see how I am to ever make these amazing websites and programs that I see these incredible software developers make.

I’m not looking to boo hoo over Reddit about my lack of expertise, but what should I do?

What should a sophomore level software engineer look like on a timeline scale?

I feel extremely behind!",classydoggoexee,10,1.0,18,1710851510,2024-03-19 12:31:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bij3we/im_20_and_im_shakey_about_my_career_software/,3,2024
1biihci,Can I ask for a higher salary? ,"I'm currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Finance, with plans to earn an MS in Accounting by 2026, in an area with a high cost of living. My experience includes internships at a consulting firm and as a legal assistant. Presently, I'm an advisory intern at a top 20 accounting firm, a position I've held for the last 8 months. I was recently extended a full-time offer to start in November 2024 with a base salary of $72k, but without overtime pay or bonuses. Until then, I'll continue interning at $30 per hour. Interestingly, interns who've only been here for the winter semester, leaving in April after just 3 months, received the same full-time offer to come back in Nov 2024. Given that by November, I will have nearly 1.5 years of experience with them, would it be reasonable for me to negotiate for a higher salary?

I appreciate your understanding as this is my first full-time job offer and I'm still learning the ropes. Thank you!",Infamous-Pipe-59,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1710849477,2024-03-19 11:57:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1biihci/can_i_ask_for_a_higher_salary/,3,2024
1bii7hq,Misrepresented expectations -- what to do now?,"For some context, I am employed in Japan in a highly sought-after industry, and am in my mid twenties with around 6 years of experience at top global companies.

Before joining company A, I was earning around 15% more than I currently do (base). In joining company A, I was willing to take a pay cut in order to gain more management experience leading global teams. 

During my interview processes, I was to be hired as a Senior Manager. Upon finding out my age at the point of offer, they told me they could only offer me a position as a Manager (this is very common in Japan and highly unlikely to be able to take actions on this ground). Despite that, I would still be reporting to the Global Head, so I didn't see any problems.

They could also not hire me as a Manager on a permanent contract as my pay expectations would be outside of the pay grading (again very common), so would instead hire me on a limited time Specialist contract, renewable every year, for a maximum of 3 so that they could pay to my expectations. I was concerned but was advised that I would still have all the rights of a permanent employee, just without being permanent.

Things had been going well until recently. 

I noticed that they were still hiring for my role, and my boss just announced that I would be getting a new manager due to HR rules (aka I would no longer be reporting into the global head), and would therefore no longer be doing the strategic work I was doing. The new manager apparently has only 2 years in my field, and is a pure generalist.

There was also an email sent round from HR regarding the new training rules. Term limited employees are now no longer able to take any training or certification on the company. This is very important in my field, and a big part of any offer is typically the 'training budget'. This goes against what HR told me before taking the offer.

I feel betrayed, and am feeling like I took a very bad decision. I was hoping for this to be a good career opportunity, but now I am unable to take training and the experience I was expecting to gain will no longer come to fruition.

I have only been here 6 months, and I have only stayed for around a year at my past 2 companies, so I am worried that I will be seen as a job hopper. I could get a new job very easily, but I'd like some advice as to how I can resolve this without changing jobs. Apologies for the long post.",BlacksmithVivid4509,1,1.0,0,1710848513,2024-03-19 11:41:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bii7hq/misrepresented_expectations_what_to_do_now/,3,2024
1bihwmj,Good reasons for requesting part time hours?,"I have an interview tomorrow for a role within a company that offers full-time and part-time roles. I have applied and specified part-time as my preference. 

The reality is I am using my spare time to work on generating my own income but I don't like to say this to employers as it's an easy way to exclude me from the race.

What is non-threatening reason for why an employee would want part-time work?

Thanks

1bihife,Should I quit my job?,"I recently started a job earlier this year.  It sounded like a dream job to me,  the pay is good,  and the job is basically 100% remote aside from a couple days a month.  However, I hate the work itself with a passion.  I've tried to ignore it and just push through, but I can't stand dreading waking up every single day knowing I have to spend at least the next 8 hours doing something so incredibly boring that I would literally rather watch paint dry.  Is this how everyone feels about their job?  I've only ever had one ""real"" job in the past, but as much as that job sucked, I never hated it as much as I hate my current job.  The thing is, any job that sounds interesting to me has either terrible hours, a massive pay cut, or both.  I would essentially be losing at least ~20k a year and a remote position.  Has anyone here been in a similar situation, and how did you deal with it?",QuesoseuQ,1,1.0,3,1710845998,2024-03-19 10:59:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bihife/should_i_quit_my_job/,3,2024
1bihi6h,I am not sure what to do with my life.,"I am 27 at the moment, and have been working in the IT industry since I was 21. I don’t hold a degree, I am a self taught programmer. I am making an okay money, but I hate it. I hate everything in this industry, and nothing motivates me anymore to stay in it, only the payment. I always liked science, especially biology, so first I thought about that I will look into a bio degree, but basically I was told that cool, with all of your IT skills you can do bioinformatics, which I do not want. And I was told that then I have to get ready for being jobless. My other dream was becoming a doctor as a child, but I never tried it before as I felt I was too stupid for it, and I also feel like I am way too old to get into the process(I would have to redo my highschool diploma, and/or other things as well) and I am afraid that I would burn out way faster due to the long hours. Howevet I am interested in the field, I like the other job aspects to it, I don’t mind the bad payment( in the EU its not the most lucrative jobs) I just feel… too old? I am not sure  what to do, I even contemplated just unaliving myself due to the depression caused by me not finding out what to do with myself and stuck in a job/field that I hate with my heart…",hanacho,5,1.0,0,1710845969,2024-03-19 10:59:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bihi6h/i_am_not_sure_what_to_do_with_my_life/,3,2024
1big5qf,Can a Mechanical Engineer work in Embedded systems after 5 year of work experience as CAD Engineer?,"Hi All,  
  
I am at a cross road. Could someone guide me. I did my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in India 2007-2011, worked for 3 years at HCL technologies as CAD engineer. Then, came to Germany to do Masters in Scientific Instrumentation. Working for 5 years in Industrial Field Instruments company as CAD engineer. My company makes pressure, temperature and flow sensors/switches. Now, to go up my career ladder there are very limited opportunities in my company. When I tried outside it was same. My masters modules had Embedded systems but, I worked only as Mechanical CAD engineer for 5 years. I understand basics but, I do not have any relevant practical on job work experience to show. If I change field, then I will lose 5 years of domain knowledge. Will any certifications from Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/embedding-sensors-motors) help to get better opportunities in Embedded System companies? I am currently learning some basics AVR microcontroller in udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/embedded-systems-with-avr-microcontroller/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING). Or should I do something like PMP?

1bifiru,Does anyone else feel super annoying/anxious having to tell your team to communicate faster? ,"We work remotely in PR/digital marketing full time with around 25 clients. We’re expected to reply within a reasonable amount of time eg. 3 hours on teams. I typically follow up on their questions within 1-2 hours, but I have two people on my team who will literally get a message at 10am and either message back at 6pm or next morning. As I’m a senior I’ve mentioned this to the higher ups but typically I just feel really annoying and anxious doing this.  

I’m going to stop doing it because of how it makes me feel, but I know this will cost us clients which really affects our work. The boss knows and is aware and has mentioned once or twice to be faster but they’re just … not. Do I need to chill tf out or continue to let their manager know when it’s not happening around once a fortnight (ending in me feeling anxious and annoying again)?

1bif823,My toxic workplace has ruined my self confidence. Tips on getting it back?,"Title is pretty self explanatory. A few months ago I was made redundant from a job I LOVED (copywriter at an advertising agency, it went under). I landed a copywriting role pretty soon after I got made redundant at another agency and have been working there for the past three months. The new agency I’m at is world’s apart from my previous workplace. Awful clients, a culture of big egos and ass kissing, an unsupportive manager. I’m someone who has always taken pride in my work. I always want to do the best possible job I can. I’m not given the opportunity to do that here. Instead, there’s a huge ‘the client is always right’ mentality, ‘that’s just how it’s done here’ is something that’s said on the daily, and the CEO of the agency checks every single thing I write and will often completely rewrite it just to have a say. My manager is probably the most unsupportive manager I’ve ever had – she’s also good friends with the CEO.

My self confidence and self worth has taken an absolute beating. I’ve quit my job (my last day is tomorrow) and I genuinely feel like I’m not a good copywriter, even though I know I’ve had a prosperous career so far. As a 28 year old woman, I know I’ve achieved a lot and that I should be proud of everything I’ve done. I just can’t help but feel like I’m seriously shit at my job and that I’ve ‘failed’, given I’ve quit after only three months of working there.

Do you have any advice for building up confidence in your career and skills after leaving a toxic workplace? ",Snamg,4,1.0,0,1710836238,2024-03-19 08:17:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bif823/my_toxic_workplace_has_ruined_my_self_confidence/,3,2024
1biewmr,Engineering dropout working in environmental for 5 years looking for advice,"So I (26m) dropped out of mechanical engineering last year after a significant mental breakdown, I’d still like to work in the field but I’ve still got two years on my degree, I was using savings to study at the time but funds are running low and I can’t afford to study in person and I’m perusing online courses but it’s difficult getting credits transferred. In the meantime I returned to my old job bush regeneration at a small family company one of the best in my city (at least it was when I left). It’s gotten pretty bad there mostly difficult coworkers and a pay rate that’s not increasing with the cost of living plus forced holidays, no public days off, no overtime pay or double rates.

1biep3j,I want to live the dream of telling my former boss off. How stupid am I?,"My former boss was as shitty as they come. He acquired the company I previously worked for, said all of the right things, and proceeded to break all of his promises. In less than 6 months, every single person from my company had quit. When I left last year I was a consummate professional. I provided lengthy notice, referred and trained my replacement, and left on good terms...or so I thought. 

I work in sales. Ex employer fought me over <$200 of unpaid commission, and by ""fought"" I mean he made up reasons which directly contradicted the language in my employment contract and refused to respond to my emails until I suggested we bring it to the Labour Board.

I have since moved on to a role in a new field which pays well, I am thriving in it, and most importantly I am happy. I am currently filing my taxes and require a form to be filled out from my previous employer, who is refusing to provide. And by refusing, I mean he is ignoring my emails. The form would net me a few hundred bucks in tax returns for work-related expenses.

On to the point of this post. Since my former employer refuses to act with any shred of decency, I'm contemplating writing an email telling him off (as professionally as possible). I realize how petty this sounds but aside from that I don't see any downside.

I don't work in that industry anymore.

He is not well-liked or connected in that industry regardless.

I've had honest conversations with my current employer and the CEO knows why I left that company.

Is there any reason I SHOULDN'T do this?",jaydtothetees,18,1.0,46,1710833883,2024-03-19 07:38:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1biep3j/i_want_to_live_the_dream_of_telling_my_former/,3,2024

The explanation provided was that the new General Manager would personally oversee the onboarding of the new Executive Assistant, as they will primarily support him moving forward now too instead of just the CEO.   However, I can’t shake the feeling that there may be underlying emotions at play, given the suddenness of the request following my resignation and a cold vibe, I always felt nervous due to his temper and that we didn’t have a close relationship.

1bidufm,Changing careers and seeking advice,"I’ve been making a decent living as a musician for almost 20 years now but I’m seeking a career change that will hopefully bring about a little more security. I don’t like the amount of travel it requires and have decided I would prefer to make music a creative outlet instead of a primary source of income.

I currently run a recording studio, produce records, teach music lessons and perform 2-3 times a week locally (in Nashville). I have a Bachelor’s degree in music from the University of Texas at Austin and will be turning 34 in a couple of weeks. I feel that I’ve been about as far down this road as I care to go for now.

I’ve always entertained the idea of going to Law school and becoming either a criminal defense lawyer, an entertainment lawyer, or both.

I was hoping to gauge the type of commitment this will require. I’m up for whatever it takes but want to know what I’m getting myself into so that I can plan accordingly. I know very little about it at the moment.

What are the steps I need to take in order to become a practicing attorney in Texas? Are the requirements/licensing different from state to state? Do I need to take the LSAT prior to applying to Law Schools?

This approach seems appealing to me, especially considering the flexibility and affordability of online learning.  
Yet, on the other hand, I can't shake off the concern that many job postings in the tech industry still emphasize the importance of a bachelor's or master's degree. It sucks to read forums where others in similar situations express their struggles in landing jobs without formal degrees.

1biblr8,Senior Product Manager Dilemma - Advice Needed Please,"Summary: I am just over 2 years in as a fully remote Senior Product Manager for a FinTech company focused on consumer spending transactional data. Have learned a ton in the role, and work with some very bright people and customers (Hedge Funds namely). This has been my first formal foray into Product Management (title/resume wise), though I have informally worn the product manager hat indirectly in other role/companies (Finance/Asset Management). Breadth of my career (15 years) has been in myriad of roles focused on Data/Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Reporting, Project Management, Road Map development, and new software/product onboarding. Was given the ""Senior"" Product Manager title in my current role given the length of experience/varied background (which lends itself to the role).  
  
Dilemma: Current company has been having some raising new revenue difficulties as of late, as competition has become more fierce/innovative in the space. Things are perpetually disorganized (minimal direction/vision - feels like a start up despite having been around for many years) and it's a super lean team, with the majority of intellectual capital in India. There have been recent rumors that the company may in fact be sold off this year (actively looking for buyers supposedly - PE or competitor maybe?). There is virtually no work life balance with a lot of the meetings being held on IST (nighttime US hours); feel like I am always on. There have been multiple rounds of layoffs over the last two years, but there is no more fat to trim, and people are stretched quite thin as a result.  


I've been passively browsing external job postings over the last 4 months and have had a few interviews - nothing worthwhile panned out. Exception being a company that I interviewed with before this current role (3 years ago). That hiring manager reached out to me directly and shared a new posting just listed as part of a new Strategic Insights Data team he is now running. The role is titled ""Analytics Engagement Manager"" and is sort of product management adjacent; fully remote, building internal data products for better reporting metrics, KPI's, road maps, use cases, data flow, and liaisoning between senior leadership and data science and engineering. The role would only be a $7K pay bump salary wise, and a 6% bonus potential increase (to 17.5%).....however, it's a massive, large, stable company (Fortune 500) (with no immediate future concerns - e.g. being sold off/raising revenue), with ""normal"" US work hours - no offshore India team (e.g. late night odd hour calls). The only major downside that I can see is that it would no longer be in the sexy and sophisticated FinTech sector, but rather Life Insurance/Annuities.  


Opinion Needed: Would stepping away from a potential sinking ship into something non FinTech be detrimental to the optics/future progression of my career? What about leaving a formal title of ""Senior Product Manager"" and holding a new title of ""Analytics Engagement Manager""? Does this seem like downgrade based on explaining each role? Which role will be more lucrative and desirable going forward?  
I could use any perspective from the group here. I have a pending offer, and need to decide within the coming days, and it feels like a difficult choice.

1bibcj4,"Is it time for a raise, or is it time to leave?","Hello Reddit! Looking for some career advice here. Sorry for the format. I’m currently the Operations Supervisor for a steel manufacturer company specializing in the craft beer industry. We can scale you up from a small mom and pop size shop to multi million dollar corporations with multiple facilitesI. Start to finish, we do it all. I started as a traveling technician and moved to an in-shop position as a service tech, then promoted to my current position, all over the span of 5 years. In both changes I was given a raise; ~52k, then ~64k, and then ~72k. I’m very happy with my progress. I’ve received multiple compliments and recognitions from customers, colleagues and my bosses. I’ve also had my share of fuck ups, don’t get me wrong. Came with write ups and consequences, but over all I’m a solid employee I believe. 

Things changed September of last year when the company laid off 10 of our 22 employee team. My workload increased by (I’m really trying to use my most fair and honest judgement) about 40%. Because I’m also cross trained in multiple departments, I cover just about all positions except for crunching the numbers. I’ve been doing what’s was a 4 person team job by myself for close to 6 months now. Mid January I was given a 3k raise, which if I understand correctly, is just shy of a 5% raise. 

I don’t fee like my raise was sufficient this last time around. I feel like the duties that were divided and handed out between the remaining employees were not evenly distributed. I’ll say now, these tasks are not taking up my whole day and are quite simple, but I did not signed up for this and I’ve expressed my dislike for them. 

Here’s where I need advice. Do y’all think it’s time to ask for a raise? The only thing I question is the facts that I’be been promoted and given raises what I think is pretty frequently. The only way I think I’ll get what I think I’m worth is by finding a new gig. I really enjoy my job but the new duties are draining the life out of me. What do you guys think? I’m gonna go watch Shōgun now, bye.

1biaaoz,How to decline a job offer without burning a bridge?,"Ok so I got made redundant a couple of weeks ago and a firm I previously worked at reached out about coming back (to a different but similar practise area). They were slow to move so I started applying elsewhere and now have been offered a position at another firm for the same role/same area/same pay.. 

I want to work at the new firm because it’s more reputable and would be an excellent move career wise. However I don’t know how to tell the partner from my old firm without completely burning the bridge. I am friends (like actual personal friends outside of work) with the two associates from my old firm so I just feel like it would be bad all around. I know it would be comfortable and I’d be happy at my old firm but I just think the opportunity at the new place is too good to pass up.

1bi7q67,Should I take a lateral move? ,"So I’ve been working as an HR rep for a company for about two years. Currently I support a group of white collar workers and they’re essentially very low maintenance. I’ve grown to enjoy working with the team. 
Last week my boss approached me and said my name was brought up in conversations for a new role, that it would be a lateral move working at one of our manufacturing plants. She then said it would start off as a lateral move and with time once I get settled I could potentially be the HR Manager there and be over two other remote plants’ HR reps. That intrigued me because of the potential, however what if it doesn’t pan out like so? Also, since it will be a lateral move there will likely not be a pay increase.

I’ve heard stories about that plant, such as the plethora of employee relations and the toxic culture. It’ll be a high maintenance group and I’m not sure I’ll be able to handle it considering the dramatic change from a chill group to that. It’ll be a huge undertaking.  However it sounds like a good development opportunity, and I’m concerned that if I don’t take it may be a while before an opportunity like this comes up. I don’t want to regret that.
Also, another concern I have about not applying is that the current groups I support could be part of a restructure and that will potentially lead me to be displaced with no one to support. At least at the plant there’s job security.

So the HR Director of that business function reached out and asked me if I’d be interested in applying, and I said I was receptive. She  seemed excited about me potentially being part of her team. I asked about the process and she said I’ll have to interview with the plant manager, however his first impression of me isn’t the best. I recently was assigned to lead an investigation and he didn’t like how I handled the incident (he wanted me to check in with him every day after conducting interviews and share information on how he can help with coaching).

Given this context, should I even bother applying with my hesitations and the potential that the plant manager, who I will work closely with, doesn’t think positive of me in terms of capabilities?

1bi7oay,"I really need some advice. I’m 20, and have very little idea what I want to do in life. Can anyone offer some guidance?","I just really could use some advice. I’m 20, M and currently work as part of a logistics team for a hardware store. It’s not terrible but it’s part time, I don’t make enough to support any of my goals, and I’m just burnt out of retail. It’s definitely not the direction that I want to go career wise.

I never went to college nor have any plans too. I had an amazing job offer out the gate of highschool that I had gotten offered before my senior year. Fast forward 10 months… AND they lost $30k overnight. 3 weeks before getting it my offer was swiftly taken away. 
As for college I originally wanted to go for sports equipment management & broadcasting. However after a deep dive into it, the job market after getting your degree is very very slim, if even possible to get a job. Pair that up with the fact I can’t afford college (I skipped scholarships & etc cause of that job offer) it’s just not doable for me

I also struggle with ADHD so sitting (or standing) in the same spot really isn’t possible for me. I need to constantly active and moving around with the ability to sit down when needed to OR to sit for small periods of times with the ability to get up and move around when needed, although I prefer to be activly moving anyways. Medication does nothing in this regards either. I understand this is a terrible excuse but…

I also struggle with some sort of light sensitivity problem (undiagnosed but it’s there) that gives me massive headaches. I can’t look into a computer screen, lights, & light reflection off of snow or water without suffering a massive headache. Same goes for wearing a welding helmet. It messes with my eyes & head so much that it makes it impossible for me to do any work. 
I also have a fear of heights (really tried to overcome this one but yeah that ain’t happening)

Some of my pros I do have:
- I’m a hands on learner 
- I have a huge love and knowledge for sports (especially the NFL)
- I prefer to be outside (except during the winter)
- I seem to work with almost anyone & I can tolerate people well when needed (not small children though)
- I can be outspoken when need but tend to be more calm & reserved 
- Very experienced with retail work, sales / marketing, and understand it all well too
- tend to be a very good sales pitcher

1bi74j6,"I'm tired of feeling like I'll never make enough money to thrive, thinking of taking classes, not sure which pathway would be most useful for getting a job making more money. ","TLDR: post title

I currently have a full time job that makes me enough money to pay my bills and get by. But I'm increasingly getting more and more restless at the realization that I'm stuck at a dead end, and if I don't make a change, I'll never make the amount of money I want to make. And thus I'm strongly considering taking classes at the local community College - something computer science related, 100%. But I don't know which pathway I should approach in order to make a major career pivot that will put me on a trajectory towards more $$$.

This is what it seems like I'm looking at:

1. Associates degrees

2. Bachelor degree

3. Certs of achievement 

What do you think would be best? Should I go full on towards the bachelor? Or maybe just complete a bunch of the certs? Would tech recruiters and hiring managers just toss the resume away if there's no big ole bachelor degree listed? Would a middle of the road associates degree suffice? 

Here is some pertinent background info I need to consider when making a decision:

I currently have a full time mon-fri, 8am to 5pm job. I do not want to give this up, I'll have to figure out a way to work full time and take the classes at the same time - most likely evening/night classes. I don't make a lot of money, like, at all. But depending on which pathway I end up taking, I might be able to pay some tuition costs out of pocket. I have no clue what conditions I would need to meet in order to qualify for financial aid, but I'm completely aware it exists. 

I've chosen the compsci field because I'm actually extremely technologically literate. I've been around computers since I was a kid (dad has always worked in tech) and I've taken software dev classes in the past. Those classes were a loooong time ago when my life was spiraling out of control - i have since then spent a lot of time and energy on rebuilding my life. Also, I have no clue if any of what I learned before would carry over into the classes at the local college in the town I'm in now, so I've kind of resigned to having to start over in that regard. Plus it was so long ago that I'm sure whatever cert it gave me is near useless and unimpressive now. 

Anyways, please let me know what you guys think. I'm feeling suffocated where I'm at now, but I realize that if I want to make more money and advance my life even further, I need to be the one who makes a big change in direction. Please nudge me in that direction.

1bi6lm9,How do I identify unhealthy work environment signs?,"
Hello everyone,

Since around October, I have been working officially at a barn up until now. However, I have a hard time identifying whether it is me that is having a hard time adjusting and freqently messing up or the factors around me if that makes sense? This would be my first official job, and I don't know whether is it me that is messing up. I would appreciate honesty if I am just screwing things up, and Il be as descriptive as best I can.

What makes me ask this question is that my environment at work constantly changes, which is no problem as long as there is communication. My boss likes things to be done in a very specific way, and objects put away in a very specific way. However like I mentioned before, the way she wants things to be done is always viable to be changed.   But I don't receive this information always, and I feel like im always asking, even simple things like cutting chaff (it just makes horses eat slower) on how its done. If I forget something, my boss will chew me out or my co worker out, sometimes I get chewed out for something my co worker does, or vice versa, and I feel really bad about it because I don't think that's fair. 

Another reason im at odds is because my boss seems really nice other than the times she starts yelling, and I start to question my ability and if I really should even be there if I'm not even doing things, especially concerning something important as animals. 

I haven't had much work experience, and so i don't really know how to identify if it's just my ability to work, or the environment around me. Again, please be honest, and IL be happy to provide more context if that isn't enough.

I try to ask my mom what she thinks i should do or at least give some advice- but of course she says go back to school. the last time i asked her for advice she said “maybe if you stop smoking weed you’ll have a clear enough head to make decisions”. my parents want me to have a “title” to my name if that makes sense. i was sort of pressured to be in the medical field. i work 7-4/5 everyday & i feel like my life is slowly being stripped away from me. i used to be so creative but now i feel like im stuck. how do i unlearn this routine of working and going back to find something that i really love?",SnooPears4691,1,1.0,0,1710803796,2024-03-18 23:16:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bi579l/how_can_i_turn_my_3_years_of_dental_assisting/,3,2024
1bi51zj,I’ve been laid off for a year and have been unable to find a job. Should I:,"1. Keep looking

2. Pivot to accounting, which is more stable and spend $100k (tuition + rent) on a MAcc in my home country (Canada)

3. Same as 2 (and same expenses), but go to a top public school I got accepted to in the US. Might be riskier though as employers may not be willing to sponsor. 

4. Do the CPA PREP certification, which is a $5-10k accounting program offered by my province’s CPA association. However, it offers no recruiting and doesn’t offer everything I need to get a CPA (I’d need to pay an additional $15k for those extra courses). 

For context, I graduated from a top Canadian business school (non-accounting) and spent a year in a boutique consulting firm. Got laid off after that due to the economy.

1bi4bjy,Contracting remotely for company of 7 years (previously employed).. just found out from execs EA that my remote responsibilities were taken away for no reason ,"Worked for an automotive dealership company for 6 years in person, slowly climbing the ladder and was promoted to a ""dual"" role that was EA to VP and a trainer for all things within my department

Life circumstances happened last year. Decided to quit the full-time gig to remain flexible for my little one. Was begged to stay on as a remote contractor to do reports.

Fast forward to beginning to this month. I was asked to train another employee on how to do the work I'm doing. I was told it was just in case anything happened to where I couldn't complete them, someone else would be able to. I was also asked to go out in person three times a week at different locations to train. I didn't mind the extra cash, so I obliged.

Last Friday, I sent a message to my bosses EA to confirm my full list of responsibilities. Got a reply from her that said, according to the VP (our boss), I shouldn't be doing any of those reports listed. 

since when? I never got a call, an email, or a new contract to sign. All of these reports and duties were listed on my contract. 

I'm so sick of this industry and how leadership doesn't have the balls to even call me to tell me. But now, with new stores opening, they probably expect me to be on call for them when they need help in person. That's not what I signed up for.

I have 3 more days scheduled this month to go work in person. I really don't even want to go now. I hate working for a company knowing they don't give a shit about me enough to even tell me my responsibilities. Lol

1bi3wl3,Recovering from Toxic work environment and transitioning into new role after 8 month gap,"Hi, 

I am hoping someone will be able to help I have been out of work since July and have struggled get back in work. I have discussed the reasons previously however brief overview of my situation I have been out of work since July last year minus some publicity work done for friend and a few volunteer projects and the odd temp in admin or warehouse. Prior that I have worked 5 years in administration before moving operations in 2021, I changed company in beginning of 2023, however this end up being a big mistake. It seemed good at beginning but soon became apparent it wasn't. 

The issue was high employee turnover and I was told it was just some bad eggs, when I started the company I went through in quick succession watching someone close to me dying and that shock leading me to end what on coming out relationship was toxic relationship filling for divorce despite knowing I would lose house just brought. In order to cope I threw myself in work the directors said I did not have to but as it continued I had more work pilled on me to point of working 100 plus hours with no compensation for additional hours.  By May I was exhausted and with new team in place I began cutting my hours, only find myself subject to insults and the pay rise that been dangled in front of me that I had required in order to leave my previous relationship. In addition my expenses for travel I done back in May were rejected as I volunteered work that weekend and suddenly was not being invited to work events the reason stated being lack of people skills. 

Frustrated and with fresh set of eyes I could see the distain held against employees following heated argument in office, where one director deflected all complaints and the other actively antagonised, I slammed the door upon returning office after talking down one employee out of fear after they been antagonised and insulted having decided to go home, had they drive back in state they were, I was worried they end up injuring themselves. Director only response was say he not worth it and seemed to integrate me interested see what he had said to me. 

Two weeks later I was pulled in meeting and with no warnings or notice, they tried to force me take pay cut, that bring me minimum wage, the stress of it as it would have at time ruined me and the fact they used stuff I told them in confidence was enough to push me to a suicide attempt. Upon getting out of hospital I informed them that I had been signed off only be fired. 

It been 8 months and since the worked on several projects for friend in music industry as well as community outreach project however they are not paying bill. I burnt through half money I got back from house and becoming increasingly concerned. I have been told I am too inexperienced to back back ops management however lower level op roles, I am not being offered. Admin is not paying bills and I burnt few large amount savings which i will not be able to easily recover and the only of way I could save money go in house share which be sacrificing my last bit independence, which after losing everything else in my life and my current mental state, I can't face that. 

Working on projects as well as a few upcoming concerts, have kept be sane and now I want to move over the project management, my end goal go to contracting  on projects so never have be tied to single company again, but not sure how go about it and each day, I feel myself slipping in that headspace that made me want take my life. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated,

1bi3ukw,Any Virtual Assistant jobs wherein all are women?,"I (22F) is considering Virtual Assistant jobs. I have a degree in Computer Engineering, and has 3 employment backgrounds: system engineer in a manufacturing company, server engineer in a semiconductor company, and currently a web develoer in an IT company.
I was - WAS a friendly, jolly, approachable person before I met my fiancé (24M). I used to be comfortable meeting new people, joking around, confident on how I approach others. My parents were like that, and as their first daughter, it looks like I got those traits from them, seeing and living with that for 20+ years. Now, since I met my fiancé, he didn’t want that. He labeled me as a flirt and often called me that whenever a heated argument comes.
In my current role, I work with a team and almost always, I am the only woman in the group. He doesn’t want me chatting them up privately whenever I have questions (that’s understandable, I now ask in the group chat), he doesn’t want me joking around (I don’t), he doesn’t want anyone joking around me (I can’t control that). Oh, he also has access on my work accounts (Teams, Outbox, Viber) and facetimes me whenever I have work meetings so he can listen. Basically he told me off one time that he doesn’t want me collaborating with any men… I got my evaluations for the past 2 years, it says there all the positive notes on my performance but the downside is that they find it “hard” to collaborate with me because I wouldn’t (I resorted to just follow and obey my fiancé on his dont’s because I hear painful words and just end up crying.)

I’m sorry it took this long. I just want to share my background.

1bi2mtm,Marketing vs finance,"Hey,

I'm a first year business student at a top ranked university in my country. I've been having trouble deciding on what I want to study as my major, as the decision has to be made this month. I find it super hard to make this big a decision based on just my experience on these first few courses.

On finance: 

Finance as the major is pretty much what is expected of me, from family, friends and other contacts, my inner circle is super preppy if that's the right word. 

I find investing and especially corporate finance fascinating, but doing the math on these assignments and exams kills me. I've always been bad at math and had a strong dislike for it, and i acknowledge my lack of skill in that area as my own fault, I know I could improve there. I know the math behind finance isn't even supposed to be hard, I just suck...

I'm pretty familiar with what the career path and earnings evolution in finance looks like from friends and family. Long hours and an okay salary for the first years with the goal being chasing promotions.


On marketing: 

I've done B2B sales before and performed well, scoring about 30-50% over my quota. I've also developed new digital systems for companies, simplifying sales processes, cutting costs, streamlining etc. and had good success there. 

I've also produced ads and designed clothing for companies before so I have a little bit of experience in marketing already, and I've found it fun and rewarding. I'm definitely an artistic, creative kind of guy, and a people person.

I've no idea what a marketers career looks like though. I've heard the job market is pretty bad right now, and I'm not sure if my degree will be worthless if i do decide to pursue a degree in marketing.

All opinions and answers are welcome, and i look forward to hearing your views and opinions on this matter, cheers!",Dry-Worker-4178,1,1.0,3,1710797556,2024-03-18 21:32:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bi2mtm/marketing_vs_finance/,3,2024
1bi2cx8,Wife got promoted (sort of) - no raise. Need some advice on how to approach this.,"This is something I never dealt with myself so I'm writing this post for my wife. 2 things have happened since she began working with this company and she's just real upset at this point.

Back in 2022, she started an invoicing job for $50k. She was told by the end of the year, they would review her and if she was doing well, she'd get an increase. Instead of doing that, they promoted her to an ""AP Associate"" working under the ""AP Manager"". She got a $2k increase for that promotion.

***Problem 1:*** She never got a raise for her first position since they never even reviewed her performance. To me, it seems like she should have gotten a $2k raise for her first position, and maybe another $2k raise for her promotion. It's hard for me to put this in words but it's almost like they just ignored her first position.

***Problem 2:*** Fast forward to today. Her AP Manager got fired and my wife was told that she would be taking over her duties (is that not another promotion???), but that they would give her a raise in 6 months after they see how she was doing. Her boss said, ""the plan was to have you do everything she does anyway when you got promoted to the AP Associate."" So again, it seems to me that they are trying to avoid giving her a proper raise. Shouldn't doing the ""Manager's"" work now make my wife an AP Manager and get another raise?

Does any of this seem right to you guys? I want to have her request a meeting with her higher up boss (that she became somewhat friends with after she got hired) to talk about this and basically flat out tell her that she is unhappy with all of this. Any advice on how we can approach this? My wife is a very quiet, non-confrontational person, and losing a job would destroy her so I want to be careful with how she handles this.

I can tell you that I truly believe they would hate to lose her. She got employee of the year out of about 200 employees and the higher up boss once begged her not to leave when she seemed unhappy at work. So I'm telling my wife she almost has the upper hand here.",huh-why,21,1.0,34,1710796912,2024-03-18 21:21:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bi2cx8/wife_got_promoted_sort_of_no_raise_need_some/,3,2024

I (23f) graduated uni in 2022 with a BA History degree and quickly moved into a 2 year grad scheme in tech sales for a pretty big company. My grad scheme comes to an end this year and tbh they’ve kind of screwed us over as there’s only a job if there’s headcount available and with 6 of us trying for roles there’s a slim chance we’re all staying on. 

With the job market being so crappy coming out of uni and me being desperate for a job I jumped for the opportunity but I feel as though I’m now trapped in a box, unable to get out of sales or tech. The worst thing is that only during these 2 years have I realised what I want with a job (the only real takeaway I’ve had). 

With the job I’m in and the opportunities it presents i feel as though I’m made to do more. I feel as though I haven’t finished learning, so have been maybe looking at getting on another scheme where I get to do an ACA qualification. Or going back to do a masters (idk what in). 

I’m 23 and live at home, barely any life experience. So maybe I thought to do something in the US but it’s impossible to get a sponsorship. 

I’ve started applying to a few jobs ( I mean 100s) and I get rejected or ghosted. 

I’d love a job in the music industry, I’d love a job in fashion and media, I’d love a job in finance and business, I’d love to train to be a paramedic. 

I know that I want to live and work in a city, but that’s my only starting point. 


Does anyone else feel like this? I feel as though I’ve got the world at my fingertips however everything is so inaccessible.

1bi19h5,Advice for New Dev,"Hi all, 

For some background information, I recently graduated and have a Bachelor’s in Chemistry and Master’s in Project Management in IT. I spent months applying to jobs with no luck until it seemed like I landed a healthcare administrator role. 

Unfortunately, even though I was a finalist, the role went to someone else. However, the interviewers really liked me and noticed that I had taken a full stack bootcamp a couple of years ago. They gave me the option of waiting to see if another healthcare admin job would open up (this was uncertain) or taking a jr dev position at the company. Seeing as how I literally had no other prospects and was pretty desperate, I went ahead and took the dev job.

Now, three months later, I’m working as a jr dev at a giant healthcare company. My team is nice and willing to help me learn, but I just flat out hate it. I hate programming, and I hate how complicated all of the applications are. I feel like I have no idea what I’m doing or even what I should be doing most of the time. 

The job is fully remote, has decent benefits and pay (not great but better than nothing), and I like the people I work with. I’ve managed to complete all the projects my team has given me successfully, and my team is very careful not to overwhelm me and are constantly checking in. There are a bunch of positives, but every minute feels like agony. I’ve never really been a fan of programming, but I think what I hate the most about my job is how complicated and intertwined all the applications are and how unmotivated I am to learn more about coding in general. It bores me to death. 

I don’t want to quit since it is remote and it’s not often that you find a team you like. I also don’t want to let my manager and team down since they’ve been extremely kind and helpful throughout my time there. Should I just suck it up and continue, especially since there weren’t any jobs lined up beforehand? Will it get better from your experience? Or should I just start job hunting again?

1bi0gmh,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi everyone, I'm an Italian boy, the next year I'll definitely become a medical doctor, I'm studying for it from 5 years now, the next year I'll finish the cycle (6 years).  
I always loved medicine and the idea to help people and I always saw myself as a doctor since I was very young. Becoming doctor in Italy is not simple, you should win a public competition with a written test and only one out of 7 people (talking about around 20000 participants) will go inside the university. In the first years I was really enthusiast about everything, with time I understood that there is sickness inside the medical business, when I was kid I just ignored this.  
For instance in my country (everywhere in reality I guess) an aesthetic plastic surgeon on average earns the quadruple than a general surgeon who instead of making new tits for rich people is actually saving their lives. I hate this! I hate that the capitalism has won on every aspect of our lives but the most I hate myself cause I've fallen into this too!  
When I started to study medicine I sincerely wanted to help people but now I think that people usually don't deserve someone helping them and spending his life for them. Now I think that I should do my own and not caring too much about people cause they will always see me like a failure instead, I think now that the only measure people understand is money and that for becoming someone important in front of everyone's eyes I should simply earn more money than them.  
In the last year I've been out of Italy for Erasmus+ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus\_Programme), I met a lot of new people and made friendships, I've done a lot of trips in this year like Morocco, Hungary, Turkey... In these trips I found out that travelling makes me happier than other things and that when I see the world I don't care about making money and career but I just want to see places and meet people and make love with life.  
After my degree I'll have to perform another public competition for going into the plastic surgery school (this extremely difficult, they got 140 jobs for a lot of people trying to enter it, in the whole country) oooooooor I could just run away somewhere like Christopher McCandless (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris\_McCandless) to enjoy myself out, alone in the world.  
I mean, I would love to make a lot of money ad plastic surgeon and the career and everything but I think that one day I could regret I didn't do the experience of leaving everything and just go into my spiritual and human growing around the world. So what I'm asking is: how could I work as m.d. travelling and enjoying new places and growing as person?

1bhy09v,Seeking Advice: Transitioning Out of Toronto's Film Industry - Making the Most of Downtime,"I'm a 25-year-old guy working in Toronto's film industry, primarily as an on-set utility driver. While my role keeps me busy during shoots (hours are long but a good amount of standby time), there's often a lull between gigs that leaves me pondering my future path. Sure, the paychecks have been sweet, averaging around $150k annually for roughly 9 months of work over the last few years. But with tech advancements and shifting trends in filming techniques, I'm starting to think about life beyond the film set. I'm aware of the industry's evolving landscape, with advancements in AI and increased use of green screens potentially impacting the demand for location filming (As a set driver Im mostly needed on location not in studio).

  
With this in mind, I'm actively considering transitioning out of the film industry within the next three years. To prepare for this shift, I'm eager to make the most of my downtime by acquiring skills and knowledge that can be applied to future careers or entrepreneurial ventures. Although I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, my practical business experience is limited to a marketing internship during university. Additionally, I've made some real estate investments that provide passive income, but I'm eager to further invest in my personal and professional development during these periods of downtime.

  
So Im reaching out for some guidance. How can I best utilize my free time between gigs to set myself up for success in my next chapter? Whether it's pursuing additional education, exploring new industries, or honing practical skills, I'm open to all suggestions and grateful for your input.  
Thank you in advance for sharing your wisdom!",DonDhxliwxl9898,1,1.0,0,1710786647,2024-03-18 18:30:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhy09v/seeking_advice_transitioning_out_of_torontos_film/,3,2024
1bhxhz0,New job - salary bands,"Hello everyone, long story short, a company I got hired for recently, basically avoided the salary talk like the plague. I've convinced them to make 10k more than I've put in my application. HR said it's ""in the upper range"" but they never specified the salary range/band.  


Now, once I got hired, people who were working a few years of course started to ask me about my salary. I am in a Staff position by the way, making around 14$k gross a month. A friend recently invited someone at a Senior position and said they got 16$k gross... Whoever we shared our salaries with, says they're making 5-6$k more at lower poistion (senior, associate).

&#x200B;

What gets me is that during the interview HR never disclosed the salary range, but he said after 10k raise I am ""in the upper range"" and when I pushed for 15k more they said ""it might not be possible"". I asked my HR already to show me the salary bands, but they said to ask my manager. What do you guys think, should I ask my manager?  


I really, really like my new job but I hate the idea of jobhopping, already work 3 different jobs in 4 years to get a normal raise during the covid/inflation phase... Also it's fixed term so I thought the money is going to be ""great"". Turns out I might be making way less than perm workers.",ThrowRABluebird22,1,1.0,3,1710785436,2024-03-18 18:10:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhxhz0/new_job_salary_bands/,3,2024
1bhxgq5,Conflicted if I should take this job offer or not,"TLDR at bottom

So for some background I graduated with my degree in mechanical engineering back in August 2023. I had to do my capstone over the summer and couldn’t afford to be unemployed so I took a BS summer internship through a old coworker at his current company. The reason why I say BS is because the internship was low paying, I would be doing product management type work not engineering, and it was for a niche industry that I have never worked in nor have any desire to work in. It ended up being my only choice to take it bc they were willing to work with my schedule and I didn’t have anything else

Fast forward I graduate, they offer to basically extend my internship indefinitely until I find another job. Since the job market is so ass and I graduated at a weird time I’m now 10 months in as I’ve had minimal luck finding another position.

As of today they offered me a full time position in their engineering department and I’m conflicted if I should take it.

If you are wondering why I haven’t quit yet here are the pros:
-my boss is easily the best boss I’ve ever had and I like all of my coworkers a lot
-I know all the people in the group I’d be moving to and like them 
-despite being an intern they’ve put a lot of time into me skills/experience development wise
-I’ve gotten to travel both internationally/domestically which is fun
-my company is a very large both domestically and internationally and has a lot of fantastic  opportunities out side of my current location, even in industries I’m more interested in (I’d have to move states tho)
-good benefits 

The bad:
-the industry as a whole that I work in is an absolute shit show
-pay is mediocre at best 
-middle management at my company is horrible 
-I’m not interested in the industry remotely 
-the team I would be working is too small for the amount of work they receive 
-(new Englander here) my job is in southern NH but the rest of my life essentially is in MA and as it is right now I drive to Boston/southern mass at least 3-4 times a week which is taxing
-I don’t want to be here more than two years even if I do take it

Some things to note:
-I have started to actually get responses from other company’s in industries I’m more interested in since it’s entry level season
-I will be attending career fair with my college this week that tends to have a very high success rate with hiring
-despite this I have no other job offers 
-no I am not moving to NH, I’ve spent 6 years living on the border/working in NH and frankly I hate the area. Also, all of my friends have also moved out of the area and I’ve exhausted most opportunities to make new ones so it’s kind of isolating 
-will be moving to Boston  (55min commute with minimal traffic since I’m going opposite to the flow, only have to be in office 2-3 times a week), sucky but not the worst 

My biggest conflict is that I’d hate to give up a real actually job opportunity in favor of the POSSIBILITY of another. I’d also hate to quit after month for something else bc I don’t want to leave any bad blood with my coworkers. I know at the end of the day I can but it just feels disrespectful especially with how much they’ve been advocating for me. At the same time, I don’t feel happy in this industry remotely and am constantly thinking about other opportunities. It just feels stupid for me to blow off this job opportunity for a bunch of ifs but at the same time I know I’m going to regret taking it if something else comes along.

I have about a day and a half to make a decision, what should I do?

TLDR: got offer from internship company. Really good coworkers & really good experience but mediocre industry/pay/location. No other current job offers but large potential to find one. Don’t know if I should decline job offer in favor of other possibilities 

Any and all advice is appreciated and sorry for the long post ",RudeRoman,1,1.0,5,1710785352,2024-03-18 18:09:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhxgq5/conflicted_if_i_should_take_this_job_offer_or_not/,3,2024

Anyway, the environment has been very.. corporate. A lot of knowledge is walled off, people are stressed, and I barely know how to do my job. Each ticket feels like a nightmare without someone helping me. Most days it feels like I’m supposed to do nothing and wait for help.. then I end up dragging the team behind. I have no doubt my co workers are nice, but I don’t feel like I belong here and I feel like my work is a ticking tomb bomb. I worry about being fired every. single. day.

My therapist recommends that I look for another job. “There’s plenty of tech positions in this area and it’s totally normal to find a new job after 1.5 or 2 years or so in your field.”

Would this be the right approach? Quit after 1.5y or 2y and have another job ready? I mean, I feel like I have such limited knowledge and I MUST stay on to learn more.. but how long is that? More importantly, am I willing to give up my nearly 48k salary to move on to another company? appreciate any advice.

1bhtt7w,I think I'm being used by my job.,"Hello, I've been working at a used card lot ever since I was 18, I am currently 19 (m). Although I've only recently been given the full time job, my dad's brought me here with him a long time ago before I was even hired, for about fives years as of now. 
My dad convinced the owners to let me work here starting at 10 dollars an hour. No interview or nothing, so I first started off working as a mechanic's assistant only on Saturdays since I had highschool at the time (I've taken anyear off from my studies to work and help my family out). 
Ever since I graduated, I was given more time to work, My scheduel changed from only Saturday, to Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, eventually to currently Monday through Saturday.
Around last year, I've been given the go ahead to work all week. It was okay starting off but now reaching about the one year, I'm starting to lose interest in this current job. Around January I asked for a raised, they agreed to only to pay me 13 an hour. I asked for a higher amount since my fellow coworkers (who are secretaries) get paid more and given a day off. They denied and I just folded and took the 13.
Recently I filled out a w2 form for taxes, since they initially hired me by word, aka a individual contractor and now I feel like I should be given a day off, but I'm nervous to ask the owners since they are intimidating figures. 
Recently one coworker has received a day off, and they have me working the day she's off, not to mention since the car lot has seperate locations, I'm scattered around the places. They also mentioned that they want to make me the ""know it all"" guy, aka. Being a car-seller, a secretary, a mechanic and what not. After being told this, I knew that they want me to work here forever, hell. They even make comments about me being there: 
""Hey, we know you can do better than this, we are greatful that you're still here."" 
""Wow, you're so serious at 19, how are you 19 and living your life like you're 40?"" 
When I was told all of that, it rubbed me the wrong way.
But the problem is, I don't have my own car and since I'm going off to college soon, I feel like I'm stuck. Can anybody part some words of advice onto this 19 year old.

1bhskch,Am I considered a job hopper?,"I recently made a post on here about a job offer I received and have since took it. Long story short I’ve been a retail store manager for 5 years. I hadn’t applied anywhere and wasn’t looking anywhere. (Just because I live in a small town and it’s rare to find good paying jobs where I live) for reference avg income for my area is around 25k a year and household around 45k a year. I make mid 50s a year as a retail manager. The headaches and workload was getting to be too much, to the point I was working 6 and sometimes 7 days week. For around 50k a year it wasn’t worth it. So I really did want out soon but had no options really up until I was approached with this new job offer. 

I was approached buy a couple guys I knew for a job as a loan officer with a bank they offered me 60k a year and obviously a bank is going to offer a better schedule pretty much a 8-4 Monday through Friday job. Off weekends and holidays etc. coming from retail where it literally never stops this was attractive to me. Along with better pay and benefits and so on, literally no real reg flags. 

Anyway I put in my two weeks at my current job and of course had the typical “what will it take to get you to stay” speech. I feel very thankful I’m wanted and not someone they want to get rid of. But for my last couple of weeks on the job I had a handful of talks with my boss, him trying to get me to stay but I told him this is a better opportunity and I’ll regret it if I don’t take it. So he starts telling me I just need to find something I like and stick with it. He starts saying things like I’ll never get anywhere changing jobs, I’ll never move up. He starts saying if I stay where I’m at I could be a district manager or higher. I just need to find what I like and stay. Well on the last day of me working I was saying good bye to some other managers I’ve worked with and one made the comment that I’ll never amount to anything job hopping and he knew this wouldnt be my last job I take. I took real offense to that. 

My job history isn’t that crazy, while I was in college I worked 2 part time jobs which equaled to full time hours. After college is when I took the retail store manager job. And then got offered this new job with a bank. The 2 part time jobs I worked for 6 years each and the retail manager one for 5 and now starting a new one. How am I a job hopper?

1bhsb6a,Stepping down from a management role to an individual contributor?,"I work for one of the Big-4 bulge bracket banks as a Branch Manager, Vice President. Inhave been in the role for about a year and I can't say I really like it. The constant stress of dealing with a partially incompetent staff, as well as the pressure from my manager had been weighing on me lately. 

So, I discussed with my manager the possibility of stepping down to a role as a Private Client Banker. Which is a position that I currently manage. If I do this, I'd be taking a 25k cut my base salary but also have uncapped incentive as a banker. Overall, I'd most likely make about the same amount of money as I do now. I would strictly focus on working my own book of clients and assisting with walk-ins as needed. So right now, my base is 78k, plus whatever bonus I earn based on the performance of my branch. Last year I earned a 23k bonus but that was on the higher end of what I would likely earn in the future. I don't see my branch having that same performance bonus this year. Now, my base as a banker would go down to 53k plus whatever sales incentive I make each month. The person who vacated the position I have an offer for made 38k in bonus last year. 

I just don't know if I'm making the right decision. I was so sure a few week ago when I spoke with my manager about stepping down. But now I'm worried I am making a mistake. I don't want to screw myself over as far as earning potential goes. This is a really tough choice.

In my current career I can prob break 100k within the next 5 year if I stay with this company but it's not like I am excited with the work I do. I understand it is a ""JOB"" but I feel as if I am wasting my time when I could have a real impact on the world by doing something better with my time.  
  
Anyways, I have always wanted to join the military (almost signed at 18) and deep inside I still want to join. I feel completley dead inside working for my current 9-5 job, I WFH and it is quite boring.. don't get me wrong I know I am lucky to have a bunch of flexibility and enjoy my coworkers but feel like all I am doing is making a big corp money and have no purpose. I have been thinking about either becoming a Firefighter, Coast Guard, Air National Guard, or Navy OCS to fulfill the void. Am I crazy or is this something a lot of people struggle with as they work 9-5 for bigger organizations?  
I am aware joining any of these would be a relatively large pay cut as well as a major career change and I could ultimatley regret it, but I just keep thinking about it.  
  
Is a career change late in 20's worth it? I eventually want to start a family and being able to financially support a family is a high-priority since I did not grow up wealthy.  
  
Should I stay a civilian and try to volunteer (firefighter) or something else that might be able to fulfill that ""Serve/Purpose"" void I have? I also could look into switching into a different field that I might enjoy and make more money at. OR do I just jump into the deep end and join the military?  
  
I would want to join by becoming an Officer (better pay and leadership opportunities) so that does limit my career choices. I am physicially fit and know I could have a high probability of getting into Officer program (except AF since it's super competative but I would still try) I have solid GPA 3.7 and letters of rec, etc. Not sure what military jobs I'd go for but I have been doing a lot of research on them. There seems to always be a 50/50 split between people who enjoyed or regretted their military service. What I am seeing is ""it is what you make of it"" on a lot of threads. If I make this big life decision I would take it seriously not halfass it.  
  
Should I just look at reserves/guard since it would be part time and allow me to continue working civilian job making $?  
  
Navy OCS/Navy Reserves  
Coast Guard OCS  
Air Force OTS (Unlikely, Hard to get into and waitlist)  
Air National Guard (Enlist,Part time)

The pandemic made it impossible for me to leave, so I spent my time focusing on paying off my debt. Now that things have somewhat stabilized and I'm in a better financial position, I'm considering pursuing a new career path or further education.

The issue is that I haven't found any fields that resonate with me or anything that I’d want to start all over for.

1bhrklt,Should I find a new job?,"I have a dilemma and I seem to be getting mixed reviews from the people in my life.

I currently have a good job but with the rising cost of living and having to pay student loans I’m living paycheck to paycheck and don’t have any extra money to start paying my student debt down faster (I have about 30k left to pay and had been making good progress up until now). Even simple groceries are becoming too expensive to afford.

I want to start applying to other jobs and I have some friends that have offered to help me get in the door with some higher paying positions. However, their companies have also done layoffs in the past year.

Some people in my life have discouraged me from doing this because my current job offers a level of stability (I do know there’s never any true promise of stability) because our products are required by law for certain industries and institutions to carry. My boss even mentioned that during the 2008 economy crash they did just fine. I also have been at this company for a while, if the economy crashes into oblivion I likely wouldn’t be the new person they let go of first. Side note: I have done very well at my job and I am in good standing with the company. 

I truly get 50/50 responses and I’m unsure of where to go from here.

So what would be the best course of action here: stay with my current job where I’m not making enough to pay my debt down/live comfortably while I wait out our crashing economy? Or take the risk of leaving my job for a job that could offer less stability in the future but more money? 

Am I holding myself back because of this fear of uncertainty? I’m 28 and still nervous after being laid off from my first job due to COVID.

1bhre3s,How can I stay motivated in this situation?,"Hi reddit. Wonder if you could give me advise or a different perspective on my current job and career. 

I have been at the same company for 10 years, and have worked really hard to get to the job I am doing now. My role involves marketing/design/website/tech stuff. I am the only person in the company employed in this type of role, and I make over £13,000 more per year than comparable roles elsewhere. I work 2 days in the office and 3 days from home, 9am-5pm. 

I've gotten to the point now where I feel like I can do the job with my eyes closed. I can do all my work in the 2 days I am in the office. The 3 days I am at home, I can do anything I want. I don't even log on or turn the laptop on some days because there is no point. The days I am in the office are spent with incompetent managers discussing the smallest things, with no real strategic thinking or plans in place. But even when there is work to do, I just feel so demotivated. Whatever work I create, my boss is happy with it. I could show them literally anything and they'd sign it off. I think it makes me feel really lazy.

I know this is a really nice problem to have, but it is increasingly dull and lonely. I am single, live on my own, and the office location is on my doorstep. 

If I looked for a new job elsewhere, I would have to take quite a big pay cut, and have to work longer hours than what I do now. 

Do I just ride this gig out for as long as I can, or look for more meaningful and motivating work for better job satisfaction?

1bhrbku,To leave or not to leave,"That is the question.

What would you all do?

I am in a senior role with a company that is up for sale. Its stock is plummeting. We have got good financial milestones, but the background noise is distracting. Some managers are leaving. Obviously the red flags are all there.


My issue is my position is pretty stress free and the work life balance is great and I make decent money. I could make more if i went somewhere else, but my fear is ending up in a spot where my work life balance is gone. Interviewers will always tell you how great it is, but that may not be the case. Honestly, work life balance is the most important thing for me.


So I’m kind of stuck. On one hand moral is low with all the company going ons. On the other hand, my spot is great financially and mentally.

Would you all ride it out? See what happens in the future? Or leave now? The company isn’t going to go bankrupt and I’m really not fearing being laid off. Not to toot my own horn, but I bring a ton of experience and I’m really in the prime of my career, so I would be an asset when buy out happens.

1bhqdj6,"Corporate world is slowly crushing my soul, but what's the other option?","Hey all, I need to draw from your wisdom and experience. I'm posting this from my alternate account to avoid any potential issues.

To give you context I'm 35 and currently working as a regional function head in one of the MNC. Professionally, I consider myself lucky as within the span of 13 years of my career I always managed to find employers and managers who are willing to support my professional/career growth. In most of my career, I'm under global/mobile arrangement which requires me to spend most of my professional live outside my home country.

Whilst the work itself is always stressful, what is killing me the most is the environment. The more senior I am, the more I see that the view up top is one which filled with ruthlessness, where people continuously scheming against and backstab each other. I'm tired of always having to look over my shoulders, and I'm desperate that each of my compassionate act is always twistedly framed as a sign of weakness or ineffective management style.

On the other hand, the job itself coming with plethora of perks that my family (my wife and son) becomes accustomed to (i.e. very generous package and opportunity to move around at company's cost). My line management is also very supportive (of my career growth) and have a very solid plan to pave my path to senior exec role.

My initial plan was to retire (from corporate world) and return to my home country when my son leaves for college (around 10 years from now). But, in the past year, it felt like my soul is slowly dying every day. In essence, I'm not complaining about the work itself, it's the game that nauseated me. 

Is this just a phase that I need to go through? Should I find an alternative livelihood now? Is there any place in corporate world where you could just focus on your work without having to play the game?

do i even have a future if i don’t have A-levels or any equivalent? i don’t want to not be able to look after myself or make a life but i don’t know if any employer would ever consider me if i don’t even have A-levels (or equivalent). when i finish, i’m planning to do some personal study at home for a couple years and then take the exam for specific language certificates whether i pass A-levels or not, because i study languages currently and it was the original plan to do so, but i’m sure that they wont mean much to employers if i don’t have the A-levels anyway.

1bhojoc,Uni student stuck in contract,"Hi all.

Using an old throwaway account since due to the terms of my contract im not supposed to be talking about it online in any capacity.

I apologise for the vagueness of some parts of this post, i cant risk publishing anything identifying about myself or the contract.

Before i started university i applied to a scholarship scheme in the defence industry. at the time it was a very appealing contract, however as time has passed im becoming more and more uncomfortable with the nature of work that is being required of me. my contract states that i have to complete work placements during summers and work full time for a few years after university. the jobs i take on have to be provided by the scheme host, but i can take on anotehr job if (a) i can prove to them that it is a job in defence and (b) the employer can prove to the host that the company benefits my country’s defence operations.

As time has passed, i feel more and more as if im being exploited. i work for less than min hourly wage in my country at a typical 9-5, however im expected to complete extra work outside of the 9-5 unpiad, and i am also expected to relocate for work with no extra support except for fuel costs to travel. the nature of the work is becoming more and more uncomfortable, and im quickly realising that i do not want to work in defence. also, the clearance level i have been granted and that i require to work in any job provided by the host is highly restrictive (basically cant leave the country unless its for work).

no part of the work i complete is negotiable. they claim i can bail out at any time however i am required to pay back anything i have recieved in the past year plus my initial support package (up to USD 12,000) which would financially devestate me. 

I have no idea where to turn. I cant talk about this to anybody IRL due to the countless NDA’s and the terms of my clearance. I cant refuse any work assigned to me since that would result in termination and i would i have to pay that 12k. I know my options are limited, i just want to know if anyone has been in this situation before and if i cant escape it, how can i manage completing jobs that i dont feel comfortable doing?",ResponsiblePair8304,1,1.0,0,1710761698,2024-03-18 11:34:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhojoc/uni_student_stuck_in_contract/,3,2024

1bhnjpn,Changing career field and quitting a good job?,"Hello everyone!

I'm 33, I currently have a good and well-paid job in Finance/Accounting as an Analyst and I have 10 years of experience in this field. I would be happy to keep living off my stable salary. I have good benefits and technically nothing to worry about. But I have this 'first-world' problem. My job is boring and I can't find fulfillment. I tried to switch to another position in a more interesting field within the same company several times but no success, I was immediately rejected. I was told I can get a promotion in a few years but I need to be patient. It's a slow-paced public organisation. Besides, if I get promoted, I wouldn't be too happy either, it's just more work in a boring job and I'm not really interested in managing other people and processes in this career field.

For the last few months this thought kept bugging me. I only have one life and I would like to do some more interesting stuff. I really like learning languages and analysing the strucutre of the language, some cultural codes and differences between different countries, cultures, languages. It has nothing to do with my job but I enjoy doing that even when I have some spare time at work. I've started learning several languages and I find fun in it. I'm not sure if I turned this into a full-time thing, I would still be so passionate but there is a part of me who would like to try obtaining a degree in linguistics. 

The problem is, I would have to either quit my job or reduce to part-time (which I don't know if is feasible - I don't know if my employer agrees). I was always a kind of person who loves learning and I much better find myself in an academic than business environment. Knowledge is a big driver for me. I could potentially pursue an academic career even if I don't earn enough, I think it would bring me much more fulfillment and joy even if it's hard work.

I can live a few years off my savings and invest my time a university degree but I don't want to make a big mistake either. Maybe it's just the grass being always greener on the other side?

TLDR: I don't like my job anymore, I don't like my career field (finance/accounting) and I would like to study another major (linguistics). Does that make sense or is it a big mistake? Has anyone done that and how did it turn out in the end?

How is anyone supposed to live off that with student loans? Even without debt that would be extremely tight. Is it like this all over the US or do I just need to leave my town?

- surgical technician (associates degree + certification) $22-30/hr
- associate scientist (bachelors degree) $20/hr

Wawa employees make $16 an hour so I don’t understand what the point of even getting a degree is at this rate.

1bhmska,The “Best” Medical Career?,"Hey sub! I will be retiring from the military in 10 years, and while I absolutely have maybe around 5 years or more to decide, I am thinking of my next career. I LOVE physiology, and I have a college degree with a minor in Biology and a MS in Health Sciences. I could really see myself in any number of medical jobs… I know there are obvious downsides to a number of medical careers, so:

If you could do it all over again and choose a medical career, which would you choose and why? Paying for school and affording life is no issue.

I am interested in:
-Medical School (Anesthesia, Dermatology, Radiology, Family Medicine, Sports Medicine, and so much more). I love the idea of what doctors do (minus paper pushing) and learning in Med School. Great pay. Not looking forward to spending my 40s in residency
-Dental School (regular dentist, Orthodontist.). Same as above but no abusive residency.
-Nursing (Anesthesia, Derm, Injector, etc). Could really decide early on what I wanted to make of it

1bhl3oy,Would you consider a counteroffer from your current workplace if you've already accepted/signed an offer?,"So I received an offer for a position that is somewhat of a lateral move in title however offers more growth opportunity than my current employer and a 30% pay increase!! I am super happy and the organization seems amazing, I interviewed with the CAO. They also matched my vacation that I had (5 weeks) and the benefits and pension appear to be better.

I actually love where I work, the organization I work for and the work I do, I've just been there for over a decade (in multiple roles, slowly moving up) and I have no more room for upward movement (in my current role or another). There are also some politics that are a bit challenging and staffing issues.

I gave my verbal notice (4 weeks) and both our HR Manager and Office Manager asked what they can do to keep me. I basically said I don't think it's possible within my current role/pay scale and I'm looking forward to expanding on my career. I received an email after our meeting from HR asking if I would consider staying if another role could be created and my salary could be increased (I haven't told them specifically what I'm being paid in their new role). 

I am going to be handing in a formal resignation letter but a part of me is having second thoughts. Should I at least entertain their potential counteroffer? I already accepted an offer so also worry about potentially burning that bridge - I don't want to come across as unprofessional. I also know the stats on counteroffers aren't good (most people end up leaving within 6 months).

Any advice is appreciated, thanks.

1bhjyvc,Should I quit my finance grad program since I got a job?,"Hi all. I think I have a more non-traditional background compared to other finance folks. 

I have been teaching for two years and I wanted to pivot to impact investing or education finance after observing financial disparities in the public school system. I believe that many problems in our education system can be solved with better budgeting practices and just more money. I didn't have the finance background to make this switch. So started a part-time online MS Finance degree program from a top university last Fall while still teaching full-time. In the meantime, I refined some of my Excel/data viz skills and began applying for some jobs in the impact investing/education finance world. Luckily, I recently got a pretty decent offer as an investment analyst that triples my current teaching salary. I accepted the offer and will start in June. 

  
I wanted to pursue the master's degree so that I would have some credibility when applying to finance roles since I don't have a finance background. But now that I landed a role, I'm starting to question if the degree is worth the investment. Should I still continue my master's degree even though I've gotten my foot in the door with a comfortable role? For context, I've taken out about $14,000 in loans for the program already and will probably have to take out $40,000+ total if I complete the degree. I don't have any loans from undergrad.

1bhjncm,Advice on Career/Education - What to pursue?,"Hello Everyone! I am a 26 yr old M looking to go back for post secondary education in Canada to get into a stable career and field I like. I have researched lot on the internet and I have gone back to drawing board to map my mind to find the perfect fit or degree but I know that a perfect degree won't exist that will tick everything. 
However I am looking for some advice and I can share some things about myself and I would really appreciate any helpful advice and insights.

I love reading books and listening to podcasts about human behavior, psychology, history, architecture, design, sounds. I love to find interesting stories of day to day things, places etc. I love being imaginative and creative and finding new and creative ways of doing things.

I don't like chemistry at all. I am okay with Maths and Physics. I am absolutely fascinated by software specifically designing and how it works.

I am in banking, and I know I don't want anything related to customer service/support, sales , trades, or physical labor.

Following are the fields I have researched on and my genuine feedbacks - ( I have researched online, talked with students and current employees in the field)

I actually have boiled down to these 3:

Teaching: I am really passionate about it. I would love to pursue this. The only thing stopping me is how teachers are treated here in the canadian education system. 

Computer Science: Most versatile and I love working with computers and software. I actually love UX/UI design, and I still in my free time randomly create ideas, design, workflows on paper. Watch videos on it to learn more. Cannot say I love coding, but I am okay with it. 

Public Administration: Because it will give me a government job. I am not passionate about it or anything, but if I put in effort, I will be able to land a government job - which I think is a pretty stable and safe career.

I have been trying to narrow down and it's been really hard. I would really appreciate any feedback. I have tried to research as much as I can but I also want to get outside reviews. I don't have any family so I can't ask them what they think I would be good at or what could be a great career option.

If you need any more information please feel free to ask and again any advice will be helpful 😊

1bhjb2q,Should I switch to IT?,"

I need some advice as I am seriously thinking of leaving nursing. I am 30 something years old female with one child under 3. I am currently a floating nurse (working on different floors) and enrolled in a psych doctorate degree program. Program is close to 100K and 4 years long. My hospital covers the entire tuition as long as I work full time. I hate being a nurse on medical floor but I do like psych and I am ok working on that floor only. 

Recently, I reduced my job to part-time and took a leave of absence from school. I applied to two new RN positions and had interviews (most likely offers too).
Job 1 is a psych reserach nurse 20 hours a week, mostly from home. They will cover 50% of the tuition (40K roughly).
Job 2- psych floor 20 hours a week (3-11pm), also covering 50% tuition. 

I think combining these two positions will be difficult (to get 40h/week and 100% tuition coverage). Taking job 2 will give me at least a possibility to eventually get more hours. Research most likely won’t. But I love the idea of working from home (both jobs are 1 hours drive up to two hours sometimes).

To make it more complicated, I am interested in software development. I learned python on my own and enjoyed it. My husband is also in IT and wants to help me. I could also do boot camp or even computer science program.


My dilemma is: is it ridiculous to switch careers this late in life (mid 30s). I have zero experience in IT and no education (though I could get a degree for the same amount of time I would be doing NP program, or I could do a boot camp).

Also NP is not the same as RN. Work is totally different and I think I would enjoy it (I dislike nursing as RN. Psych nursing is the only field I am ok with but not loving it currently as RN).

I think I feel guilty to throw away all the effort it took me to get into one of the better programs and have the tuition covered. Also, I have a very solid foundation in nursing and am familiar with the job responsibilities and team work involving different specialties. 

IT would be a leap into unknown. 

I know only I can make a decision but would love to hear your opinions.",Plus_Bookkeeper1388,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1710739858,2024-03-18 05:30:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhjb2q/should_i_switch_to_it/,3,2024
1bhj8rp,Got laid off after failing probation,"Hi guys. I think from my past posts it's been quite clear that I have been having problems with my job, and my probation was extended a month. Come to think of it I still clung on desperately to the slim chance that I stood a chance but on hindsight, I should have just listened to the advices here to find a new job. 

So now once again, I'm hoping for advice. Should I feel sad? I just feel numb though. I thought I was improving but suddenly the bomb just dropped today. I honestly was caught rather off guard. 

Anyways. I'm only here for 4 months, should I put this job in my resume? It's a good name company and I'm honestly prepared to just explain that they felt I wasn't a good culture fit. If I don't put, then how do I explain the 4 months gap? Cos my industry is very small and is easy to find out where a guy has been. So no point in trying to hide that I was let go from here...

Also, when I state my last drawn, do I state this 4 months job? Or my previous 2 years job?

Lastly, anyone been through this before? I'm still trying to process my emotions so not sure what to feel...

1bhj559,Not sure if work environment is sketchy or to ride it out ,"Hey all! So I came here for some advice this is a burner acct. 

I recently started a new job after leaving a place I liked but got burnt out at after 5 years. I took this new job because it involved doing not as task heavy work, I’m decently passionate about the work (which is pretty fun in and of itself) and I thought maybe a change of scenery would help in sparking my creativity. Well as I am now a few months into this job, I’m starting to see how dysfunctional the organization is. There is so much red tape, weird policies, tons of redundant/tedious administrative work and just entitled colleagues amongst other things. 

I accidentally forgot to turn in my timesheet at the 5pm deadline last Friday because I was helping a colleague with an event and by the time I got home, I was so tired I fell asleep. I woke up that Saturday in a panic and filled out the very tedious time card and submitted it within an hour (the time it takes to fill it out). Since our accounting department doesn’t work on weekends I thought I’d be good. Well, Monday I got an email from HR telling me how to be better at time management and giving me passive aggressive tips to get things in on time. To top it off per company policy, I will not accrue PTO for the next pay period as a punishment for submitting my time card late. Is this normal practice? I’ve work in many other places in this sector and this is the first time I am seeing this type of policy. To top it off, I have never met this colleague in the months I’ve been there. So to get that type of email from someone I’ve never met felt so strange. Our company is small, probably around 20 people but we all work in silos and onboarding doesn’t include meeting your coworkers only the boss, your supervisor and a few people you might come into contact with and some people from HR. 

Additionally there’s just some other stuff I’m not a fan of and it just becomes annoying and unnecessarily difficult for no reason. The tedious administrative work is becoming exhausting and just the dynamics of the staff like higher ups putting added tasks on my workload and not considering any of my concerns (though I am the inly qualified person in my company by educational and work experience). Its workload that will take an insane amount of time to complete but they don’t listen to me when I show them the data or explain to them. They can’t see it because they’ve never done the work. 

Now there are some positives like I somewhat like my supervisor. She seems to be very understanding and watches out for me a lot! She seems to be more of a collaborator with me and seems to shield me from some of the stuff going on at the org. I also get to do a lot of fun things that the work entails that allows me to be more of a creative and kind of hone that side of me. 

My struggle comes from feeling like I want to move on but also wants to give it a chance to see if things change. Also, they have the flexible schedule option and the option to work from home if you’d like which really helps as Im also in school. It’s just tough because I took a 20k a year pay cut from my last job to take this job because I thought it would be more laid back but it’s been a little stressful. And some of the policies like punishing staff for submitting a late time card with docking PTO or receiving passive aggressive write ups from higher ups that you have never met before. So I’m trying to balance the grossness with some of the benefits. Im really missing the culture at my old place of employment just not the burnout. 

I just needed to rant and maybe if anyone has been in a similar situation. I just don’t know if I should ride it out or look for something different.

1bhi7ec,How do I prepare to escalate the issues with my new manager to their boss? ,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I got a new manager in December, and it has been going horribly. I’ll try not to make this too long, but basically he is a complete micromanager, but only does the micro-ing and not the managing. 

He has blocked all of my projects, including ones that were already basically done and had been approved by my old manager and his manager (who is also my new manager’s manager) stating that we should completely pivot and take another direction to approach everything. Nothing I say or do is good enough. No feedback is given. If anything, he goes in and completely redoes something with his extremely limited knowledge on the company and that is that. No ifs ands or buts. Only what he says can go. 

He blocks these projects and doesn’t allow me to provide revisions or new options or set up dedicated time to review together. He doesn’t believe in any deadlines even though these projects are time sensitive and other people at the company are depending on me. This has led to multiple other teams having to scramble and others left empty-handed because I can’t deliver anything. 

Beyond that, he has also been dropping very passive aggressive comments that make me uncomfortable and feel hurt. He has one other direct report who is experiencing the same things as me. 

I am meeting with my manager’s manager in three weeks. I set it up under the impression I’d like career guidance. But really, I need to prepare for how to drop this bomb. My new manager has ruined the job I used to love for 2+ years and I’m on the verge of quitting because of him, but I can’t let him win. 

I need advice on how to best prepare for this meeting. I’ve been trying to keep track of projects being delayed, unprofessional commentary, and now I’ve begun to very slowly and lightly drop feedback to my manager about some of the things that aren’t working for me. I know I can’t go into that meeting without having an answer if my manager’s manager asks, “Did you talk to your manager about this?” 

So what else do I do to prepare? What do I compile? What are my main points? How do I stay emotionally disconnected during this and stick to the facts?

I work at a Sales agency (6 months in). We have 10 product lines. I focus on the distribution side with Boss A. Boss A is great and he is my direct superior.

Boss B is responsible for Product Line Two, and needs sales help. They asked me and said that it won’t have a pay adjustment (since they will lessen responsibility on the distribution side) but will give a commission. I agreed and said I think that using me is an inexpensive way to go to market with this new product line. Boss B said “Yeah you are cheap labour.” In front of 2-3 other people, which i feel is inappropriate and disrespectful. 

That was roughly 6 weeks ago. In the last 6 weeks the training has been terrible, self paced with little guidance and many conflicting suggestions/info. I have reached out to teammates, Boss B, Boss A and others even outside my organization to properly understand the needs of the business. I have 4-6 emails proving that I have proactively been reaching out to try and get started calling leads and help Boss B. 

Fast forward to last week, Boss B wanted a rundown of where all  the leads are at and what the next steps are. I was confused because the previous conversations I had was about how I can get involved and there was either no answer or no clear explanation. I called boss A and he told me to call boss B for clarification because it’s probably just a misunderstanding.

I tried calling Boss B for 2 days, then Friday after a group meeting he called me. I told him about this and how I feel it’s been one sided as I try to get info on product, funnel etc, and Boss B told me to “take responsibility”. He also mentioned on this call that since it’s not a profitable line for the company, they can’t pay me commission until around $400k of revenue (30-50 sales?), and then it will be a bonus structure. 

I have a meeting with Boss A tomorrow and would love some help on how to bring this up in the proper corporate manner. 

I am feeling disrespected and unheard by Boss B, and am unsure if I want to continue with selling that product line, due to the comment of being “cheap labour” and that there is no commission that was previously mentioned (for the immediate future), no pay adjustment for different responsibilities, and the tone that Boss B has had recently during our conversions. 

Any help is much appreciated!!

Eventually (last year) my department had lay offs and I was included. After 4 grueling months of job hunting in my field, I was unsuccessful. Needing income, I pivoted to a different industry altogether (but the same job). 

My current position is a contract for a year, and I’m halfway into it. This past week though, a recruit for the company who owns the one that laid me off reached out to me about a position. I interviewed w/ her before so we’re acquainted. 

After two interviews, I was offered the job and they would like me to start next Monday (3/25).  I love the description and would excel at it.

I accepted but it isn’t binding, there’s more documents to come and also the position is temp. Although the rehire and background checks are happening. I asked on layoff if I was rehirable and was told yes, my background is fine.

The recruiter explained the plan is to become permanent, but w/ temp work they can get rid of me any time. 

So, I’m worried about putting in a short notice on Monday and burning that bridge with a great boss. Then 

1) Having to be exited from my current position on Friday, and then have a fail in the checks and lose both jobs. 

2) Two weeks into this new position, they decide they don’t need me. The field is quite layoff happy right now. 

If all goes well though, this could potentially jump start my career. Any help is appreciated, thank you!!",Jeffers19,1,1.0,0,1710729091,2024-03-18 02:31:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhg2ev/would_you_end_the_contact_early/,3,2024

Currency exchange of Country A = x3 home country 

1. I started my first job in Country A, but I was laid off within 5 months. After I was laid off I learnt that the another member in the department had taken over my role. They had only been there for two months more than I was. Despite the short time, I learned a lot from this role and my acting manager had always been a good mentor and he didn’t have any say in the layoffs. 

2. I joined another place as a trainee in home country but it has been demotivating. I’m treated as intern or personal assistant, assigned tasks like handling MOM and I’ve not been treated part of the team. I've been here for 7 months, but speaking with my manager about my concerns isn't an option.

3. Currently, I'm considering a role change because I don't see a future here and I'm not learning anything related to my field of work. In my current line of work, learning often comes from experience or day-to-day tasks. Based on my job hunt, the roles that I’m interested requires few years of working experience and limited roles are available  

4. Now, my acting manager from country A is offering me to rejoin, and the pay is also good. So, I'm unsure if I should return or continue applying elsewhere. My long term plan is to live and work in country A.

The workers/my bosses have been extremely kind, but there was ZERO training (I replaced the one other person in my department the day after they left), and as a new grad, I don’t have the experience to just roll into it, so I’ve been stressed everyday.

I kept applying/interviewing, and I have now been offered a job at a MUCH larger company that actually has upwards growth, a higher starting salary, and will look MUCH better on my resume in the future. It’s also hybrid (in person 2 days tho) but only 10 min from my apartment. Basically, it’s a no brainer

The only issue is idk how to quit and I feel awful. This is like a “we’re a family” small company where they have been super welcoming, just gave me a company card and office key, etc. As mentioned, I’m the only person in my department, so leaving is gonna put them in a huge bind. I’ve given zero inclination that I’ve been applying and interviewing at others

Currently, the founders manage the project and the team, but they have a lot of other business-related things to do and other companies. My tasks are going to be taking as much from their shoulders, taking care of the project and its future, and also taking care of the people. Well, basically being PM I think. There wasn't anyone in that position there, so I need to also “create” this position from the ground up. 

I have experience mainly from the student government at my university, where I helped with a lot of projects, but those were mostly entertainment events. I also graduated from Business Management, and I am currently doing a Google Project Management Certificate, I think it's better than nothing for a start. 

My questions are: 
- What is the best way for me to prepare for this role, what to prepare, and what to quickly learn? 
- What are the first and most important things I should do when I start this work? On a first day, week, or month? 
- As vague as this could sound, how to work with new people I don't know (it's also a fully remote company)? 
- What are the general dos and don'ts? 

I'm terrified, but also a little excited, I believe that this can be an incredible experience for me and my career, and I really care to give my best.

1bhd3v7,Non-manager is piling on work and is making threats. How do I raise this to my boss?," I work in a finance role and a director in my department (not my manager) is piling on work. I need advice on how to discuss the following scenarios with my boss:  
\- Non manager gave me three projects to complete on Friday and told me they were due Monday. She said they have CEO visibility and it would be a bad look on my part if I did not complete them in time.  
\- Non-manager has done this to others in my department, so I don't believe I am being singled out. I have one colleague who has complained to our boss about this non-manager's conduct. Our boss (CFO) sent out a department email that unless it was an emergency, any work requests that others needed should have at least 2 business days to turnaround. This person regularly violates this rule and our boss said this non-manager doesn't respect other people.  
\- Non-manager has joked about layoffs and said we are lucky to be employed. She has said under-performers are being noted. Again, she isn't my boss. I don't report to her in any way. Any work I do for her (financial reports, ppts, etc) are basically helping a colleague. She is director level, and I am not but my boss made it clear I don't report to this person.  
\- My boss has acknowledged non-manager is a ""huge pain"" in her own words. They worked together once before but my boss said if she knew non-manager treated people this way she would not have hired her.  
\- Non-manager has made some pretty impressive turnarounds in our department, but at the cost of causing a lot of burnout.  
I spent all weekend working on financial reports and assembling a powerpoint for this non-manager because she requested it at 6PM on Friday. She called me, sent me a message on Teams, and then texted me telling me I had to work on the report and then meet with her at 6:30 AM to review it so she could request any last-minute adjustments prior to her meeting with the CEO. She told me failure to deliver would be a bad look.  
How do I raise this to my manager? I am concerned about three things:  
\- seeming like a tattle-tale  
\- looking like I am piling on someone who is generally disliked in our department  
\- seeming weak, like I cannot handle pressure or interpersonal difficulties ",New_Operation7278,2,1.0,8,1710720629,2024-03-18 00:10:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bhd3v7/nonmanager_is_piling_on_work_and_is_making/,3,2024

I am currently 33 living in UK. All my life I have never been ambitious and never had a real goal in mind. I went into College and University to do music production as that was (and still is) my passion. Regrettably, there isn't a job scope for this line of work as the arts is outstandingly competitive.  


The skills I have learnt from the above course has helped me start a band and produce original music but that, of course, was not my main goal.   


For the past 7-8 years I have been an administrator for law firms. First was 5 years was with a small company and the remainder is with a much larger law firm ( Will not disclose these company names).   


I am at the point in my life now where I feel under achieved. My job is minimum wage for the role I do and is ungratifying.  However, as an adult with responsibilities I am grateful for what I have as it pays the bills and keeps a roof over my families head.   I just don't want this to be my life for next 39 years ( if Retirement age does go up to 72). I need a change.   


In my spare time I play with my 3D printers and constantly upgrade/maintain the machines. This involved using G-Code to configure firmware to suitably match the printer. I  have found to enjoy Coding and would like to do more of it. I am extremely tech savvy and working with coding does sound fun.   


Am I reaching for a pipe dream again? Sure I am not going to quit my job right away as that is financial suicide but I feel like I need to change my career for my own mental well being. There is no challenge and I feel my IQ is lowering.

1bhbc3j,Leaving A Dead End Job I Like for a A New Career. How much Notice,"In October I am starting a new career. I have been at my current company for about 4 years. I like the company, I really love my bosses, but the salary is shitty and the trajectory could be a lot better. Last year i talked them into paying for about 10 grand of job training for a job that they hire for internally. About 3 months into the job training i was recruited to a company that pays better, will offer a more meaningful challenge, and ultimately will set me up for better opportunities going forward. 

My current company hasnt made any promises or anything about me moving to the role I got the training for, and I havent really asked. I would absolutely go back to work for my current company in the future once Ive gotten experience in this new line of work. 

The thing is: this new line of work famously hires about 10 months in advance for new graduates. When i do end up quitting my current job, and updating linkedin, they'll know i knew for a long time. I don't get the sense that theyll be vindictive, but you never know. 

I just worked really hard to build relationships at my current company and I'd like to maintain them going forward as optimally as possible.

Whats the right amount of notice to give in this situation? 2 months would be enough time to not leave anyone in the lurch, but may also result in me being let go to make room for my long term replacement. 2 weeks kinda feels like a fuck you based on the circumstances, but maybe thats corporate kool aid talking.

1bhaw3r,Help me consider my next move after college?,"I'm in my last semester of college and am completely undecided as for what my career path should be.   For context, I'm going to be graduating in the U.S. with a B.S. in Psychology in an Occupational Therapy pathway with minors in Advanced Writing, Applied Statistics, Communications, & Music (hopefully the 4 minors won't be a problem--I had a lot of credits going into college so I was able to fit a lot of courses I was interested in). The Occupational Therapy pathway only consisted of an extra 3 courses (medical terminology & 2 semesters of anatomy and physiology) so I decided to include it within my degree, but after shadowing I'm not sure if this is the path for me. I'll hopefully be graduating with a 3.8 GPA and have a couple of extracurriculars (co-editor in chief of student newspaper, film/tv club, volunteer service). I'm also in the psychology national honors society and another honor society my college invited me into, and will be doing a short-term study abroad this summer for a film class I'm taking that will be traveling to Italy.

All of that being said, I'm lost as for what career best suits me and will lead me to be financially comfortable. I have a lot of different interests and experiences from college that could potentially look good on my resume and for grad school applications, but with all of these interests I feel like I might come across as noncommittal. I was considering occupational therapy before because of the ability to help people in a meaningful way, but after shadowing and seeing many OTs online wishing they could switch careers, I have a feeling this path isn't for me. 

I've been suggested to go into public health, forensic psychology, counseling, and social work, but I'm not exactly sold on any of those fields (social work is infamous for being mentally-exhausting and low-paying from what I've heard as well). I feel like I have the ability to pursue higher ed, whether that's a masters or PsyD/PhD but don't want to commit to anything like that before I'm absolutely sure it's what I want because of the cost. I also have a creative side which is why I decided to pursue some of my minors in writing/communications/music, but have no idea how those could be marketable or beneficial to my career. I would ideally like some element of creativity in my career and ability to use the skills and interests I built in undergrad but a lot of the careers I've been suggested don't seem to have that sort of component. If anything my minors and interests could lead to side-gigs but I'd like a day job/career path I can fall back on and enjoy at the end of the day.

My plan for after graduation is to move into a city area and bartend while pursuing my education or doing entry-level work, but I still have no idea which way I'm leaning. The only work experience I've had recently has been bartending for two years and being a COVID tester for my college when COVID first hit, and I have no internships or research which makes me very nervous for grad school applications. A professor mentioned I could be a caseworker or do an entry-level marketing position alongside bartending but I'm nervous for such a big change. I live in a small town right now with limited opportunities so moving out into a city area is a big goal of mine to do ASAP.

I'm open to any ideas, especially if there are careers or pathways out there that suit my majors/minors well and have a relatively good pay/rate of employment.

1bh8xqa,Possibly Making a Huge Mistake in Insurance Sales?? (Plz Help),"Hello All!

I'm a 27M recently leaving restaurant management and moving into the insurance industry.

I was ""sponsored"" by Insurance Company A and got my State Health Accident & Life Insurance Producers License. However, upon starting work at Insurance Company A, I discover that the job is mostly cold-calling prospective clients with NO BASE SALARY. 

I only really have enough money saved up to survive maybe 3 more months at most with out income, and I am starting to get concerned about bills.

After my first day at Insurance Company A, I did some research and found several alarming reports from former employees and accusations of the company being run almost like a Multi-Level Marketing/Pyramid Scheme. 

In a panic, I applied to another Insurance Company, Insurance Company B, which did offer a base salary. However, after my experience with Insurance Company A how can I be sure that this new company isn't also some thinly veiled scam????

Please if anyone here knows anything about insurance sales/producing I could really use some help!

\- Thanks,

TLDR: Just got into insurance producing, is it all cold calling and MLMS? And is a State Health Accident & Life Insurance Producers License even worth anything????",turtleartforever,1,1.0,2,1710710284,2024-03-17 21:18:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bh8xqa/possibly_making_a_huge_mistake_in_insurance_sales/,3,2024

I was watching some videos related to the some concepts on YouTube. Suddenly I came across a video of an educator in which he described the hustle of an average neet aspirant and then regarding college life and further studies. 
He explained how mbbs doesn't hold much value nowadays. So it has become a compulsion to go for Neet PG. Mbbs basically takes 5-6 years of a person and if someone took many drops for Neet UG, his or hers 6-8 years are basically invested in just this whole course. Then it doesn't stop here. While attending college for MBBS, student also have to start preparing for Neet PG, which is a very difficult exam and also no. of students that can be selected are very less.

Even if that student gets lucky and get selected, after MS or MD there are more examinations such as Super Specialist which is much more difficult than the first two. And after all this hustle, person gets 1-2 lakhs of salary on average basis.

So is it worth 12-15 years of our life? Why do so many people attempt Neet? For sacrificing these years of one's life In which many more other things could be done? After watching that video, I'm having very mixed emotions. I never wanted to become a doctor. I'm just trying to fulfill my parents wishes. But that video shook me. I don't know what to do now.

1bh7o36,Unsure about premed/med school,"Hi everyone! I’m a current junior in college who has been pre-med since I’ve entered college. I keep going back and forth on whether to pursue premed or not, and wanted some insight on my decision/future plans. 

I’ve shadowed doctors before, and that’s showed me I do not want to be a surgeon under any cost lmao. I liked my shadowing experiences with two other speciality doctors (outpatient setting), but they didn’t convince me that this was the only career I could see myself doing, or medicine was perfect for me. What energized me the most with shadowing was how the doctors were experts in their fields, how they built trust and rapport with patients, and their depth of knowledge. But, I wasn’t fascinated by the actual medical cases/the scientific knowledge.

I’ve had more direct volunteer experiences, as a volunteer for a crisis hotline and in a hospice, and I’ve had energizing moments with both of them when I’m directly interacting with people. But, now almost two years into doing both, I’ve lost motivation to do it - I can still find moments of joy with it, but I don’t feel the same energy/fuel that I did with it when I first started. I don’t know how much of that is burnout and how much of that is natural, but I’m scared by this happening so early on in my career. If I’m already feeling like this, how would I feel in a few years?

I also am a major procrastinator, which is affecting my perceptions of myself. I’ve done well in my science classes (~3.95 sGPA), and my favorite subject in school was science (especially biology, which is what even drew me to medicine in the first place). However, my interest never takes precedence over my life, and I’m not the type who reads up on scientific advancements for fun. My time in college has shown me when it comes between doing something else, I’m not solely concentrated on science/science isn’t enough of a passion of mine to give up time with my friends. 

For the actual process of studying, I love the mental clarity I get when I can get into a flow state and study, and do enjoy the process of studying. But I find that state hard to get into sometimes, and its usually under moments of pressure do I seriously get into it and get shit done. This type of studying won’t work in med school, and idk if I’ll sink or swim, so I’m not 100% sure about my competency either. 

I also feel like some of the things I want are contradictory. I admire people who can draw broad connections/have a depth of knowledge that allows them to solve problems uniquely/see things from a new lens. I want to be that kind of “expert” in my field, but so far, I don’t like anything enough to put in the hours that are necessary for you to get to that point. I also still don’t know how to learn in a way where I’m building towards that type of knowledge, and not just learning/forgetting stuff instantly. I still don’t know if it’s even feasible for the type of person I am to be the type of expert I want to be, and what my strengths are between being a specialist/generalist. 

Also, financial considerations are a huge thing I’m worried about. I didn’t really internalize until this year what being in debt for my 20s will look like - all my financial milestones will come much later, and I lose out on prime years for compounding interest. Especially in school right now, I don’t feel like I’m learning enough to justify the cost of not having a job, and am worried med school will feel the same way. I think this is contributing to burnout, where I feel less motivated to maintain an A streak/go to office hours/and am just doing the bare minimum to skate by. If I get a B in a class, I used to care more, but now I’m just like whatever.

I feel like there’s too much to manage between courses, extracurriculars, and living my life, and I don’t feel like I’m doing anything to an excellent level, and am skating by on the bare minimum bc I know I can. Med school, with maintaining a high GPA, doing extracurriculars, etc, I imagine would feel the same way, and I don’t like that feeling of constantly having to be “on.” It’s so nice when you know that your time off is truly yours, and I’ve read some specialities in medicine can offer that, but med school + residency sure won’t. 

I got a bit off track, but basically, I think being a doctor would be a job I enjoy because it has the potential to offer the level of expertise + direct human interaction + problem-solving + salary + work-life balance I want in a career. But, I don’t see myself uniquely drawn to medicine, I enjoy the science and the patient-doctor relationship, but it isn’t something I envision living life without. At the end of the day, being a doctor would be a job - a purposeful and meaningful job, but it would just be a job. And I don’t know if the training path for something I’d just see as a job would be worth it. I’m taking a gap year to make sure this is something I want to do/potentially try out other fields, and am thinking about both medical and non-medical options.

For an alternative medical route, I’d thought about something like PA school, but I think that will be a career that’s great in your 20s, but would suck when I’ve gained a certain level of expertise, and would still need to answer to a supervising physician. Especially when young, I don’t want to lock myself into a path where there’s not much room for upwards growth. 

So, I was considering non-healthcare related fields. I’ve had some exposure to
tech - I don’t have a passion for the field, but like coding + problem-solving. I ruled it out because I liked science better than math in high school, which feels like pretty stupid reasoning in reflection lol. I do think I’d like medical problems better though, because I’m more motivated to work on problems that involve people. However, tech is a hard technical skill, and I appreciate feeling some degree of a meritocracy. 

I also thought of a business field like consulting, which is the most viable path that I can think of to test my tolerance for doing BS work that I get paid for. I enjoy presenting, and think consulting would help sharpen communication skills. I also think it’ll net a pretty good salary and expose me to what’s actually out there career-wise, along with giving me the social interaction I want. However, I don’t know how/if I can get this job, especially if I’m going to be studying abroad next semester (during recruiting cycle) + I have no relevant past experience.

There’s also sunk cost fallacy coming to play here - I’ve been premed through college, and investing time in a new path that I don’t even know if I’d like feels daunting. But, I don’t want that to rule my decisions. 

I think that sums up my thoughts, and I’d love to hear what people are thinking/if there’s any other paths you’d recommend! ",ShyFly897,1,1.0,2,1710707240,2024-03-17 20:27:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bh7o36/unsure_about_premedmed_school/,3,2024
1bh6whd,How do you choose a career?,"Hello,

I (23M) and struggling to decide what I want to do with my life. I have many passions but don't know which to follow. I have recently graduated with a bachelor's in philosophy, which I absolutely adored studying, but I think I want to spend my life helping people. 

I have an EMT-B certificate, and am looking for more stationary medical positions using it after I learned how horrible it is to drive an ambulance during rush hour. I currently have two possible job opportunities: one as a medical assistant in a doctor's office, and one as a recovery specialist in a rehabilitation center. 

I am now considering if I want to continue down a medical field and maybe become a phlebotogist in a year, focus in on non-profits, or go back to school for philosophy. Volunteering is an important part of my life, but I also want a career that helps people. However, I also know I will regret not pursuing philosophy futher. I am lucky to have so many passions, but I don't know what to do with them.

I am also horrible with math and chemistry, as I started my degree in biology and philosophy but later had to switch to just philosophy after taking and failing chemistry 4 times over. So that may prevent me from most medical fields, but medicine does seem to be the most obvious way to help people. I also do enjoy studying medicine and have a pretty strong stomach to bodily fluids.

1bh6mq1,Choice between 2 offers,"Hi, guys!

I have recently received 2 job offers, which are both from good companies and more or less same salary. 

1. R&D in robotics.  **Advantages**: i have experience in this work and i like it; possibility to switch to another topic(but not 100% sure as we did not talk about this a lot). **Disadvantages:** there is nobody with big experience in this topic(only 1 guy with fresh phd works on it at the moment, who is slightly more skilled than me);  i would probably be working alone or in a team of 2. 
2. R&D in computer vision. **Advantages**: team has lots of experience and expertise in deep learning;  lots of people working in the same area, making opportunity to share knowledge and experience; possibility to become very good in deep learning. **Disadvantages**: no experience in this kind of work, not 100% sure i would like it   


Overall, my fear about first one is that i would have to do a lot by myself and might not grow a lot. I feel like second would give me more opportunities to grow in hard skills. Even if the topic would not be very interesting, skills in computer vision and deep learning would be very helpful even if i go back to robotics.

1bh5yuk,My massive fear of job interviews is ruining my career,"I (37, w), have a debilitating fear of job interviews. This got worse with age. 10 years of professional therapy, couseling, and three rounds of job coaching (with different coaches) have not made this better. I tried to exercise, do breath-work, rest well, do yoga, masturbate, you name it, in the mornings of those job interviews to take the edge off and feel more at ease. It's safe to say (and extremely disappointing): nothing worked. No matter the amount of times I reviewed my career achievements, pat myself on the back, worked so hard on my self-esteem, it's like this trauma never ends. It's like once I hear about getting an interview with a new company, I am glad for 2 seconds, and then revert to a child-like state (although I don't even think this is the right term, a child might not be so terrified of this), or a dumbfounded state where I lose all confidence and ability to believe in myself. 

I prepare thoroughly for interviews, over the past year(s) I've created as many as 100 different, real-life scenarios for whatever they might ask, research the employers, read everything I can, ask around for other people's experiences with that company...you name it. When I get on Zoom (or in the room), it's like my insides blow up and I simply cannot feel safe, at peace, or at ease within myself. I did rehearsals with my coaches and some friends, but the thing is I seem to always be less anxious in those (since I trust those people I am.not able to replicate the real world interview settings) so they tell me I sound great and confident. Finally, the advice ""be yourself"" gets the worst of me. I feel that I cannot sound prepared, interesting, assertive, and relaxed all the while AND remember everything I want to say. This baffles me, because I am a relatively good public speaker and if I make a speech for instance, or do a talk in front of an audience, I am able to improvise my way out of forgetfulness or painful ""uhmmm's"". 

  
On Tuesday I am invited to interview for a big company, in a VP role. It's laughable, because I don't understand why they called me. I believe (genuinely) that I must have tricked them. Some of you might come to tell me that this is trauma, or impostor syndrome. I know people who have impostor syndrome. They are doing better. I, instead, feel cursed, and have seen the effects of this panic and fear in action, and how they sabotaged some seemingly great opportunities. 

  
I am afraid of the interviewer, and that advice to picture them naked or ""just a normal person"" doesn't move me. I, interestingly, do not have this fear if I, say, interview with a potential client in freelancing. It is only with high level work-for-hire roles in big companies because I need to work, and need a salary, and they potentially hold the key to my way back into employment (I have been laid off for financial reasons 1 year ago). 

  
Instead of preparing my interview this evening as relaxed and curious as possible, here I am, shedding yet another layer of my humbling panic. It grows back. I don't know what to do. 

  
Does anyone have a suggestion, has anyone dealt with this?

Thank you very much. ",Ok-Sherbert5713,49,1.0,67,1710703185,2024-03-17 19:19:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bh5yuk/my_massive_fear_of_job_interviews_is_ruining_my/,3,2024

1bh5fed,Any advice for a construction project manager feeling burnt out but stuck on a job due to a retention bonus?,"So I’m an assistant project manager for a large construction company. I have been with this company on a large transit infrastructure project for the last 4.5 years. I am feeling pretty sick of it and have gone through various degrees of burnout over the last few years. 

About 2.5 years ago I got a decent promotion from field engineer to assistant project manager (and a decent raise). There has been a couple re-orgs since then and each time I have been moved into a position with less managerial responsibility. I have voiced my concern with this and the response has always been it’s not due to poor performance but just a temporary change due to requirements of the project. 

Now the project is approaching completion and my manager has admitted that there is not going to be any opportunity for me taking on more responsibility since the project is winding down. I am now doing pretty much the same job I was before I got promoted (although still with the better title and pay). I voiced my concern that this will be detrimental to my professional development and career aspirations since I have been doing that job for almost 10 years now. I am no longer learning new things or growing. My manager said he understands but the only other option is for me to quit and get a job at another company. 

The problem is 3 years ago they offered me a “completion bonus” if I stayed until the project was complete. Back then it was supposed to be completed by end of 2022. Now there has been many delays out of my control and the project likely won’t be finished for at least another year. Unfortunately the bonus letter has a clause that the completion date is subject to change. The bonus works out to about $20k and I could really use that money. 

It is a large company with many other projects. I have asked to transfer to another project and HR had been setting up a few interviews for me on other projects but I just found out my manager and my managers manager have been blocking because they say they need me on this project. 

I have also had a couple interviews with other companies but so far have not received any compelling offers…

Any advice on how I can deal with this situation? Ideally I’d like to get my bonus and still move into a position where I can continue to grow professionally.

Also, if I plan to give my two weeks' notice and the verification is scheduled five days before my start date, can I still quit before the verification? Or do I need to remain with my current employer until the verification is complete? I want to take a week or two off before starting my new job.

1bh4kaf,Mom Friendly Career Paths,"I’m a mom of two great kiddos! A five year old boy and a 6 year old girl. A little back story for you is my husband is the main bread winner for our family. He covers most of our bills and I work to help cover some of the extras. Since our kids have been small I’ve worked in a Pre-K classroom in order to earn income but also keep the childcare cost low.

Starting this August both children will be in the school system full time and I’m considering following a new career. 

The issue that I’m faced with is since my husband does make most of our income, it is not financially smart for him to take time off for the breaks that come up in a school year. Also what I make would only be enough to cover the childcare bill during the  breaks. So essentially I would be working to cover their childcare cost during that time and with as many breaks as they have (fall break, teacher work days, Christmas break, winter break, Presidents’ Day spring break etc) it quickly adds up. 

Aside from teaching, I’m curious what jobs are out there that may work around a typical school year schedule? Should I just bite the bullet and work for childcare cost while someone else is spending that time with my child or is there another way I’m not seeing.

Help!

I am now conflicted. I love all roles of emergency service, and I wish I could do them all.

1bh1v1t,The job I enjoy most or the job that would give me the best life satisfaction?,"I always wanted to be a psychologist - I’ve graduated now with a psychology BSc with a first class from a good uni and had my sights set on becoming a clinical psychologist. I really enjoy listening and helping others to feel understood, educating and supporting others and i’m passionate about it. 

However, I also really enjoy travelling and working remotely and i understand this doesn’t really align with becoming a clinical psychologist. i thought about being a psychotherapist but even then I feel like I wouldn’t really enjoy it as i always wanted to be a child psychologist and work in person and i don’t think that it lends itself well for that. 

I worked in marketing/customer experience throughout uni but hated how shallow it felt. I don’t enjoy result driven jobs. I don’t enjoy sales. I honestly am not interested. 

I’ve looked into UX research and feel like this might be a good choice? I’d be able to work remotely, the pay isn’t bad and it’s not sales driven. I also enjoyed the statistics part of my course and I did a mentorship programme with deloitte digital which went into UX research a bit and it sounds interesting. 

I’m just wondering will it fulfill me as much as clinical psychology? Is it worth abandoning my goal of becoming a clinical psychologist to pursue this career just so I can work remotely and travel?  Or should I sacrifice travel and work a job that will fulfill me despite it taking the majority of my 20s to get there? 

I love freedom, but will I find freedom in making my quality of life my priority or my a fulfilling career one?

Do you think 15k+ in commission is feasible for a first year?  The other thing that makes me nervous is job security.  Where I’m at now, unless I screw up big time, I’ll always have a job.

Some backstory- this is my first job post-government. After ten years, my wife and I were ready for something different. So, I partnered with a recruiter who specialized in this transition. I had a few offers, but I ended up going with this company for their pay and geographical flexibility. 

I have been with the company just shy of two years, including a promotion afters six months. Two weeks ago, I applied for a promotion that I and my manager assumed I would be a shoo-in for. Fast forward to last week and, not only did I not get the promotion, I have been demoted and reduced in pay. Feedback from the interview was that I seemed distracted and lacked excitement. There have been no write-ups, documentation of poor performance, suspension, PIP, etc. As you can imagine, I'm frustrated, angry, and blindsided.

1bgxfvc,Wanting to stay at my job but ask to become a contractor,"So I am a Chief Financial Controller, not a CPA. (My company doesn't give out ""officer"" titles) I have 15 years of experience in accounting. I loved my job when I first started, it is remote, no one watches what you do, there are deadlines, and no one cared if you take a random Tuesday off with no notice, just get things done by the deadline, and you are golden. It started about 4 months ago, the owner started to ask me about urgent things last minute, and most these urgent things had something to do with me. Like ""I'm about to enter a meeting with a client and need xyz reports right now."" I would do it, but ask the office assistant/AP person when the meeting was scheduled, just to find out that he knew about the meeting for weeks and could have asked me without such tight time limits. Lots of examples like that. Lots if texts at 7am and 8/9pm asking for similar things.

Then he started asking me to do these really meaningless tasks that make the whole process harder and more complicated if I'm involved. Like for instance, he will tell me to call a client and ask why they haven't paid an invoice(even if it isn't due yet). I informed him I have an automated system in place where everyone gets an email from me 5 days before an invoice is due, reminding them of the balance, due date approaching, and asking if there are issues with the invoice that would cause them to not pay. Then another one goes out the day after it's late. He said I need to be texting and calling them regularly and I need to update him weekly. Here is the thing, if I call them, they normally always have a reason for not paying, but the company is in the construction industry and the customers have very advanced reasons for not paying something. I am not on the job site, and even if I was I wouldn't know what I am looking at, and when I talk to these people it's clear I have no understanding of their questions and just am taking notes down for the owner of the company and also the project manager of their project. And they will talk for up to an hour about their questions because I had no understanding so they'd have to explain really ""simple"" things to me for me to even take real notes. Then I will call the owner to update him, read back my notes. Then he will say ""oh call them back and tell them they are wrong."" And I'm like.... I can't do that, I don’t understand any of this, they want to talk to you or the PM, someone needs to explain why they are wrong. I never should call them, only the PM or owner understands their questions. I've become a glorified middle man. This has somehow become a large part of my job, and same deal, it's an ""emergency"" that this needs to happen all the time with no notice. Now I find myself checking my email and texts for messages from the owner 6am-9pm is when he will contact me about these ""emergencies"" and then I get embarrassed for not knowing I should have called someone about an invoice. There are so many of these middle man things, where it would take nearly no time for him, and really is not my job. 

Most recently I was in a meeting with the owner and CPA. The owner had reached out to the person who used to have my job, had them go over the year end numbers and come up with a standard financial report. They said our Net profit was 69k. The owner did not tell me he had asked them to do the report too. He also asked me to do it. I came up with 1.4m in net profit. In the meeting with the CPA he revealed he asked the old controller and she got to a different number than me and obviously she was right. The CPA looked shocked and could tell how awkward I felt, and said that he had already reviewed our books before the meeting and that I was correct, not her. Right after this meeting I felt good and thought things would change and I'd get respect. I was wrong. He sent me a link for a seminar coming up for people considering being accountants in the construction industry and asked if he should reserve a spot for me. Exactly zero times since working here has he found me to make an accounting error, WTF.

I'd like to continue aspects of my job, the ones I was originally hired for. Invoicing the clients (our invoices are not standard, they are very time intensive and require an insane amount of back up information) and to keep the accounting books clean and accurate. No more client contact, no more administrative work, I just want to be a 1099. I'm going to send him a letter today explaining this, and offering to do this for half my pay. (Which I think is a steal) I can do all of this in about 40/44 hours a month. These are the things the old controller also did exclusively, except she took way longer to do them because she'd have to go back and fix her errors which is very time consuming for the type of invoicing we use. 

I'm highly anticipating him saying no, giving me a very emotional call and pleas to not do this, and saying if I do, then I'll need to stay for months to train a new person. I feel terrible and like I'm buying a bridge which will destroy my resume.

My mum is a mental health nurse so she was the one who idk if I would say pressured but like

she would say u need to find a job that is secure and she would say look at x y z family member they did that and they don’t have a career now , you can do what you want on the side, my stepdad said the same thing


my gap year is over now and I did say I want to try working in mental health and I just kept on putting it off I didn’t want to do it the idea of starting work in that field was so daunting 

i wanted to travel so I went on a few holidays with my friends I wanted to make money because my job was really bad in school so I got another job but I didn’t even save that is my fault and now I’m starting to realise the importance of money  and saving even tho I was a earning less even saving £5 is important 


i didn’t gain any skills I was just going through an existential crisis for a whole year doing quizzes trying to figure out what I wanted to do  but w out doing anything 

I’m paying for an access course that helps me get the grades I want for uni and I can’t even bring myself to open the website 


i want to take another year and actually try different jobs work full time save do maths drive travel but on my own so I can gain some independence on navigating new areas learn my home language and learn how to do my own hair before I go to uni , I figured through the different jobs that I try I  could meet ppl gain nee experiences and hopefully figure out what I want to do 

I do see my parents point of view on job security and I understand but nursing  is mentally and physically draining I ahve many family members who are mental health nurses and there’s a lot that goes into it . I understand all jobs are hard and come with struggle but I want to be able to pick which struggle I’m willing to put up with in terms of career. I just want to find what I like in jobs what I would like to do in a day to day 


After working in retail I realised I don’t like constant customer interaction through trying new jobs like healthcare , call centres , maybe even working in a nursery I could figure out what I like maybe

‘My mum did tell me to try things a while  ago and I didn’t listen I was too scared and put everything off.


i want to take another year off and if by the end of the year I still don’t know what I want to do I will move to another city with the money I’ve saved and try new jobs there if I do not what I want to do I will apply for uni by the end of the year

There’s a big misconception in my family that I don’t want to go to uni when I really do i just don’t want to spend it doing something I don’t like even in the slightest or something I know I’m going to hate

IK alot of nursing jobs don’t have ti be on the ward but they require atleats a year of bedside experience and I don’t see myself doing that for a year 



my family hates the idea of me taking another year off and they see it as a waste of time and say I should just do nursing


I also have a cousin who went to do nursing said she hates it felt like she was going ti drop out and is looking for another job and wants to change career and never do nursing again , she said she fell into the Trap of listening to parents say ‘ just do it you will get good money and job security and you can do what u want on the side’ she said she’s too exhausted to do that

I guess I’ll never know until I try but nomatter what my parents say I still feel like this gap year will be good for me I will save loads try different things get maths learn skills I need and actually have a goal towards something that is possible for me and I will actually have direction which is something I didn’t really have before

1bgui2s,How do I find my path?,"I'm 21 in my 3rd year of uni, studying a 3 yrs bachelor in business management.
I've always liked the corporate world but I know a lot of careers in it are about IT, finance, accounting... and other technical skills.

I know I will incorrectly sound as a lazy person saying this but I don't really like to dive into details, also because I'm not good at it, if I work at something I cannot avoid looking at the big picture, I like a lot more thinking at the whole of something, could be a project or a company.

This is why, while studying, I'm also trying to launch some projects I have in mind, but obviously I have to face that doing startup has a high probability of failure, so for this reason and also for personal growth I decided to go mainly for a career in my first working years.

I'm not a dev but I studied a bit of IT both in high school and uni, I would never be able develop a software all by myself but I know basic/intermediate stuff and I know how to ""talk"" to people in IT.

Because of this I thought these careers (in IT or not): 
- Project management
- Consulting
- Maybe even sales also if I think there's less entry barriers so more competition but I could be wrong.

I'm Italian, and I know my english is not excellent now (maybe a high B2/C1) because I haven't trained it for years but I would consider also moving in us/uk/any other country where I can speak english and get some work experience.

Sure thing I'd love to work on something I like but obviously also money is a factor so with all of this said:

1. What master's degree would you recommend?

2. Do you think a career in IT can be pursued without having to be a engineer/knowing how to code?

3. What are some other careers I could take a look into?

4. If you know the Italian job market, should I consider moving or not? And why?

5. Any other tips you have for me?

I already see people mocking me in the comments, what can I say? we'll have a laugh together ahaha

1bgttj0,How to address process inconsistencies/favoritism in a nepotistic workplace?,"I’ll try to keep it short and vague. I’m in my 2nd year of work at a relatively small sales company, <100 employees. The structure has a handful of team leads and I primarily report to one in particular for day to day, but receive direction and am evaluated overall from a sales supervisor that oversees all team leads and their reports more broadly. 

Without getting too detailed, recently, there was a sale that became an internal conflict for my company as both myself and another employee at my company were working with the same client. In my job, this has happened to me twice before and I was provided clear direction from my sales supervisor for both myself and the other employee to proceed as cleanly as possible, and had no prior concerns from a process standpoint.

The reason I am posting is because this precedented process was not abided by for this most recent third occurrence, and in very tangible ways that I have documentation of, I was able to see the other employee was provided advantage over me from my company to close the sale, and they ultimately did.

My concern is that my supervisor is a relative (immediate family) of the employee that was favored to win the sale, and the other employee is a team lead with much more seniority than me, so I am struggling with how to approach my genuine concerns about what to expect for any future conflict that may occur, especially since they do happen infrequently. Previous process I thought I knew well was not abided by, and not only resulted in a loss for myself, but based on the negotiations of the sale for the other employee, it earned less revenue for my company than the sale would have if it had come through me, objectively.

Given that this would need to be discussed with my supervisor, how can I go about asking for this clarification without it coming across as bitter for losing and out of line for questioning why things played out how they did since it is their immediate family? Is it out of line to overstep my supervisor to their boss for clarification because of the clear conflict of interest of my supervisor setting rules that only their family can be the exception to?

TL;DR: how to ask my boss about inconsistent rule sets that favor their family over other employees and the company as a whole?",Any-Distribution8267,1,1.0,2,1710668746,2024-03-17 09:45:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bgttj0/how_to_address_process_inconsistenciesfavoritism/,3,2024
1bgt1f4,"Lost Job, Uncertain Career, Parenthood Dilemma: What Steps Should I Take?","Hey everyone, I'm new to Reddit and feeling a bit lost right now. I'm a woman in her late 30s who recently lost her job at her dream company a few months back. The industry is tough, and some colleagues were talking behind my back over small mistakes. It's cutthroat out there, with long hours, low pay, and networking being key to landing jobs. Freelancing hasn't been fruitful, and I'm even contemplating internships, though it feels awkward at my age.  
Friends suggest a career change, but I'm not ready for that. This job is my passion and identity. Losing it has left me drained, unable to relax without a new opportunity lined up. How can I re-enter a good company at my age? Networking seems daunting when I'm unemployed, and competition is fierce.  
On top of this, the decision to have children adds to my stress. My husband and I have always wanted kids, but my career love made timing tricky. Now, with the biological clock ticking, uncertainty about my career makes having a child feel daunting.  
I wish I could turn back time and make different choices. Seeing young, successful peers can be disheartening. My career has been a top priority, and now it's all up in the air. Have any of you faced similar challenges? Any advice or words of wisdom to share?

1bgrh0k,Need advice,"Good evening. I am a 20F working as an intern in a STEM industry. I never thought of myself as “pretty,” but I’ve been encountering a bit of sexual harassment at my internship. I guess I’ve gotten “prettier” because I decided to get braces, and comments about my appearance are typically made. In the beginning, I laughed off compliments or stated “thank you” or simply disagreed politely. However, this will be the mark of almost my third month there, and I would say something major was said that definitely impacted the way I see things.

For context, I am a Muslim, and I am fasting during Ramadan. I am not the best Muslim, but I make it known that I am waiting until marriage. On Monday (the presumed start date of Ramadan), my “boss” said, “would you sleep with me for money?” I laughed it off. But my heart dropped, and my face showed it. Another woman heard it. 

I guess I’m just tired. I’m so tired of being complimented on my physical appearance rather than my abilities. I have a bunch of hobbies (poetry, video essays, reading, learning), and I make it known. But little to no acknowledgement there. 

I know it’s not all men, but I’m terrified if this is going to be the rest of my life in STEM. I’m so hurt and disgusted and I keep blaming myself whenever I hear comments like this. It’s degrading, and I already went to HR for another sexual harassment issue (he would wait for an hour after his shift was over, asked about my sex life multiple times, suggest “teaching me” how to kiss, and say racist stuff). He ended up showing up on a day he doesn’t work, and he stared at my chest for 15 minutes. I told him he made me uncomfortable multiple times and started to ignore him. He thought I was 16 at first. A higher up in a different department saw our first meeting and felt uneasy for me. And now I think I’m known as an “HR girl.”

I feel so alone and suicidal. Most people assume I have multiple options, but I don’t care for male validation. Idk if my period is coming up which could result in my mood, but I’m still looking for help.",negatednight,1,1.0,0,1710658688,2024-03-17 06:58:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bgrh0k/need_advice/,3,2024

After graduating from a VFX program, I worked as a texture artist for a year before being laid off last year. Since then, I've been working on my portfolio, hoping to re-enter the industry soon. However, I'm uncertain about the feasibility of that happening. I recently moved to Toronto in search of more job opportunities.

1bgqf3i,Underpaid content writer ~ hirap makaipon. Need na ba maghanap ng better work?,"Hello everyone. I just want to ask for your advice kung paano ba ako makakapag-ipon. I am 31, single, breadwinner ng family. I currently work as a content writer sa isang BPO company. I earn 19,000 a month ~ wala pang bawas sa benefits. Malapit na po ako mag 1 year and iniisip ko if okay lang ba na magrequest for higher salary, since nagtetrain na din po ako ng new hire and gawa ko lahat from writing to graphics and editing. 

Last year, my adopted dogs got really sick so wala akong choice kundi ipaconfine sila. That time, I was still working freelance and sumasahod ng 32,000 monthly. Pero nung June 2023, bigla na lang kaming tinanggal. May iwan pa na 12,000 sa vet bills ng mga aso ko. And at first nakakabawas pa ako sa balance, pero now na sobrang mahal na ng mga bilihin, nagpatong patong na yung interest ng bill. 

Gustuhin ko man na isettle na isang bagsakan, wala namang matitira sa amin. Mahal ang kuryente at tubig sa city namin. Naglalakad na nga ako pauwi from work pero wala pa rin akong maipon. 😞 Right now, bumili ako ng food namin for 2 days and food ng mga dogs ko. Sa Wednesday pa ang payday and for sure wala na naman matitira.

Any advice po sa next step ko sa current job and pati na rin sa pag-iipon? Kahit pakonti konti na hindi ko magagalaw every month yung ipon ko sana. 🥹 Gusto ko din naman po maenjoy ang sahod na pinaghirapan ko. Salamat po sa mga magrereply. 🙏

1bgpvbs,Work Culture,"I am a electromechanical engineer tech in a hybrid process/quality engineer role. In general, I have turned around the department we're in. I've gained a lot of traction for the company and became internationally recognized at one point already. 

In reality to those praises, I'm exhausted. They have congratulated me for holding up a job meant for 5 people while I've been begging for help since I've been working there. I was promised help was coming and that HR is looking for a QE. In one of my meetings, after holding the fort for 8 months, my boss said ""help is not coming"" and it killed quite a bit of motivation out of me and the team. 
 I don't feel like I've learned about engineering at all either. I'm the dedicated firefighter 100% of the time. Being in absolute survivor mode to keep things functional, and then being plucked apart for the little things is burning me out. 

So to the point... we get into another major failure on the floor at the beginning of the year, and the changes that we need are delayed until the end of March. The boss has pushed the team to find another solution. Multiple people have told them that if there was another solution- we wouldn't have worked all of 2023 trying to get the new changes implemented in the process. I said sure; no harm in trying another approach anyways. I set up a DOE and there will have to be 11 different experiments done to pinpoint what we can try next.
 I got in trouble for trying to set the tasks up across 4 shifts since it's the weekend and no one will be able to analyze the data anyways until Tuesday. 
I understood that this was always going to be a urgent ordeal, but I debated that I would rather plan actions based on resources in a way that distributes responsibilities across the team to make it easy and stress free on everyone- and that we should hold slackers accountable if they're not picking up a much more simplified task. 
For some work load context: 
Supervisors: engineer ratio is 1:4. Supervisor: operator ratio is 1:30. 
It's quite the bottleneck for all projects so I try to keep a realistic flow going. 

The boss did not like my answer and he wanted the task to be done by the end of day by one supervisor. 
The supervisor has mentioned that they're ready to leave after 45 years because of how overwhelmed they are with the expectations now. Meanwhile, the new supervisors have a track record of putting off the tasks I assign them to and it ends up in the veteran's hands without fail. Because of all this, I may or may not have been out of line and told the boss to ""read the room.""

This led to a ""coaching.""
The way I'm taking things, big boss is wanting me to always say yes despite non realistic goals and to not be mind-to-mouth transparent... They said that I write and speak as if I'm journaling and that I don't need to do that.

Perhaps I'm bugging from the burnout or too blue collar for this, but what does the boss even mean by my journaling style of talking and writing? What other types of speech and talk is the big boss even talking about? 
Is it ok to lie and not be transparent to your boss if they tell you to be?
Is this type of expectations and leadership normal? What should I be doing? 
This is my first job as a engineer, so any insight from any other engineer or white collar would be greatly appreciated.

1bgpqep,I'm scheduled for both of my new jobs on Thursday and I don't know what to do,"Some necessary perspective:

&#x200B;

I quit my well-paying, but extremely stressful job in corrections last spring. The only job i've had since then was a seasonal position at UPS where I grossed about 800$. I unprecedentedly struggled to find work until finally getting 2 sets of interviews and 2 jobs.  Needless to say I've burned through my emergency fund and then some.   I'm also at the very beginning of an 8 month onboarding process for a federal corrections position that should be much better if I get it. I don't know if i'll make it through their process. 

&#x200B;

Last week I finished training for an ambulance company as a basic life support driver. It was amazing. The depot aka 2 ambulances in a nursing home parking lot are literally 2 blocks from my house.   3 12 hour shifts a week scheduled in a way that i'll get 7 days off in a row after working 6 out of 7 and opportunities to sit at sporting events and transport organs/bodies for overtime and and EMT training that i'll be able to start in the fall that'll gives a 4$ an hour raise once you become an EMT. i feel like this is an excellent current job for the fed and my work life balance. I'll be skirting by the margins of my budget in the interim, but I feel like this is the perfect job to work as a substitute teacher, which i've wanted to try for a few years.

&#x200B;

Monday, I start a position that pays a few dollars more than being an EMT doing some entry level surveying work for a utility company. Unfortunately, this is an hour from home, 6 days a week 8 hours a day. I own my home outright. Not sure how i'd handle moving since that seems to be the obvious thing to do.  The primary perk from this job is a new company truck for business and personal use. 

&#x200B;

As of now both employers think i'll be there Thursday.  Any tips on handling this amicably?  Suggestions on which job to take? This is one of the hardest decisions i've ever had to make.

 I want to try get a degree and start from there however am completely overwhelmed by the degree options and genuinely have no idea where the degrees can lead too. I don’t believe in these paid courses people do to ‘work for yourself’ so no suggestions like that lol

I don’t really like animals (allergic), I love art and creativity, I like fashion & interior design but I’m not very good at it, I enjoy sitting at a desk but also enjoy being up and moving, I enjoy sales and making money but only if I’m confident in what I’m selling. I do have anxiety but try not to let this effect my work life, I love an early start job (8-4 kinda thing)

My questions for you is
1. what degree would be good to go into if you are struggling to know what to do in life?
2. If you love your job, what job do you do and how did you get there? ",Haunting_Radish_1480,4,1.0,4,1710647491,2024-03-17 03:51:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bgoekh/best_degrees_to_do_when_you_dont_know_what_to_do/,3,2024
1bgo8cb,About to get laid off. Please give thoughts on my approach.,"Getting laid off soon - is this a realistic approach?

Here is the scoop. I am going to get laid off or fired in the next few weeks. My manager confirmed it recently in a 1:1 and how I perform on these tasks (this company doesn’t PiP but this sounds like it) will determine which way the wind blows.

I went on paternity leave last quarter. My manager is new and didn’t tell me I missed a procedural step so my paternity never really started. I literally just disappeared for 12 weeks (HR POV) despite my manager knowing I am out and my org aware of it.  I updated my outgoing email to say I’m out on pat leave, has my slack updated, and even gave a date of return.

I get back into the office after 12 weeks and my manager tells me I didn’t follow procedure. Now the company wants about 10k of “overpay” back because I technicality wasn’t on leave.

On top of that, my job is legally protected in CA and since I’ve been back it has been clear I’m moving toward a lay off (e.g. working at 15% capacity, looking for jobs to jump into, bad performance reviews despite only working 2 weeks…).

So here I am. Getting laid off soon.

An employment lawyer believes I have a case. But the letter for repayment  just got to me yesterday so now I need to send that to him.

I have two meetings this week - HR and my manager. Please give feedback on my approach:

HR
I’m going to throw my manager under the bus. They didn’t tell me I missed procedure. I literally had no clue until 12 weeks of pat leave were over and now I’ve petitioned the state to reconsider the leave and give me FMLA. I’ll share all this with HR but I am putting the ownership on her because I did everything I thought I was supposed to do and she didn’t say otherwise… for 12 weeks.

Manager
I’m going to ask her to lay me off. I don’t want to keep working for projects I’ll never see and I’d rather take my time finding a new job rather than split time between BS work and job hunt.

What they don’t know is I have an offer for a 45% pay raise and significantly more money but I’m not going to share all that. 

Goal - are these realistic?
I want to negotiate my severance package, I want my quarterly RSUs for June (50k), and I want X number of months they give employees pay and healthcare that have been employed for 4 years at the company.

Am I crazy to approach them like this? I’m taking action Tuesday so please walk me off the edge or give input.",No_Guess3275,14,1.0,28,1710646907,2024-03-17 03:41:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bgo8cb/about_to_get_laid_off_please_give_thoughts_on_my/,3,2024
1bgnmwn,"A simple request, can we stop recommending ""the trades"" to people and be more specific?","Mass layoffs of family supporting jobs continue.  In place, our government is counting the 2, 3, 4 gig, temp, and contract jobs you can work, where all combined will not replace your income, support your family, afford you to buy a home, or much less save for inevitable retirement years, when you may be more than willing to work, but not able or simply not desired by corporations.

So, people are getting desperate, and they're looking everywhere for advice, and the parrots chirp loudly the same message from on high, over and over and over.  ""the trades"" are in demand, ""you can make money in the trades"", but we rarely get the specific details and career paths that lead to these proclaimed lucrative jobs.   For example, the path to becoming a doctor is well defined, and a long one, and the pay is great when achieved.  The path to becoming an aerospace engineer, also quite challenging, but clear, and like many other challenging and expensive paths to these jobs, not all can do it, and so the supply is relatively low and the demand is high, and the pay reflects this economy.  

If (broad hand waving gesture towards) ""the trades"" is such an easy and fast entry, it stands to reason that ""the trades"" can rapidly gain ever how many workers they need, and the pay will not be great and likely not even enough.  BUT, it sure works out well for big businesses to push this message, to saturate the market, to drive wages down.  However, if you don't think that is what it is all about, and you truly believe ""the trades"" lead to prosperity, addressing all the needs of adults, often adults with families, children and even parents to support, and a desire to not work till the day their body fails completely, and thus need to save for retirement, even if you truly believe the trades address these needs, then be specific.  Give us the clear path, the concrete numbers, the specific market you serve.  Till I see those details, I think we're doing an injustice to those who are desperate for how fix their situation right now, quickly, but also an injustice to the next generation of young workers, to help them avoid trappings that we ALL know exist in various career paths, whether that be glass ceilings or stupid high training costs, or ridiculous tuition cost for degrees with no demand.",agreeablederivative,3,1.0,1,1710645023,2024-03-17 03:10:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bgnmwn/a_simple_request_can_we_stop_recommending_the/,3,2024
1bgmbt2,Stuck--Advice Wanted,"I'll be done with with graduate school to become a therapist at the beginning of May and I'm trying to figure out where to go next. I've got a job offer in another state and recently checked out the area for the first time. While there are some things I like, I couldn't shake the feeling that the city felt a bit ""dead."" Since the pandemic, there's been an increase in crime rates around, and strict safety rules have pushed some people and businesses away. To be fair, my visit was during the week when it was cold, so I didn't see much happening outdoors. Towards the end, the weather got better, and I saw a bit of the city's energy. I feel as though I didn't feel swayed one way or the other on whether to take the offer and move to this city.  
So now, I'm stuck because there's another state/city I'm considering where I have friends and family. I'd rather live there, but the job market isn't great, and the pay is much lower compared to the offer I have. Plus, this city has a VHCOL compared to where the job offer is which is HCOL.  
I'm struggling to decide if I should move to the state I really want to be in long-term and hope I can find a job, even if it pays poorly and I have to wait a while to get licensed. Is it worth it to move there to try and establish roots in the community and just suck it up that I'll be really poor for the next few years? Or should I take the offer I have, make good money, save up, and then try to move to the other state later?

1bglwxm,Colleague feedback?! To the Boss (their friend),"I have a colleague who I would consider one of my work besties and who is also very good friends with our boss, they holiday today. This coworker has in the last couple of years increased her success within the company greatly, with a $35k pay increase and a promotion into a management position surpassing me, with what I believe is with my help. Two years ago she was going through a marriage breakdown and needed to increase her income. I wrote the email she sent to our boss asking for a pay rise and she got one. A few months later a postions became available that would help develop her skills I told her to go for and talked her through how to approach the asking for the roll. She got it and it lead to another pay rise. She was then promoted into a management role within the space ( I role I had asked for years earlier and was told that the company didn’t need) she received another pay rise. Since being in the role she does nothing be complain about task that is actually part of her role and has displayed terrible management skills. I am actually training one of her team members AND I get about 20 emails a weeks from her asking how to do something or how to fix issues etc. 

Recently, whilst another team member is on mat leave I have had to pickup additional tasks and was given a temp pay increase until their return. My colleague was also given the SAME increase as me and has not taken on any additional task to date and when and if she does it’s only one task.

My question is how do I bring this up to my boss (her friend)? She is clearly being looked after and I want my boss to know it’s all me in the background and she is reaping the rewards.

1bglpzo,Is this fair?,"Over a year ago I (23F) applied for a job that was advertised as hybrid. 2 months into me working there management was changed and I was put under new management. My new manager during 2023 advised that I am not allowed to work from home. 

See, this wouldn’t be an issue if half of my team is working from home and I need to commute everyday to the office. We have a small team and I’ve been noticed as one of the hardest working people on my team (winning awards for this at work.) I recently told my manager in person the toll it’s taken on my mental health not being able to have a day or two to wfh (working from home would give me a day or two of breathing room from all the requests I get in person.) and he just reiterated that we are short staffed. Now to give you an example of the times I’ve felt taken advantage of by my manager which was:

I came into the office at 8:30 and left at 4:30 while he was still there. We get paid for 7.5 hours. I told him I was leaving because I came in super early to do a client meeting and he just waved me out. Then on our next 1:1 he mentioned to me that I need to standardize my time because a user came in asking him for help right after I left. KEEP in mind my other coworkers working times are 8:30-4:00. He went on to mention I need to be the one who works 9:00-5:00. This depresses me because it’s a 1.2hr commute so not only do I waste 2.4 hours getting to and from the office, I can’t even leave slightly early to enjoy the sunlight. 

Another scenario is : A person on my team left for mat leave for 18 months, came back and immediately got to wfh. Her excuse was that she has no one to take care of her baby. That’s not an excuse she’s been riding this excuse for 8 months and my manager does nothing about it.

Do you have any advice for me?

TLDR; I’m very heavily relied on in the office and I’m always booked to the brim the minute I come in. I’ve told my manager in person that me having a day or two to wfh could really improve my mental health and he brushed it off meanwhile 90% of my team wfh!",Murky_Journalist3252,1,1.0,9,1710639088,2024-03-17 01:31:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bglpzo/is_this_fair/,3,2024

In the beginning of my cna job I used to work 12 hours 4 days but it affected my health and my mental health so I went to two days 12 hours. I started seeking a part-time job and found one at chipotle and now I'm debating if I should leave my first job. There's lots of reasons why I think I should but the pay is good but I don't think my mental health and overall physical health is worth all the stress.

Cons: 12 hours, no work life balance only have 1 hour after shift ends to shower eat and spend time with my husband and alone time.

1bgkcda,This is big… for me at least,"Context: up here in Maine, wages across the board seem to be very low. After college with a useless business degree, I was able to get by with an internship and per diem position. Probably grossed around 24k for a year (lived in an apartment with 2 roommates). Internship ended, and I kept the per diem job, eventually landing a full time job at the same facility (allowed me to earn overtime despite traveling to different site). I did both for a while, grossed around 51k. After a couple years bought a house up north that would inevitably cause me to quit the per diem job since the extra pay vs. gas evened out. I only did this because my full time manager let me work OT for a while.

Fast forward, full time job’s manager strips my OT due to “budgeting crisis”. (I was making the base salary of their position FYI). 

My income was no longer sustainable. Our mortgage, bills, and car payments were fine as long as I had a second job or overtime. Girlfriend picked up my slack for a long time. I applied for everything under the sun. 100s of applications to entry level positions, call center jobs, remote chat agent jobs, everything remotely close to what I had experience in.

Silence for nearly a year (aside from one job that offered BELOW my desired/required salary… which was just 40k. I received NO OTHER callbacks).  For a long time I was convinced that I not only would never be able make 40-50k ever again… but that I may actually never get a new job/second job.

Fast forward again… 
A construction company responded to my application…. To which I had no memory of applying to. A local place, one I never heard of and I initially questioned their validity. Lo and behold, they are very much real. I went in for a physical interview, got a job offer.. and my god. They would like to offer me DOUBLE my salary. 

They want someone with no experience so they can raise them under their wing and eventually grow into a high up role. Admin side has maybe 12 employees, construction guys maybe 40. Very low turnover rate. Newest coworker has been there 3 years, the rest have been more than a decade. Benefits are typical. They seem to have no problem finding projects and increasing profit, but don’t have much desire to grow into a massive team. They have generous bonuses 2 times a year, spend a lot of money on.. food. Their software does seem to be outdated 

I of course accepted. Any red flags? 

Extra context: my experience is strictly data analyst and coding for hospitals. Per diem job was a housekeeping role for the same hospital. Don’t know anything about construction.

After this semester, I only have one 12 credit hours left. However, I'm completely exhausted with school, I struggle a lot with mental health so this semester has been rough so far. Also, I've recently decided I don't want to go into an environmental field. I originally planned on becoming a wildlife biologist but decided that I want something more stable and that doesn't require a masters degree.

1bgeyfa,"my client on Upwork sexually harassed me, how do i go about quitting?","⚠️TW⚠️

hi i’m 25F. i only joined Upwork on last february. on Feb 28, i gained the “rising talent” badge. but i received an invitation from this particular client on Feb 22. on the job posting, it says that he was looking for a VA to whom he can read guided visualization hypnosis scripts and that it was invite-only. (more info in the photos attached)

at first of course i found it weird and i was hesitant (especially since i came across other multiple scams, but i was able to realize it immediately unlike this one). but after the initial interview and demo/sample reading, i felt like it’s safe and easy enough. since i knew some info about hypnosis (mostly the psychological aspect) and upon careful research, i accepted the offer after much consideration. plus, of course i also did a background check on my client. 

client resides in the US but is originally from China. he said that he works as a (software?) engineer. he’s been on Upwork since Oct 2022. he has 2 reviews so far, one Romanian girl (verified, has $3K+ earnings and has 2 jobs in progress) and another Filipina (verified, no longer active, only has this particular client in her work history).

he asked that we meet on weekends (usually 1-3AM PHT, which was afternoon for him) the first thing he told me was to put in an hour on the timesheet for the duration the interview/demo took. we always met on Zoom. up until tonight, we only have an accumulated 5 hours, for a total of ~$57 (minus 10%). 

in our first few meetings, he always makes small talk before and after the read through, but nothing too personal. he asks about my professional background, preferences and even about the PH. while the hypnosis visualizations seemed normal—like the usual hypnosis scripts i heard based on my research. 

but looking back, i was uncomfortable whenever he called me by my name and used phrases that pertained to touching me. at first, he only said “feel me touching your nose.” but in the later meetings, he used phrases like, “feel me stroking your lips/thighs/chest,” “when i count to 3, you will feel pleasure” (at first it was happiness but it changed to pleasure), “feel your feminine energy” etc.

tonight, i was hypnotized to laugh. but i felt like a bucket of iced water was poured down on me when he suddenly said “now feel pleasure, and then make sounds of pleasure” and what triggered me most was when he repeatedly said, “i want you to moan/groan for me” while calling out my name. 

i said no multiple times. i didn’t do it—not even once. i felt panicked but i still acted professional as much as possible. he ended the meeting after a while. quite abruptly and awkwardly i think. he usually initiates small talk after the read through. and he was evidently hiding his face with his hands. 

the only thing is, i have no recording of these meetings. he’s also my first client and i don’t think i can afford a bad review. based on my research, Upwork doesn’t have the best customer service. i’m worried it might happen again to someone else, but at the same time i can’t risk tainting my Upwork profile, or my only source of financial security right now.  i feel rattled but i need to act smart about this. one thing i’m sure of is: i wish to quit. 

i need to hear your thoughts and some advice on the ff:

- how would you advice me to go about quitting?

- would reporting him hold me at a disadvantage? is it worth the risk?

- what would most likely and possibly happen if i report him?

- i know that there are many misconceptions surrounding hypnosis and it’s highly likely that no one else would be interested in his job postings, but is there any way i could help other Upwork freelancers to avoid this client?

note: please be advised to avoid insensitivity as much as possible. i’m only trying my best to handle this and sadly i’ve been sexually haraassed more times than i could even admit, both online and in real life. this may not be new to me, but i still feel sick to the stomach. thank you for empathizing and understanding, as always.

1bgd0gw,BS in Information Science or Artificial Intelligence?,"I'm 40, so I'm a little behind. I'll be finishing up my Associates this May, and am planning to transfer to university to pursue a Bachelors. My goal is to get into User Experience Design or work with AI in some capacity. I think jobs are about to get a lot harder to find as AI continues to advance.

The university I'm looking at (University of TN, Knoxville) has 2 BS offerings which I'm torn between:

1. **Information Science - Applied Data Analytics & User Experience**
2. **Applied Artificial Intelligence**

The IS one is fully online, while the AI one will have more in-person, but may have some online. Neither requires high-level math or previous programming experience.

**Do you think recruiters would be offput by the AI degree? Is it foolish to specialize like that at the Bachelors level?** 

The main reason I'm pulled more toward the AI option is because I find it genuinely fascinating, and it really seems like the way of the future. However, I've heard you're supposed to be more general with your Bachelors, then specialize with a Masters. Considering my age, I'm not sure if I'll go for a Masters.

**Here are some of the core classes offered in the AI program:**

Natural Language Based Programming Techniques  
AI, Ethics, and Legal Frameworks  
Human-AI Interaction and Experience Design  
Natural Language Processing and Conversational AI  
AI-Based Data Handling and Visualization  
Internship  
Research Project in AI  
Interdisciplinary Capstone  
Exploring the World of AI

**And here are some classes in the IS program:**

Foundations of Information Sciences  
Programming for Information Applications  
User-Centered Design  
Information Management in Organizations  
Database Design   
Foundations of User Experience  
Usability Testing and Methods

1bgclae,Guidance with what to study to help career prospects,"Hi all. 

I am currently working as an insurance consultant in the UK for one of the biggest banking groups. I am at the bottom of the ladder and want to move up as quickly as possible into a high paying position. 

A little background. I worked in manufacturing from age 18 till 18 months ago, I'm now 32. I consistently missed out on promotion roles during my time in manufacturing and heard many excuses such as, we see you as a future manager, and, we can't lose you in your current role. I moved around a few places during that time and heard the same thing. Several years ago I was diagnosed with a neurological condition that classes as a disability and over time it meant I found my role in precision manufacturing untenable. 

I managed to get my foot in the door for my current role and have been doing well, although promotional positions seem sparce. There is scope to move sideways before moving up but it's waiting for an opportunity and then getting it. 

I want to make sure I am in the best possible position and am looking at qualifications /degrees to help me be the best candidate and progress fast. 

Currently I am looking at a couple of degrees, and want to be studying something I enjoy not just something that will get me ahead. I don't necessarily have to stay in insurance/finance/banking. 

The two degrees I have been looking at are a degree in physics (which from what I can see would have many transferable skills, and also something I'm interested in)or economics which while less interesting to me still holds some interest and may be more applicable. 

I wanted to see what reddit thought and if there was any other suggestions or advice. At the age I am with a young family I need/want to make sure I can support and provide the best I can financially as it isn't something I had growing up and also set us all up for a better future, whatever the cost. 

Tldr; I am looking to advance career wise and need advice for what to study, qualifications and degrees that can earn well and support me in growing inside my current insurance role or outside it.

I’ve built full stack production apps. Now, much of my learning for that is learning new frameworks and learning about designing architecture that can scale well. 

I’m wondering if I should continue improving those skills or add some “machine learning skills.” 

By machine learning and AI, I guess I’m talking about creating models and stuff I’m seeing with python. 

On one hand, it’s probably a good idea to be really awesome at something like web dev instead of just good. 

On the other, I’m not sure if that’d give me lower marginal opportunities than learning machine learning. ML would give me an additional skill that seems like it’d be hot for employers - and few devs will have those skills than web dev skills - but not sure if the demand is there and what the skill floor would be.

At baseline he will do nothing.  If it’s extremely busy or you outright ask him to please work he will do the immediate task and stop working again.

I’ve been direct about it several times and he’s just kinda unapologetic about it.  Not in a confrontational way, he just matter-of-factly says he wants to do the bare minimum.  He thinks of himself as “extra” or the “guy that does stuff when it’s busy” even though we do the same thing.

I spend most of the day resentful and pissed off.  It’s not worth going above him because we have a good job and it’s not worth putting our group as a whole under a microscope.

I know the “correct” thing to do is just continue to ignore it.  That it will just eat me up inside and I shouldn’t try to control it, but it’s been affecting me more and more.

1bgans1,Where do I go in this grad school/career crossroads?,"This might be a long post, so I understand if not many read this. This is a throwaway account.  
Basically, physics Ph.D. applications didn't go exactly as planned. I'll try to be vague, but I attend a public school ranked in the top 50 physics universities in the U.S., towards the upper end. I personally felt that I worked very hard in undergrad, I studied a lot and kept my GPA right around my goal of a 3.8, worked as an undergrad researcher since the beginning of my sophomore year which resulted in some presentations at my university, and spent two summers at a national lab where I was published in a sub-journal (if that's the right term) of a very well known journal, as well as some other miscellaneous conference papers/abstracts. My recommenders knew me well and were, as far as I know, very complimentary. I must note that I did not take the general or physics GRE. However, all that apparently was not enough. When applying to Ph.D.s, I reapplied to my home institution and the rest were applications to schools in the top 15 just hoping one would stick. I was accepted to my home institution, but rejected from all other schools. I was especially disappointed in a rejection from a public school in the top 10 for my chosen subfield, since I was able to tour a lab there and meet the current grad students. I don't want to make any excuses for myself, but I think I was just unaware how well qualified my competition was, and how hard it is to break into these schools when coming from outside the top 15. The smartest kid in my graduating class was rejected from most of the the top schools he applied to as well, and he is genuinely the smartest person I've ever met, even more so than the people I know who ended up going to top 10s for undergrad. All this is making me question what to do next. I'll try to say this without sounding arrogant, but I feel like a very well rounded person, in that I have many hobbies, friends, and things outside of physics that make me who I am, but all these rejections are for the first time in my life making me question how far I can make it. It's just weird as well since none of the individual rejections hit me hard, if it all, they were all just kind of like ""damn another one"", it's just the totality of them all is getting to me.  
The thing is, I really don't NEED to go to a great school to get the jobs I want in industry or the government. As of now, I want to continue with physics research as a career, but I certainly don't want to work as a professor or somewhere that requires me going to a top 15 school. I think the thing is I'm very competitive and wanted to be among ""the best"" at what I do, and this process is making me feel as if I'm being told I'm not, and looking at these grad admissions forums and seeing other's results are certainly not helping.  
My dream career is working as a physics or applied physics researcher in industry. But after this process, I'm questioning it. Doing research these past few years has taught me that most of the enjoyment I get from research is the actual process, i.e., the programming (especially ML), experimentation, etc., rather than the results at the end. Granted, my research has been in topics I'm not too into, but it has opened my eye to other career paths like data science, engineering, etc. Plus, I'm really not sure if I want to spend another 4+ years in my college town. I really want to enjoy my early-mid 20s, and I'm not sure how many opportunities I'll have to do that in my college town.  
This is all to say, I'm basically at a crossroads here and am unsure of what to do. I'm definitely not going to wait a year and reapply with a GRE score, since I'm not sure that would change anything. I've decided I'm going to take the offer at my school, but I'm strongly considering mastering out. I just don't know how marketable my physics masters would be to physics adjacent jobs like the ones I've mentioned. I also could commit and see if I can just do my Ph.D. as fast as possible, maybe <5 years if I'm lucky. I think I'm just looking for guidance or seeing what other people have done in circumstances similar to mine. It's just a little dejecting when my friends are are getting into good masters programs, finding good jobs, and I feel as if I under-performed, even though I should probably be thankful I made it into a relatively high ranked Ph.D. program at all. I really appreciate it if you've read this far.

1bga2x0,My boss is constantly threatening my job and harrassing me ,"Im an employee at a large company in AB canada that is kind of union but not at the same time. We have our own association. I am a solid employee that has never missed a due date, never been written up etc and dont break rules

Story is as follows, pretty much one of my higher ups has been constantly poking and prodding me about every little thing i do. I cannot use the washroom without hearing about it and how long my bathroom breaks are (10-15ish minutes) with travel to and from washroom  , and i am someone who struggles badly with ibs and stomach health and he knows i struggle. 

It started off fine and i just laughed it off as teasing but its got to the point of borderline harrassment. He says he says it as a ""joke"", but then ill joke back and then suddenly i ""have an attitude"" and my job is being threatened. 

Another recent time he was blaming me for something another employee did, i had proof it wasnt me and that it was him yet he ignored everything i said and still sided with the guy lying with no proof. I got upset and just walked away visably upset. That resulted in him driving up to me laughing his ass off saying hes just bugging me. 

I ended up up apologizing for getting upset but that i didnt like him grilling me for something i didnt do when i had proof it wasnt me and it was the guy he sided with, he just told me he is just messing with me for a reaction (which i have proof of him saying) and then started defending himself for siding with the guy in the wrong.

I sent him a message explaining how i am sorry for getting upset over his banter, and how im in an extremely low spot in my life and am walking on egg shells with my mental health and well being so i just cant take the constant comments i recieve. I also added that he knows he wants a reaction out of me but every time i give him any sort of reaction he threatens me, so id like it to stop.

His reply was along the lines of (way to make me feel like shit. Sorry i cant relate to how you feel, dont hurt yourself, and if you think your job is so hard blah blah blah we can transfer you to a different place.

I cant transfer and i rely on this job a lot. I sont know why im being targeted but i dont feel like any of this is right. I dont feel like i should be able to be threatened with my job every day, when im being hounded until i say anything. 

What can i do?

I think it's important to mention, while I do value financial security, it is not an important deciding factor. Heck, I think I could be comfortable if I knew I'd make $50k a year as long as I could find fulfillment in work.

If you've had a similar issue, I'd love to hear your experience and any suggestions on great fields to consider!",KilluminatiThugLife,1,1.0,0,1710602162,2024-03-16 15:16:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bg8c6p/recommend_me_a_career_field/,3,2024
1bg8c4z,Sudden redundancies at work & toxic culture change - should I look to leave?,"I work for the UK branch of a company that also has a large U.S. presence, and recently underwent major changes in the form of a complete rebrand/takeover. The whole thing is a bit of a mess, the company culture has gone from being quite British/European (flexible, never really any layoffs, most staff stay there for decades, highly respected within the industry) to extremely American and corporate/toxic. The new exec team seem to spend more time implementing random “organisational changes” and rebranding different teams than actually doing anything useful. The CEO has literally *promised* no redundancies several times now and then suddenly whole teams have been axed with no warning. The current MO seems to be: buying profitable small businesses, then laying off 90% of their workforce. The executive team has also had more people suddenly step down than I can count. My unit had been fine and seemed to be doing well (making profit, ticking on as it has been for the last 50+ years before this takeover) but the other day, several of my US colleagues were suddenly laid off. Those who lost their jobs had all been with the company for a couple of decades or more each and I’m honestly not sure how the business will function without them. If they cut the same positions in the UK, both my manager and my manager’s manager would be gone. It would basically leave me as one of the most senior members of staff, which would be absurd as I have only a few years experience. I’m also even more terrified that I will get made redundant - given the US layoffs, it doesn’t seem like choices have been made on performance or merit as it’s some of the most successful, long-standing staff members who have been let go.   
I’m also panicking as what I do is very niche (I’ve never *not* been offered a job that I’ve got an interview for, but equally, suitable roles are few and far between). There’s really no roles going elsewhere atm unless I made a career change which would come with a salary cut. I don’t want to say what I do as I would make myself identifiable.   
I think it’s incredibly cruel that they’ve laid off people who have been at the company for most of their careers and will likely find it difficult to be rehired. I love my job and my team, and I think I’m good at my job (I’ve always had very positive feedback), but I feel so anxious about potentially being made redundant that I’m struggling to focus/sleep. The company has given no reasons as to why people have been let go, and have made no efforts to relocate them within the firm. Also, they just announced the best year of growth yet from the specific team where people have been let go, so it makes 0 sense to me that they would make redundancies now.  
As I’m based in the UK, I probably have a bit more protection than my US colleagues, and I’m hoping that I would be able to question (legally) why they would make job cuts right after announcing the past year had such high profit/growth from my team specifically. But also, maybe I should just start making plans to leave - I don’t have any interest in working for a company that treats its employees so poorly. Any advice would be VERY welcome.

1bg87sh,I need advice ,"I need advice 

I (20f, living in South Africa ) need some advice. Some information about me, I graduated high school in 2022 with an 85% average, I got accepted to mechatronics engineering by a great university . Lots of shit happen in life but long story short- I haven’t been able to go to uni for the last 2 years and I might still not be able to go next year. I’m constantly anxious because I feel like my life is being wasted working part time  jobs while all my friends are able to go to university.  I don’t want another year to go to waste, I’d like to do a course online that will benefit me. I’ve seen so many videos about online work/free courses online/google free courses but I don’t know where to start or who to believe. Now to get to the point I’d like advice from  personal experiences about this. Have you or anyone close to you done a free/cheap course online that benefited you. The course shouldn’t be too long (up to a year). The course should help me find online work.  I don’t care what to type of course it is-I’m open to learning and trying. I’ve done a 140 TEFL course already and applied to cambly today but I’m not having too much hope in that (I’ve been tutoring students for the last two years subjects like economics,mathematics, computer application technology and English)

So anyways I’m open to any suggestions-please advice

1bg7ygc,Big bank to boutique investment firm at 24? $8K raise,"I currently work at a large traditional institution doing communications work for an Engineering team. I am paid ridiculously well (~$142k base), but I don’t like working for the big man, I don’t like the hybrid model and I don’t desire a career there in the long term.

I have been recruited to join a boutique investment firm by one of my old bosses (whom I very much appreciate and trust) and they have offered me a Director position on their sales team. The TC is $200k with base of $150k and $50k bonus during the year. I am 24 so to be offered a Director position feels nuts. The role is remote. The company is ~30 people in size. They’re doing good business with high ticket transactions as far as I can assess. Benefits are comparable outside of new firm doesn’t offer a match to my 401k contributions.

I am going to take the offer. But I am SICK with guilt at leaving my current company, so much so that I am making this Reddit post to hear some other opinions. The team at my current job likes me well enough and I am a valuable contributor. I have only worked with them for ~7 months and we are in the middle of a large transformation. I was also recruited to come do this work by another of my former bosses and when I interviewed he asked me to stay for at least two years. And lastly they have just given me a big raise to $143k in the last two months from $115k.

I have worked in sales before (tech sales) and I was very successful and know that I can be very successful in this new role, so that’s not a problem. But I am asking for some words of wisdom - I feel I cannot even enjoy my weekend because I feel so sick that I have to tell them soon that I am leaving for somewhere else. Please help

Also if anyone works in financial product sales - how do you like it? Are you making good money?

1bg7kcp,Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"Hey folks,  
  
Throwaway account here. So here's the deal. I've got a background in marketing, but for the past two years, I've been working in data engineering. It's been quite the journey. I've got this incredible tech lead who's been a mentor to me, and I swear, I learn something new from him every single day. I've tackled big, complex projects and managed to deliver each time. Funny thing is, I didn't go through formal training for this gig; everything I know, I've picked up through hands-on experience and, of course, good ol' Google.  
  
So, I recently updated my LinkedIn to reflect my current role as a Data Engineer and recruiters started flooding my inbox with messages. Now, here's where I'm torn. I actually enjoy what I do right now, plus having such an amazing mentor is priceless. But on the other hand  I know I'm underpaid for the work I do, and I'm currently in the process of buying a house alone, having a stable job seems like a smart move.  
  
The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm ready to take the leap just yet. I still rely on my mentor for important decisions, and the idea of flying solo is a bit daunting. Any advice on what I should do, especially considering the whole house-buying situation? Would love to hear your thoughts.

1bg7bcz,Boss wants me gone ? Advice needed ,"
So for context, I’m in a client facing role in a professional setting. Will be 2 years in this company this May 24.

1. Had my performance review last August 23 - boss said I was doing fine and everything’s good from my end. Even asked me to give trainings to other teams / juniors. I expected a raise and promotion given that he didn’t flag any negatives to me.

2. Promotion result came out - I was the only who didn’t get a promotion in the team. Of course, I was disappointed and felt super left out.

3. Had a chat over lunch with my boss to get the reasons why - he attributed it to poor market conditions, which to me felt disingenuous. I pressed on further and boss then mentioned I wasn’t generating enough revenue. Which came as a complete shock - because I wasn’t told there was a target to be met, nor was this communicated to me during performance review. 

4. He then asked me to double my current revenue (say it’s now USD 2 mil, he wants me to up this to USD 4 mil) if I want to get a promotion this year - this requirement / rule wasn’t imposed to anyone else (checked with my other colleagues).

5. Fast forward, I just did my usual day to day work since then till now. From February onwards, he’s been extremely difficult with me and been really pushing my limits to the maximum.

 (E.g. - he has been giving me very short deadlines to complete the work / my work done was just chucked aside / he completely ignores what I have to say / nit picking at me and at some point was very rude to my face. There was an instance where he shouted at me but he later said he overreacted) - just some examples to share.

Question is :

1. Am i overthinking this ?
2. It seems to me he wants me out ?
3. No future at this company?

I am trying to hold on as long as I can until I get another job- but I feel boss is going to make my life more difficult in the coming months. 

Any advice on how you would handle this situation? Appreciate it! Many many thanks.

1bg6gl3,Need advice on whether or not to accept job offer,"Hey all! I could use some help/career advice. Back at the beginning of February I decided I wanted to take a sabbatical after getting severely burnt out working at a start up with a really difficult boss. 

I’ve been soft applying to jobs/putting my feelers out in the market. Out of the blue a competitor reached out to me. Their CCO specifically asked HR to contact me for an AE role. Here are some of the specifics: 

- I would be taking over the best patch/territory in the US
- I’m in the Midwest and they want me traveling to NYC for customer meetings and events once a month
- they’re offering me the same pay and salary which is at the top bracket based on my experience 
- the hiring manager previously came from my last employer - has a good reputation and is aware of the challenges I’ve endured

My concerns: 

- the reason I’d have the largest and best territory is because last year the entire sales team was reorged and let go
- certain support needed for brand awareness and for enterprise reps to be successful doesn’t exist yet 
- they sent me an offer letter but not the compensation plan 
- traveling to NYC would be a lot once a month and can only imagine the frequency increasing once a book of clientele is established 
- poor PTO structure - 10 days a year which is very low 


I’m not hurting for money. I could easily go another year without working. I had connected with someone through my network earlier last month for a role he’s hiring for in July. It would be a lot less travel, slightly less on the base salary, but 4 weeks of PTO and very attainable quotas.

Could use some help/perspective.

1bg5w4v,Advice on Career/ Education for INFP?,"Hello Everyone! I am a 26 yr old M looking to go back for post secondary education in Canada to get into a stable career and field I like. I have researched lot on the internet and I have gone back to drawing board to map my mind to find the perfect fit or degree but I know that a perfect degree won't exist that will tick everything. 
However I am looking for some advice and I can share some things about myself and I would really appreciate any helpful advice and insights.

I love reading books and listening to podcasts about human behavior, psychology, history, architecture, design, sounds. I love to find interesting stories of day to day things, places etc. I love being imaginative and creative and finding new and creative ways of doing things.

I don't like chemistry at all. I am okay with Maths and Physics. I am absolutely fascinated by software specifically designing and how it works.

I don't like jobs that involve sales or any related sales target and don't wish to pursue any trades.

Following are the degrees/fields I have researched on and my genuine feedbacks - ( I have researched online, talked with students and current employees in the field)

Counseling/Therapist - Love this field and career. I would have to do 4yrs of UG and then gain some experience to get into 2yr Masters and then certification. It will atleast take 6-7 yrs. Cannot devote that much time 

Teaching - Always wanted to be a teacher but the current situation of education system in Canada and how teachers are being treated in Canada. I would love to prevent it unless something drastic happens to make situation better for teaching in this country.

Software Engineering - Most balanced and safe bet. Technology Job market is rough right now so that scares me a bit. But still it is in one of top spots in all of my options.

Fainance/ Management/ HR - I am in RBC and I don't like being on phone all day but if I have to do something in banking I know would prefer going in risk management/complaince, HR , training and development.

Public Administration Uottawa - Another degree I have been very fascinated by after researching with college, past graduates. Co-op option and a highly employable program to get into government job. Most students have positive reviews about the program and co-op is actually very solid as well.

Civil Engineering Technology - 32 month diploma at RRC that is really well recognized around in the province. Co-op and highly respected by employers anx past graduates. Very Math heavy ( which scares me a bit) but a really great program.

Application Delivery and Development - 28 month (4 terms plus 1 co-op term) at RRC. Another good program with positive reviews from graduates. This program can be a great stepping stone to go into tech field but it usually is well recognized in Winnipeg but is really hard to get jobs with it outside province anx tech market is really bad and I have been advised to go for a degree with co-op rather than diploma to increased my chances. 

I have been trying to narrow down and it's been really hard. I would really appreciate any feedback. I have tried to research as much as I can but I also want to get outside reviews. I don't have any family so I can't ask them what they think I would be good at or what could be a great career option.

If you need any more information please feel free to ask and again any advice will be helpful 😊

1bg5625,"I need scripts for working in an environment to ""kick the can down the road"" and avoid solutions to deflect blame placed on me. I need to not come off as threatening to extremely fragile egos.","I *(mid-30s woman)* know this is a super weird post, but my bosses and higher-ups *(all male)* are people who prefer have no accountability, don't like direct communication and don't follow through. ANY type of directness or assertiveness on my end is seeing as pushback. These men are able to deflect any responsibility off of themselves in nearly every situation *(I've seen it several times)*. It's like they don't want to commit to any type of decision or direction. The core problem is that these men act and say things in a way that makes me think they are sexist *(I'd rather not get into this here..)* towards women, and I know that there is no script or anything I can do if they simply won't do their jobs. But I need to learn how to best navigate this. 😬

I had originally been tasked with ""Project Pillows"" 4 months ago, where we needed ""Joffrey"" to help to actually implement the task. Joffrey doesn't want to say he doesn't understand the project, so instead he plays dumb when I try to get clarification or help, and then goes, ""I don't know what you want me to do."" He's disorganized and extremely rude so most so the whole thing was a mess.

Then I had a new manager, *""Jon Snow""* start who then took ""Project Pillows"" off my plate. But Joffrey is doing the same thing with him, like sending him questions that have nothing to do with it, and then going, ""you need to figure out what I need to do"". We had specifically talked about him taking it 100% off my plate, but then he'll complain to me how Joffrey isn't being helpful, but I don't think he's bringing these issues up to his boss, ""Jaime"".

Jaime also used to set up bi-weekly meetings with Joffrey for outstanding items, but nothing would get done because Joffrey wouldn't have any updates, we would have to spend the entire meetings re-explaining everything. Everything that had already been ticketed on and he was already looped in on.

And now, Jaime's clutching his pearls asking, ""why hasn't there been any work done on Joffrey's end on Project Pillows?"" Yet, he's not asking Joffrey or his own boss this, and it still doesn't look like he and Jon Snow have connected on this. *(Joffrey and Jaime are both at the same high level; why haven't Jaime and Jon Snow touched on this during their 1:1s??).* 

Now Jaime wants to have another meeting with Joffrey over this, and even though Jon Snow took this off my plate, I'm getting the sense they want me to attend the meetings, likely to hope that I'll be the one to re-explain everything again, because no one else wants to actually hold Joffrey accountable.

I need help with how best to fit in the culture and not make waves. How can I also dance around the issue while appearing to find a solution, but not actually finding a solution?

I'm thinking other phrases like:

* ""It's my understanding X,Y,Z, so I'll defer to Jon Snow and Jaime on how to approach it""

1bg4giz,Can I lie in on my application about when I attended university?,"I graduated from university in 2020 during the pandemic lockdown in the the UK and I'm still unemployed. I haven't been successful in finding any jobs or internships schemes, despite my best efforts in looking and applying everywhere. I kind of lost hope in finding any career I really wanted and just starting applying for regular paid by the hour jobs like I did when I was a teenager as I'm thinking it's going to be too late for me now in my mid 20s.  
  
Yea yea and I get it ""ohh it's never too late for you, you're still young many people haven't made until they're were around their late 30s"". Yea that's easy to say when the past few years all the desired opportunities and schemes have exclusively been for uni students only. Every time I find the perfect internship or work placement for me they only want a rising Junior or Senior Undergrad Student (18 years or older).  
  
Must be actively enrolled in an accredited college or university degree program for the full duration of the internship (proof of enrolment required)  
  
I'm not the best at interviews and what I mean by that I'm not great at fake smiling or pretending to have a bubbly personality that girls usually have as that's all it takes it seems, as they really kind of care about specific diversity and inclusion only and not skill, talent or based on merit. A job interview doesn't tell you a single thing about anyone really and their protentional whether they got in or not. (My female cousins who are the dumbest fucking idiots you would ever meet all got successful careers at big companies already despite definitely not doing great in school and being younger than me. Their parents are loaded as fuck tho so I don't know if that played a factor into it? They grew up as spoiled brats who haven't struggled at all in anything, and thought it was normal getting luxuries like a £1500 jacket on a regular weekend as a teenager?) Anyway that's not really relevant and just me mini ranting.  
  
So, I meet all the other skill requirements, past uni experience, actual competency and passion for the job yet I don't meet the required qualification of STUDENTS ONLY. So I obviously also looked for placements that were for post-graduates and there just weren't any I could find at the time and the very few ones I did, I didn't get in or a response for why with no actual reason, probably bc Linkedin says 900+ people have also applied for this as well. The 1 or 2 times I did get response it would be like ""you said everything right and what we wanted to hear on the application or interview but there were just others who had more years/months/days/hours/minutes of experience in whatever X, Y and Z bullshit, so we went with them"". HOW THE FUCK AM I TO GET EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY ONLY WANT HIRE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERINCE?!  
  
Anyway that brings me to now to my original question, you see a big company that I have been following for a while have now just released a bunch of graduate intern roles for people like me who have struggled. The issue is it's only for people who have graduated in the past 2 years,  
  
You must be a recent university graduate, having graduated no earlier than July 2022.  
  
Shit. I'm 2 years short to be allowed to apply for this. Can I lie about when I graduated on my CV and application? Will there really be any repercussions if I change my graduation date from 2020 to 2022? I really I want to apply for these and know I have great shot of getting in and want to be part of their Early Talent network of over 100 interns & apprentices, meaning I will have an important support network of other students, graduates and apprentices and plenty of opportunities to socialise! Do they actually check and verify your graduation dates? bc most employers I felt like they don't really check past job roles like I had a lot of part-time work when I was a student and I'm pretty sure they just took my word for it and didn't call whatever retail store/restaurant to see if I actually worked there.  
  
thanks,

1bg3swr,What are the skills required for my dream job?,"It's probably some pipe dream because in my country you cannot rent a place of your own without an open-ended contract, bonus points if it is a big company, or several years of solid freelancer's tax returns to show, so I'm not sure where this could realistically go.

I have a degree in anthropology and I love handicraft, I would be quite happy if I could work in some company that sells local handicraft items with a history within the tradition of that people. My favourite would be working with items that can be integrated as part of interior decoration in a culturally sensitive and aware manner. What I really love is to talk about cultures, their history, the meaning of something... I want people to be learned and cherish what they buy and integrate it in their lives and keep it for years. Is that even a market? On the other side I would love to help dying crafts to survive, get the recognition they deserve, and give those communities a much better quality of life.

It's idealistic, isn't it? People fetishises those things and lack basic culture to understand them (ok I'm in a provincial place, I just don't have the money to relocate abroad and anyway mine is not a high-demand job that would make me a prised migrant). What kind of hard and soft skills do I need? I worked as an office manager so that's what I have down. And a thing...

(This is a small company, only 13 of us) well, I get paid salary (40k a year, and no sick days, so my paychecks have been less then b/c as a singe mom if my daughter is sick and I need to take off I have to) and so they’ve been cutting my paychecks.

1bg0uya,Pursuing MEng at Berkeley vs. Continuing Work,"Hello everyone,  
I'm at a crossroads in my professional journey and could use some advice from this community. Here's a bit about my background:  
\- I've completed four internships, one of which was in the Bay Area.  
\- I recently graduated from McGill University with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  
\- I'm currently working full-time at a startup, but I'd describe it as mediocre. By the time I would start my master's program, I’ll have 8 months of full-time work experience.  
\- I've been accepted into the MEng program at UC Berkeley, focusing on Mechanical Engineering in Robotics. Although I've received some funding, the exact amount is still unknown, which makes the cost a significant consideration.  
I'm torn between two paths:  
\- Pursue the MEng at Berkeley: This option is financially more challenging, but it could potentially open doors in the Bay Area, especially given the program's prestige and location. I’d be leaving my current job with just 8 months of experience, and after graduating, I would try to find a full-time role in the Bay Area, leveraging the OPT.  
\- Defer the MEng program: If possible, I could defer my admission, allowing me to save more money and be in a better position to comfortably afford the degree. This would also give me more time to gain additional work experience before pursuing the master's, possibly making it easier to find a job in the Bay Area afterward.  
Given these options, I'm looking for advice on:  
\- The value of the MEng from Berkeley, especially in the field of robotics.  
\- The impact of having only 8 months of full-time work experience before pursuing a master's.  
\- The financial aspect of pursuing an MEng, considering the unknown total funding amount.  
\- The feasibility and potential benefits of deferring the program to improve my financial and professional standing.  


Any insights, experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated to help me navigate this decision.

1bfzv23,Should I call HR?,"Hi everyone,  
I created my account for this post. To start off I'm a part time worker, Ive been working at my job for a long time and recently a new manager was brought in and its been hell ever since. Important to note everyone must have 3 shifts. Ill go into the events that occurred.  
My co worker who had 2 shifts picked up another one which ended up comprising the favorites schedule by taking away 1 shift, so in response my manager took one shift away from me. I had 4 to begin with and now I have 3 while her favorite has 7. I never knew about his schedule change till I asked both of my co workers what happened and they explained. The favorite told me that he doesn't want my shift and wants to rotate shifts with the other co worker and that I will be covering the shift my manager took away from me. I was under the impression that he told my manager all that until the schedule came out a few days ago and saw that he had my shift so we texted. I found out that he told her that he doesn't want to work the shift he was put on. He did not mention the rotating shifts. I wanted us to be on a mutual ground so when we speak to the manager there isn't any loopholes. I misread a text of him saying that ""if you want the shift you can have it"" because I was busy working. My fault, but nevertheless I told my manager really quickly that my co worker doesn't want to work on the day I have and that he wants to rotate shifts with the other person and that he wants to cover my shift that she took away. She called my co worker. I go back to my desk, 5 mins later she stormed in yelling at me that I was asking for this shift from my co worker which I said was not true. I have texts to prove it. She continued to yell that I cant go behind her back and do things which again I never did. Then she said ""you can have the shift next week but going forward"", she didn't say anything after that. She then stormed out. Later on in the day I come to find out that everyone but me knew of the schedule change. I don't understand why she informed everyone but me, again all I did was ask and tried to be on the same page with my co worker.  
Obviously this is a big miscommunication but I don't appreciate the fact that she blamed me and that I might suffer reprocussions for something I was not properly informed about. This whole situation is screwed up because my co worker who had 2 shifts should have been told 3 or nothing and the other one shouldn't have 7. It makes me very upset that I get the short end of the stick. There are many instances of my manager pulling stuff with FORMER employees as revenge. She also comes in. late, leaves super early, takes super long breaks, doesn't do work, etc. People have noticed her slacking. I still want to work at my company but not with her. I hope she gets transferred out.",daniellestaubxoxo,1,1.0,0,1710570822,2024-03-16 06:33:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bfzv23/should_i_call_hr/,3,2024

1bfxn86,How to deal with extremely anxious manager?,"So I (29F) started a new job about 4 months ago. Everyone at my job is super nice, generally calm and collected. Except for my manager (mid 40F). She’s super nice but also extremely anxious. She talks super fast. Can be a bit blunt and has no filter at times. The reason why I’ve been concerned about her is that she is very quick to react emotionally and take things personally and gets defensive about things. Although she’ll admit when she’s wrong and means well, oftentimes she gets worked up over small things and could create a really chaotic and stressful environment because she gets so easily anxious and stressed. Like I get stressed just by listening to her complain all the time. She’ll do the work but likes to verbally complain out loud. I have absolutely no negative feeling towards her. But it does bother me when she uses accusatory language, and pushes that kind of narrative. Also she talks fast and loud, so it clouds my thinking and judgment sometimes.

However, today we were looking over something I did and my VP said I maybe could add additional details in the future. My manager sort of trained me on this so she told me that if anyone had some sort of common sense, they would have added additional details. So I told her “that’s why a few months back I thought I should’ve added extra details but when I asked you said I could leave it the way it is.” And we kind of went in circles because she claimed she never said that and that I didn’t specifically show her what I had submitted. So I said “maybe I spoke with [Jane] (my other co-worker who also has the same a manger). So my manager said let’s called Jane because I don’t think I ever trained you guys to leave out additional details. Jane said that she left out the additional details because it didn’t make sense to add it, and that she also confirmed this with my manager. My manager basically concluded that she never told us to not include additional details (basically saying that it’s not her fault, which I totally get). 

But then she told me don’t put words in my mouth by saying that I said something when I didn’t. So I just said sorry and that I really thought she told me that because I did ask her about the same thing that I asked to my other co-worker. I didn’t want to take it personally but I couldn’t help but do so because she likes to push narratives and I know she’ll tell other people “this girl likes to put words in my mouth, I didn’t know she was like that”—because she does that with other people. 

It seems like everyone else has figured out a way to kind of laugh over her anxious antics and not take her too seriously, because they know how she is. A lot of times they do listen to what she has to say and believe her to some extent, and other times know that she exaggerates—like complaining about all the work, talking about quitting (half joking—half not), etc. How do you guys deal with co-workers/seniors like this?

1bfx8dj,Which company should I work for?,"Background: 
I’ve been unable to finish my degree and was kicked out of my sick father’s house due to his crazy wife. Taking into account my current circumstances. Living in my grandparents house in the same room as my mother living out of suitcases with no real feeling of being settled and having my dog taken away as my grandparents don’t allow dogs in the home. My mom is constantly away at work with no time for me and I have no means of transportation or real friends. 


I originally wanted company A as it’s a big new project on an island with constant opportunities but the fact that I don’t have a degree won’t put me in an immediate high position. I’ve been in contact with an employer there, we’ve been talking over a month now and the first jobs he mentioned to me, knowing my education background and all are really good and high paid positions. But over the weeks he mentioned he wasn’t able to hire me right away due to the buildings not being fully functional and said I could either wait till it’s fully functional and he would hire me for that position then, or hire me in a low position (hostess/receptionist) and then advance later on when it’s fully functional. There is no actual guarantee and he said this in one of his emails”we wait until I'm told the sports club is fully opening and I hire you no problem” and then said this “I can see you being top of my list to be Assistant manager” which made me have doubts. Company B as wanted to hire me from the start but the hiring process has taken a while and now both opportunities are coming at once. Here are the pros and cons lists I’ve written for both companies. 


Company A :

Pros: 

- having and living with my dog

- Potential 25% increase in the potential job advance (assistant manager) 

- Housing provided 

- Transportation provided 

- All food provided throughout the day 

- 2 paid for travel tickets to visit my home city 

- Constantly growing and innovative project and environment 

- Living on an island 

- Relocating is paid for

- Very western 

Cons:

- immediate job id be getting is 62.5% lower than company B 

- Won’t be able to afford to purchase my own car in the beginning 

- Potential job not fully guaranteed 

- Moving to a new city is going to be a hassle 







Company B: 

Pros: 

- immediate high salary

- Would be able to afford a car sooner

- Good established company 

- They truly want me to work there as there were hiccups and still waited for me

Cons:

- Living with my grandparents in the same room as my mother with no feeling of being settled 

- I wouldn’t have my dog 

- Losing a huge opportunity in such a big project 

- I’d have to provide my own transportation (Uber)
 
- Very conservative

1bfx48s,"Love my job, but great offer. Should I use it as leverage?","I work for a mid-sized engineering firm that is growing very rapidly. So annual performance reviews just happened and my manager and colleagues all think I've been doing great in my new role (1 year in). I'm in a leadership position at a relatively young age versus my counterparts in other sectors (I'm 27 and they're on average 36). I've advanced pretty quick with my current firm in the past 2 years and managed to get an increase of 12% last year. Even with that, I've come to learn that I am paid on the lower end compared to my counterparts, while being responsible for twice the work (I lead two sectors vs. their one).

I was recently contacted by a headhunter for a position with a global firm that's very well known as an industry leader and had my interviews expedited to the second round. I decided to take the interview and everything went phenomenally - I was offered two days later. The increase in pay is 8% with a guaranteed bonus of $15k at the end of year 1. The new firm is very well known for their bonus pay structure and the annual bonuses float around 15-20% of base compensation. 

&#x200B;

The thing is... I love my job, the teams I've built, and the people I work with and would prefer not to leave. I've already hinted to my current manager that I'd like to discuss an increase in pay, but I'm not sure if I should mention that I got a job offer and use that as a basis for them to compete with.

1bfx3dd,"How to be impactful, and how can it impact me?","  
Hello,  
I am a german mechanical engineer(m27) and i find myself at a crossroads in my early career. Here is a quick overview over my careerpath so far:  
2,5 years of prof. training as a technical product designer in a prototyping company in automotive  
3 years of working there after my training. I quit after the company was shrinking due to new competition and covid.  
Studied mechaical engineering for 3,5 years, which i finished recently.  
Within those 3,5 years i had an internship at a small sustainability-focused engineering office. I learned a lot about the engineers role in forming a more sustainable future, to make our precious little planet last a little longer. It gave me a a great motivation for my career, as well as a general sense of purpose.  
Now for my very privileged dilemma:  
I currently have two Job offers for engineering positions, which are similar in description but differ vastly in nature.  
Offer 1 --- small sustainability-focused engineering office  
The company i had my internship at. They have a very scientific, no/low bullshit approach to sustainability and operate in various industries. I enjoy working with a creative and somewhat puristic motivation with mutuals. However the current impact on the large industries is not that big and future impact is always unsure. Every project almost feels hypothetical, or like a low odds gamble.  
Offer 2 --- ""Big automotive manufacturer Big OEM You see their cars every day"" company  
Stongly efficiency/economics-focused. Basically the ones we tried to change at my internship. The nature of their approach is not as attractive to me. However my direct industry impact would be huge compared to Offer 1. At the job interview it also seemed like they have some interest in my sustainabilty knowledge. But these people also tend to just say whatever sounds good.  
Pay is no point in this discussion. 2 pays better than 1, but both are good enough to make me perfectly happy, so this matter can be excluded.  
to destill it down:  
In the battle for sustainability, should i join the front, or should i trojan-horse that shit? Also should i be afraid to be corrupted over time by big car company and sing their song within the next 5 years?  
Thanks for reading!  
Any advice/ insight is apreciated

1bfulxd,Manufacturing floor level positions ,"Looking for input and commentary on those who have successfully made a solid career for themselves on the floor in manufacturing. It’s a profession that has been mostly bastardized and demonized by millennials and gen Z (I’m 35) due to pre conceived notions of unsafe work conditions and a terrible slave like existence.

I have personally found the exact opposite. I was able to make 80k within 5 years (pre Covid) of working in the industry (upstream semiconductor manufacturing) with generous vacation time and a very nice work life balance schedule working in mostly clean environments. My last 2 years of employment I cleared 135k$ as an hourly floor level employee in a MCOL area working 45-50 a week. 

The need for floor level technically advanced/controls level personal was predicted 8-10 years ago and I’m still perplexed as to why people are so confused to learn about these salaries. A power plant operator in my area probably clears 175k$ with a positive work life balance. 

The mantra of “my grandfather went to work with a tin lunch pale for 40 years then died of asbestos poisoning” is absolutely sad, but has iced a lot of people out of a very easy living in our generation IMO!

1bfulla,The manager catch-22,"I’ve been at my company for over 3 years, and in a manager role of 1.5 years. I work in the for-profit sector of my industry but I’ve always wanted to be in the nonprofit side and have a related MA. Nonprofits never seem to give me the time of day, even though the company I work for is a major player in the industry. My job is fast paced and demanding, and I have a lot of people and project management experience now. 

I recently had a screening call with an HR rep from a major nonprofit, and they basically said I was both under qualified for the role because I don’t have the exact experience requested, and also overqualified because it isn’t a manager title. This feels like a catch-22 that I’m probably falling into constantly, this is just the first time an HR person has verbalized it to me. What am I supposed to do?

1bfuknd,What are the job options for working in addiction recovery?,"TLDR: I'm a 27yo guy, I'm an addict in recovery, 18 months clean, I want to jump to working in addiction treatment to work with fellow addicts helping them to get clean and grow in recovery. Only ever worked menial associate level food service and retail jobs. Don't know what options there are for working in the addiction treatment field, what are all the options and how can I get started in the field?

Hey everyone, I'm a 27 year old guy and I feel like I'm at a point in my life where I want to finally make something of myself and get into a real career. The around 9 years I've been working, it's been mostly in the food industry and now in retail freight which I enjoy and the pay is quite better, but it can be isolating and physically taxing. More than that, I want to finally begin pursuing one of my true passions, addiction recovery, I'm an addict in recovery, I was a drug addict for years and it was absolutely a living Hell to say the total least, I now have over 18 months clean and sober, and I want to help others recover by working in addiction treatment somehow.

I always have really liked psychology, specifically abnormal psychology, I used to be in college years ago wanting to become a clinical psychologist, but I just suck at school and that's when my own mental health began to tank, I dropped out and gave up on school. I'd like to be the first in my family to be a college graduate, but I feel it's too late, especially if I want to go for more than an undergrad.

Lately I've been thinking of trade school for welding or something, I prefer blue collar and physical work, but I feel like helping fellow addicts is more personally fulfilling and could pay as much as something like being a welder or electrician.

I honestly don't know what options there are for jobs in the addiction treatment field. All I know from my personal experience is inpatient treatment like a rehab technician, house manager, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, internal medicine doctors, and recently I've heard of peer support specialists but I haven't seen many job postings for that title. What are the options for getting into the field and working directly with addicts to help them in recovery that could also allow for growth in the field?

I work full time but do miss some work during the week due to completing my welding education at a nearby community college. I asked my boss about it today and he tried to use my school schedule as justification to leave me out of training, when in reality I had no prior notice to coordinate with my school instructors to allow me to be present for the forklift training. He also tried to leverage the fact I mostly work on the welding robots and don't have much need for a forklift, when other robot operators are also receiving the training. He very quickly became agitated at me to the point he was visibly shaking and speaking in an inappropriately hostile manner. The conversation didn't amount to anything other than him losing his cool. 

Not sure if I should proceed to talk to a more higher up supervisor about this training issue, or if I should just accept it and move on.

1bftpyo,Took manager’s job now I am drowning in work ,"Last year in April I was being headhunted by another company to work for them as a sysadmin for a significantly larger amount of pay. I brought this to our company president because my current pay was honestly shit for the amount of work I did and he offered to update my job title, match the salary, and give an extra week of vacation. I really liked the company and this offer so I decided to stay.

 A month later the president sends me an email saying he’d like to discuss the updating of my job title and to meet him in his office. I meet him and turns out the IT manager (my boss) is getting fired right when our meeting ends and I will be assuming his role. So after our meeting ends, I shut my bosses accounts down and the president and HR walk him out of his office and the building. 

It is now almost a year later and I am drowning in work. I do not feel like I was prepared to be a manager so soon. I am 26, have my BA in computer science and went into IT just over 3 years ago after I realized I hated coding all day in my first job out of college. I started as help desk here and moved up to sysadmin very quickly but becoming manager is almost too much.

 I am learning quickly and there’s been a huge support from my team and our executive team and I appreciate everything they’ve done and are currently doing but the amount of work I have acquired is unbearable. 

The worst part is they did not hire anyone to backfill my position so I am doing my previous duties plus the duties I assumed from my manager. 

I am currently trying to hire someone but it is so hard to find time to even start. 

Every week the amount of work gets larger and larger and I am keeping up but I feel like I’m not making a dent. The executive team keeps throwing new project after project at me and I can’t catch a break. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any advice on how to manage it all? One thing I have trouble with is delegating work, I’m so used to just doing everything myself it’s probably why I have such a large workload.

1bfthek,Master's in Creative Technologies - What Now?,"I went back to school near the start of COVID-19 because it was a better option than working in retail.  I'm about to have my Master's degree in creative technologies with a focus on sound design, specifically narration.  I graduated with honors with a bachelor's in game design.  I've got one card game that's ready for production (I might have an investor), and dozens of music, sound design, and graphic design projects on my portfolio page.  I've also got some narrative writing credit under my belt.  Oh, and I'm about to be forty-five, with ADHD, and I might have autism (I fit a lot of ""high-functioning"" traits).  I have no idea what to do next.  Add to that, I'm wondering if I'm not finding work because I'm asking for too little as opposed to what I'm worth.  Not that I'm even certain ***what*** I'm worth at this point.

I have no desire to get my doctorate.  I don't want to teach.  Given the school I'm graduating from, it seems like a good fit, but I'm better with one-on-one or small groups.  I feel completely lost.  The only thing that's keeping me from being in a complete panic is I'm only going to have to pay off my bachelor's and master's as my associate's degree was paid off a decade ago.

Looking at job boards isn't giving me a ton of hope either.  I've been ghosted on every job I've sent out work for.  Does anyone have any suggestions as I've got a few months before what little savings I have is gone paying rent?

Should I ask for part time instead and see how that goes? That way I can still have my other job if things don’t work out? Or should I just wait until my other interviews and see how they go?

1bfrd5p,"Scored in the 99th percentile on the LSAT, now considering being doing w Law School after one year. Any advice on alternate career paths? (Type B personality)","Main Idea: The LSAT tests ones reading comprehension and analytical & logical reasoning skills. Anybody know of any solid careers that those skills might lend themselves well too, that aren’t all encompassing like most lawyer jobs? 

If you’re interested in the backstory: I never dreamed of being a lawyer. I came to law school because I had a pretty impractical undergraduate degree, I knew I had some skills needed for law school, and I was excited about the touted flexibility of a JD. My LSAT score outweighed a poor GPA and led to a full ride at a good school which solidified my decision to come. (Not a crazy prestigious school, big state school ranked in the top 25, but not in the state I want to work in).

But a semester and a half in, I’m starting to consider alternate career paths, as I’m not seeing much light at the end of this tunnel.

 I don’t know my personality type but think it’s type B? I’ve never been concerned with getting rich, having some prestigious job, or even doing work that I’m passionate about (partially cause I don’t know if that exists). I just want to find a career that pays well enough to support myself and maybe a small family and has a good quality of life that allows for time off where you don’t always have to be stressed about doing work on vacation or making the time up when you get back. Pays well enough to me is hopefully cracking six figures within five or so years.

Some options I’ve considered are moving back home to work and save on rent and trying to self-teach or bootcamp CS or programming (or maybe look into a degree), or maybe stick out law school and try to leverage the JD into Compliance or HR. I like to be creative and always learn new things and solve puzzles which makes programming intriguing to me, no STEM or CS background though. I’m also pretty good with communicating with different types of people which is why I’ve considered HR. I’ve even considered middle school and/or high-school teaching for the time off and cause I think I get along good pretty good with kids (always will be a kid at heart).

In law it seems like the only options are government, in-house, or making it solo. I’m not interested (nor probably qualified anyway) in being a fed, state gov seems okay for the wlb but not a lot of upward growth. And I think having to grind in a firm for the years it would take to land in-house or go solo would make me miserable.

I’m 26 btw, worked a few customer service jobs before law school. If you’ve read this whole thing kudos, appreciate any advice. Also thank you for any brutal honesty, I probably need it.",Nighthawk1458,2,1.0,7,1710544189,2024-03-15 23:09:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bfrd5p/scored_in_the_99th_percentile_on_the_lsat_now/,3,2024

1bfqst4,"Should I shift from stable remote work to a hybrid role in a major city, given the potential promotion?","As I stand at the crossroads of my career, I find myself pondering a significant decision that could potentially reshape my professional trajectory. It's a scenario many of us encounter at some point: 

Should I leave behind the comfort and stability of my current work-from-home position to embark on a new journey in a hybrid role located in a bustling major city?

Here are the variables I'm grappling with:

1. Salary Upgrade: The allure of a substantial increase in compensation is undoubtedly enticing. Transitioning from my current $99k/year position with a 2-5% bonus and standby travel benefits to a $140k/year role with a 10% bonus and a 4% 401K match amounts to a minimum total compensation of $154k. It's a significant financial leap that promises greater financial stability and security.
2. Career Advancement: Beyond monetary gains, the opportunity for professional growth is another compelling factor. Moving from a senior analyst to a manager consultant role signifies not just a title change but a remarkable 64% increase in salary. It's a step up the corporate ladder that holds the promise of broader responsibilities and enhanced leadership opportunities.
3. Location Dilemma: However, the prospect of relocating to a new city presents its own set of uncertainties. While Florida, with its stable environment and the perk of free standby travel, seems appealing, Arizona remains an enigma. The familiarity and perks of my current location versus the allure of a new adventure—it's a delicate balance to strike.
4. Work-Life Transition: Additionally, the shift from a fully remote setup to a hybrid model—three days a week in the office—introduces a new dynamic into my work routine. While the current arrangement provides flexibility and autonomy, the possibility of a future transition to a five-day office week adds another layer of consideration regarding work-life balance.
5. Company Culture and Connections: Amidst these deliberations, the endorsement of trusted connections looms large. The positive experiences shared by my peers, coupled with personal acquaintance with the CTO of the prospective company, instill confidence in the organizational culture and its long-standing stability.

In weighing these variables, I find myself torn between the comfort of the known and the allure of the unknown. It's a decision that transcends mere career progression—it's a reflection of my values, aspirations, and appetite for change.

As I navigate this pivotal moment, I invite insights, experiences, and perspectives from those who have traversed similar crossroads. Your wisdom and guidance could illuminate the path forward in this journey of professional evolution.

1bfqqnf,I am almost 19 years old and can’t choose between these 2 careers,"I currently have been working as a pharmacy tech making $14 a hour for 5 months and I’ve been investing my money for 2 months.

I wrote a lot here lol so I f you can take the time to read this I would greatly appreciate it. I am just trying to explain what I know so far. So you guys can. Accurately access.

#1 Finance Degree: I have a passion for investing. Specifically stocks and ETFs and real estate investing but I think I like stocks a bit more. I also like going on Reddit and answering peoples budgeting questions and would love to help tell someone how to budget and invest. I also would like to look professional and wear a suit and be organized. I did bad in math in high school but it’s probably because I goofed off with my friends and it was boring to me and I just couldn’t focus. But I have no idea how good I would do in the math portion of things because I don’t know if I’m confident in myself to pass the math part of finance. But maybe I can learn basic investment equations if I put my mind to it and really get into a focused state. I think some tax loopholes to learn about would be cool as well. Everything else in finance that I didn’t mention I couldn’t really care about. I like how you can have high income potential as well. But I am not confident in starting my own financial business. I think I’d stick to working for a small company and work my way up. But I am uncertain about how good of a job I can get after college and since it’s competitive I don’t know how likely I am to get accepted into a large firm with experience. But my uncle is in financial and own his own small financial business so he can guide me maybe. But I also know finance people usually work long hours and I hate getting up early but if it’s something I like I will get up early for it. I also don’t know if I would be able to handle 16 hour days either but I could handle 11.

#2 Pilot 
I like this one because I think flying jets is cool. Not the Air Force kind. But I would like to be a airline pilot or a private jet pilot. I also know this a is a great paying field depending on what job you pick in it. But many people have said that it takes a long time to become one and others have gotten in fast. Also a lot of people say don’t go in if your just in for the money. There’s also a massive pilot shortage and it’s causing pilots to be paid more. I went for a discovery flight one time and enjoyed it I also landed the plane perfectly but the experienced guy next to me did all the speed controlling and all I did was control the direction and the stick. I don’t know if being a pilot will be boring but from what I see it sounds like a awesome job. I think  it’s cool to travel around and stay for a little and experience the area and get up the next day and fly out. I like how professional pilots are and I remember seeing them in the airport and thinking man it looks so cool being a pilot. I hav seen people say go hard it is to get into delta  and the major airlines that pay more but if you work hard or get enough hours in you can really make a lot . As far as I’ve seen the more flight hours you have the better. And I would also be going to college because the major airlines prefer a degree in aviation but used to require a degree. But since there a shortage and demand for pilots it’s easier to get in. Some people make the process sound miserable by saying you can loose your job easily if something goes wrong medically because since your responsible for all passengers you cannot have anything wrong to interfere with your flying. But some people can get a job with there aviation degree in something else and it doesn’t just have to a pilot as a backup.you do have to pass a medical exam so that is why. I also don’t know if I can memorize the controls. But maybe I can but I think once I start doing I I think I may like I a lot. When I went go the discovery flight I was thinking It would be scary and I didn’t know how I was going to figure out all the controls. I also thought it would be hard to control the plane but it wasn’t bad after all and was pretty fun. I also think it’s a badass job to be a airline pilot. The last thing I don’t like about it is that how much math you have to do and I don’t know if I would get bored learning about cockpit controls. I also don’t know much of a quick thinker you have to be to calculate everything. In the air. Like I don’t know know hard that is to do.

I have a track record of successful projects and I've been recognized as a high performing employee. And since I managed to build a ""bank of credibility"", I considered actually focusing on starting a family with my partner of 11 years. 

However, my company has not been doing well the past months due to the economic context. It started with budget cuts (while I'm asked to do more and grow my activity, which upsets me), then my N+1 leaving for another position in the company. And recently my company's CEO left the company on the day he made the announcement. And with each new CEO comes its reorganisation. 

I'm afraid getting pregnant during this period might actually hurt my prospects of keeping a position in a potential new organisation or that I might not get my position back after my maternity leave.  

I can imagine there is never a perfect moment to start a family. But is this actually a good moment to do it? Should I put this project on standby? Right now, I'm wavering between it being the worst moment to do it and actually the best moment to do it.

Option A: is staying at this energy company where I make 70k a year while working 3 days a week and travel 3 hours on those three days. I cannot grow in my position and salary can raises with max 3% a year.

Option B: work at a nearby bank where commute will be 20 minutes and the salary will be around 90k but I will be expected to work 5 days a week so more responsibilities. Also more room for growth.

1bfpg0y,Team Gift Giving,"I work with an extended team of about 20 people, all of whom work remote. I am friendly with, though not particularly close with more than the 4 people on my immediate team. The extended team’s director and other managers will frequently sponsor gift donations for major life events for my coworkers, babies being born, loved ones passing, etc. I have gotten into the habit of not contributing to these funds.

Managers / directors on this sub - would a direct report being inactive with group donations effect how you see their professional contributions to the team? Would it affect your judgement in processing their growth within the company/team? Should I address this directly with my manager(s) - e.g. “I’d rather not participate in these things, either as a contributor or a receiver of generosity”?

1bfo74a,Need advice.,"

For context I'm 20f from the UK.

How can I acquire the skills necessary for a ""proper job"" without pursuing an apprenticeship? I can't opt for an apprenticeship because I didn't achieve my maths GCSE. While I could consider retaking it, I'm worried that by the time I pass, my age might make me less desirable to employers. I know there are apprenticeships available that don't require a pass in maths, but those types don't interest me much.  
  
I'm thinking about going to university to study either computer science or software engineering, as I have some knowledge of Python and C# languages. However, I'm concerned about the job market saturation in these fields, and I don't see many tech job opportunities like that in my area.  
  
Alternatively, I think a carpentry or mechanics job would be appealing, but I'm unsure how to gain the necessary skills, and I feel like not having a maths GCSE won't help. Additionally, as a woman, I worry about feeling out of place in male-dominated fields like these (I'm aware that software engineer jobs are also predominantly male).  
  
Any advice on where to learn these skills would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

It's not the only thing I'd be working on of course, but I'd get to put hands on it. 

The downside? I'd have to give up half remote work to come onsite most/all the time, and I'm not sure how much if at all my salary would get bumped. I just got my yearly raise, so I just don't know.

When I lay it out all on the table, the new opportunity doesn't sound as glamorous. I really prioritize my ""me"" time. I prioritize my health, working out nearly every day and meal prepping, etc. I'd really have to make some major adjustments to fit into the new role. But hey, at least I'd be working on a passion project, right? 

I feel like my work isn't all that interesting nowadays. I know there's ups and downs to every job. I know I can't stay in my cushy situation forever. I also value my own time, as mentioned before. I kinda hate going into the office as it stands now. Part of me feels like maybe if I had no choice,  I can get over that fact.

1bfn7rf,Almost 40 and burnt out out in Management,"I've been in management rolls in heavy industry for about 15 years. I'm getting sick of the 24/7 ""always on"" expectation of the business, among other issues. Kids are still young but growing fast like they tend to do and if there is a time for a change it's soon, not when they're in their teens. A typical week for me is 55-60 hours at work, with calls, texts and emails at all hours. Weekends always on call. Often times numerous nights a week getting up in the middle of the night to discuss or come in for a problem. I feel my energy dwindling and I don't think I'm being as good of a dad as I could / should be (I spend a good amount of time with them, but I've been feeling like too often it's just sitting and watching TV because I just don't have anything left). Besides that my marriage suffers the same lack of energy problems and forget about a social life outside of that, or self care or hobbies lol.  I understand the blessing of being fairly financially stable (as long as the plant doesn't shut down), and am certainly worried about giving that up... but more and more I've been talking to people who've worked this career and almost all of them tell me that they regret missing too much of their kids growing up.

We have a small cushion in my savings and my 401k is in ok shape. I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking for by posting here, but if other people have had a similar life experience and made a change and would be willing to share I'd love to hear about how it went. I'm thinking of setting a deadline for myself, something like the end of the year to decide on what's next... I feel like I ""can do anything"", but have no idea where to start.

1bfl6op,How to stand out to a busy manager,"Hi there-

I’ve finally gotten into my dream job but I was onboarded with at the same time as someone who has 18 years of experience in the industry vs. my 3 years of experience. It was super cool because they gave me the offer literally the same day I interviewed so I know they liked me and felt like I had a lot of potential.

My manager and I had a great conversation during our interview and I definitely have great chemistry with the team. No one has made me feel like I’m useless.

BUT she’s never trained two people at once and I am sensing a lot of hesitation to give me projects since I’m definitely the green one. I made some minor mistakes on the first project she gave me and we went through all of them so I could make some notes.

I also made some dumb mistakes like saving over a source document which is something I’ve never done. I’m just nervous and anxious which makes my brain stop working. I feel a deep need to prove my value which is a lot of pressure to put on myself.

I think she’s more apt to give projects to the more established team member and I’m sort of sensing that I’m a second thought so my training is falling behind.

She also has been out a lot and only checks in very occasionally.

I feel like she’s waiting on me to say something but I’m not a very aggressive person.

What do I do?

Do I just take it easy on myself and wait and see if things change? Do I need to be more talkative about my desire for more training?

I’ve only been here for two weeks so I haven’t had much of a temperature check for the vibe but I can already see who is the go to people and who are the supporting people.

Business undergrad doing engineering management master,"Essentially I am from a business undergrad background and have been admitted to a top Master of Engineering management program. Some stuff online I read makes it seem like doing this master doesn’t make sense since I am not from an engineering background, though I was admitted in a selective group and it does align with what I want to do class wise and work wise (product management). I have other offers for specialized business masters but really feel drawn to this program.

1. Does pursuing this master of engineering management (MEM) make sense with my background? I am able to take data analytics, energy, and product management courses that I am super excited about.

2. Does pursuing this masters allow me to consider a PhD after a few years in industry? Maybe in management, innovation, or strategy?

3. I am confident the coursework aligns more with what I want to do than an MBA, but will employers scratch their head at this combo? I am really passionate about learning technical skills and management skills that are specific to product development and tech which this will provide.

4. Am I over thinking this? If a program is a school I love and has the classes most important to me, is this justification enough to pursue? The argument of engineers saying I’m from a non tech background and that it doesn’t make sense is making me question doing it, though it seems to me this could provide me with a unique background and that there are tons of jobs in product management, project management, data analytics, and tech I could be in the running for with this degree.

I have repeatedly mentioned this to my manager, and he is sympathetic. However, I don't think there are any changes planned for my assignments.

I don't know what to say, there's so so so many things wrong with my life. 
I have bachelor's degree in psychology.
And I was preparing mba entrances.
One year passed. And now my parents are getting annoyed.
I don't really know in details what business analyst are, but I want to become that while also doing ux design.
I am thinking of doing professional training course of 6 months job ready course of business analyst.
My sibling and siblings friends told me to stop wasting time.
My family is not well financial and emotional.
My whole family feels like can fall apart tomorrow and I am the loser of the family who couldn't even able to pass an entrance.

I am so scared, frightened infact. I went to one institute for this course and they don't me business analyst and business analytics are both different and it went confusing. And I got scared more.

Every decision I'm making, every decision I have made, all feel like hell.

My plan was to give entrances after entrances exams for Colleges this year too, but my sibling said I'm wasting 2 years of my life. 
Just hurry up and get a 6 months training and get a job. 

Every minute feels like decaying object of my life and that object is my life itself.
I don't know, I hate that I'm so stupid.

1bfihkh,How do I cope with maddening broken and absent processes at work?,"I ask two people what a process is, I get two different answers. Or I’m told to consult the SOP, I follow that, and turns out that’s wrong and outdated. 

For example, I need to get approval for a return. Customer ordered 20 KG, I changed the order to eaches (boxes), to 1 EA. Pricing analyst ran a program that changed it to 20 EA. We shipped customer 20 EA, they want to return 19 EA. Coworker entered inquiry while I was out (vacation week) and then passed it back on to me when I was back in office. I don’t think she is supposed to pass work back onto me. IT is the inquiry owner and hasn’t done anything. I ask coworker what I’m supposed to do, account manager wants to give customer update. She says follow SOP and send approval request out to 5 people (quality control manager, customer service manager, supply chain director, BU controller, GM). I do so, controller is very old and play armchair detective and says he will not do anything until inquiry is closed. I thought I had to wait until inquiry was closed before I send approval request, but coworker told me I don’t have to. Controller doesn’t understand anything about what happened and can’t even figure out how to navigate the inquiry, he asks who is person who is supposed to review inquiry, and I do not know. There are 3 names on the inquiry, coworkers tell me something different. Account manager is harping down my back, supply chain director won’t approve credit in March but will for April so our books aren’t negatively affected, but is okay with impacting the customers books which I think is shady. The company only cares about revenue. Controller is acting like I’m the problem. I’m told I report to supply chain director and not to be on the sales reps side, however I’m told in other scenarios to be an advocate for the customer. Then I’m told I contacted the wrong quality person, senior coworker told me wrong person.

We also get audited and have to explain our credit process and heard my manager say to the auditor “we don’t have a process because corporate is trying to change it but won’t communicate exactly what the process is, they just let us know if we need to get different approvals. Auditor is assigned to make new SOP and can’t understand anything my manager tells him about how things work.

We have annoying, time consuming broken processes and work arounds that are a big time suck. Management makes no efforts to clarify or improve processes. We have the same issues every single day and nothing gets done.

The department also fired four people in six months and have not replaced them. They were fired because they “didn’t catch on well enough” but were not provided proper training, were told this place isn’t for everyone. We are told to work faster and harder and get orders in ASAP, but are all days behind on work drinking out of fire hoses. Our department had five inquiries in three days on order accuracy and then were pulled into a meeting and told to use an outdated, non functional checklist that is much worse than the one we have, or else we will have to fill out detailed spreadsheets on each order we enter, but are expected to do the same volume of work. We were told to sign a document saying we understood expectations.

The CEO sends out a quarterly report on all of the people who got fired for code of conduct violations and why.

I feel like walking out and never coming back. Help me. I have had several interviews in the last few weeks and have two more upcoming. I’m so burnt out. I’ve gained so much weight. I hate my job. I hate management.",RealAd1811,2,1.0,0,1710521334,2024-03-15 16:48:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bfihkh/how_do_i_cope_with_maddening_broken_and_absent/,3,2024

1bfhst9,Promotion pay rise negotiations ,"Hi all,

I’ve today gained an internal promotion from manager to senior manager with a pay rise of 10% including benefits but a base pay rise of ~9% but I really thought this would be more and I’m not overly happy with the figure. I work for a large multi-national firm and am solely responsible for training  ~5,500 individuals in digital and big change management projects. I have achieved the highest possible appraisal grade and smashed my targets saving the company loads along the way. All of this is written in my promotion business case and the offer I have received is:

Current : £52k base, £4k bonus
New: £57k base, £5k bonus

I have asked if there is any room for negotiation on the base as this is a huge responsibility, although I have been working at this level for the duration of my time at the firm ~2 years and feel they have been getting cheap labor from me.

My manager does not seem overly impressed that I am asking for more but has said let’s discuss next week. They have told me the role currently ceilings at £70k so they wanted to “leave room for progression” but I’m already working above the expectation of the new role. I couldn’t humanly do more to achieve the competencies.

Am I being unreasonable? How should I conduct the  face to face conversation? I’m very nervous! ",Sparkles785,1,1.0,10,1710519546,2024-03-15 16:19:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bfhst9/promotion_pay_rise_negotiations/,3,2024

1bffsmo,40 years old and what are the remote stable income jobs I can do that fit into my background ,"tl;dr

Contemporary sculptor artists looking for suggestions on what I should do to have other incomes that are remote and stable. Many thanks!



Hi all,

  
I am a contemporary sculptor and have an MA in molecular biology (2012, previous career) and an MFA (2018, current job). I've been working hard to become a full-time artist since I graduated.

  
I have a gallery representation in my city. It's promising but new and small, focusing on growing, running through different artists, and fine-tuning his stable niche at this moment. I realize I have to start to broaden my network beyond my city myself. I started to find stable remote job opportunities, so it would be easier for me to go to shows, and openings that I am part of, and keep my art practice going and doing out-of-state artist residencies in person. Studio space is expensive. Plus, sometimes people just don't pay on time, exp there is a hotel chain that pays me 4 months later than their promised deadline.

  
After some research earlier last year, I chose UX design, based on my interests and background, and some articles say it should still be in high demand within the following 5-10 years. I just started my UX design boot camp at the end of January this year and realized how brutal and low the entry-level salary is. I made about 30K in art last year. The lowest range of my boot camp graduates last year falls into the same range.

  
Unfortunately, I also got divorced last year. My ex generated fake documents and took everything. We are in a family lawsuit now. So even though I live in low-income housing and costs down tremendously. It's hard to control my monthly expenses.

  
I guess my question is, I feel in the long run UX and trying to get into tech I have a higher possibility that I can have a smoother and more stable life while I grow as an artist. But seeing how saturated it is, I started to doubt it. Maybe it will be a better choice for me to try to find/ create remote art teaching jobs etc. I have some friends who work in tech but also try hard to turn their side hustle in a completely different creative field into their day job. They seem to balance well but they all work in tech for more than 10-15 years. But for me, having two careers seems impossible in terms of my ability and age.

  
Any suggestions to help me think things more rationally would be super helpful! Many thanks.

1bfeobb,"LinkedIn bragging is nauseating, but people love it: good to do it?","I find LinkedIn to be generally nauseating, as it mostly consists of (1) people posting platitudes that are really humblebragging and (2) people bragging.  But people seem to like it.  

For example, one post today (below) brags about giving a saxophone to Bill Clinton and is pure humblebragging; it makes me nauseous.  

But since seemingly everyone on LinkedIn either brags or humblebrags, is it a good idea to do it?  I guess so, even though I don't want to.

Czech Saxophone for Bill Clinton, Thirty Years Later  
  
Bill Clinton is one of the American presidents with the warmest relations to the Czech Republic. In 1994, he received a saxophone made by the Czech company AMATI Kraslice, výrobní družstvo from President Václav Havel and played an impromptu jazz performance at the Reduta Jazz Club in Prague that made the club famous around the world.  
  
More than thirty years later, we at the Czechoslovak Group have decided to revisit this remarkable moment. During an official reception at the American Embassy, together with Roman Staňek, the owner of Amati, we presented the President with a second saxophone from the Czech Republic. Again, it was made in Kraslice, but since the presentation of the gift took place during the official reception, it was not possible to try it out this time. Perhaps on Mr. Clinton's next visit?  
  
I have long appreciated the warm friendship that President Clinton has shown towards the Czech Republic not only during his term in office. And let this gift, which is also a memory, be a testament to that.  
  
We at CSG are proud that we were able to facilitate the presentation of this gift, and the saxophone is engraved with our company's name along with the name of the manufacturer. President Clinton managed to charm everyone at the Naše Bezpečnost conference and we are looking forward to his next visit to Prague and the Czech Republic.

1bfc1uv,"Bored, jobless, aimless - what can I do?","Hey friends - help this brother out with advice for landing a job... here's my story ...  
36 M in India here. No college degree. I jumped into a customer service role at an international BPO in India (Delhi) at age 18 and progressed from there. Then I switched a few times over the years and last worked as a customer success manager for a US healthcare firm. Most of these opportunities have been through referrals.  
I've got a total of 12 years in customer service, account management, soft skill training, and sales. I took a break from full-time work at the start of '22 and have been looking for suitable roles for the last 5 months without any success. All I've gotten are 2 repeat interviews (both of which I cracked) for the same company for customer service operations/training manager--and got ghosted big time.  
Naturally, it's been frustrating and challenging for two reasons--seeing such wall-to-wall rejections is despairing & and meeting basic expenses is a steep challenge.  
I've applied to big, mid, and small companies, experimented with a variety of formats and styles of CV and cover letters, and sent 100s of cold messages and emails to recruiters, employees, and founders. But nothing's giving.  
The only interviews I've had have been through referrals from friends and ex-colleagues. And God knows that I've personally reached out to every one in my contact book or online network to ask for one.  
After reading a few online posts of how folks from India have bagged remote jobs abroad, I also began applying to lots of remote jobs posted from the US/first world. Again, nothing fetching.  
The obstacles I suppose are: 1. lack of college degree 2. career breaks (I've had two long ones).  
If you were in my position, what is the #1 piece of advice you would offer - not just for now, but also to navigate my work scene for another 10 years to my best advantage?  
(I've posted my question here on a couple of other career channels too - without a response. Sorry if it feels like spam to anybody. Not my intention.)

1bfaovg,Is there any trade profession or certification program that earns a livable wage at entry level?,"I’m currently trying to find something that I could do in less than a year or a year total, either a trade profession or a certification program for something that would help me earn a livable wage at an entry level position.

I currently make $19 an hour and my husband makes less than me. We do not have a place of our own and we barely make enough to actually get a place of our own. I usually do not cap out at 80 hours unless there is room for it and there usually isn’t because of certain employees at my job. Even if I do get 80 hours it’s $2400 a month and I would be the sole person paying the rent and honestly there is nothing out there in our immediate area of Tennessee that would be affordable. Hell, in our city alone and nearby cities, apartments are usually $2400-3400 a month. And renters want you to make 3x that type of money. 


I’m interested in the health field. I’m looking to become a clinical psychologist and am hopefully going to school in the fall of this year for it. I can’t wait til I graduate to get us a place of our own because the way the education process is, it’ll take me upwards of 12 to 14 years before we are able to look at something. I’d like a place of our own now.


I’ve been looking at the medical billing and coding certification program my college offers but I can’t seem to find jobs that are entry level that would pay a livable wage. You have to have years of experience to be able to be offered $56k a year. 


I’m not good with my hands and so I don’t think I could do like any type of maintenance trade like HVAC or something like that or construction. I have experience in hospitality but even hospitality management doesn’t pay that well. I just need something to do that won’t bore me to death as well as will make me earn a livable wage so I could earn more money enough to get my husband and I at least an one bedroom apartment somewhere in Tennessee.

1bf99vx,In career purgatory right now ,"Got laid off from my big tech job in January. I had plans to pursue a part time MBA for next spring while working but post the layoffs I figured it was a sign to apply for full time programs in the fall even though I was late in the admissions cycle. Got some positive feedback from my dream school NYU Stern and an invite to interview which I thought went incredibly well. Stern also has a high post interview admit rate so I was feeling pretty confident. Lo and behold after 3 weeks of waiting I got the news that I am waitlisted. I was honestly surprised because I thought I was a great fit, but now I am extremely disappointed.

In the mean time I have been applying for jobs as well. I haven’t had much luck there with the tech job market being abysmal but I moved forward with a mid sized startup and I’m in the final stages of the interview. Now the problem is that if they decide to extend an offer, I probably won’t have a lot of time before I make a decision and I don’t think I’ll hear back from the other schools or Stern during that time. I could take the risk and reject the offer but then I am at the mercy of the other schools which could very well all say no, leaving me with no job and no school acceptances. I haven’t had any luck with other companies and I am also on a work visa which adds more limits to my timeline. So if they extend an offer I am most probably going to have to accept. This is of course contingent on the fact that they extend an offer at all. I have a final round of “behavioral” interviews left and they could very well reject me after that.

I realize this is not the worst situation to be in. In the long run if I took the job id be fine even if the company is a significant step down from my previous one. And I’d likely won’t be able to pursue an MBA until after 1-2 years. I’m just feeling very frustrated because I want to make a decision on my terms and not have something forced on me by circumstance. I’ve been crying all night following the waitlist news. I have the gmat scheduled for this weekend (I had it scheduled long back but it’s helpful in improving the odds to get off the waitlist) and I am extremely nervous that I won’t be able to improve my score. Even if I do do well, the school can take up until late august to decide to admit me. I just have no clarity right now about what my next few months are going to look like. I have been in a constant state of anxiety for the past two months (my Apple Watch even detected higher average heart rate lol) I’ve given up practically everything - my friends, family, dating, hobbies, just focusing on figuring out what to do next.

1bf8h76,Overthinking how to negotiate,"My line manager is going on family leave (12 months) and I am the next most senior member of the team. I am also on a contract that is finishing at the same time. I work remotely and had discussed taking over large portion, but not 100% of the responsibilities during this period. I was expecting the company to offer an increase in salary, and/or temporary title increase, but instead they have just offered to extend my contract with a small CPI increase, as I already get paid very well. I know my hourly rate is good (I work part-time) but I am also pretty efficient and work in a niche area that is hard/impossible to source experienced people.  Am I being entitled expecting an increase in salary if I am being asked to take on a higher workload/responsibilities if I am not going to take over my line manager's full job (they are not going to hire a replacement, the workload will be shared).   I do not have any idea what kind of base salary differential there is between me and my line manager, but the responsibilities would require me to have more customer meetings (specifically excluded from my current responsibilities) and be available 5 days a week (although I would not need to work full days). Would I be better off asking for a higher % time to be paid, rather than a higher pay rate at my current, as it's likely I will need to work more hours anyway to do both jobs. I had been clear with my lm that I expected some sort of acknowledgement and they agreed and were positive - so now when the company came back and said this was what they were offering, and implying that I am greedy and already overpaid - I don't even know how to respond.

1bf6m5l,Career Confusion: Seeking Guidance on Further Studies,"
Hey everyone,

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my career journey and could really use some advice. Here's a bit about my background and the dilemmas I'm facing:

Background:
- Graduated with a BCom in 2023 with a GPA of 7.90.
- Currently pursuing an MCom with a GPA of 10.00 in semester 1, will make sure the gpa stays high.
- Working in digital marketing at an MNC.

Dilemmas:
1. MS vs. MBA: I'm torn between pursuing an MS or an MBA, unsure what field to pursue for a high paying job. It's worth mentioning that I'm not particularly skilled in finance or IT.
2. Inclination: I have always been more inclined towards strategy making or event management or client facing roles. 

Questions:
1. Timing for Application: When should I apply for studies abroad? Is Fall 2025 the right time, or should I consider later dates?
2. Job Experience: What type of job experience should I gain in the meantime to enhance my prospects?
3. Preferred Country: I'm open to studying and settling abroad in a country where I have good job opportunities to pay off my loan, and possibly migrate to other countries from there. Preferences are US, UK and EU.
4. University Preference: I'm only considering top universities (e.g., Top 20 in the USA or Top 5 in the UK) Cause otherwise it doesn't make monetary sense.

I'd really appreciate any insights, personal experiences, or advice you might have regarding these dilemmas. Thank you in advance for your help!",comfywaffle,1,1.0,0,1710480571,2024-03-15 05:29:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bf6m5l/career_confusion_seeking_guidance_on_further/,3,2024
1bf6l8m,Columbia or Kellogg? ,"Columbia SPS or Kellogg MiM?

I got into Columbia for MSc in Strategic Communication and into Kellogg for masters of management program. 

I want to become an entrepreneur after grad school and move back to India. 

My debate: Columbia has the Ivy Tag and is more recognised overall back in India which could help build trust with investors / clients despite the specific degree. But Kellogg is equally as hard to get into but maybe not as globally recognised in India, but if you know more about it, you’d know just how hard it is to get in. I also think the degree is definitely more valuable in terms of what I will learn.

My first question is will employers care if I took really long to finish my degree if I do or do not switch, will I need to gruel to get a job??

Second question is: given I am not that bright is it a good idea for me to switch?

More emphasis on the first question. Please be objective and not encourage me needlessly. 

Advice from everyone is asked for by me but especially anyone who has done a switch like me or is doing electrical or software please do my ignore this post.

1bf5ghm,Job Offer,"Hi everyone! 

In an interesting position and would love feedback. 

I (27F) started looking for jobs (after almost a year not working to relax and plan my wedding) and recently got an offer. The pay is around 75K with a potential 10% bonus. The job looks interesting (better title than the previous one but  same pay) but is one hour driving from my home (Miami to FLL) with no traffic and at least 4 days in person (uggg). I honestly don't think I could do the commute everyday since I hate driving and we considered renting a place in FLL for the week and spending the weekend in Miami (we own here). I countered asking for 95k (originally told them was looking for 100k) but they said no. It s a manager role so I think the pay is not great but the company looks good with growth potential. 

However, my husband works in Miami so we would potentially not see each other during the week and even a shitty place in FLL to crash during the week is expensive. 

THE ISSUE: I am waiting to hear back from another job (100k base, remote, and a DREAM, working in research I believe is more beneficial for society). I made it to final round and really, really want it. I reached out asking for an update and they said ""Thank you for following up. We are interested and appreciate that you have other things to consider.  Please allow us until next week for the final decision.""  

However, the current offer wants an answer by tomorrow Friday (I officially got the offer today, Thursday). I asked for the weekend to review offer and speak with my husband and they said no, which I also find a little rude since during the interview process I was very understanding with rescheduling interviews and needing an answer in less than a day I found to be unusual. 

 I don't really know what's best and am scared of giving up on a sure thing to maybe end up with nothing lol. Also, I have not been the most responsible in the past and want to do better and take my career more seriously. 

Everyone keeps telling the market is terrible and I should take it. Husband is super supportive with moving / not moving or me working or not and just wants me to be happy. I could not take it and keep looking as well.

In 2021, I started working remotely for a Telecommunications company and quickly climbed the ladder and now work as a ""Lead in Training"" I didn't mean for it to happen but given all the free time I had waiting for my program to get back on track I excelled at my job and now I actually love what I do and actually want to learn more and do more in my role. I am a bit confused because I still really like the idea of being a Surgical Technologist and helping people in the OR etc but the more time I spend at work is the more I am loving the job plus I have noticed that my personality is more suited to my current role.

 Is there any way I can use my impending Associates Degree to catapult myself into the world of IT and Telecommunications even more? Is it worth it at all, or should I just complete the program and go work in a hospital, especially since I have a private student loan to pay off? My family thinks if I decide against being a surgical technologist  and make this switch, then the loan and degree would be a waste, would it?

1bf1uh1,help with advice on a raise,"i’m not really sure where else to ask this question.

i’m 30 and i have a 4 month old. i work as a general manager for a national smoothie chain, and i fully manage 2 separate stores (same franchised owner). i was hired as the assistant manager at $16/hour for both locations in june 2023. i was on maternity leave nov 3 - jan 28. while on leave, the general manager for the stores left. i was offered that once i came back after maternity leave the job to manage one store, $20/hour, and the owner would hire a second manager for the other store instead of one manager/one assistant manager. long story short, that woman lasted 3 weeks. 

i am 100% in charge of everything for both locations. finding new hires, training them, managing the store’s employee schedule, counting the full stores inventory, placing orders with vendors (for retail items we sell as well as all fruit and smoothie goods), managing these employees (disciplinary action, making sure everything is done & runs smoothly, etc), doing cash deposits at the bank and maintaining records of everything in & out, and probably so much more that i am not listing. the owner does not help unless it is a question that i truly cannot find the answer to, or she is dropping off items every 2-3 weeks for 5 mins (like floor cleaner etc). she is there for any advice i need and is great - but i basically run the stores 100%. 

this was not our agreement. the agreement was one store, and she was going to hire someone else for the other. i know the manager before me made $55k a year plus monthly bonuses and had health benefits. she doesn’t know i know this. i have only state mandatory sick time, $20/hr (not allowed overtime), no health benefits, and no bonuses. 

i love my job and the flexibility, but i feel as if i’m being taken advantage of. i’m constantly working from home whether it be texting kids to get shifts covered or dealing with an issue, etc. i log that time and am paid for it, but i am not allowed to go over 40 hours a week and therefore not everything is getting done. i would happily get it done but i’m not working for free. 

i live in maryland. i have 10 years of customer service experience (mainly call centers, data entry, managed another retail store for 2 years). what should i be making? i don’t know what i should ask for money/benefit wise. i don’t know how to approach the situation. any help/advice is appreciated.

1bf0zo7,I'm 33 and still don't know what want to do for a living,"How did all of you choose your current job/career?  
I've struggled my whole adult life not knowing where my passions lie and what I enjoy doing or what I'm good at. I was always told ""you have time"" but that led to noting but stagnation and job hopping from part time job to part time job.  
I'm sick of bouncing around from job to job, but for the life of me I cant think of anything I would enjoy doing or be good at. Hell, just getting out of bed some mornings takes all my strength, let alone trying to find a career.  
  
The thought of working 40 hours a week, even at something I enjoy sounds exhausting and demoralizing.  
  
I've tried  
retail (5+ years)  
working BOH in restaurants (3+ years)  
Working in a casino (1 year)  
Working for a pack and ship store (3 years)  
working in entry level tech (3 years)  
  
Even the jobs ive been most excited about slowly kill me. My current and most recent job is Geek Squad. Ive not gotten more ta a 5 cent raise in the three years ive been there whereas the tech hred after me STARTED at a wage $2 an hour higher and works the same ammount of hours and does the same effort of work.  
  
Ive tried taking aptitude tests and all my results keep coming back with high end jbs that require 6+ years schooling and masters degrees.  
  
I just feel so lost and like a fucked up my whole life by never owing what I wanted or even having a vague plan. Everyone I went to high school with knew from 11th grade what they wanted to do and are all married and homeowners. Honestly if it werent for how sad it would make my family I'd just let myself waste away homeless on the street's. Id e less of a financial burden that way  
  
I cant to physical labor because im chronically ill  
I cant get any thinking jobs because Im a stupid moron with no degree.

1bf0vmf,Sexually harassed and assaulted at work and was asked to keep working with them or quit  ,"hi everyone, i (23F) just started a new job about a month ago at a small local pizza place in BC. About 2-3 weeks ago i was slapped on the ass by one of my coworkers in the presence of his friend who also works there and at the time i honestly thought that he had whipped a towel because it felt the same and stupidly i didn’t think he would physically touch me like that. My next shift with him i found out that it was in fact his hand but i didn’t know what to say to him because i was in shock and it was just us 3 working, and then the next day he was fired due to budget costs so i thought there isn’t much i can do now. Later on i found out by his friend/other coworker that was there that he had said to him “I bet you $50 to slap her ass” but he didn’t because “i didn’t want to take the chance knowing there are cameras, even tho i would have fucking loved to”. So i was pretty disgusted that 1. he knew his friend was going assault me 2. there was money and a bet involved to do it and 3. he followed it by telling me how much he would have loved to do it himself and the only reason why he didn’t is because there are cameras. so i ended up telling my manager whose also a woman but 22 years old. She told me that that’s not right and she’s going to talk to the other manager (man) and said that she doesn’t think he’ll be working there much longer because he’s been written up 3 times already for non sexual reasons but he’s close to being let go already. 
Fast forward to a few days later I asked her if there was an update on him because i was scheduled to work my next two shifts with him, one of them being closing alone with him and his brother, and she told me that she and the other manager talked to him about it and he said he’ll keep his comments to himself. I asked her if there was anyway that i could scheduled on different shifts than him because i do not feel sexually safe and am uncomfortable working with him, and told her that regardless of his comment he knew i was going to be assaulted by his friend and admitted to me that he would have done it himself. She ended up telling me that he can’t be let go for his friends actions and that she doesn’t think he is dangerous or threatening so my only options are keep working with him or find a new place to work because changing my schedule is not possible. 
A note too is the girl before me working here also complained about sexual assault towards him but it wasn’t taken seriously because they thought it was an excuse for being written up for doing her job poorly. 
So i am honestly stuck about what i should do now because i don’t want to quit but i don’t want to have to work with him alone either. Is there anything legally i can do? Any advice would be great thank you ",541155675,4,1.0,5,1710462762,2024-03-15 00:32:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bf0vmf/sexually_harassed_and_assaulted_at_work_and_was/,3,2024

1bf08tk,Is sales not for me or am I just in a bad position ,"Am I bad in my job or am I in a disadvantageous position

I’m 24 and ever since I graduated college I feel like I’m pretty much useless in the market.
I’ve been working for the same company for 3 years, 2 as an intern and full time since 2023.
My role doesn’t even have a real name but to me it’s a glorified SDR role with some community management thrown into it.

To give you some context, I work in a. Consulting agency that specialises in product experimentation/ digital strategy. We are a small team, consisting of 10 people, and I am the only one in the sales position (the rest are all consultants) and respond directly to my boss.
I don’t have a sales manager over me, I don’t have SDRs under me. I’m the sole sales person in the company.

My mission? To sign our consultants to new clients.

The role as it was sold to me was a full sales cycle type thing that went from prospecting all the way to deal closing. Besides some books that I’ve read, I’ve had 0 training in any of this.
I’ve also had very little technical training in the service we have, I know what we do, I can explain it in a pretty detailed manner to someone who isn’t in the industry. But for someone who is, if they start asking questions about our consultants roles with our clients, it can get blurry for me since I never worked directly with one of our clients.
I also find things very difficult since as a consulting agency with consultant fees, we cannot go after smaller clients and typically have to aim for much larger organisations (think Fortune 500) that themselves already work with much larger consulting firms such as McKinsey, BCG, PWC,Deloitte etc..
So typically if they get a message from me they will either ignore or say they don’t need me at all, or that they already work with someone.

My current strategy consists of lies to leads about being a consultant myself and wanting to have a chat with them, which does result in a much higher response rate, but once we get to a call a real consultant has to be there with me to answer technical questions (which to me is extremely frustrating ) and then we use those leads to promote our company with our newsletter/ podcast/ events etc.. but we’ve completely cut out the direct sales approach because it just wasn’t working.

I’ve started this role in August 2023, and so far I have not signed any consultants into a new company, I knew it was gonna be hard, I didn’t know it was gonna be near impossible.
I typically mainly use LinkedIn for prospecting since it’s the less invasive way of contacting our leads, maybe I should focus on cold calls?

My personal opinion is that my company does not have enough recognition to be focusing on sales just yet and should be focusing branding, marketing and networking as opposed to full ok sales calls/messages. But that’s just me, maybe I’m trying to justify my poor performance on the industry but I want some unfiltered external advice.
I ask because I’ve decided that I want to quit this job, but so far the only offers I’ve gotten are in Sdr positions, albeit in very different industries and in companies with a more organised sales team. Could that work for me or is sales not for me?

I'd like to somehow incorporate both of my background knowledge and professional experiences somehow.

I would also like to mention that I'd want to work remotely due to various factors. I noticed there are many communications positions available that are remote.

I completed my Masters in Education and my certification at Columbia U, and have a Communications BA from Pace U. I'm not really sure of where to go with both of my professional experiences, and would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, and advice.

I am 30 F
Currently I am super lost with my career and not quite sure what am I supposed to look into
I got a master's in economics without thinking twice because I was passionate towards it. Due to my HOD's bullying towards me, I lost my interest towards the subject and I lost my confidence. Besides that, I did around 6 internships on Human Resource, Video Editor, Content Writing, social media strategy and community management.After that, I took a year gap because I thought I would write an entrance exam to get into a PHD program. It didn't succeed and I failed to get in. I really wanted to get into governmental sector to make a difference. I tried getting into NGO and they didn't take me either. 
I got into the corporate job market. Oh boy! I felt like I died inside because I went through 10 interviews out of my 55 applications. 
Most of the people who interviewed me (particularly men), they asked me questions like are you going to get married anytime soon? You going to get engaged soon? Does your parents work in govt sector? Blah blah. I couldn't fathom the interview and ended up accepting in gaming industry as digital marketing executive positive. It's all about social media management. I felt the sexism after working 2 months in that organisation. 
So,I quit my job after 3 years and took another decision of going to France (going to France was a thing for me and I kept suppressing the objective of going there due to my finance) so, I went to France to study in a business school for masters in data science but they killed my brain cells. It was supposed to be a year course and in reality, it was just 6 months and they taught me advanced course on the first month rather the basic. Basics was taught in the end of the course.
After the course, I got an internship as Product Marketing Assistant in gaming industry. Completed it 3 months ago and now I am like the fuck do I do now? I don't know what sort of marketing am I interested in! Because during the internship, I thought I would get a revelation but all I got was swamped with work enough to burn me out. The person in charge of me didn't do shit. The supervisor was non existent. My role wasn't defined. I was so happy to be accepted in there because you know, ""brand"" of a company will provide me networking opportunities and it will create a small value in my resume. No networking opportunities nothing but more work! I have finished my graduation a month ago! So yay! But right now, I look at all these job portals and wonder what role should I even apply for? I usually know what I have to do and right now, I feel so lost. It's frustrating to feel this lost.

I’ve been looking for a new job because I wanted more money but there has been layoffs with the company so I wanted more stability.

The promotion was already expected it was just the question of when. I’m very happy and if I decide to stay, I know I can at least get 2 more years with the company. The ones I’ve been interviewing for are for the same role but would pay me $15k-$20k more than the salary I would make with the promotion plus a 10-13% annual bonus. I don’t have any offers yet but I feel good about getting one which I know is not guaranteed.

I have put quite a bit of effort into my resumes and LinkedIn. What should I spend my time doing to get past my current professional situation?

I am (31 M) trying to find my way out of a basic warehouse job that literally anyone could get right out of high school. I have a Master Degree in Computational Chemistry, decent tech skills, and absolutely no ability to convince anyone that I am worth more than $40K a year.

I spent some time trying to bone up on data analytics and data science skills to make my application more appealing but I have not been able to get so much as a single interview with \~115 applications so far (I don't know if that is a small or large number) which is a little disheartening.

I have tried \~7-9 variations of resumes formats and write my resumes to fit each job description, optimizing for keywords. I have spent a good amount of time optimizing my Linkedin to make sure it is visually appealing and there are the right keywords in my headline and throughout my about me, etc. I also have a website that could use some work but serves the basic function of showcasing my analytics portfolio to those who visit it.

I started and almost finished the Google Data Analytics program on Coursera but stopped at the 7th module (out of 8) because I thought it was WAY too basic and from reading it hasn't really helped anyone get a job (so I am not sure if I should I finish it or not. I mean are certifications even worth it at this point?).

I have some projects that show off my skills. A couple are Python projects that require intermediate level mathematics and statistics. One is on equations of state and the other on the variational solution to the hydrogen atom. I understand these projects are not directly data analytics or science but they are tangentially related and the skills are transferable. I have a couple of basic Excel projects and one SQL project (which I have heard is THE skill to have in data analytics).

I am getting to the point where I feel like most of my effort has been wasted or misplaced. I recently joined a meetup group that I try to go to twice a month. I know this will help with networking but I have not yet utilized the benefits the group has to offer because I am not sure if I am ready for a career. I am in this awkward state of being burned out from trying to put everything together to get a better career and feeling like I'm too incompetent to even manage the career if I got it.

I know this post is very unstructured and basically just a stream-of-thought but any advice would be great. Thanks for the help in advance.",Sad_Basil_6318,1,1.0,0,1710454082,2024-03-14 22:08:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bexjpl/stuck_what_should_i_do/,3,2024
1bexi75,How do you handle asking for more work?,"I’m new to the full-time office job. It’s been 6mo and I’m still always unsure if I should keep bothering my boss to give me work. The alternative is normally me waiting at my desk for hours or even half the day pretending to look busy till he comes to me or sends an email. The work I do is a back and forth so it gets checked and I do revisions based on construction changes etc. Of the times that I went to ask him if he had work for me, majority of those times he said he will come to me (he’s busy gathering all the work.) No one else in office goes to ask him, but they’ve been here longer so they have bigger tasks to work on. He’s a great boss, and very kind and encouraging. I’ve learned a lot from him already. But I can’t help but feel like I’m being “lazy” for not getting as much work and trying to look busy. Is it fine for me to keep waiting? What is normal?

1bewzvj,Seeking Advice: Transitioning from Restaurant Management to Project Management after PMP Certification,"

Looking for any advice or suggestions or help from people who may be in management roles.

I have years of experience in restaurant management, including overseeing day-to-day operations, scheduling for large teams,  event coordination, team management  + delegating tasks, designing/implementing standard protocols, atrong customer Service, assisting Owner/GM with budget and labor cost over sign, and administrative tasks like coordinating with vendors, plotting out the day, han. Additionally, I've assisted with 2 grand openings in the hospitality industry, such as restaurant renovations and menu changes and hiring/training, and tracking our growth.

Outside of my restaurant work, I've been a freelance portrait + food photographer for eight years, managing various photo projects from concept to completion. From drafting concepts for clients, to reaching out to models/stylists/designers/assistants/Hair+Makeup/Creative-Directors for specific projects, to researching locations, coordinating everyone's schedule for photoshoots, analyzing work from similar brand projects if necessary, managing big teams during longer term campaigns, While I doubt this experience directly applies, it has made me feel like I'm capable of transitioning imto project management.

I'm currently pursuing a PMP certification and wondering if my experience qualifies me for project management roles on an entry level basis to get my foot in the door as I've been having trouble figuring out how to revise my resume and haven't gotten any interviews for coordinator positions. I'm also seeking advice on potential industries or career paths after obtaining my certification. I'm considering financial , HR, or tech or IT-related certifications but open to suggestions. I don't have a degree but may pursue one depending on my career path. For clarification, ideally I'd like to invest the next 1 to 2 years gaining experience and gaining two to three new certifications before deciding on going back to school to finish a bachelor's degree.

Was considering getting the pmp, maybe a cert budget or financial planning, and from there I don't know.

Any advice on transitioning from the restaurant industry to a career with growth potential and work-life balance would be greatly appreciated.",Triniteighlynne,1,1.0,0,1710452710,2024-03-14 21:45:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bewzvj/seeking_advice_transitioning_from_restaurant/,3,2024

1bevypz,Need help with salary negotiation.,"I applied for a job and when I got the first call (it was a technical person who had called me, not an HR) , the company rep asked me for my salary expectation. I was neither expecting that call, nor that question. I gave him a range, 50-55k which I thought at that time to be acceptable for me. The company rep then said that their budget starts from 48k. I didn't say anything.

Since then I have had 2 interviews with them, one with a manager and one more technical, both of which went well. The technical guy said he was ""very happy with my profile"" and casually asked me my salary expectations, and I repeated the same range 50-55k, and the tech guy said that the company can easily meet my expectations. I got a call from HR today, and they told me that that they received the review from the manager which was ""very good"", and so they want to extend an offer.

After all these interviews, I feel I would be a good fit at the company, my experience shows I can handle their projects, and background has a lot of stuff which sets me a bit above from others with my background.

For the last year, my career has been shit. I am not making much money or even growing in my career. Honestly, I have been feeling a bit dejected. I feel like maybe I lowballed myself, because I was a bit desperate for good work. But these interviews made me feel like this company is a good match for me, they will give me the right environment to grow, and they also have money to spare. Last couple days gave me new energy and I feel like I can be at the top of my field again. I have already told them that I am looking for a challenge, more difficult work, and I am willing to work hard.

For this reason, I would like to change my range, and aim a little higher, so that I don't feel underpaid and have to change companies again soon. I wouldn't go too far, but maybe I would like to say under 60k instead of 50-55k and then see what they are willing to offer me.

How do I approach this?",KarmaAndFruit,1,1.0,2,1710450152,2024-03-14 21:02:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bevypz/need_help_with_salary_negotiation/,3,2024

1bevg8h,"Recruiter reached out on LinkedIn, advice on how to secure an interview for dream job?","
Hi everyone, 

Recently got reached out to on LinkedIn by a recruiter for a company I’ve always wanted to work for. They contacted me about a position I was getting ready to transition to and I was excited about this opportunity. 

After first replying they didn’t reply for a week, I followed up by asking if they were still interested and if so, I’d be available to talk. 

They replied saying yes and which day worked for me for our call. The day of the phone interview arrived and the recruiter called me 30 minutes before our scheduled call, thankfully I was prepping and was able to answer everything successfully. They said they’d follow up with a link to submit my resume and cover letter so they could give the hiring manager directly. 

I waited 3 days and nothing, so I went ahead and applied at the company’s website and messaged them again saying that I applied and would appreciate any feedback. At this point I gave up any hope and 2 days later they messaged back saying that my resume was with the hiring manager. 

I ended up finding the hiring manager on LinkedIn and they’ve been visiting my profile for the past couple of days. I don’t want to overstep and contact them directly, but at this point I’ve lost hope in the recruiter. 

I really want this job, what advice would you give that would help secure me an interview with the hiring manager?

1bev3sz,Finish college to advance my career or keep trucking,"I have no idea what direction to pivot towards in order to advance myself financially or title level within my career and hope for some advice.

I have had a seriously rocky relationship with my college career in the past 6-8 years. I started college in fall of 2016, nailed it that first semester. Second semester rolled around and that was the beginning to my downfall. I was in and out of a community college between 2017-2019, but got pressured to go back for a 4 year degree at a university by my parents (oh how young and naive I was not acknowledging the cost of student loans in my future-). I barely made it through the 4 years, and still did not complete my bachelors by spring 2023.

I have about 30 credit hours left to take to obtain my degree. I successfully passed my major’s classes with flying colors but the rest (art, philosophy, geography, lit, etc etc) I simply cannot pass. I couldn’t bring myself to focus on the work, or even care about it. It seemed absolutely pointless to me. The whole ideology behind spending money, time, and energy toward classes that don’t mean anything for my actual degree is outrageous in my brain. I HATE school.

Now keep in mind, I networked my way into an absolute dream job of mine in May of 2023. With no degree, despite it being a necessity for my position. I work a wonderful remote corporate job, make good entry level money. But I am drowning (162k to be exact) in student loan debt (thanks Sallie Mae) for a piece of paper I don’t even have.

I want to move up within my career at some point. I don’t anticipate changing positions anytime soon…but if I desire to move up, I’m afraid that piece of paper may become a focus point within a future conversation. But I’m also not sure if it is wise given my track record and the amount I’ve already accrued. I’m TERRIFIED to add to that amount, if I can’t successfully finish it…again.

1beutv0,Advice for dealing with my coworker who’s constantly negative and unsatisfied with what I do?,"Hi, I’m really stressed at my new job (3months) because of a coworker. I work in software development with 5 years of experience.

I have a coworker who’s constantly stressing me out. She’s very smart, barely has a life working 10+ hours everyday. She’s very passionate about what she does and I respect that. She’s also the same level as me, not my manager.

I also understand I’m new, younger, less experienced than her and I might make mistakes as I learn. My working style is laidback but I get my work done, she’s more intense. But honestly I feel targeted at this point. 

She’s always having something negative to say to me or about me, even if I do something and finish it and other teammates are happy, she doesn’t miss the opportunity to say something snarky. It’s seriously affecting my performance and self-esteem. I’m very low key and non-confrontational so it’s not like I’m a threat or anything. Whatever I do, it’s not done correctly, her talk is riddled with cliches about how we make a difference and I need to be thinking a certain way. There’s always a “but” in her statements if they’re not outright negative. And it’s not constructive just passive aggressive or straight up aggressive. 

I’m really tired and I’m trying my best here, I also have social anxiety and struggle with perfectionism so she’s making it hell for me. She also bad mouths everyone to our team and wants to create problems with their managers and I just know she probably does the same to me behind my back. 

My other team members told me not to worry about her without me even saying a word, and that she’s just very passionate about this job.  I actually thought it was the wrong job for me until I realized my stress comes from her, not my work. 

How do I handle this? I’m starting to lose my cool and I don’t want to say something I’d regret. I avoid her as much as possible and no longer ask her anything but our work is very collaborative. I’m really worried she’ll paint me as the villain to my manager who’s very hands off and I’m trying to make a good impression here.",Interesting_Item4830,2,1.0,1,1710447325,2024-03-14 20:15:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1beutv0/advice_for_dealing_with_my_coworker_whos/,3,2024

I accepted the interview and went in but apparently the manager wasn’t there as he was at a family emergency or in the hospital, I got two different answers. 

Anyways, they let me speak with one of the department managers and he seemed very nice! Super in tuned with the things I enjoy.

I feel like I want the new job, but I’m a little hesitant as the company seems a little disorganized. During the interview they also mentioned how there have been people leaving/changing positions etc. Are these red flags? Should I accept the offer? Should I keep my part time job just in case.

1betc6i,"If you're stressed from work (or your personal life), here's a Pi Day-themed stress management exercise to help you address and overcome your stressors","Happy Pi day!  
  
As someone who loves data and pie, today I bring you a pie-themed exercise to help you overcome your stress:  
  
Make a pie chart of your stressors.  
  
Your assignment: Make a pie chart of your stressors  
First, make a list of everything that is stressing you out right now. Get specific! E.g., ‘my kid staying home sick from daycare 99.9% of the time’ is better than ‘parenting.’  
  
Then, decide what percent of your total stress each item is causing. For example, if you divide 100 percentage points among these stressors, how much does each one take up? So, for example, perhaps your constantly sick kid is causing 30% of your total stress.  
  
If you have a lot of items, I find it helpful to tally up some high-level categories. For example, “work” and “life”. When I did this, I discovered work accounted for 60% of my total stress, which was a helpful insight in and of itself!  
  
Then, draw a good ole fashioned pie chart so you can visualize your most significant stressors at the moment. If you have too many to fit nicely in a pie chart, you can skip it and just rank order them in a list… but it’s Pi Day, so it’s worth a shot.  
  
Last step: Answer the question, on an average day in the past week, on a scale of 0 to 10, how high is my stress right now? (Zero being not stressed at all and 10 being the worst stress possible). Answering this question helps us understand if we're working with a small, single-serving stress pie or a giant, way-too-big-to-manage pie.  
  
(See an example of my own stress pie chart [here](https://thriveculturecoach.substack.com/p/address-your-stress-in-pi-day-style)).  
  
Now, ask yourself: What is one small step I can take today (or, if that’s not possible, this week) to reduce my biggest stressor?  
  
If you want an accountability buddy, comment below and tell me what you’re committing to do! You should also tell me your favorite type of pie, because… Pi.  
  
That’s it— happy Pi day!

1berz0w," 5yrs restaurant operations/floor manager exp aiming for PMP certification and then what next? What paths are available for me after project management cert to start growing? Suggested on industries or other certs?
","



I'm interested in studying for the PMP cert and I was wondering if my experience in hospitality management might be relevant. I've been a restaurant operations manager for the last 4 years and have also worked in operations in the customer service industry. I've worked closely with General Managers in two separate instances in opening a new restaurant and all the logistics that went along with it. I dont know if that counts. I've also had small scale projects that I've overseen as the hospitality manager like helping revamp a restaurants re-opening/appearance/menu which also involved hiring and training staff. I had to keep budget in mind, consult with people, reach out to distributors,  and etc. 

 I'm just basically a restuarant manager in NYC  for really big restaurant groups. my normal day to day duties involve things like doing schedules for like 50+ people, overseeing day-day operations, keeping guests happy, ordering goods, keeping the owners happy, handling our events schedule, team building, and doing lots of administrative work on the side when im not working the floor to boost sales or keep customers happy.

I've also been a freelance/contract photographer for the last 8 years, which I doubt counts whatsoever, but I've basically overseen/managed bigger projects/campaigns in regards to my photography. From drafting concepts for clients, to reaching out to models/stylists/designers/assistants/Hair+Makeup/Creative-Directors for specific projects, to researching locations, analyzing work from similar brand projects, managing big teams during long term campaigns, managing budget/costs, making sure everything is organized well and scheduled correctly for people, dealing with any issues that come up, and delivering an end result for paying clients. 


I've been really looking to switch into a more operations or large scale management role outside of the hospitality industry but have trouble getting even entry level jobs as a project coordinator or some junior level to gain more direct experience, as my resume is moreso restaurant management/operations experience and managing other places (like at a big art gallery and also as the operations manager at a ferry company in nyc).

Is there even a point to trying to pursue the PMP certification without that relevant project mgmt job Or Is my experience enough? I'm currently going through the project management Coursera course, then after I'm finished I'll be going through the PMP exam prep book 11th edition by Rita Mulcahy, an agile practice guide, then run through a few mock tests online before trying for the PMP test.

Also, any suggestions on possible industries/paths after my PMP cert? I was thinking of trying to get a financial related cert or something IT/tech related but I'm undecided. Also no degree (dropped out getting my business admin associate) but depending on where I end up after PMP job wise will determine if I try to get my bachelor's. I'm looking for career paths that'll bring me closer to $150k+ in NYc or LA/SF in 10 yrs w/ the right certs and a bachelor's. I was initially considering a bachelor's in computer science or engineering or business and certs like for HR or CompTIA or something that might look good in In Fintech. I have no construction exp or finance exp. 

Any suggestions for a lost soul looking to leave the restaurant industry and work towards a career w/ good earning potential and decent work/life balance?

1bernzc,Am I making a mistake? How should I answer the resume gap? ,"I plan on resigning from my banking job soon as it's not fulfilling and the long hours are having a toll on both my physical and mental health. I don't enjoy banking so I don't plan on staying in this industry in the long term. So I'm thinking sooner is better than later when it comes to resigning as I feel like the time I'm spending here is not adding any experience anyway. I plan on switching to UI/UX design and am taking a freelancing course.
Ik freelancing is uncertain but I dream about the flexibility it can provide so I am forcing myself sit in the online class after working 10+ hours every day.
But it's really draining. I want to quit my high paying bank job and continue the course wholeheartedly. As I still haven't done my Postgraduate, I'm even planning on going back to school. But the lack of income and leaving such a high paying job ""that people can only dream about"" is making me overthink to the point that it is affecting me physically. 
I live with my parents so there is no financial burden whatsoever and they are really supportive but it's my mind that's messing with me. All I can think about is what if I fail? What if I can't end up freelancing? What if I ruin my career? What if companies don't even want to give me a job anymore due to me becoming unemployed? What if I regret later?

1bequd8,Data science ,"Hey everyone!

So I did my undergrad in psychology and neuroscience, then dove into computational neuroscience and AI for my master's in the UK. I've been struggling for a good 1.5 years to land a job here for roles in data science and AI.  It's been a rollercoaster of interviews and dashed hopes due to the economic mess we're in. I’m progressing through the rounds and then there is a hiring freeze. 

Now, I'm eyeing a move to the US for a master's in Data Science for Fall 2024. Figured it's a good move since the job scene seems brighter across the pond. But out of the 6 universities I applied to, 4 have already said no. This could be due to so many reasons at this point since it’s such a competitive field. 

I'm feeling pretty lost right now. Going back to square one with job hunting feels like a gamble I'm not keen on taking. Should I consider a PhD in the field, or would that just be stalling? Does having a PhD in this field have any benefit in terms of getting hired? Any advice on where to turn next? 

Sorry for the long rant, folks. I’m really lost at the moment and being unemployed and starting over at 26 feels really crappy. Any help would be awesome! ",Indo-minus,1,1.0,0,1710437554,2024-03-14 17:32:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bequd8/data_science/,3,2024
1bepxt4,Should I do the work,"For some context I (26M) currently work as a Junior Producer for a video production company. My responsibilities include a mixture of producing, filming and editing. 

I currently work in Surrey where the company are based but I live in Northamptonshire (renting in Surrey in shared accommodation Monday - Friday, living at parents house on weekends) I do this because:

1. I can’t afford my own place on my salary
2. My girlfriend lives in Northamptonshire and doesn’t want to relocate away from her friends and family 
3. There is limited work in Northamptonshire for videographers and I need the stability of a full time job in my sector 

Now you have some background, getting into the point of my post…

Today my boss asked me if I can work a certain Saturday in the future to film a wedding, that Saturday being my girlfriend’s birthday. 
I explained to him that this puts me in a difficult situation and although he understood if I can’t do it he gave me a speech about how we all have to make sacrifices for work. The catch though is that this work is for an associates company and not my employer, my boss and I would both be freelance workers on the job doing someone a favour as he can’t attend the wedding. 

I had marked on our work calendar that I am busy on the wedding weekend but my boss said as it’s not annual leave it’s a grey area. 
The difficult part for me now is that I need the filming experience to progress in the company but I find this has stepped over some weird boundaries and it has been completely overlooked that I already sacrifice a lot of my spare time to be available and local in Surrey for my role. 

If I say yes does this leave little to no boundaries of when this can be sprung on me again and if I say no then of course I am holding myself back and could mean I’m not considering for filming in future (my favourite part of the job). How should I approach my boss regarding all this?

I appreciate any advice anyone has to give and happy to provide more information.

1bepquh,I'm 4 months in and I'm already burned out,"I left my old job for this one after a traumatic event in my life. I needed something new and jumped at this. 

It was supposed to be promising. I start as a Junior Buyer but with the intention that I'd learn the ins and outs of the company to take over for my manager. 

My company- honestly is not good. They are growing rapidly but still have a tiny family run company mindset. People are incredibly negative and any progress is shot down. 

I've been trying my absolute best and I was pushed to my limits when the Senior Buyer pretty much just abandoned her job. They wait 3 weeks hoping for her to come back and eventually fired her going on 4 weeks. During this time, I had to step up and run the entire department. I got lots of ""good job!"" comments but in between those I'm still getting buried in work and shit on for the mistakes of the Senior Buyer. I've just been so exhausted and there doesn't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel. They have said they are hiring another person and when I saw the salary range - it kind of made me mad. It's a good 15k more than I make. My manager has also stopped talking to me about replacing her and has transitioned to implying to train me up to work elsewhere. It's felt insulting. 

I'm now at a point where it's been 4 months and I'm just so burned out. I struggle to get up in the morning, I struggle to do any work. I'm just done. 
On top of this, I'm not even past my probation.

They said that is okay and they would be working out the offer details and they would be in touch this week. 

  
The hiring manager called me last night and said they will be offering me $170K base salary (I asked for $125K), but he needs me to relocate to CA for the role. It sounds like it is his preference and not a company requirement that I relocate. I am unable to relocate because I am a court appointed guardian for my father who had a stroke and I need to be near the care facility where he lives.

1beonr2,Should I be honest in an exit interview?,"Hi everyone, I'm leaving my corporate job to go back to retail and try to start my own business eventually. I'm wondering if I should be honest in my exit interview or not. I marked personal reasons for my reason for leaving the job because over time the job has changed me. I definitely went into the job with high hopes, but now I look like the stardew valley character before they go to the farm. 

The points that I think lead me to feeling I had to leave were: 

1. Lack of communication about my job. They did not disclose to me that I'd have to do yearly public speaking meetings. I am not a good public speaker and was caught off guard when I had to suddenly do it. I would've preferred time to prepare myself for it. 

2. Lack of training set me up to fail. In my department, they said we would be doing a job rotation so that everyone would have a back up or coverage for when they'd take vacations. On the surface, this sounds like a good idea but over time as I learned my new position I realized I was forgetting everything about my old one. 

When it comes to being set up to fail, the reason I felt this way is I had a vacation scheduled, months in advance to the point I had to wait for the vacation time to be scheduled to apply for it. And the time when we were doing the job switch, just so happened to be during my vacation. So I had less training than everyone else and a gap between when I started and when my training ended. So I did not retain the information I was learning very well. 

My boss also told me late that training was my responsibility and I should've started at the same time as everyone else did, and it was bad that I hadn't started a week prior to when I did. I have only ever worked in retail and my family's small business, so I did not know about this expectation. 
So in the end, I had 2 weeks less training than everyone else, and my boss put a lot of pressure on me to do better when I didn't have the resources to. 

3. Office Politics. Office politics really pushed me over the edge when I learned about then. My boss confronted me in my cubicle about having too many piles of paper on my desk (it was only 3) I tried to explain to her the system I was making with the piles, she interrupted and raised her voice at me while giving me an ultimatum, and I had an anxiety attack as soon as she walked away. 

My boss knows I have diagnosed anxiety and that cubicles have been a hard adjustment for me because I'm anxious about being perceived. 

What makes this worse, is in our next 1on1 during my performance review, she decided to explain Office politics to me and explained its very petty. Who on earth wants to be a part of that? Then she socialized with me, in my opinion, as an attempt to raise rapport after expressing to me that I've become unapproachable and I need to socialize with the team more. 

4. Favoritism of certain people on the team made it blatantly obvious to me I could not go to my superior if I had an issue with someone else. I felt I had lack of resources compared to other favorite team members and it made it harder to socialize with them in the end. 

- 

Should I be honest about these things? I have never done an exit interview, I'm not sure if it matters or what the point of it is exactly.

1. they are actually trying to assess if they need someone for this position 
2. they are interviewing other people to see if they might be a better fit for the role

1ben4zu,"Seeking advice for weird skill set / resume, unclear future direction","Hello! I am a 30y/o struggling to either market myself or identify potential career paths.

I worked in tech sales & consulting for 4 years out of undergrad and then in 2020 transitioned to teaching through the government run Teach for Americas program. I chose to make this change because of the deep respect I have for teachers and it felt like my last chance to do something sort of risky before I am financially responsible for kids, a home, etc. I have largely enjoyed teaching and what I have learned but it has become more and more apparent over the past year and a half or so that it is not a long-term career I am interested in pursuing.

The good news is that I am in no urgent rush to leave my job! The difficulty comes with trying to decide what to do next. As I have matured a bit, I have come to realize that I appreciate the life part of work/life balance much more than I did a few years ago. I'm aiming for a remote or hybrid job that is higher paying than teaching (although I am getting by just fine as is). I am ready to commit myself to learning new skills to make another big chance, but thinking about where to go from here leaves me feeling aimless and overwhelmed.

i have several cases that are unprecedented in how poorly handled they had been before coming to me. i took this job partly because i wanted to be the change in child welfare, but now i’m dealing with everyone else’s mistakes. i’ve reached out to my supervisor and asked for more help and guidance, and she blew me off. my mental health has been struggling and my anxiety levels have been through the roof, and now i know i won’t be receiving help from anybody it’s made it worse. 

i told myself i had to at least stick it out for a year, but i don’t know if i can take much longer. i live at home so i won’t be evicted or anything if i quit but i have a lot of debt to pay off and i need to save for masters. i’m having to battle with my own mental sanity and financial stability. 

any advice on what to do? i don’t want to quit but i don’t know how much more i can take before i break. i also am worried about how it would look if i quit my first job out of college. thank you so much everyone for any advice or tips

1bek828,What can we do to hold employers accountable for their sheer lack of ethics?,"The question is broad, I admit, but please allow me to explain. 

I have been looking for a real job for the last 7 years in my field.  I had been advised, coached, and conveyed to me that the field that I am now in will give me the opportunity to do a specific kind of work (obviously contingent on obtaining certifications and additional degrees for obvious reasons). 

Here is the problem: 

I approach a job interviews with the methods that I have both been advised and with the advice being given by numerous articles.  Understand the company, product, what the role is, great questions to ask, dress and groom accordingly, demonstrate your interest in the position and seem genuine about it.

During the interview, I speak as I deem very professional and convey all of the above.  I advocate for myself.  I explain what I would like to do and how this role will allow me to do it.  I ask great, well-thought out questions and naturally, each company will straight up lie about everything (I'm unfortunately not exaggerating). 

In my current role, for example, during the interview I was asked, ""what do you want to do?""  I responded, ""I want to work with AI and play my part in this project (succinct/paraphrasing).  I'm really not interested in doing customer service.""

During the entire time of the interviews, there are red flags everywhere.  They're not saying much of anything and giving non-responses to my questions.  Non-responses to me are simply either, the refusal to respond in any way or issuing a deliberately cryptic response for obviously bad reasons.

As previously mentioned, I was offered the job and as you likely guessed, I am once again shoved into a role that will either likely kill me by inducing a massive heart attack or brain aneurysm.

This has been every interview that I have gotten so far (even with a fabricated resume).  Honestly, I don't want to lie, I would prefer to be straightforward, honest, and direct, but if the writing is on the wall and I have to lie about my education, certifications and everything else in a much more deliberate manner, then I will be forced to do it and I will push the accountability and responsibility onto these businesses.

I have literally changed my resume to give the appearance of having some serious managerial jobs and I have explained my managerial experience by (paraphrasing), working with people to make them feel included and needed---and that's a lie.  I have always tried to put my best foot forward and just be professional.

I am now three companies in on this career path and I don't know what to do anymore.  I don't want to appear to be a job hopper by any means. I want a normal, real job that I don't need to be a slave for 18 hours a day on an obscene salaried rate that's just barely getting by (as like so many others).

I've approached interviews deliberately appearing, for lack of a better word, ""dumb,"" and wouldn't you know it, I can get a job offer.  If I display and show what I can do, nothing, and that is truly disheartening because I know what that really means.

I'm sorry for the length of this post.  It's not meant to be a vent or a rant by any means.  Like so many others, the job market and process to get a real job has been a difficult one and has been dealing serious damage to my mental health.  I'd half thought about calling the cops on my current employer and reporting them to the state(s) and federal government, but I am not stupid.  I know that that will not accomplish anything.  I am just deadlocked, like so many others.

- Has been shit talking behind our backs
- Has been stealing our sales
- Has been coming to work sometime between 11am-1pm (his work hours are 9-5) and forcing us to leave early to keep his secret.
- operating the forklift and moving heavy equipment while it has a flat tire. (State will fine up to $3k)

1bejx3i,"Stuck in a rut, jobless and without direction - please advise","Hey friends - help this brother out with advice for landing a job... here's my story ...  
  
36 M in India here. No college degree. I jumped into a customer service role at an international BPO in India (Delhi) at age 18 and progressed from there. Then I switched a few times over the years and last worked as a customer success manager for a US healthcare firm. Most of these opportunities have been through referrals.  
  
I've got a total of 12 years in customer service, account management, soft skill training, and sales. I took a break from full-time work at the start of '22 and have been looking for suitable roles for the last 5 months without any success. All I've gotten are 2 repeat interviews (both of which I cracked) for the same company for customer service operations/training manager--and got ghosted big time.  
  
Naturally, it's been frustrating and challenging for two reasons--seeing such wall-to-wall rejections is despairing & and meeting basic expenses is a steep challenge.  
  
I've applied to big, mid, and small companies, experimented with a variety of formats and styles of CV and cover letters, and sent 100s of cold messages and emails to recruiters, employees, and founders. But nothing's giving.  
  
The only interviews I've had have been through referrals from friends and ex-colleagues. And God knows that I've personally reached out to every one in my contact book or online network to ask for one.  
  
After reading a few online posts of how folks from India have bagged remote jobs abroad, I also began applying to lots of remote jobs posted from the US/first world. Again, nothing fetching.  
  
The obstacles I suppose are: 1. lack of college degree 2. career breaks (I've had two long ones).  
  
If you were in my position, what is the #1 piece of advice you would offer - not just for now, but also to navigate my work scene for another 10 years to my best advantage?  
  
(As an aside - despite my setbacks, I remain upbeat about bouncing back. I've been volunteering for arts initiatives in the meantime. My last two gigs were: interning for an L&D podcast & as a festival secretariat for a leading leading book festival. The big positive is that I've made a good impression in all the interviews that have come may way, big or small.)

I spoke with my foreign boss about how I’m not thriving with his micromanagement and even despite all that, I’m also not getting enough and organized instruction to do a task. We patched things up and he explained his side…. but that’s not what I’m here to ask.

He brought up a line from my old employer (also from a foreign company) that mentioned this, “You can give [my name] an instruction and she’d be able to do the job 100%”. Soooo….. I kind of took it negatively and thought whether it’s a bad thing I’m not capable to work without any directions? For context I work in Marketing doing research, writing and sometimes design.

I don’t know, is it bad that I wanted to know every variable of the task to be more efficient? Because if I take my own ideas and run with it, it would be a waste if I’m wrong.

1bejknn,Avionics tech wishing to be an engineer,"I'm (36) an Avionics Technician (FCC GROL, A&P, AET) transplanted into a SME position and love it. It's kind of spurred me wanting to go back to school and get an engineering degree, hopefully an FAA DER and focus on the development side of things. CAD and wiring diagrams I find oddly satisfying and feel like I could do all day. So, I'm starting to feel a pivot in my career (maybe with the same company, maybe not) however, I'm not sure how to get there from here.

My life feels insanely busy. I'm staving off burnout as it is and have traveled far too much for my taste. I'm not afraid of work, I'll work a 40 hour work week job no problem. However I admit I've enjoyed my current gig because, despite the travel which even that has been getting better, their work life balance is unparalleled. Need to take off early second time this week to hit up an errand, go. Never been denied PTO. Optional on call days if my work is all caught up. It's one of these deals where I KNOW the grass isn't going to be greener on the other side. However, I know I could get paid a lot more for less technical work somewhere else. So I'm starting to wonder what I could do to position myself to do MORE of the SME type work. Maybe make more money. Potentially even from home.

A couple of the DERs I've worked with do pretty much exactly that. Even though my experience qualifies me, the FAA will likely not give me the authorization without an actual degree. Or so I've been told. The fear I have from school is that first, Academia and I have never really gotten along. I struggle with homework on boring subjects and real life constantly seems to get in the way. So I could quit my current job and go to school full time, but that brings me to my second concern. Retirement. Men in my family have a nasty habit if not living long past retirement age, so I would really like to position myself to be able to retire early. But at 36, I feel like my retirement is not nearly as far along as I wish it was. I feel like my 401k has been stuck right around the $100k mark for the last 4 years. Not going up nearly as fast as I'd like despite contributing decently above minimum, just shy of maximum. So quitting and living off of the GI bill BAH doesn't feel like a smart move as it'll effectively pause my retirement growth for 4 years. 

I have a supportive wife who makes more than I do. I just really don't want to shoot myself in the foot because I feel like a DER, even after a degree and almost 15 years of aviation experience with steadily growing responsibility leading into engineering style work, is still not a guarantee. I'll be right back at being an Avionics Technician slugging away until maybe the FAA approved me for my DER just in time to start thinking about retirement way too late.

Should I just shut up and enjoy the comfortable lot I've got in life, or aim for the more satisfying type of work I yearn for? If there was a draftsman position where I could make wiring diagrams and documentation all day from home for 100k a year, I'd die happy right there. Everything I've found so far either requires to be an engineer, or pays way too little.",gecko1501,1,1.0,1,1710417810,2024-03-14 12:03:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bejknn/avionics_tech_wishing_to_be_an_engineer/,3,2024

I've been working in the healthcare industry for the last 4 years. Last year, my boss assigned me as a team leader and with a chance to be a practice manager in one of his clinics. And I've been doing well managing everything and going above and beyond.

Recently, my boss expanded the business and he hired a new staff(HR) to help him with the staff/managing all of the business. Currently, the business has over 100 staff across various locations.

The HR is visiting the clinic that I've been managing this week. And she asked me to organize a staff meeting to welcome her on board during her visit. And of course, I did it as it's a normal thing to do. 

At the meeting, she announced that she appointed another staff member who just come back from a long leave as a practice manager and the new practice manager would take on half of my responsibilities. It surprised me as no one ever told me anything about it. 

I'm ok with me not being the manager but I feel it’s not right. I did mention to my boss that I have too much stress and I'm happy if they find another manager. However, the new practice manager has less knowledge than me. On top of that, I have to teach the new manager about everything that I know.

Since the last post:

1.
I have had 0 feedback from my manager.
Ocasionally (around once every 3 weeks) the assistant manager pulls me aside for a few minutes to review some stuff. This clearly isnt a planned feedback session but more of a ""I saw you messed this up, let me show you how it's done"".

2.
There are 0 KPIs involved and basically I was told ""there is no evaluation/metrics unless you mess up and get pulled for feedback"".

3.
There is no training available. Most I can look forward to is (inside this department) is learning some other tasks inside the department, but nothing that really adds value.

4.
My contract ends in 3 months (should be auto-renewed for another 6 months and then 1 year every time). Also, my contract is with a recruitment company and it doesnt specify the department I am assigned to.

5.
I am getting really bored and unfocused on my work. Meaning when a moment comes that requires focus and quick/correct input,  I'm afraind I wont be ""switched on"" and will fail.

Since I'm at halfway through my contract, I am considering asking my manager for a 1-1 to ask for some feedback and plan the road ahead for the next 3 months

Any tips?
TIA

1behrla,Confused with myself,"I have had about 5 years of working in the maritime sector and was always looking to change to computing. 

Last October I kanded a position as a Data Analyst mainly though doing Excel data entries and transforming data. 

The company was oerfect, I was remote working from home and the support as well was great but the wage was a mediocre one. 

A month ago I was offered a position to go back into the maritime and the offer was crazy as I basically almost 2.5x the previous salary. I accepted the position as the company orevoously could not reach somehow the money even at a bit lower level. 

1 month after working for the shipping company, while the place is nice and people are ok, I feel like i just dumbed my dream and a company that was amazing. 

I will try to make some sort of courses to get some knowledge to try and switch back at some point but i feel also very jnstable inside me.

1begzni,I'm worried about my future job prospects,"For some brief context - after graduating high school (2021), I took a gap year (2022) in order to take some classes and get some casual work experience. It also allowed me to earn/save money because after this gap year, I intended to move cities and commence university. During my first year of university (2023), my mental health started to decline. I noticed a real shift in the grades I was getting, and eventually things snowballed and now I have very much fallen behind in a lot of my subjects. I started my second year (2024) and found that things had only gotten worse for me, and it was almost embarrassing showing up to class considering how much knowledge I was lacking. My deteriorating mental state has truly stunted my capabilities. So, I made a rather last minute choice yesterday to suspend/defer my studies for a year. In 2025 I'll return to university as normal to complete my second year, and then of course I'll go on to complete the rest of my degree. I'll graduate when I'm 23. 

Now, in my mind, I think this is a smart choice. Better I graduate a year later with results I am proud of, and having truly enjoyed the experience; as opposed to sticking it out and producing horrible grades (which was most certainly going to happen). However, this was a big choice for me and so understandably I have some concerns. 

Specifically, I am worried about getting a job later in life. So, to those of you here that are more plugged in than I, I have the following question - do employers care about the nitty gritty details of how you went about completing your degree? Will they raise a brow at someone who took a year off in the middle of their degree? (It's not like I'll be doing absolutely nothing, I'm still working a job full time this year). But will this matter? Is this a black mark on my academic/education history? Does this make it seem like I have a poor work ethic? I still have massive career aspirations, however I just needed this time. Long-story short, should I be worried that this choice is going to impact my reputation, and make me less attractive to future employers?  (If an answer will vary depending on the location, I am from Australia). 

(Sorry as well if this question happens to have an obvious answer, but I don't know much about this stuff, and I get mixed answers from people I know in my personal life. Google also has not been too helpful) ",zar1naaa27,1,1.0,1,1710407695,2024-03-14 09:14:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1begzni/im_worried_about_my_future_job_prospects/,3,2024

1befsau,Working Holiday Visa (Brisbane),"Hi, so I recently moved over from the UK to Brisbane on a working holiday visa.  I travelled across South East Asia for a few months before coming over. I am fortunate enough to have family who live here so don’t need to worry about things such as rent. I would like to travel to other parts in Australia in the future though. 

I have a degree in Business and experience at Enterprise Rent a car, Office work for the council and estate agency. 

I managed to find a job within a few weeks in a position that advertised itself as sales + marketing. However, when I started it turned out to be door to door sales.

The first couple of weeks went well, performed well, everyone liked me and my attitude but the only issue was the work life balance + the repetition of the role, so I ended up leaving this week. It may have been naive of me to leave without finding something else but in the 2/3 weeks I’ve been there I’ve seen 5 people go already. If I stayed I could see my motivation draining and I didn’t want to be in the position where they let me go for not meeting targets.

I would typically wake up at 6/6:30 am and get to work for 8/8:30. We would finish on the field at 6pm on most days but wouldn’t get back to the office until about 7pm. After my commute back home it would be 8pm and after having dinner + a shower I would only have an hour of free time before heading to bed. Typically I’d be waiting for Friday / Saturday night which is exactly the kind of thing I wanted to get away from in the UK

Would be great to potentially get something that can progress my career but I’m essentially here to try new things and for the  journey. 

If anyone has any advice/tips/feedback it would be greatly appreciated.

1bef398,Can’t choose between 2 jobs,"Hi. I am a woman in my early 20s in New York. My background is primarily fashion events / marketing / PR. It’s a difficult career to get into and I’ve been fortunate enough to work at a popular fashion magazines & events like nyfw and the met gala so I am very grateful & don’t take anything for granted. I had 2 surgeries in October and November and have been unemployed since with 0 luck. I applied to a data analyst job and surprisingly heard back 2 days ago. After I confirmed to interview with the research company, I receive a message requesting an interview from a fashion brand in their office which also caught me by surprise. The data analyst job hired me today but I worry that I’m making the wrong decision. The data job is remote and pays double than what the fashion company does, which is great but I also accepted the job because I didn’t want to be unemployed anymore. Now that I have the option to work in fashion again I want to- but the salary would be what I was making in 2022 and it’s onsite. So here’s the dilemma: 1. I want to work where my passion is in fashion/beauty and I’m afraid I won’t enjoy the data analyst job. 2. The fashion job is 45k a year and onsite but the data job is double that salary and remote. 3. Of course it’s my luck I’d get called by these jobs on the same day but I’m afraid to stop the onboarding process since I don’t know when I’ll get a job opportunity again because the job market is terrible.

I still don't have the answer for the sick leave policy, but considering this is a remote job, would you take the offer? 

I am considering to take this job because.

I wouldn't say I ever loved what I was doing, but got to a point where I was content last year. Then, as it happens, I got laid off in the third round of my company's layoffs.

I landed somewhere early this year doing payroll, a process I was pretty familiar with. Just a few months into this new job, my confidence and overall desire to be in this realm has been seriously rocked. My boss micromanages me, nitpicks every single mistake no matter how irrelevant or miniscule, and questions almost everything I do. It's gotten so bad that a task which usually takes me 30 minutes took me 2 hours today. I kept second guessing everything I did and, being hyper aware of the time, I felt like I was a complete failure.

I've been applying elsewhere for a few days now,  but I don't know what I want to do.

1bedi1y,How can I bounce back?,"I took my life in the wrong direction and made some mistakes. I worked at Amazon in a fulfillment center as an Area Manager II for 3 years after college. It took a terrible toll on my physical health. I did not sleep, eat, or drink right and was not taking care of myself correctly in the slightest. One day I woke up and decided I needed to take a personal leave because I was fed up.
My leave lasted 3 months. When it ended in December, I did not return. I never took the time to sort my life out properly until recently. For those months, I did make the mistake of wasting a lot of time. Not planning out what my next steps were, drinking, smoking weed, and avoiding my problems. It was irresponsible and stupid.
For the past 2-3 months I have taken time to contront my past and create a more clear vision for my life. I rarely drink, I don't smoke weed, and I am taking better care of myself. I do have more work to do, but l am in a better place. For me to progress further I need to get off my butt, get back to work, adopt some responsibility again, and pursue my vision for my future. This is where I am running into an issue and would appreciate any sort of guidance.

I cannot land a job for the life of me. I have 2 B.B.A's under my belt from a popular state university concentrated in Business Management and the other in Human Resources Management. I have loads of great extracurriculars from college. I have a few years of Amazon experience in management and some successful projects from there as well. I have a few interviews that have gone well, but ended without ar offer. I would say about 90% of the jobs are frontlit management positions as I don't want to set the bar vo high. My goal salary is 60k, give or take 10k. My career interest areas are entry to mid-level management in just about any industry, Human Resources (training or recruitment), or entry level position at a consulting firm.

My significant other suggests setting the bar lower and apply for jobs that have low qualifications like a cashier or stocking shelves. Then focus more on my aspirations for some better down the road.

1bed14g,Just lost my job; how much danger am I in?,"I have over 5 years of experience as a project manager for large industrial construction projects and was let go from my job today. 

I have two major problems right now that are scaring the living shit out of me that I won't be able to make ends meet. 

The first is that my finances are shot. This is 2nd time I've lost my job with the past 15 months. After the last time, being out of work for a couple months and getting hit with some major unexpected medical expenses, my liquid savings were basically wiped to zero. I've been spending the last year trying to fix that and start building up an e-fund again, but it hasn't been easy and I've only managed to put away about $3k-$4k in cash.

The second problem is that this is the 4th job I've had in this industry in 5 and a half years. I left my first job after 2 years due to covid shutting down the industry in the area, and the second after 13 months when I was poached by another company for a 40% pay increase. At the third company, I was in way over my head and given a position I was not ready for, leading me to get fired a little over a year in. With the fourth and most recent company, I was brought on to clean up a multi-year project with major issues. I did some good work with it, but never was able to quite get it to the finish line and was let go after a year. 

  
I've started applying to new jobs and have been told by recruiters this looks pretty bad. On the plus side, I spent over a year at every job, so I'm very confident in my experience and abilities. On the other hand, I feel like my resume makes me look like either a textbook job-hopper or someone who's incapable of holding down a job for more than a year. It also doesn't help that the 2 jobs I was let go from were my two most recent. 

It's only been a day, but I did the math and if I bring in $0 of income, I'll be completely out of cash in just 3 weeks. Even if I can figure out a way to bring in half of my net income, I'll be lucky to make it into May. Even if the job market for my industry is great right now, in my experience, the time from submitting a full-time job application to getting an offer and starting work at said job is like 4-6 weeks *at best.*

So... yeah, I'm absolutely terrified I'm not going to be able to provide for my family. If anyone has some advice, reassuring words or just anything that I need to hear, I'll gladly take it.

I have a degree in computer science, but soon after graduating I felt like I wouldn’t do very well working in the tech industry as I wasn’t really into programming and coding and gravitated more towards website design and then an opportunity fell into my lap to work for a prestigious construction company as a sales person, so I took it and I was successful and was able to generate leads and help close multiple deals however because of my shy and introverted nature I felt like all the pushiness of cold calls, emails and basically constantly nagging people seemed desperate and wasn’t for me so I quit. 

I then leaned into my passion of interior design and became a self taught drafter/ renderer of interiors and yet again I was able to make a living out of it, but it isnt a high paying job especially in this economy for a single mom trying to make it on her own.

1becqef,To wait or play it safe? ,"Without going into too much detail, 
I am a leader/ machine learning engineer in technology, what I would consider to be an overachiever (I poured my heart and soul into this startup) and have been working for the last 3.5 years with a good salary at said startup. 

Well, startup could not raise enough money given the current state of the economy during scaling and cut the fat in december to just a tech team of 7. Now this month, they essentially booted the 2 highest earners at the company, me and another American, and stripped it to the bare bones mostly consisting of the CTO, foreign talent, and a mostly-finished product. The firing struck everyone left to their core (as we were both leads in the company) and in my off boarding conversations, has everyone worried the company is going under.

That being said, onto new things. 

I was immediately aggressively pursued for a lead data role at a large multi-billion dollar org. Role seems interesting, decent salary, but then they drop on me that this would be a contracting role.  I'm nervous about this as I don't want to go through the whole job search again and a year, do not know what it would mean in my career development, and don't want to be the ""easy cut for logistics reasons"" should the economy get worse (big co's dont care), and don't just want to be exploited labor (again). It's also worth noting id be significantly younger (by 5-12 years it seems depending on the person) than anyone on my ""team"" that I have met so far, and unsure how that could limit my growth as well.

I've already got 3 other interviews in process of being setup for 1st rounds, all would be direct hire and also seem interesting, but all 3 are dilly dallying causing me to lose a bit of trust in their urgency versus the above that sent me an offer in 10 days.  I've also gotten offers to move out of state to NYC for a (significantly) higher salary, even factoring in cost of living, but am uncertain of doing that as my wife is a high earner, hitting a huge stride in her career.

My plan to this point has been to stall the large company, which I've done for about 6 days so far successfully, but I'm unsure how much longer I can keep doing that without raising major suspension.

I know this may come across as boo hoo to some, seeing as I have an offer and significant interest immediately after being let go when many of my peers have been out a job for months, but I genuinely am lost in a cross roads and seeking advice.  I think it's also worth pointing out I'm physically exhausted after all of the effort I put into this startup. I began before I even graduated grad school (with a few weeks left at the CEOs request), took my finals while working full time, took 10 total days off (including holidays) my first year, etc. And am actually in a way looking forward to a bit of a career reset and a few weeks of rest. Problem is job searching is NOT by any means rest 😂. I just REALLY don't trust this market with a lot of tech companies on hiring freezes and the market in some ways oversaturated, even if I am at a senior IC level. 

If you were me would you take the guarantee, or wait it out for something that could potentially fit your ideals better?

1beat0v,Am I on a normal path? What should I do now?,"I graduated college in June 2023. It was difficult to get a job as I am in the film (my skills are specifically in sound) industry. The strikes did not make it easy.

 I had plenty of lower level internships in college (with a matching portfolio). I finally landed a corporate internship at a pretty high profile company that marries my interests — I work full for a music company in their video production department. However, as it is an internship, the pay is absolutely abysmal. The job also requires insane amounts of overtime that I was not expecting. 

In addition, I was expecting grunt work, but now I’m learning that I’m going to be doing way more grunt work outside of my specialty than was discussed in my interview. I’m not sure if this will be valuable experience. The only thing that’s holding me back is the brand name.

I also learned that this position has absolutely no chances of progression. Once my internship is over, I’m out of a job. 

Is this normal for a college graduate like me? All of my friends are working 60,000/yr jobs already. I was thinking maybe they were just outliers and that my situation is something everyone goes through. Older members of my family are telling me to look for jobs NOW and get out as soon as I can because I should make more with my degree, but I’m not sure if that’s just outdated advice. This was literally the only job out of like 1000 I applied for to even offer so much as an interview. What should my next steps be?

1beakh2,Is this normal? I’m changing departments and can no longer do certain tasks (that shouldn’t have been my responsibility to begin with). Current manager is not communicating the revised workload to his team and I’m at a loss. What should I do? ,"To elaborate on the title, about 2 months after I started my job, they laid off a man in an adjacent position to me. He was the only other person in the company who regularly used the same tool I use. After he was gone, his work fell on my plate. My manager assured me at the time that I was not to replace him, and to continue doing my regular job. Then the hypocrite would go on to ask me to do their projects. They never rehired his role.

I was bright-eyed and trying to prove myself a team player so I took on the work and even learned some new skillsets. Then I got in way over my head. I was hired to do a specific niche of the business, but found myself taking general business requests from all over in a company of 400 people. It was unsustainable. 

The business reorganized and thankfully I’m now moving away from my current manager to a different team and my “official” role is what I was hired to do in the first place.

While we transition, I asked who should be taking on all those other tasks, as the next obvious teams to handle these projects would be in his department. He gave me some confusing run-around but suggested some names. When I went to one of those people to talk about the reorg, she was shocked when I asked “what should the process be when it comes to X requests?”. My manager hadn’t told her anything, and I had to awkwardly explain my position. She told me her team doesn’t really know the tool I use and aren’t experienced in the type of work. 

I’m so frustrated because I know people are just going to keep coming to me because there’s no one else to do it. Some of this I brought onto myself by building dashboards that need maintenance. I’m already doing the work of 2 people and when I officially move, I’ll be learning new ideas. There’s no way I can do everything. 

Anyone been in this spot before? What can I do?",MyFifthSecretAcct,5,1.0,5,1710383948,2024-03-14 02:39:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1beakh2/is_this_normal_im_changing_departments_and_can_no/,3,2024

1bea7xl,Work Policy. Fair or unfair? BPO company with ridiculous attendance and pay policies.,"Hello everyone. I’m currently employed sa isang BPO company dito province. And tho alam ko naman na unfair talaga, I also want to ask for your opinions and advice if possible. 

So more than a year na ako nagtatrabaho sa BPO company na ito. And they have the most ridiculous policy regarding attendance. Wala kaming paid leave, bawal kami umabsent during “critical” working days, at ang pinakanakakaloka sa lahat: Kapag nale-late kami kahit 1 minute lang, ang pay samin ay half lang. Meaning, if 1,000 ang sahod per day, at malate kami, 500 lang makukuha namin. Walang rason rason. Basta matic malate ng 1 minuto, half day na agad ang kaltas.

Hindi ako makaalis kasi sobrang hirap makahanap ng work nowadays and nasira din yung laptop ko na pwede sana sa online jobs (na uncertain din naman ang job security. Breadwinner din naman ako, so takot ako umalis. 

Sobrang stressed ko sa policy na ito kasi wala naman gustong malate sa trabaho. And even after coming late to work, expected pa rin kami na buuin yung shift with half of our daily rate. 🥲

1bea65y,Needing a soundboard for particular instance | Brand voice and strategic communications,"Hi there,   


I had a sort of touch day at work.   


**A little background:**  
I am a social media manager for a college.  
I'm labeled as a ""social media team"" but it is just me managing 4 social media channels with 100k+ followers. My boss doesn't seem to understand the full extent of my job and role.   


**On a post today, a follower commented and tried to point out a mistake that he thought we had made on a Facebook post. He basically mansplained our university's history to us. I've seen this guy in other threads related to our university and he isn't a fan of our current leadership. A lot of other followers corrected him and we added some context very politely, explaining the post (these details don't really matter beyond the fact that several people commented back to him to correct his snarky comment). We all moved on.** 

Later in the day, he took to Instagram where one other person had pointed out the ""mistake"". He commented that he had made the same observation but was chastised on Facebook and that ""The post was incomplete and the social team was not the best."" Our brand responded ""Speaking on incomplete... think you meant the BEST social team. Fixed it for you <3"".   


The guy immediately called our office, threatened to pull his donation and continued with a bunch of other complaints that had nothing to do with me, social media, etc. Clearly I struck a nerve (on accident, truly). He is really offended and said that what we said was like a punch to the face and we made him feel dumb. Personally, I'm having a hard time feeling empathetic after seeing his previous comments on our content. 

Then, my boss shared a screenshot of our comment exchange with our entire department despite it only being relevant to me and my direct supervisor and told me to remove the comment immediately. Which I did.   
1) I'm really embarrassed by how this was handled. 2) I don't think the brand's response was a punch in the face. 

It was instagram and our brand voice is a bit more playful and a lot more interactive and engaging on Instagram. I missed the mark but the DM of the guy saying we lost him as a donor and the call to my office feels extreme.   


I'm not in trouble at work. Just disappointed in how it was handled and I'm not sure how disappointed I should be in myself. 

&#x200B;

Any advice, thoughts, etc. are appreciated.   


Thanks! ",Wooden-Fix-7172,1,1.0,0,1710382800,2024-03-14 02:20:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bea65y/needing_a_soundboard_for_particular_instance/,3,2024
1bea1pt,Should I demote myself?,"Needing some additional sound boarding on an imminent decision I must make -- should I demote myself?

Backstory: I've been with my company for 5 years. I'm mid-level in my career, and have historically been pretty career driven. I am mid/late 30s, but completed a career change about 8 years ago, which has made me feel that I am behind where I ""should"" be in my career at this point.

I have wanted a promotion for a while now, and have put in the work to go above and beyond to gain a promotion over the last year / year and a half. I finally was promoted in late Nov (2023). However, I'm considering stepping back into my old role at this point for a number of reasons, outline below:

- PAY -- I would actually get a (albeit small) pay *bump* if I were to step back. I was slightly above the mid point of my old pay grade, but am at the low point of my new pay grade, so only got a 2.25% pay increase with this promotion (even though it jumped me two salary grades). The company has a new comp philosophy that did not allow for any negotiation. This was already a raw deal from my perspective, but the real kicker / cherry on top is that this promotion actually meant that I wasn't eligible for a 4.5% company-wide comp adjustment that everyone else got on Jan 1 (because my promotion took effect in Q4, and promotions in Q4 were decided to be ineligible for the comp adjustment). *And even though* my manager told my I would get the comp adjustment when she made me the offer and I was trying to negotiate my salary (unsuccessfully due to the stringent new comp philosophy, where every position had a pre-approved hiring start rate that was non-negotiable). She didn't know at the time that I would be ineligible for the comp adjustment (I truly believe that is true), but nonetheless, she did tell me I would get it, and I didn't. So at the end of the day, if I demoted myself, I would step back into a rate that would actually be 2.25% *above* my current pay. (I've already confirmed that they would honor the 4.5% adjustment in my old role still.) Though it's not a big increase we're  talking about here, the entire situation just really, really rankles me....

- SCHEDULE -- I'm in a supervisory role now, which means coming into the office 3 days/week instead of 2 days/week. My company recently implemented this increased RTO in Feb this year, up from 1 day/week previously. For me, this is a huge downside. I have come to very, *very* highly value work-from-home, and the shift from one day in office to three these past 6 weeks has been r-o-u-g-h. My only hesitation with this as a considering factor in whether or not to step back is that I do not believe the 2 days/week for non-supervisory roles is going to last. I believe that once they've figured out the space constraints issues of being in office, everyone will be back in 3 days/week. I just don't know when that would happen.... Could be a couple months, could be till the end of the year. Who knows. If it were till the end of the year, that might give me enough time to find another job that hopefully would be remote (I'm looking, but the market is trash right now).

- MANAGER -- My current manager is one of the biggest reasons I'm unhappy. She didn't used to be as bad as she is now, but in the last 1.5 / 2 years, it's gotten really bad. We have a new CHRO, and I think our old CHRO kept a level of humanity to the overall culture thats since been lost. With my manager, especially lately, I feel like my opinion/thoughts never matter, it causes great anxiety to ever request any time off or schedule adjustments (I'm salaried, but even asking to leave an hour or two early for a doctor's appointment feels like pulling teeth), she is always argumentative and always has to be ""right"", never let's you have a dissenting opinion or different idea, has no respect foryour time (example: I had a meeting a few weeks back that was supposed to be an hour with her; she was 25 min late, then kept me on with her for 2.5 hours after she joined; yes youbread that right, two and a half hours). She frequently has emotional outbursts, talks trash about everyone (including us, her own direct reports, to each other), and has made myriad off-color comments related to team members' pregnancies and leaves of absence. One of our team members has actually just raised a formal complaint against her to our CHRO and CEO. If I were to demote myself, she would no longer be my direct manager. Awkwardly, one of my (new) coworkers (who is currently a level below me) would take my place. I don't have a good sense for what he'd be like as a supervisor because he's pretty new still, but I have to think he'd be better than it is now. I also think I've developed a pretty good relationship with him thus far, and think he'd be generally more chill, but I don't really know.


These are the main reasons I want to step back. The reasons I want to stay are:

- TITLE -- The title for my resume. As I've said, I already feel behind in my career, and I worked hard for this promotion. () I had hoped I could take this title and leverage it into another job, which I'm still trying to do but the market is suuuper crap right now. 

- THE JOB -- The job has issues and isn't still as autonomous as I'd like it to be, but it at least has *some* level of discretionary decision making to it, which I've been wanting more of for years. I usually take pride in being an excellent employee and doing good work, and kind of get excited at some of the work opportunities that come with this role (though in all honestly, I've had a really hard time motivating lately, especially with the extra-crappy promotion that decreased my pay and put me in the office *more*....so tbf I'm not producing work to the level I usually do.....).

- MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CO-SUPERVISOR -- I have a direct counterpart who was also promoted to the supervisory role at the same time (these are two new positions that were just created), and I feel like we've trauma-bonded these last few months because of our manager, lol. It would suck to have to change our dynamic because it's one of my only silver linings to this job lately.

1be9wxb,How can I best protect myself during employment negotiations?,"How can I best protect myself during employment negotiations?

I am currently employed at what I would consider a quality employer (small to mid-sized). The pay is comfortable for the position (cybersecurity) and the benefits are good. Additionally, I very much appreciate the company culture. All that being said, I would like to continue to develop as a professional and I'm not sure what opportunities or on what timeline that would be possible at my current organization.

I was recently interviewed for a position at one of the major tech companies. Both the position and pay would be improvements from where I currently am. I meet the qualifications and I suspect the interview went very well. I don't want to be presumptuous but I do want to be prepared in the event I am offered a position. Obviously to accept, I will have to leave a pretty secure and otherwise comfortable position to enter an unknown, much larger organization. I am worried primarily that I am trading job security for increased financial incentives and want to make sure I position myself so the trade is worth it. These organizations have a reputation of over-hiring and then cutting. I do not want to leave my current employer  just to become a stat during some round of layoffs and then be unemployed with 0 leverage. 

If I am offered a position, what can I negotiate that will decrease my likelihood of being cut or at the very least allow me some security in the event parting ways is unavoidable(severance, contact, etc.)? What are some red flags I can be on the lookout for or questions I can directly ask to best inform my decision prior to acceptance? Any other advice would also be appreciated.

1be8ils,Should I apply for this new role knowing it’s secretly promised to someone else?,"For years, my company has been talking about adding a new role that’s essentially a project manager/jack of all trades to help connect our disjointed teams. From the first mention of this, I made it very clear to my boss that this is a position I would be interested in and she has helped me build my inter-team knowledge to help me be a prime candidate. 

Two years ago, they went with an external hire who would fill this role. Because of my knowledge and the processes I had built out, I was tasked with training her on everything related to our team. Other teams had tasked other people to train her on their jobs. But when push came to shove, she didn’t really do much. She wasn’t very self-driven and her manager was very hands off. Basically, the company decided the role wasn’t viable based on the fact that she added no value. She was laid off and the plans to build an entire team cancelled. 

I’ve waited patiently since then. New leadership had been hired since that experiment. Leadership that had that role in previous companies and thought it was needed. Over time, there started to be whispers about trying again. Whispers turned into brainstorming. Brainstorming turned into budgeting. And finally, at a meeting last week, it was announced that we’d be piloting this new role (under a different name) and the req was opened that morning. The pilot person would be the one building the workflow and what the role looked like. If it was successful, we’ll start staffing a full team in Q4. 

I immediately went to my boss and told her I was thinking of going for the job. She told me I was a prime candidate and that my name had been floated around by almost everyone on the hiring committee. Then she told me that it wasn’t worth my effort right now because the job was promised to someone else but I would most likely be the first hire in Q4. 

I’m pissed. A) I don’t like that this entire team is at risk of one person again. B) the time the req opening and me asking my boss was maybe 3 hours. So the req isn’t even a real req. it’s an ass covering req. And C) I know this person. Yes, they outrank me (manager vs non manager) but this is a completely new role not in management and I have cleaned up several of their mistakes in rollouts they led because I have more actual skill/knowledge of the various departments. 

I’m thinking of going for the job anyways even though it feels futile. I just don’t want to start shit because my boss is on the hiring committee and I technically didn’t get her blessing to go for this job. 

Would it be career suicide to apply anyways?

1be8bn5,"At 23, should I stay at Fortune500 or leave for small consulting firm?","TLDR: 23 years old. 5 years study in cooperation with Fortune500 firm and working there. Got offer from Fortune500 and small Business Intelligence consulting firm. Happy at Fortune500 but maybe like BI tasks better. Don't know what to do?

Hi,  
I am 23 and will soon have my Masters degree. I got this and my Bachelors degree in cooperation with a Fortune500 company in the IT field which is possible through a program here in Germany. Therefore I worked for the Fortune500 company for 5 years already, the first 3 only in different projects for a few months to discover the company and the last 2 years I've been working in one departement. I think I do a pretty good job there, as I am well known and respected as a couple of colleagues forgot I was only working part-time (Masters degree), I get quite a lot of responsibility compared to others in the program and I already got an offer without me asking for that same role to become a full-time employee after Masters is finished. I really like my team and my tasks there too, so originally my plan was to stay.  
However now a local small Business Intelligence consulting firm contacted me. I wouldn't call them a startup as they're not developing something new but they are 5 people of which I know 4 fairly well (they are 10-15 years older). The Business Intelligence and Data Analytics field really interests me really fits my degrees as well, arguably more than what I am currently doing (however I can't compare as I didn't do this day to day yet). I will be talking to them more about my potential role and my position etc. tomorrow.  
I already know my proposed salary for the Fortune500 company which isn't negotiable and is 66k (54k base & 12k bonus). Looking at the current state of the market for the other job I find a range of 50-60k so a little bit lower, as my colleagues told me that they usually receive minimum 80% of the bonus or more.  
I know I am in a really luxurious position right now but unfortunately that doesn't make the decision any easier.  
What would you do and why?  
What should I ask for at the consulting firm (stock options?)?  
What are thing I should consider (pros, cons)?

This job is training 40 participants virtually for 8 hours a day and it’s exhausting. I have a teenage daughter and in the last 6 months her mental health has tanked. I have pulled her out of school and we are doing a virtual school from home instead but despite that, medication and therapy she’s still struggling. The combination of this and my stressful role at work has me rethinking everything. My old role I had before this corporate training job is hiring again at $19.50/hr. It is a quiet paperwork type job that is production based but no talking or being “on”. It is flex where you can work any hours you choose from 6am-6pm with a max of 10 hours a day. So I would have the potential of having an extra day in the week off. I’m a single mom so I feel like this is a bad look to step down but I almost feel like this season of life my daughter needs me more and I would have more flexibility to go to her appointments.

Title sums it up. 

I felt it was a great interview, I hit the nail on the head with qualifications, and I was clear and concise on how I formatted my answers to correspond with the job role. She seemed very excited to be interviewing me, and said I’m the person they are looking for(yeah yeah I know, probably gaslighting). At the end, she explained the next steps in the interview process, said she’d hand the notes off to the hiring team, and said she would let me know the results either way. That last point didn’t set well with me, so I asked a friend and he said that is 100% a bad sign.

She used to LOVE me - she would always shower me with compliments, not just between us but also publicly, and gave me a lot of exposure and opportunities for growth, which I am very grateful for.  
This has changed 180 since her new boss came.  
Her new boss, from the moment he joined, wanted to overhaul all existing processes and structures, and naturally this has created some tensions with my boss who has been in the organization for a very long time (She is also a lot older and has way more experience than him)  
I am not sure why exactly, but her new boss really took a liking to me and I have been working a lot with him directly recently. And recently, there have been some difficult situations for me e.g. him inviting me to meetings that my boss should usually be invited to, him talking to me directly on tasks skipping my boss, etc.  
Three months since my boss's boss joined, my boss no longer wants to give me high-visibility tasks, easily gets annoyed at me, and disagrees with almost everything I say. Today, after my boss's boss complimented me on a draft of a document that I've been working on, my boss said she will take over from here and finish it herself! (This has never happened to me before.)  
From the surface, it looks like we get along, but I can tell for sure something has changed.  
I don't know how to tackle this situation. I obviously want to be on good terms with both.

1be0bm4,"Was planning to quit and change careers, now manager advised me for a promotion earlier than anticipated, not sure how to feel.","Hey everyone, some background information:  
I (22M) am currently a r&d test technician, going to school full time at community college for an associate’s in business administration, then transferring to university for a bachelor’s in supply chain management.  I graduate with the associate’s April of 2024 and planned to transfer in the fall.

HOWEVER, I decided to forgo getting the bachelor’s and will be done with school after getting the associate’s. A desk job is not for me.  I love to work with my hands and problem-solve and being able to see the fruits of my labor every day.  I was interested in skilled trades apprenticeships like IBEW electrician and IUEC but those are very lucrative around me and have long waitlists until 2025ish.

When I started at my current role in February of 2023, my supervisor had a meeting and said I would be promoted after a year.  In January of 2024, I met all the requirements and asked for status on the promotion which was met with “promotion will come along in the fall, come back to us after you get your associate’s”(associate’s was a requirement I didn’t know was required).  Ok, no biggie, I’ll just wait it out since the job is pretty gravy, just the money could be better.  

For a while I felt that this job wasn’t for me, just held out for that promotion that ended up being delayed so I was always looking for opportunities in the skilled trade sector.  This brought me to looking into diesel mechanic jobs which, I love working on cars and trucks and I am mechanically inclined, seemed like a no-brainer.  There is always work and I got many replies back from applications sent out even though I have no experience.

I accepted a job last week as a entry-level diesel mechanic, for more money than the promotion was said to be, with union benefits, healthcare, a pension, more PTO, etc.  Unfortunately I am a contractor at my current job right now with potential to be hired in full-time.  I am still waiting to put in 2-weeks notice since my start date isn’t until mid-April.

Fast-forward to today, my manager told me to fill out a promotion form to submit to senior management.  Now, I am a pretty anxious and shy dude, I always dread putting in my two-weeks at every job since I usually get along great with everyone no matter where I go.  My coworkers are great, just the job isn’t really fulfilling and I don’t see that much career growth besides getting a bachelor’s and jumping out of testing but staying at the company.  I love physically wrenching and diagnosing and working on cars and trucks and this job just isn’t that.  

So I guess I am just looking for advice on whether I am making the right decision or not.  I feel really guilty and shitty, listening in on meetings, speaking to everyone with everyone talking about our future together here.  All I can do is just smile and agree even though only I know the truth.

Thanks for reading and advice you can offer.  Hopefully it makes sense and is coherent LOL.",Sea_Disaster_7120,1,1.0,1,1710358036,2024-03-13 19:27:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1be0bm4/was_planning_to_quit_and_change_careers_now/,3,2024

I have looked at insurance agent positions that require licenses like Life and Health Insurance and Property and Causality licenses. They seem to be decent. 

If I obtain these licenses, do I need anything else to work in such positions? Also, should I get both, or is one enough?

I’m not paid enough for that. Anyways, they are making some serious budget cuts which has me worried something serious is going to happen. Any other companies making budget cuts too?

1bdy33i,Advice on how to ask my boss to move with my partner temporarily but still work remotely? ,"My partner and I are both in our mid-to-late twenties. We have been together for 7 years. My partner is being relocated for his job temporarily (2.5 months). The relocation would be cross country (NY to California). He has expressed that he really would like for me to move with him as it would be a new/exciting experience for us both since we’ve only ever lived on the East Coast (which I agree with). I work remotely but am local to my company so I have the occasional “we need you to come in for xyz” every few months, however I know of these instances in advance, they are never urgent, and they are far and few between so I mainly work from home. Lastly, we don’t have kids so that’s not a factor. I’m struggling with bringing up the conversation of working from California for a short time to my boss because I keep having the thought that it would seem kind of silly to move just for 2 months, with no reason to give other than my partner will be there and it would be nice to be there with them. It’s not that I can’t live without my partner for a few months (we were long distance for 2 years before moving in together) but I would like to be there with him and experience a different place. Am I overthinking this? Is there a better way to bring up the conversation that doesn’t make it seem like I’ll just be away (but still working) for a couple months to follow my male partner?

TL;DR - How do I ask my boss to move to California for 2.5 months with my long-term partner without it seeming like I’m just following him and not prioritizing my own job/career? Or am I just overthinking this?

When I started in my role, I knew I wasn’t passionate about the industry but I enjoyed my job, had an amazing manager, and worked with great people. My manager left the company 3 months ago and I now have manager who I don’t like and is working on a massive restructuring which will change my job role significantly. As part of that restructuring, the company has paid for me and a few others to go through a professional certification course which only reaffirmed that my job role will be changing in a way I do not like.

I’m struggling with the feeling that I’m being disingenuous by agreeing to continue going through trainings when I know I don’t want to stay in this role much longer.

Current Role: Admin at a public institution, offering flexible hours, hybrid work, long lunches, and a full time positopm that requires low-stress work for aboutonly about 20 hours a week. Ideal, but it's contract-based and future is shaky with budget cuts.

• Good vacation time, low-stress environment
• Preferably remote or hybrid setups

1bdwfnr,Feeling unhireable ,"Just got an email saying I didn't get the job.  I thought it was a sure thing - worked for the company in the past, had positive notes on my file, had a good employee referral, tons of experience with the type of work...I was confident in the interview, I turned on the charm that had gotten me positions in the past.  In the end, it doesn't matter.  It was a position I was qualified for and confident in, had the pay and schedule I was looking for, and I was excited to rejoin the company.

Still didn't get the job.

I know this is temporary, but I just feel worthless right now.  I'm finding myself regretting the years I spent pursuing a degree in a niche career field, chasing that dream for far too long...where if I had just quit school and stayed with that company to begin with, who knows right?

I know I'm not going to stay in this place too long, but right now I'm feeling down.  I spent almost fifteen years chasing after a dream that has little applicable skill in the real world (7 years getting 2 degrees in audio recording, then several years running a studio up until it got shut down recently).  There's not much in the way of stable work in that field, so I'm wanting to change gears back to something regular and reliable...and I'm afraid that my history of rejecting it for the sake of a gamble is now coming back and showing its teeth.  I have people to worry about now, I have a family I'm trying to take care of...I need something to count on, and I thought for sure this was it.

I've faced lack of support from my boss and unclear goals. These are things that i have NEVER delt with in all of my years working only read about - I guess it was my turn to deal with these type of workplace issues.  From day one, I have questioned why they hired me (literally - i have asked my boss this question) Honestly, I'd have left months ago if I didn't need to work. I am actively seeking employment.

But now, it seems they might be trying to fire me. I received a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) a week ago. It lists performance issues that aren't true, based on hearsay from a small group of people who have a crazy amount of influence on my boss.  I can't fight some points due to lack of initial documentation, but I have evidence disproving others. 

Frankly, I just want to focus on my work. Unfortunately, the PIP lacks clear goals and reads more like an incident report. They claim my signature is only for receipt, not agreement. I don't agree with that. When you sign any document,  you agree to the content. 

Here's my question: Do I need to sign this PIP? They want it back. I don't mind signing, if it was an actual plan or at least had truth statements.

1bduu8c,Is being honest in an interview a good strategy?,"Hi all,

This is a question for the hiring managers, I'd appreciate your perspective.

Long story short, I got a degree in a scientific field, I published two papers, went to work in a hospital genetics laboratory before deciding I no longer want to work in the field of genetics.

I then quit my job in 2021 and pursued being an entrepreneur and whilst I have learned a lot my pursuits haven't worked out just yet. I have thought about what I want to do and I have decided I'd rather keep trying at starting my own business so I want to get a part time job to act as a safety net while I continue to pursue my own business outside of work.

How do hiring managers feel about someone of my profile? am I a risk? Should I be totally honest in interviews? The reality is, I want a job to cover very basic expenses whilst I work on getting myself off the ground.

My long term plan is to become autonomous, I'd rather earn less and be self-employed than work for someone else. That said, I'm a solid worker, I work from the moment I walk in to the moment I leave and I never cause friction or trouble at work so I wouldn't be a headache for management.

What's the best approach to take in interviews?

Thanks.

1bduo7s,"Became ill, got less work but also any chance of growth has been tanked","I love the company I work for and my colleagues are nice. Not willing to change jobs right now. 
A couple of months ago I had a burn-out, recovered relatively quickly but still was overworked. I work as a application manager in healthcare. I have three applications I manage for this company and at some point during my burn out I (stupidly) mentioned to my manager that the more technical application maybe wasn't the right fit for me. It also needs someone who had the time to do some training and that wasn't me. 

My manager was already looking at maybe downsizing my workload so now this application is being moved to a colleague. The annoying thing is I did really love managing this application, it was challenging but definitely interesting. And it was the only application which also incorporates programming which I'd love to learn. 

Now I've lost the application and while I'm happy to have less workload I've also realized that now there's no way for me to learn something new at this company. I can't grow into a more technical role which I was hoping for. 

I almost feel like I failed because of the burn out and these are the consequences. But I was hoping for other solutions and not this. 
And I don't know what to do.

1bdtuqb,"Should I go with the nonprofit that makes me happy, or with the ""corporate type"" job that pays more money?","I interviewed with the Salvation Army and was offered the job less than 24 hours later. It's a dream of mine to work for a non-profit and I would be working as a Marketing and Special Event Manager. I would love this job. The two problems are:  
\-It is an in-person job without an opportunity for hybrid work  
\-It only pays 55K  
\-However, it does offer 29 days of PTO and 11 paid holidays.  
Before being laid off, I was making 66K, so I'd be taking an 11K pay cut which is significant considering I live in a very HCOL city.  
I just got through my second round of interviews with a local children's hospital for a Marketing Specialist role and I am fairly sure I will score the third (and final) interview with the Marketing leaders. If I am offered the job, it will:  
\-Offer a hybrid work environment  
\-Pay 70K plus merit increases every year and an annual bonus.  
\-Not sure what their benefits package looks like.  
I'm sure marketing for a children's hospital would be a great way to use my skills to help others, but it still feels like a ""corporate"" type job that I'm trying to get away from. I would love to work somewhere like the Salvation Army to then rack up the experience to find a higher-paying nonprofit job.

My other skills that don’t get any nod from my career:  
  
 \- Guitarist for over 35 years with performance and recording experience.   
 \- Writing and producing music in Logic Pro (both lyrical as well as instrumental)  
 \- Have published music with a band and as a solo (instrumental) artist on major streaming platforms  
 \- I did create MS Excel and Access tutorial videos for a fledgling YouTube channel for a while, but I have not posted anything new for well over a year. It only has between 600 and 700 subscribers  
 \- I also have some decent experience editing and creating instagram reels using CapCut - this is a more recent interest of mine  
 \- I have developed a handful of CRUD type of web apps too  
Migrated MS Excel applications/tools to web apps using JavaScript  
  
  
Currently working on:  
 \- “Wealth Building for Beginners” eBook  
 \- “Excel Mastery for Property Management Professionals” eBook/Course (my wife is in property management and she needs Excel training. LOL!)  
 \- I have two prospects in the funnel that need assistance with their Excel workbooks - they both could probably use the “Excel Mastery” eBook/Course…LOL!  
 \- Mixing 3 instrumental recordings for my alter ego Hiautumski to be released on the major streaming platforms soon. Already released one in February.  
 \- Just finished a Google Sheet script for a guy in construction to reformat csv exports out of a timesheet app he uses called Clockshark

I love AI and seek every opportunity to leverage it productively. I use ChatGPT 4.0 quite regularly and it  I've even leveraged it in software development, dramatically reducing the time it takes me to develop and test. I have even used it to create content for Instagram and for my eBook ventures.  
  
**BONUS**: I have also developed a web app version of a solution I developed for a client in late 2022. The original solution is a combination MS Access database + MS Excel report. They are able to import third party csv files into the database and then open the Excel report that is connected to the database and refresh reports at any time. They literally email me every quarter when they need the report refreshed to have me do it even though they have the application. I usually charge them about $250 since it takes me no time to import their files now and refresh the report and send it to them.  
  
But in my spare time (spotty at best) over the course of the past 6 months or so, I have developed a web app version of this same thing that allows them to import their files and view the report in the browser. It contains filters and conditional formatting functionality just like in Excel and they can export the report to Excel. It is protected by a user authentication system and I’ve branded it to their logo and colors. They didn’t ask for it and they don’t know about it, but I’m about to present it to them in hopes that they will use it and create a robust case study and potentially produce some referrals.

This mostly started as a challenge to myself to see if I could do it. Now I'm just looking to do a reveal presentation to the client in hopes that it gets plenty of 'oohs' and 'aahs'.

1bdszyv,Last PIP check-in and now they're taking it to hearing ,"Back in February my line manager decided to put me on a PIP given the ebbs and flows on my performance. 

I have two manager btw and both kept telling me that this is just to improve my performance and nothing serious. 

Fast forward to now, I had my last check-in with my managers and HR. The results did not meet their expectations and they have decided to take it to hearing (a senior from the org will decide my fate at the company).

The PIP that they made for me has some unrealistic expectations and I've shared it with my own close network of friends, and they can't even believe this nonsense.

For context some of notes on the PIP:

- Not be 3 minutes late for work
- Notify managers 8 hours in advance tasks can't be met 
- Stop asking colleagues again and again for help on understanding something (example: website management)

I'd like to also note that there are typos and inconsistent points that don't align with my role but we're still mentioned. Things like project management, I'm not even a project manager. 

I'm quit livid at this point, but I guess this is a blessing in disguse to leave the organisation. 

However, I don't want them to squash me and scar me for life. 

I've already collated some of the information I would need for the hearing, as well as notes from my friends. 

I've been told that I can have someone to advocate for me too. 

I'm trying not to break down here and keep my cool but please do recommend services, tips and other miscellaneous information that would help me.

I'd greatly appreciate it. 

For context: I'm a digital content analyst with 2.9 yrs experience at the company. I have servere depression, on medication too.

1bds9g6,What direction should I go? Marketing/ design jobs or do my back-up: law school? ,"Unsure which direction I should go (design/ marketing/ law)

Hi a bit of background on me (22f):

I grew up in the states, went to University of Toronto in Canada for my undergraduate degree in Communications. I finished a semester early due to taking a bunch of online classes during all summers due to covid. From September of 2019 - December of 2022 with my actual graduation being June 2023. So i’m a recent graduate-ish.

Since August of 2021 i’ve been working remotely for a Staffing Agency based in the Bay Area as Marketing / Communications. They have been flexible and accommodating so they have kept me on while i’ve been job hunting. They underpay me (still a great company & culture) but since i’m the only person in their marketing department I get to learn a lot. Most of the time it’s me figuring everything out by myself and working with the CEO, HR, and IT departments. So I don’t have the most cutthroat knowledge of marketing but I have grown the company’s revenue and reputation since I started. I also have a couple additional clients that I do occasional design/ marketing work for. 

My skills include Adobe Creative Cloud: Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator; Market Analysis, Content Writing, Email Marketing, Social Media Management and Content, Design (graphic and multimedia), learning some UI/UX now too as i’ve been put on a web project. Anything design and creative marketing oriented i’m good at. I just don’t have much on the analytical side. I also just redid my portfolio site and have all my work showcased there, I think it looks professional and gives a good idea on what I can do. My resume is geared more towards marketing than design. I label myself as a digital designer / digital marketer as I do a little bit of everything.

I have been looking for a new job more full-time in Toronto (trying to get something more full-time in canada as on work permit and eventually aiming for dual citizenship) for a year now with little luck. Either no responses or I get a couple of interviews that only make past 1-3 rounds before they let me go. I can talk well although I do talk faster than my thoughts sometimes, but my interviews almost always go well and half the time over the time limit from good conversations. I’m just wondering on what else I should do to get hired. I know the job market isn’t the best at all, but i’m not sure what I may be doing wrong. 

I just need a good paying job in this industry…i’m feeling defeated. I’m a good designer/ marketer. I’m hard working, charismatic, and passionate. Most of my current gigs love me so much they keep me on for additional projects. I’m just having a really tough time landing a new opportunity. Maybe I seem inexperienced? I’m applying for entry level, associate level jobs but I only get interviews for Lead positions or positions under a director to help manage teams or additional projects. However they never pick me past the 3rd interview…some companies i’ve done 3-4 rounds before they let me go. 

1) How can I make my marketing/ design profile stronger?
2) Should I just try for jobs in the states? Maybe even remote? (long-term BF’s job is in toronto) 
3) Should I just continue my current gigs and focus on studying for the LSAT? Law school is my back-up if my marketing career continues to be embarrassing. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I’m at my wits end, not sure what direction to go. 

Also I apologize for the shitty sentence structure and typos, I’m in a bit or a rush this morning as I type this out.

1bdrobb,"Trying to make a career change, having trouble weighing the pros and cons of this job that I’m currently interviewing for ","So like the title says. I’m working on a career pivot. I’ve been doing miscellaneous white collar stuff, kind of a mix of accounting, data entry, and customer service. It’s super unfulfilling so I decided to pivot into analytics. 

I went through a few bootcamps and taught myself advanced Excel, SQL, Python, and R over the last few months. I do use Excel and SQL in my day to day functions, so I have practical experience with those specifically. I’ve been working on the more advanced stuff for fun/practice. 

I’ve started applying to analyst positions and just had my first interview yesterday for a junior business analyst position. The position is EXACTLY what I’m looking to do career-wise. The upward mobility is great (I verified this with a college friend who currently works there) and I’d definitely be looking at being bumped to the senior analyst level within 18-24 months assuming my performance is adequate. 

I’m experiencing some ambivalence, though, for two main reasons. I would be taking a pay cut. It’s only
$1,000/year from my current salary, but things are already very tight for my wife and I. Additionally, it’s hybrid remote (3 days on site, 2 days remote) but the commute is about 45 minutes each way. My current job (completely on-site) is roughly a 7-8 minute commute each way. I would be more than tripling my commuting time despite moving to hybrid remote. 

The idea of getting my actual career path in motion at a place where I know growth is possible sounds great, but those two factors have me feeling hesitant about moving forward. What do y’all think?

1bdr8un,Should I take the job?,"I've been offered a job in a architectural tech firm. I'm an architect by training and have always worked as one, and have recently been managing projects, but I've been wanting to make a change into the tech world to start earning a bit more. 

The new role is titled as ""architect and product manager"" and loosely involves assisting the design and technical directors in managing the production of a software product.

The issue is that midway through the interviewing process, the role was changed from indefinite to fixed term of 6 months, as it's a new role and they apparently want to asses its necessity. There might be an opportunity for an indefinite contract thereafter.

There is no defined job description as of yet, and I've been told that it's likely to change pretty regularly. I've also been told that the directors tend to be very indecisive and moody - both red flags.

However, it's a young and very ambitious firm with exciting goals, and offers potential to grow significantly and quickly.

I'm currently on a contact with an architectural firm which expires at the end of this month, so it's really my only option at this point aside from taking on freelance work for a while.

first of all I am from Europe. I am 22yo.

I am bachelor law graduate which is pretty much useless without Master’s degree. I decided to get a job and it was pretty tough to find something without experience although I got one, not law related. Firstly I was thinking about working for a year and then finish Master’s by external study. Or then I had thoughts just to get some shitty job just for some experience. Now I have job offer. It’s a graduate managment program which lasts max. 1 year or based on your skill even shorter. It’s pretty  perspective career however If I fail the program let’s say after 7 months, I will have to wait another year to start the college again. If I don’t fail but I will be looking for a change after 5 years, I am pretty much screwed and I will be only able to look for the same managment roles. In order to do legal jobs, like attorney or detective I need Master degree. Or even to work in public sphere I need Masters

What would you recommend? I was thinking to start external studies in September, but I realized I wouldn’t have time to do it. I am thinking about finishing it after a few years when I will be settled but I have worries I mentioned above.

1bdos5i,Feeling Lost: Should I Pivot to Web Development or Stick with Flutter Amid Career Uncertainty?,"Eight months ago, I found myself climbing out of depression and decided to throw myself back into the world of development. I chose Flutter, which felt was the right choice because of its simplicity, especially since my experience with Android was pretty minimal at the time. I dove headfirst into learning the basics, thought of landing a junior developer position or a well-paying internship. But reality hit me hard. Despite going through several interviews in the past six months, the focus always seemed to shift to my experience with backend technologies or REST APIs. Sure, I've tinkered with weather APIs and the like, but a real-world, production environment? That's uncharted territory for me. I always tell the truth, that I'm a quick study, ready to soak up new knowledge like a sponge if given the chance. Sadly, those opportunities never called back, and I can feel the shadows of doubt creeping in again, whispering that maybe Flutter wasn't the right choice.  
  
In the meantime, I've been teaching a Python diploma course to keep the lights on. Recently, a teacher floated the idea of me taking a web development diploma course. The pay was too good to pass up in my current situation, so I jumped in, despite having zero experience in web development. Now, I'm scrambling to learn everything I can about web dev before each class, which has thrown me into a whirlwind of confusion. Do I pivot to web development? It's a daunting thought, especially when it feels like abandoning my Flutter journey would mean all my efforts over the past six months were for naught.  
  
I'm at a crossroads, torn between continuing to teach (and thereby securing my financial stability) and dedicating time to hone my programming skills in the stack I originally started. The thought of pivoting to web development is bittersweet; feels like I'm admitting defeat. The biggest heartache comes from feeling like I'm at a standstill, unsure of which path to take.

It’s become feeling like everyday is the same, conversations are the same, doing the same stuff everyday, every few weeks I travel but even then it doesn’t get me excited about work.

I’m not sure if a career change is the answer or a new sales job, I’m just looking for advice on how to figure this out and where to start?

1bdnbwo,"Fucked myself over with job and school decisions, not sure what to do next","I’m currently on a lease and cannot sublease (afaik), and I’m waiting on grad school decisions for this coming Fall semester (still uncertain, and unsure when they’ll get back to me). I have to work in the meantime or I won’t be able to afford rent - Well I could, but i’d be digging into a massive chunk of my savings. I’ve been struggling at work and mentally.

I should’ve known I’m not a good fit for my current job. I thought I could handle it when I applied. I forced myself through it, thinking I’d get the hang of it. But despite improving my KPIs over the past few months, I’m still underperforming and may lose my job next month if I don’t further improve my KPI this month. My mental health has been worsening since I started this job. I feel my clients can sense something when I speak to them, even if I think I’m behaving naturally. Like one just straight up told me “you look so tired”. At the time of my last KPI evaluation I felt so burnt out, yet I know I have to maintain that level AND MORE if I want to stay.

I’m thinking of applying to other jobs, but I don’t think companies want to hire people for only a few months - so I’m fucked. Should I try anyway? I’d rather not conceal the fact I’m waiting on grad school applications… but my grad school admission has not been finalized. Or do I further risk my mental health by staying at my current job, or risk my savings by just giving up and getting a tiny bit of rest?",321notsure123,2,1.0,2,1710322579,2024-03-13 09:36:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdnbwo/fucked_myself_over_with_job_and_school_decisions/,3,2024
1bdn4s6,IT early career advice,"Hi all, looking for some advice on my current job situation. Currently in the UK working IT support in an entry level role, I have a job offer for a more senior position at another firm in IT support, however the company I’m at have offered me a role in IT procurement and will also fund a procurement qualification , CIPS I believe. 

I am really interested in the procurement role and they have offered it to me based on some previous experience I have, along with my IT knowledge of the company. 

How lucrative is the procurement career path? Is it a good switch from IT support if I enjoy the job? Initial plan was to stick at IT support whilst continuing to learn cybersecurity and gain qualifications until I was ready for an infosec/secops role but my company have given me a competitive offer to make a switch into procurement now.",bbds1,1,1.0,0,1710321776,2024-03-13 09:22:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdn4s6/it_early_career_advice/,3,2024

Should I take a minor in finance or maths
What opportunities should I explore
What programming langs to learn
What softwares should I learn to use (MATLAB?)
How to get the opportunity to get into Quant-related ML research
And anything else you would like to add.

1bdmpqb,Should you accept a better role even though you’re not 100% qualified?,"I work at an engineering company, I joined the graduate scheme in 2021 which lasts two years. A few months before the end of my scheme I secured a full time role in the commercial team. Imagine there is a line, on the left it’s the engineers with the ideas and on the right it’s the salesman/saleswoman who then sells the product to the customer. My job is to stress test the ideas engineers come up with, analyse the cost and returns to understand whether this passes the go/no go stage, pitch for funding, develop sales and marketing material and once it’s ready for sale, hand it over to the sales team to sell. 

This was a good first time role for me because I thought I could use it to slowly understand the engineering knowledge and I quite liked the idea of testing ideas and routing them to market. 

I always want to get into sales, and I have dreams of being high in the corporate ladder and making a name for myself. I have been networking with colleagues around the business. Just for reference this is a global business and one of the leaders in the energy industry. 

From one of my networking calls, a guy who manages a sales team in a different division really liked me and said I should go for a role he has in his team. I voiced my concerns on not being technical enough but he said we just want someone with the entrepreneurial spirit. I was really exited, but out of courtesy I had a chat with my manager to tell him I was going to have a chat about this role, and his response was (not in a rude way at all): “Do you feel confident to sit in front of a customer and talk technical, because at times you will and you won’t always have your product expert with you”. This comment pulled me back into my self doubt because I agree, I don’t know everything from an engineering point. There’s still more to learn.

From this I had a call with the sales guy hiring and said pretty much thank you but I’m not ready. He responded back saying things to reassure me that I should interview because there will never be a right time. Once this role goes, they rotate in three years. So if you’re ready in six months, I won’t be able to do anything. He did nearly sway me but I stuck to the plan after talking to my manager.

I have frequent networking calls and I had a chat with someone who previously was in my team and made a big jump. Explained the situation and he was on the same page of just go for it. You’re never 100% ready and if you wait till you are it’ll never happen. This annoyed me and I feel I missed an opportunity. After the call ended, a few minutes later he messaged me saying “I’m really close with the (name of the guy in sales). I asked him and there’s still an opportunity open, he said to email him). 

I’m so nervous right now because I don’t want to look like an idiot. For reference I have been in this full time role since March 2023. My manager said I don’t want to ruin my CV by job hoping around. If I got this role I would be there for 3 + years then start looking for opportunities to manager a small team and go from there and work bigger.

TLDR: Should I apply/ potentially accept a role I’m not 100% ready for. I have the entrepreneurial drive, I just don’t know all of the technical stuff. 

Sorry for the long message and any comments would be very much appreciated. I understand I could interview and not get the role. Im scared on understanding what to do if successful as I think I’ve pretty much got it ass it’s a sales role that has been open for a long time and they haven’t filled it. 
I did ask why they haven’t filled it and because it requires relocating up to Scotland, people don’t want to do it. If I need to move up there for a better future in the long run, I will.",GPLorenzo,2,1.0,3,1710319987,2024-03-13 08:53:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdmpqb/should_you_accept_a_better_role_even_though_youre/,3,2024

1bdl6pa,Need suggestions on salary discussion with CEO,"Hi all, I will be having a pretty casual/semi formal meeting (online) with my CEO to revisit my salary (kind of a salary / performance eval) within a week, and I would love your guys suggestion on how to reinforce my points and why I think I deserve X amount of raise. Also, what I could possibly prepare to say if the worst comes to worst and i get nothing.

A little bg about my career:
I am a product designer with 3 YOE at a small-mid size tech company and we operate like a startup. I’m the sole product designer at our company and have been handling everything to do with ux and ui, fr research to ideations to prototypes and even learned some front end coding to support the team and help with a project, which we’ve launched.
My pay is decent but I think it is below average compared to similar people with similar experience at my area (bay area).
Mid last year I have also taken fulll responsibility of our precious graphic designer, so I am also part of our marketing team as well and I help out on all things from graphic designs, one sheet docs, logos, certifications, etc.
I’ve feel like with all the work I do and always trying my best to deliver, that I deserve a good raise. So I reached out to my ceo directly (we are a small company and our ceo has mentioned if there is anything anyone likes to discuss, its always welcomed to just dm him).
I messaged him earlier this year telling him why I think I deserve a raise and if we can further discuss about it. Fast forward now, will finally be having that meeting soon.
However I know with the market and economy being bad now, its going to be tough & that looking for another company will probably increase my chances at getting a better pay, but as you all know it is wayyy too hard and competitive to just land a new job now.
Anyways, just wanted to see if there are any tips to present these things in a meeting to have a better chance at persuading my boss that I deserve a raise.

TL/DR:
Meeting with ceo to discuss possible salary raise, need tips on how best word things.

In Indian standards, so far I have had a stellar profile when it comes to academic competitive exams. But what lies beyond exams, the life and career have been ever confusing..my present work profile with govt of india involves, engineering works of army, navy, air force, man management, tendering and so on, mostly admin work.  
Thoughts these days :  
I am suffering from autoimmune hepatitis, I am on immunosuppressants steroids, basically cant afford to get sick often, the air quality in India is pretty sus.  
Being an officer with Ministry of Defence, I will be posted around the country with tenures changing every 3 years, that doesn't give me a sense of location stability  
The growth in govt sector seems slow unless it's the IAS service, though job security and power is there, housing, health is all looked after by the govt, but the posting locations are often remote, though inside Cantonment Areas, which are well managed but cut off from society  
All of my ""best friends"" and my only sibling shifted to USA  
I feel my potential could be utilised more. All I want from life is a life of dignity, sorted working hours 9-5 is cool by me, post that having the time to spend with family, work on myself, a good work life balance at a good city, a metropol perhaps.  
I understand my needs from life might sound like something that everyone wants in a way. But I am severely confused. Whether to pack my bags, apply for mba in Europe ( why Eu ? Because work culture, job security, value of human life ) and start of a life there ? Seeking suggestions from the community.

Also, since I was hired we have yet to have a month where we did not meet or exceed (sometimes significantly) our expected revenue. I know anyone can be replaced but we can't even find baristas right now, never mind department managers.

1bdjzu5,"Lost Job, School in Sept. Now What?","Hey all,

TL;DR: lost job; resume/career is semi-random; finances are precarious; job market sucks; school in fall; how do I make this work?

This post might be better suited for r/personalfinance but it found this subreddit first. 

I recently lost my job and got dumped a chunk of change in return.

My previous job was at a startup where I started as a technical writer for the first time in my career and grew my role into instructional design.

During my time there, I realized I love education, so I applied to a local university for an after degree in Ed, and was (surprisingly!) accepted. I start in September. 

This sounds great, and I am hopeful about my career for the first time…ever, really…

However, losing my job is bad timing. Who is going to want to hire someone for a few months?

My career has been kinda all over the place. Mostly management and sales, with a bit of trades and business ownership, followed by my last role. I have stayed employed at most every role for at least a year or two, but most people don’t know what to make of my experience when looking at my resume.

This has made applying for jobs daunting and discouraging, as every job requires a customized and tailored resume because my primary responsibilities don’t fit any particular common job description.

I can learn any job. Honestly. There is a reason my resume is peppered with seemingly miscellaneous roles. I’m an opportunistic job seeker. A few years ago I relocated temporarily with my partner, and worked at a factory where I learned how to use a CNC faster than anyone they had ever seen. Before I left, they offered me a management position to entice me to stay. I had been there less than 6 months. We left because my partner’s contract ended. They knew all this when hiring me and chose to take the risk on my candidacy, and felt it well worth it by the end of my stay. 

I also present well, and I am cordial and conversant in person, so I feel like some business must have a weird role that they can’t fill by requirements, where I would be a shoe-in to take on the role and learn it from scratch in all the required nuance. 

The job market seems to suck right now (based on 6% unemployment rate despite 40k new jobs, and everyone on Reddit lamenting the current market). Even my local dollar store and fast food joint are blowing me off. Recruiters aren’t calling back, or are saying things are slow. 

I have the opportunity to travel internationally to spend time with a friend for 3 months where my expenses will be dramatically reduced (flight, lodging, food, and transportation will be free, and I can reduce my car insurance and phone while away). 

I can float myself on savings for the remaining months until the semester starts, but I am worried about tuition and bills while I am at school.

I also can’t apply for loans or credit, as I have recently declared bankruptcy. I also can’t start a business for the same reason. Because of the nature of my recent termination, I may not qualify for EI, either. 

I feel like, if I can get through the next two years of school, I’ll be set for the rest of my life with a vocation that suits me, either in government as a teacher, or in the private/NFP space as…something. Education where I live, is a well regulated industry with a strong union. Pay is regulated with yearly raises and benefits for tenured staff after as little as 3 years. 

My 5 year plan has never been more clear. The challenge is going to be getting there.

Thoughts and advice are welcome.

1bdjcpy,Advice on juggling career ambitions when you're young and have a terminally ill parent.,"Sorry, this is long, but context is important. 

I started an 8-month leave of absence (LOA) approximately 5 weeks ago from my current consulting job to start postgraduate study and have my wedding. When I first planned the LOA, I also planned on using this time off to job hunt as I am sick of my current position and feel I have gotten all I can out of the role. Taking the LOA instead of resigning was designed as a kind of insurance policy, meaning that if I didn't manage to find a new role then I could return to my old job at the end of the 8 month period.   
  
Fortunately, on my last project before the leave, my then-client offered me a position which is directly linked to my new area of study. I expressed my keen (and genuine) interest. I am also fortunate in that they have been understanding of my need to take time off for my wedding, and that when I do return to work I would need to work in a part time capacity so to continue my study and also care for my elderly father.   
  
For context, I dropped to a 4 day work week in my current role in early 2023 after my father was diagnosed with dementia so I could take some extra time to support him (although, given I work in consulting, this was not really honoured as part of the deadlines and I ended up work a huge amount of unpaid overtime).   
  
Fast forward to today, with my study in full swing and wedding taking place a week ago, the recruiting contact from the client has reached out to me again so we can resume discussions about a potential role.   
  
However, since the start of this year, my father has taken a steep decline in his health. A bit out of the ordinary, but my father had me and my brother much later in life, meaning he is >80years old, whilst my brother and I are only in our mid-late 20s. He is steadily losing the ability to speak and I have discovered this week he no longer has the ability to write whatsoever. He mentioned in conversation with me this week that he knows now that ‘his time is limited’, and whether it be that I have been partially distracted by my marriage, the prospect of a new job, or starting new study, this stark realisation that he may not live until the end of the year has left me heartbroken and confused.  
  
Added, my father has always been a **very** difficult person so - I mean this literally - he does not have any relationships other than with myself and my brother. He has another son (my half brother) who he has no relationship with, and he and my mother are not on speaking terms after a bitter separation a few years back. 

He lives alone at present in our family home, but has also flatly refused to ever be put in a care home and erupts at the idea of an in home carer, so setting the expectation that my brother and I will be the ones to take care of him when he can no longer do so for himself. My brother and I have somewhat begrudgingly accepted this given our own individual relationship troubles with our father, and because we have career/life ambitions for our 20s, however, we have accepted it. Now this reality seems even sooner than I had originally anticipated. 

**My question: How do I approach the discussion with the would-be recruiter about the potential new job?** 

I want this job and I know they want to hire me given how accommodating and positive they have been, but I am worried that even if I were to work in a 3-day a week capacity, my father's health/requirements are such that in a couple months time I will not be able to fully commit to the role. 

I don't want to waste their time, nor mine and whilst I do feel comfortable explaining (at a high level) my situation to the person wanting to recruit me, I feel I need to come back to him with a proposal rather than just my problems. 

I think I could: 

a.  Start the job in a month, try juggle it with study and dad-duties and see how it goes 

b.  Ask him to check in with me again in 6 months (although this feels like stringing him along)

c. Put the career change on hold and ask for a guaranteed start at the beginning of 2025 (which I am fairly confident he will agree to as he mentioned it in the past) 

Each option has its drawbacks - slowed career progression, missed $, potential to pip the recruiter off, or miss out on precious time with my dad, who despite everything, I love. I also don't want to ruin my chances at this role by continuing to request a move in my start date. 

Is there another option I am not thinking of? And what would you do? 

Thanks for reading.

Even offered to pay for more education in the areas I’m interested in. Pretty much a dream scenario! I’m an admin assistant and I do pretty much 4 people’s jobs since various layoffs have occurred. There’s only one other admin at our office so we split office management/ reception duties, which I hate and feel very demeaned at times doing. I’d love to drop that role to feel like I’m moving upward, but likely all my tasks would go to my counterpart who is also overworked and may quit soon. I feel like I’m screwing her over, but I will need to quit if something doesn’t change. My boss even said to be honest about what I don’t like doing because she doesn’t want me to eventually quit. Am I screwing my coworker over if I ask to drop those roles? 

Also kinda silly, but I sit at a reception desk in the C Suite and would really love to move to a normal work station (it’s pretty lonely and I manage an intercom). If I can drop my reception tasks, is it ok to ask for a new workstation?

The only issue with this position is that the contract will be ending no later than December this year.

2.) I travel for Amazon Robotics to different facilities across the country deploying different robots. I’d be making anywhere between 52k - 66k a year (possible negotiations). This position, everything is paid for (flights, rentals, hotels, food) it’s a pay cut but this role im not going to be worried about where my next job will be and I’ve heard that many people are making really great money after a couple years.

1bdhuue,42m excellent career that I loathe...,"Hello,

Kind of odd, but as I sit here wondering what I want to do, or what career change i should make I end up asking again and again, how can I or anyone ""know"" what career they want to work in before working on that field?! Things will always look different from the outside.

Isn't that like asking a 3 year if they like cake before they ever had a piece to try? 

On paper I have a good career field. I work for the government, I'll have a pension, great benefits, decent pay, etc. 

But the job itself, like the career field I'm in is slowly eating at me. I have no desire to be in this career field. I didn't have it 20 years ago, and I don't have it present day. 

I know I loathe this career field and I want out. Problem is in the government it's not easy to just move over to a different career field. Your resume has to reflect experience to be at that level of pay.

I could try to enter a completely different government career field, but that would result in about a 70% pay cut for the first year, then 50% the second year, and then about a 40% pay cut the final third year and remain at that decrease until I receive a promotion, that may or may not come.  From a salary  viewpoint, I'd be looking at like 110k decrease the first year...

Money isn't everything but I could take this huge risk, switch government jobs to a new career field and hate that too.  Then, all I did was cause a huge struggle for my family financially and still dislike my job. 

Because again, I have no way of ""knowing"" I'm going to like the job until I'm doing it.

1bdhh1q,Mechanical / Robotics Engineering Career Advice needed,"I am a final year Mechanical Engineering undergradaute student graduating soon. I took an interest in robotics, and during my internship and final year project, I kinda pivoted toward robotics software related work. 

During job search, I realise that robotics software job is so limited, mostly start-ups and research institutes only. and often times requires a master of phd degree, and  prefer someone from Computer Science background. I do not really have an interest in doing research work... I am now super afraid that once I kickstart my career in robotics software, my future career path will be limited, getting stuck as a poor researcher, or keep jumping arounds few starts-up. and my mechanical background would put me in great disadvantages, even if I want to switch to common software jobs. Also tech market has been unstable recently, so all software related jobs, especially entry-level are non-existence. 

Hence, I was wondering if it would be a better choice for me to pivot back to mechanical jobs, such as mechanical design, or manufacturing, since it is more common sought after? I think that mechanical jobs have more market value, and would promise me more stable career and forseeable career progression. Anything software related seems so unstable nowadays.

1bdh59e,Is this a red flag? (New Job),"Accepted a job offer last Friday, March 8th. First day on the job will be April 1st.

Currently unemployed, so have been interviewing with many companies to find the best fit for me. I went ahead and accepted this offer since I had 5 days to accept it and I wasn’t sure how many other offers I’d get (if any) and wanted to cover my bases.

Here’s the odd thing though, my recruiter for the job (internal recruiter) has called me a ton since they gave me the offer.

First was for the verbal offer last Tuesday.. standard stuff, laid out details of the offer and gave timeline of how long the offers valid (5 days)

Second was a two days later to see if I had made up my mind.. a little weird but told him I needed til the end of the week still (which is what was originally agreed on)

Third was a day later, Friday, after I had signed the offer. Again, standard stuff I’d expect, welcoming me to the team etc.. no problem

But then he calls him again over the weekend about filling out onboarding information (which isn’t due til my start date) and I had already completed my background check. Just confused why he felt he needed to reach out on a Saturday.

Today is Tuesday, and he calls me AGAIN about onboarding information (I promise it’s not important onboarding info, shit like what size t shirt do I wear) and asked me if I’m interviewing with other companies. Thats when I started to question this company. Feels pretty intrusive and obviously I’m not going to tell you if I’m doing that or not. 

I’ve been enthusiastic in all our calls and in our in person interviews, so it’s not like he’s worried I’m not excited… but yeah, just feel like this is potentially a red flag because I’ve never dealt with this before at any of my other companies… but maybe I’m overreacting.

What do you think?

1bdguyc,Commercial Loan Broker or Business Owner? Career/Life Advice Welcomed !,"I need to know where to go!

I need some advice but I don't want to discuss this anymore with people in my life because every time I do nothing works out. 

When I quit my job, this lady, let's call her Elle, said, hey, I may have an opportunity for you. Come meet me at this day spa. 

As we're sitting in one of he sauna's, she tells me, that she's starting to work for this commercial loan brokerage and if I want, to interview and if I get hired I can be a part of her team. I said, hell yeah! And she said maybe she could get me a membership to the spa so I could go whenever I wanted. This is after not knowing this woman as anything more than a very distant aquaintance.

And two weeks later she invited me to her apartment and made me a home cooked meal and shared some really personal stories about her past. This little voice in my head was saying, ""Is she *love bombing* me?"" Like with the spa and the invitation to her home, the cooking, *and* the really intimate details about herself? This isn't a normal progression of a relationship, be it friendship, or coworker etc. I was aware of this and had my antennas up but proceeded forward.

 A few months ago I asked someone what he thought I should do for work and a commercial loan broker was what he recommended. 

AND a mentor I was paying a few months ago recommended this job to me too, out of the blue. Without even knowing what the job title was.

I blew off both of these recommendations because I had a 9-5. Fast forward to now I quit my job and Elle comes out of nowhere and says to try out this job. 

Also like ten years ago I got hired to work for a law firm and I worked for the commercial real estate agents on deals that always would have a broker involved. 

So now I'm here looking back and thinking, this is meant to be.

So I interview, get the job and am excited. I get the questions I'll need to have on hand for potential clients and after a few networking events I finally meet someone who does a call with me. 

Elle, gets wind of this situation and says, get me on the call, I'll lead it since I know what I""m doing.

I think to myself, I can do this on my own, but I can't say no, because she is my ""team lead."" And I also want to know if she knows what she is doing and I want to see how she does business.

We have the call. She bombs it. She doesn't ask the right questions. She word salads, confidently. I stay silent. I can tell it's already over.

The deal drags on and with every following interaction she makes it worse. Thank god it was finally over and obviously the potential client went with another company. It was so embarrassing. 

Afterwards I asked her, even though in the contract it says no such thing, do I have to do every deal through her? (AKA split my commission with her). She said yes, until I ""know what I'm doing."" She even used the word *mentor*. Which I would have *died* to hear someone say to me just a few months ago. But now it didn't feel right. I got royally scammed by an entire mentorship community and a psychopathic narcissist ex, the cream of the crop manipulation that now I had my eyes peeled for people looking for opportunities to take advantage of me more than ever before. I know that I'm vulnerable. And I'm learning, but predators can still probably smell me a mile away as an easy target.

Anyways, I said ""okay"", but as soon as she said this I had a very strong reaction in my body. It was so unpleasant and powerful it reminded me of how I used to feel when I was with my toxic ex. It was my body telling me something bad was happening and I needed to listen. It took me hours to shake this feeling.

So what I need advice on is, now that I know my intuition is like, ""Bitch do NOT work with her, do NOT split your commission with her."" I feel like after not listening so many times in the past and getting my ass whooped I need to let this ""opportunity"" go. When she first invited me to the spa and then to the dinner I started to put together some ideas in my head. I know that she's worked in the RE world for decades and never quite made it enough to be a team lead, so I figured that since it wasn't working out, she saw this as an opportunity for her to move into a new role, be a team lead and have a bunch of little team members working under her and giving her a split of all of their deals and poof she finally leveled up and made it. 

I understand that. Nothing wrong with that. Buuuuuuuut if I feel like she ran the deal well and I felt like I could learn from her, and there was no weird vibes I was getting, and there was no love-bombing and everything I just shared then I would happily be a team member but after that I feel like I could honestly do a better job on my own, which was my original plan, AND because that's what's on the independent contractor contract. It's only a verbal agreement that she is a team lead, but my contract says that my commission is to me only. SO 

I'm in this pickle where, ( and to give you context I'm unemployed right now, no savings, and zero prospects for incoming deals right now, driving uber and BARELY paying my rent every month ) I am trying to figure out what to do. Also I might add that even working alone with this company so far has made me lose faith and motivation because it doesn't  seem like they know what they're doing and they're literally preventing me from being able to do my job well because they are cockblocking me from the lenders so how the living hell am I supposed to effectively sell a product if I don't know it well myself? There is a person between me and the lenders who will not really answer my questions and doesn't seem to know the answers about the products they offer. So ..

My plan a week ago was to:

1. Prepare to work independently. I want direct relationship and communication with my lenders. I want to know their products and the people that offer them. No middle men. I need to know exactly what I'm selling and who I need to look for to connect them.
2. I need a title. I have no background experience in anything real estate or business or finance so I figured the closest thing I can do is to become a MLO. Get some letters next to my name, so when I meet people I can tell them that's what I am and at least I will have state certified training and a NMLS#. Also if worst comes to worse I can always be an MLO and sell mortgages for homes.
3. Find my own lenders. Then, find people who need them. 

This is my plan. But I have lost motivation because now I'm scared to leave this company. What do you guys think? Does this plan make sense? What am I missing?

The only thing else is that I'm not sure if this is the proper career for me. I don't have any experience in business deals and negotiating. I'm not creative with solutions and problem solving. And I'm not always the best when it comes to maintaining relationships and being ""likable."" Also I hate the idea of having to have my face plastered all over social media promoting myself. I usually work best alone unless the people I'm working with have the same goal as me and are on the same team as me as in my level. They're not above or below me.

The alternative path, that I don't even have money for, but that is lingering in my brain, is to take a completely different path. And the reason why it's in my brain is because I think the lifestyle might be more suited for my personality, or lack there of. Having my own business through selling a product. Having my own brand (but I wouldn't be the brand). So not those social media influencers who *are their own brand* as personalities, but where I would pick something like a head band, product it, and sell it under my own brand and then hopefully scale up and build wealth that way. I won't have to work with so many people, I won't have to constantly be wheeling and dealing, I won't have to constantly be working for clients and on the phone with no time off, AND I wouldn't have to be working in a heavily male-dominated field where I honestly do not have the skills to hold my own at the moment. 

I know *nothing* about having a business and have almost no money to my name so I couldn't even start it now.  But I feel like maybe being able to run my own show would save me a lot of trouble because I would be the only one having to deal with myself, if you know what I mean, and I could run things in my own way, which I have to do everything, differently. 

So what do you think? Any advice would be helpful. I will tell you that my work history is pretty sad. I've never stayed with a job for too long. I'm not great with commitment and persistence if I smell any type of bullshit going on, which is everywhere. And I haven't really built up the confidence and tactics to be able to hold my own against manipulators yet. Also I'm really not that smart. I just want to break out of this hourly wage situation and live a life where I can support myself and not be in poverty anymore.

I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible but with enough details so that someone can help me. I’m F25 living in New York City with a Bachelor’s Degree of Science, majored in International Business/Business Administration. I have about 7 years of work experience now with a mix of operations and now banking. To be exact I have 6 years in operations as Administrative Assistant (from two previous jobs) and almost 1 year now in banking as a universal banker. Now I hate my job as a banker because the bank I work at doesn’t pay well, overworks me and abuses me. There’s a lot to do and it’s overwhelming and staffed with enough people. I’m not given proper training and have so much time there that I’ve taught myself a lot. I do both the job of a teller and a banker. This was my first time switching industries/careers. I thought I would like banking but decided it’s not for me. I really want to quit but fear being unemployed for way too long. I do still live at home with my parents because I don’t make enough money to live on my own, I’ve always only made 35k-37k in all my years of working now. So one of the main reason I want to leave is because of burn out and I need a major income increase because at my age I want to be independent already but can’t afford anything with such a low income. I really want to go back to being an assistant but would much rather be doing it somewhere I’d enjoy with a much higher salary. I was thinking since I have my vacation in May for 2 weeks, that I’d wait till then to make my final decision and if I do leave to then just leave in July with or without another job lined up. I am and I have been actively looking for another job as an assistant but been having a hard time. I fear being jobless because I don’t want more then 2 months to pass and I have nothing to then go crazy without a job and feel lazy but this job alone is taking away all my happiness. So I ask can someone please tell me their opinion and what they think I should do?

I had a comparable level to my boss but in a different industry. I say this to explain that I had a lot of responsibility and I know that my skill level is above my current job.

A few things she does that makes me feel like she doesn't see my skills, just my title. She constantly asks if I feel comfortable doing xxx (new task). I say of course, every time. She is a micromanager. Side note - This is frustrating for me, but I combat it but trying to say less (since I don't want my frustration to show). In general, I don't get much talking in during meetings because she talks A LOT. She's made comments like they wouldn't normally have someone in my position be able schedule interdepartmental meetings so that's soooo great I can schedule those. I feel it's like giving a toddler a compliment. Most people in my position would probably be fresh out of college though. I feel like based on comments that she doesn't think I could do the next level of job. This is a new boss that I got around 4 months ago. I have been in my position for less than a year.

Should I ultimately say something about her asking me if I feel comfortable doing tasks makes me feel like an insult to my skill level? Or something about feeling micromanaged.

1bdg2xt,Early career advice (software engineer),"I’m about to graduate college, and three weeks ago started working at a very small startup. I’m making good money, 125k, but I feel like I am missing out on getting a solid footing in my career. I have very little industry experience but act somewhat as the CTO. But I do enjoy the people I work with. 

The dilemma is, I just got an offer to work for another company. After negotiations, they offered me a salary of 100k. This company is legit, has a real technology department, and would have a ton more structure over where I currently work. I would be part of a team of 5 SWEs who all have years of experience in industry. 

Do I stay at the small startup and just ride that the roller coaster ride? Or, do I take the job with more structure, less pay, and gain solid footing and understanding of how a technology department operates. 

I’m leaning more towards the job with less pay, but man would the be awkward to quit on these guys after I just started",Constant_Border1312,2,1.0,0,1710296638,2024-03-13 02:23:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdg2xt/early_career_advice_software_engineer/,3,2024

1bdf83t,"New boss will not renew my contract, but offered to get me a job. What should I do?","I’ve been working in a large hotel for almost 2 years now. 
I’ve not had a complete team due to staff shortages and post pandemic, changes were made to the operation and 25% of my team were cut. It’s made the job a lot more difficult and I’ve had some issues. 

New boss starts 9 months ago and took a strong liking to some of my direct reports, but not to me. 

He put unrealistic pressure on me and treated me very differently from my peers of the same level. He bullied me for the last 6 months and has made my work life miserable. It was clear he didn’t like me personally. It’s obvious to everyone that if he likes you, you’re going to benefit, no matter how bad you are at your job or how much you lie to his face. He likes it if you’re one of the boys.

I could tell he was lining me up to get rid of me, but I never once gave up and pushed really hard to do the job, even when he was a raging a hole. He went behind my back constantly and manipulated a few people and made up stories. Unfortunately, his absolute lack of communication except for passive aggressive emails and scolding (for traceability purposes) made my job so much harder and he made sure I was to fail. 

So contract talks come around and he tells me the obvious. 
I don’t have any chance to argue the point as he made it clear it’s in progress. 
I sure as hell outlined his failings and challenged every one of his arguments. 

I’m not saying at all that I was perfect and I definitely could do a better job. I am saying I was not supported from above and below and was exhausted everyday. 15-16hr + days, 2am finishes (I start at 7), working on my days off etc. I did a lot. 

Now he has offered to put me in contact with people to get a job in several locations, but I feel it’s another manipulation. I am in need and don’t want to reduce my salary, so the places he’s offered to ‘help’ me have similar salary ranges. 

I have another opportunity to go back somewhere I was before, but I don’t want to go back to old dwellings kind of thing. 

What would you do in this scenario? ",888throwme,3,1.0,3,1710294329,2024-03-13 01:45:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdf83t/new_boss_will_not_renew_my_contract_but_offered/,3,2024
1bdf5ue,Should I pursue sales if I’m not sure I like selling?,"Should I pursue sales if I’m not sure I like selling?

I am 31F and currently work as a CSR/supply chain support specialist. I have a BA in Communications and a history of working in customer service and supply chain support (global distribution planning support specialist) in manufacturing environments.

I am an introvert and “highly sensitive person” and have noticed I enjoy working alone but also in a team where I can talk and reach out if needed, but generally don’t like loud or bright environments.

I am feeling burned out (current workload is crazy, everyone works OT, they’ve fired four people in six months and have not replaced, less than skeleton crew and everyone is behind, a whole bunch of broken processes, management threatening to fire us, they have a quarterly report on all the people they fired).

I don’t even know what I want to do for a career. I just know that I should leave my workplace soonish before I get fired or so burnt out I can’t come back emotionally.

Anyways, sales has been recommended to me before (by people online who haven’t met me) since I have customer service experience. 

I am typically a shy and awkwardish person. Not super social, but I enjoy solving problems. I’m not really sure what I’m even good at, besides being organized and detail oriented.

I have applied for a couple of sales jobs, and just heard back from a junior account manager role, for an ERP software company, fully remote. I am a bit excited about this opportunity, since the e industry aligns with my experience the pay is around 65k, I currently make 52k fully in office.

I kind of feel “icky” (please don’t be offended) about sales, my mom says sales reps are crooks. I don’t necessarily believe that though! The sales reps I’ve worked with have all been personable and nice. I just don’t want a career I feel morally conflicted about, but maybe I shouldn’t!

Can anyone help me with this?

I think that as a person he is a good guy but as a boss / buisness owner he has a lot of ridiculous policies, underpays staff, and honestly takes advantage of his employees labor. To a sense he even lied to be about the nature of the job when I was interviewing.

1bdebpx,Is the time I’m spending stressing at work time I should spend getting another job?,"Tl/dr: my boss left, I’m stuck with their tasks, I’m drowning, to quit or not to quit?

My boss left about a month ago. Their role was invaluable to the company and they took a ton of critical knowledge with them. There was a flurry of activity around their departure and the handoff was.. mediocre.

I was told I wouldn’t have to assume their role and responsibilities. We hired someone to replace them, but that person backed out. Now we have a new employee to help support me, but still together we aren’t able to meet the demands that are placed on this team. Things are starting to fall apart and I’m working 60+ hours a week.

At this point, I feel like quitting. 
I’m struggling because my expected output is now being compared to my old boss and those responsibilities shouldn’t be on my plate. I think they just need someone else, but I’m so bummed because I was doing so well. I recently got a great performance review and now all I’m getting is heat and impatient remarks with the tone of “just do it”. I’m at a total loss of what to do.

(Not sure if this matters, but there is also a lot of tension at the top leadership tier. Some days I feel like they might be looking for someone to punish that can’t always push back..)",anonymousrealtalk,1,1.0,1,1710291819,2024-03-13 01:03:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdebpx/is_the_time_im_spending_stressing_at_work_time_i/,3,2024
1bde5y4,Should I take a new job for an extra 20k and a promotion?,"Hey all - you might be looking at the title and saying this is a no brainer. But my situation is a bit unique and I was hoping to get the input of others.

Background: I'm an engineer living in Washington state with 8 years of experience.

My current job has a 3 minute commute, is nearly stress free, and pays 95k. I go into work, do my stuff, and then leave. I am just a staff level employee. I also do not work Fridays. My current schedule also allows for me to really help with my family (wife and 3 young kids). My coworkers are good, and my boss is great (best boss I've had). I am VERY comfortable where I'm at.


In comes the second job. I was basically sought out due to my certain skill set (I have some advanced certifications not many people have), and before my current job I actually was a manager for 6 years (until I switched jobs and stepped down into my current staff level job). They heard of me through a friend of a friend of a friend. I spoke with a recruiter and immediately within 10 min I was offered a job. No resume. Just a casual conversation. I told them that 1: I'm never working Fridays again and 2: I only want to work 36 hours a week. And the recruiter said he'd have to ask the higher ups. I then went home thinking that that was the end of the conversation due to what I thought were nearly impossible requests.


The next day I get an official offer for a manager position, for 115k, and a 10k sign on bonus. Note: I haven't even interviewed yet. The recruiter asks if we could set up a meeting to get interviewed at the new job. I figured I'd hear them out so I agreed. I get to the new job (only 6 minutes away vs 3 minutes) and the office is sort of depressing. 5 other employees with older computers/equipment, dimly lit, etc. The particular company was recently bought out twice within 2 years and is now part of a larger company. I interview with a guy named Jim and he seems to really like me. And I reiterated how I can't be available outside of my scheduled hours, despite them wanting me to be a manager. Jim didn't seem to care. After talking with Jim about what he expected I got the feeling that the particular office I was at wasn't doing great and was struggling and wanted me to breathe some life into it. ""We are looking for strong leaders to come in and prop this business up!""


I left the interview not very excited about working there. I get another phone call from the recruiter who asked me what my offer was: ""was it 115k and 20k sign on bonus?"" I replied, : no it was only a 10k sign on bonus."" So this recruiter then says ""oops my bad, let's make it 20k sign on then!""

...


That's pretty much the background. My question is: would it be stupid to turn down this offer of 20k more salary and 20k sign on bonus?

It would definitely be more work as a manager, and like I mentioned before I'm very comfortable where I'm at now. My main goal in life right now is to focus on my family (but one can make the argument that getting an extra 20k in salary with a nice bonus would be focusing on my family as well as I'd be able to provide for them better).


Any thoughts?

1bddrxb,I keep making mistakes at work,"I started this new job in October. Essentially you work for multiple different  companies at once during 10-12 hour shifts. Each has different policies/procedures you have to follow as well as different systems you have to learn. You essentially have to learn ~40 different accounts each with little intricacies and I’m losing my mind. There is NO TRAINING. Maybe an hour or two on each account and that’s it!! You just get thrown right in. It’s actually starting to piss me off. On all the accounts I’m doing I keep getting emails sent to the whole staff from my boss about ‘guys remember at X account to do this, we’ve been missing this a lot recently’ 

It’s just embarrassing because it’s all the accounts I’m doing and I keep screwing up small stuff I had no idea about in the first place. It’s really getting me down and making me not want to continue. Also this job is VERY fast-paced…I literally do not have time to assess anything. There’s barely a break through the shift and if you do take one you get backed up very quick and the calls come flooding in. It’s actually ridiculous. And then of course there’s this coworker that’s been there 10 years and is just a cocky asshole which makes me feel even more shit. 

I guess this is just more of a rant I could go on even more, but what is with these large companies and training. There’s literally never good training and it pisses me off. Also, the on-site people at these accounts who we cover for get AT LEAST 2 months of training AND they only have to know 1 set of policies and 1 system yet they write us up all the time for getting little stuff wrong and expect us to be as good as them…it’s so fucking frustrating and borderline impossible. I just don’t know if this is the job for me, but it’s about as good a job I can get in this garbage field I chose.

I'm a 35-year-old non-native English speaker living in the US. For the past two years, I've been immersing myself in learning Java and JavaScript with the goal of becoming a software developer. Despite applying for 30-50 job postings a day over a span of four months and seeking guidance from mentors on my study path and resume, I got only a handful of interviews and no job offers.

1bdc7f2,To Interview or Not?," I was selected to interview in back to back interviews this Thursday with a prestigious company.  I found out that one of the team members who will interview me (let’s call him Groot) is a former boss of a former (major a-hole narcissist) supervisor (let’s call him Rocket).  I left that job on bad terms because I was being bullied by this supervisor, Rocket.  Like literally berating me in their office for 3 hours straight, type of bullying.  That’s no exaggeration. The supervisors boss (Groot) called me into their office when I gave notice and was angry that I was telling my colleagues the reason why I was leaving.  Yeah it might have not been the best way to handle it but I was so fed up and angry with being mistreated and verbally abused. Groot didn’t care either. They just wanted me to shut up and leave quietly.  It was an awful experience but I’ve tried to put it behind me and move on.  This was a very long time ago (over 20 years) but I’m almost certain this interviewer (Groot) will remember me.  My spouse thinks I should now just cancel  the interview.  They said I’ll never get a real chance and why torture myself?  Maybe they are right but I said…. REDDIT WILL KNOW!!  

I would really like this job.  So… How can I make the best of this and come out with a decent chance at being offered this job, if that’s even possible?  What can I say that will make it go smoother, to offset any (negative ) feelings from 20 years ago?  Specific examples of what to say during the virtual interview appreciated!   

Groot is not the hiring manager but he is one of the team members in the department.  The hiring manager really liked me.  

It was a very long time ago and I’m a completely different person, as I’m sure most people are with so much time in between.  (Think 25 years old vs. 45 years old in your career, for example). 

Or is my spouse right that I should cancel? I’m on the fence.  ",Strong-Baseball-9256,1,1.0,1,1710286273,2024-03-12 23:31:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bdc7f2/to_interview_or_not/,3,2024
1bdc6il,2 weeks or quit?,"I had a great paying job for 6 years, benefits, pensions, bonuses - I also worked part time for a small ma & pa business for the 4 years while working at this job. For the full time position I had a great boss, great atmosphere. For the part time I went in on weekends and would have the entire shop to myself (was easy and peaceful). I went back to school for 2 years and was later contacted by the owner of a company and asked for an interview, looking back at the situation now he was honestly desperate for experienced people and promised high pay, benefits and growth in the company blah blah blah. I decided to take a leap of faith and leave my good paying job to soon find out the owner at this new place had only broken promises and was a straight up dick. I reached out twice to my old job in the duration, nothing came from it. 

After 1.5 years of working for this asshole miserably and continuously handing out my resumes, having no luck on an equal paying job (while maintaining my original part time job I was still working for on weekends). I basically convinced my part time to take me on full time and that I would take a pay cut, be loyal and work hard to get the hell out of there. They promised me 37.5 hours a week and a dollar raise in 6 months. (I took a $2.50 cut to leave) preaching to myself happiness over money. No vacation pay (they pay it out every paycheck), no pension, no benefits.

Now I’ve been there for almost 6 months. It’s a very repetitive and exhausting job. However God WILLINGLY my originally 6 year job reached out to me 4 weeks or so ago and offered me my full time position back and to start in April…. with an additional $1 from what I left with ($27/hour - amazing) Now fast forward, the owner at this ma & pa business is… eye openly a slave driver considering I have such a low wage and high experience. Not to mention I’ve gotten this small business over the time of working there 2 hard working employees who both quit saying it’s too low of wage for the amount of work. One also noted that the owner leaves for lunch and comes back tipsy. I brushed it off. 

Side note - I started this job in November and moved into a house in February telling the owner I have a mortgage and bills now to pay. I need more money as we all usually do in this day of age!

Fast forward, to today.. the owner at this small business has taken 2 trips to Mexico and has me doing the entire work load; now ok, of course I’ve made this business loads of profit - as a low paid employee I’ve never been offered an early raise or bonus or even a praise really - she’s quite literally cheap and cold when it comes to business. Somewhat understandably as a business owner with budgets but I’m not stupid; I’m understanding but I do know you should treat employees accordingly if you want them to stay especially in my personal sustain I’ve told them about. When she hired me she said we would be a “great team together” I literally do all of the work. She always says “I leave all the work for you for hours” which ok I understand as a business owner and as my place as an employee, she’s almost 64 and is essentially a one man show so before I was there full time she was doing everything herself (minus me coming in on the weekends to help) but now I’ve started to feel like I’m a retirement investment for her. NUH uhhhhh.

Okk back to her promise of 37.5 hours. She went to Mexico last week and it’s a “slow time of year” in the business we are in. She told me to leave early Thursday and not to come in Friday or Monday. As previously mentioned, I just moved into a house in February and am so behind in bills and have grown further in debt. She also knows this and didnt even once apologize for cutting my hours. Again broken promises. 

My question here is, if I should hand in a notice of my departure (I know she will be super upset) or message her the Friday before April saying I will not be returning to work & to be honest.. I was scared I would have been let go and left with no money for 2 weeks. Because it’s a slow time of year and today she literally told me she’s not doing any work this week and leaving it all to me because I need the hours. What would you do?

1bdazoh,Not sure what to do.,"My former boss was dismissive, condescending, and rude at times. Some of the things he said were abusive and belittling. He lied on several occasions about actions that were essentially sabotaging my job or my relationships with other employees. He made a number of sexist remarks on several occasions. Classic narcissist - only when I indicated I was fed would he try to keep me from leaving. I feel into the trap. It was the worst experience of my life. I stupidly filed an HR complaint; all he got was a slap on the wrist. His boss didn't do jack shit. You can look through my history of some of the things I had to deal with. Apparently he had HR issues years back as well.

I managed to get an internal transfer but the role I transferred into was frankly a step down - less responsibility and less visibility. People made comments to me as such. Still ultimately under the purview of my former boss' boss, and as a result, there still continue to be problems. I still feel like I'm being punished, or at the very least my nose is being rubbed in everything. My mental health has suffered tremendously as a result.

I feel like my career is tarnished and all of the issues have just followed me to my new role.

Should I wait until they send the official offer with salary before telling them I have another offer + the specifics, or should I go ahead and say something now via email so they can counter accordingly or tell me they can’t match it.

1bda9yq,How do I unfuck myself? I am lost and overwhelmed.,"Hello, Folks.

Be Blunt, Be honest, Criticize, Cuss but give advice.

Myself(20M and soon to be 21). 

So, I HAVE FUCKED UP and put myself in a miserable situation.

I am a fuck up financially, physically, mentally and socially. Barely have any money to my name, am fat as a watermelon, mental health is down the drain and social life doesn't exist.

I don't have a degree, I don't have a job and I don't have any savings. I recently moved in with my parents and they barely interact with me. 

I use to go to university but dropped out in first year itself to scale my business. Started my business just before starting university, business was in creating low latency models for fund managers. I ran it successfully for 2 years. God forbid, got wind up in an insurance lawsuit and eventually everything came crashing down resulting in immediate liquidation. I had to liquidate overnight and it was the worst night of my life. Pathetic. Only good thing is that I am not in any debt.

Fast forward to today, I am 20 without any degree, job and savings. I will be starting degree this year(September 2024) in Mathematics, I'll be 21 when I start.

Since the business failure, I have slipped into depression and am very overwhelmed by everything. I tend to overthinking everything and regret the past so so much(not a typo, so comes twice because regret is high). 

I will complete my bachelor's at 24 and master's at 25. I feel I am extremely behind and my peers are already graduating this year. 

I literally do not know what to do, the overwhelming thoughts blind me and completely hijack me. On top of that my parents keep taunting me everyday saying I failed at this, I failed at that and so on and so forth.

Advice me what should I do?? Am I doomed?? Am I failure?? I am lost

I am not suicidal.

TLDR: I FUCKED UP.",SpareAccount1111,196,1.0,405,1710281529,2024-03-12 22:12:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bda9yq/how_do_i_unfuck_myself_i_am_lost_and_overwhelmed/,3,2024

1bd9zlx,Tell me about a time you had to adapt your own style to work effectively with other members of a team. Does this sound like a good response?,"A common question in interviews is; Tell me about a time you had to adapt your own style to work effectively with other members of a team. 

I have drafted an answer to that question, you tell me if it sounds like a good one. 

When I took a creative writing class in college, I was placed in a group to write a poem from the perspective of one of the characters in Shakespeare’s Othello. We had the option between writing in free verse poetry or using the Iambic pentameter. I preferred to write in the Iambic pentameter, while the person with whom I was paired liked free verse. 

We compromised. The other person would write a poem in free verse. I would then read that poem and rewrite the poem in Iambic pentameter, conveying basically the same idea that was conveyed by the free verse poem. Having to paraphrase ideas that are not technically mine was a bit of a challenge, but I found it to be an effective exercise in empathy, having to find clever ways to articulate an idea that someone else came up with. 

Each of us got part of what we wanted. My team mate got to have the poem be written about what he wanted it to be written about. I got to to have the poem be written in my preferred style of writing.",bigelow6698,1,1.0,2,1710280847,2024-03-12 22:00:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bd9zlx/tell_me_about_a_time_you_had_to_adapt_your_own/,3,2024

1bd8z0m,Should I leave construction?,"I'm an apprentice in the laborers union in Alaska. After focusing on treating my ADHD, I was sent up north to Prudhoe Bay, and that's where I am currently.

In the past, each job I have been on went like this: I show up to the job, show promise due to my attitude and math skills, then I get burned out and my work ethic falls short. I later learned that I have ADHD and that it could contribute to my problems with working in this field.

The job I'm on has a better crew, and I'm medicated. I recently moved out of my sister's house to move in with my girlfriend, and my plan was to work a hitch up north, then transition to working in the town I live in during the summer. Her family owns and operates a concrete and dirt sampling business, so they run a lab and do quality control. There are also engineers I could work with and learn from.

The specific job I ended up on does a 6 and 2 rotation, 7 12s, until October, so I would work through the summer. I do not like working 84 hours a week, but I do well enough to fool my crew. I want to be home, renovate my apartment, play music, follow my passions.

My predicament is this: do I stay in the apprenticeship, journey out during the last couple weeks of this job and use that to chase a construction management degree, partially paid for by my union? I would be managing road work projects out on the field, working 12s away from home.

Or do I use the union to pay for a civil engineering degree, risk burning out and getting run off the crew due to the workload, and pay for the degree myself with apprentice wages?

Or do I do what my soul wants and quit, work the summer job in town, take out student loans for my civil engineering degree and learn from the engineers I work with, and be able to be home?

I've been wanting out of construction for a while, my mental health took a plummet since I joined and I don't really see a future doing labor work. I want to do really hard math and go inspect bridges. More than that, though, I think being home for good would be a lot better for me.",SpectacularSoup,1,1.0,0,1710278477,2024-03-12 21:21:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bd8z0m/should_i_leave_construction/,3,2024
1bd8ovo,Global/Social-Studies Teacher Vs. LCSW Therapist?,"I would say there are two lenses/metrics I could use to weigh the two options)
Experience: Ergo, how much I find the two careers actually suitable. I roughly feel the same way on this end, though I am curious to ask any teachers and social workers, what skills are an absolute necessity for either career? Also, what are the hardest challenges or struggles of either career?

Financial-Potential: From what I gather, a Social-Studies Teacher might have better general benefits, way better vacation time, and better initial-pay…. Possibly.

However, the Therapist or Mental Health Counselor might have a higher potential in the long-term.

TL;DR: For someone relatively young (23), which is better to consider, slightly higher initial pay, or the long-term pay-ceiling?

1bd83ks,"Was promoted, but no salary increase","Hi, I have a meeting with my boss soon. The situation is as follows: I started as an ordinary employee in the company. I was given the task of setting up a new department, which I managed to do in just over 2 years. I have now been head of department for about 9 months, have 3 employees and the department is developing well.  
Due to the restructuring in the management, I didn't push the conversation about my situation too much, I also had enough day-to-day tasks to deal with. There were always discussions with my new boss. However, we always postponed the actual discussion of my new situation. There were also plausible reasons for this. Right from the start, it was more important to me to be shown a development perspective for myself. Now we finally had the interview. However, the boss then said that I was on the last rung of the career ladder. In the hierarchy, only the managing director would be above me.  
That really surprised me and I had to digest the information first, so I didn't get to the subject of salary adjustments. Despite or perhaps because of the lack of prospects for the next step in my career, I would now like to demand a salary in line with the market. Nothing has happened in this regard since my promotion. My idea is:  
\- 20-30% salary adjustment due to increase in responsibility (area/staff responsibility)  
\- 10-15% variable profit-sharing bonus  
\- Company car in exchange for giving up overtime  
With this total package, I would be at the average compensation for this job in my area, industry and with my experience and training.  
So far, my boss has only suggested the last part (company car).

He also indirectly told me that the reason for this was me not being ""visible"" enough to the rest of the company and said he'll help me with this by including me in more meetings and giving me more responsibility.

I'm scared that if I present a project I could look bad if my project doesn't get great feedback. I know that I have good social skills and so maybe meeting the team, participating in discussion could be enough. Or is it understood that I need to present something?

1bd57a1,What to do next? ,"Long story short, I have a PhD in Microbiology. I came to the USA and did two postdocs, which I really enjoyed. However, my university does not promote postdocs to Assistant Professors, so I went into industry. I spent 2 years as a consultant for CROs during Covid (WFH), which was great. In March 2023, they were letting people go, and I decided to jump ship back into academia to work as a protocol writer/coordinator for investigator-initiated INDs applications to the FDA. On paper, it sounded great—a senior role with more responsibility—but it’s not that at all. Rarely do I do any protocol writing; I'm just working on mundane stuff. I’ve tried pushing for more regulatory work, but my boss wants me to set up meetings, and I feel like a personal assistant now.

Since October, I’ve applied to about 350 jobs, both medical writing and lab-based positions, and I have had no offers (hence this post). I just got another rejection today. It was a real gut punch, and I’m really down about this rejection, as this particular job area I have extensive experience in. I keep on thinking I should have stayed in the lab, but I wanted to try something new, and Covid showed me that my lab work was really insignificant.

I honestly don’t know what to do. I feel like a complete failure, and I took a risk, but it hasn’t paid off. I don’t know where to go with my job or career.

1bd4s49,Should I take a 1 hour commute for pay increase?,"I'm in decision paralysis mode and I could really use some help.

I was wondering if anyone has ever taken a job with a longer commute for higher pay and then regretted it. I need to make a decision and FAST (like TODAY... or yesterday).

I am a speech pathologist in my clinical fellowship year. This means I need a mentor to sign off on my paperwork to earn my certification. I have a master's degree in my field and I'm halfway through my CFY (clinical fellowship year). But I work at a private practice currently (in a very HCOL area) and I am paid fee for service. So if I'm not sitting in front of a patient, I am not getting paid. I see pediatrics and parents often cancel or no show due to things going on with their kids. I am  not paid for any of those. So I will be sitting at work not making money when I had scheduled appointments.  I feel my boss is exploiting me (the pay rate is very low) and I have asked four times for health insurance which was promised. I've been there 6 months and was supposed to get it after 60 days. I'm in a healthcare field constantly exposed to germs (got Covid from work a couple months ago) and I don't have health insurance through work... kind of ridiculous. I have asked in writing and I am given the runaround every time. 

My boss is supposed to be signing off on my paperwork after each segment (which is around 3 months). She hasn't done it and say she will do it at the end when I'm completely finished. 

My current commute is 8 minutes from home. I was offered a job with an hour and 5 minute commute (sometimes longer depending on traffic) for 61/hour at 37.5 hours per week.. It would be at a school. I have anxiety due to the commute, learning a whole new way of doing things, new supervisor, etc. The special ed director was very curt and rude. She would not be my direct supervisor, but she is the lead supervisor. The thing is, switching CF supervisors can lead to a lot of headache because then you have more than one person you need to sign off on your paperwork. Sometimes they are reluctant to do  it for you. I also don't know this new supervisor so I have no idea what to expect or what they will be like. Your CF supervisor literally holds the key to whether or not you get your certification in the field so a lot of power is in their hands. This is part of my anxiety. This position would also be WFH two days a week, so my commuting time would be 3 days a week at 120 miles round trip. I tested the drive out yesterday and it was pretty awful. It also used a half tank of gas. 

If I take the school job, I won't finish out my hours that I need by the end of the school year in June. I'd be just shy of a few hours to get my certification and would have to wait until the following school year or find a new job (and then I'd have not two but three supervisors signing off on the paperwork). I would qualify for unemployment at that rate if needed because it a W-2 contract position.

I have a personal fear of this commute due to past trauma involving a fatality with a semi involving someone very close to me (fiance). 

Both options are bad in their own ways and I am completely at a loss as to what to do.",Significant-Sign8428,1,1.0,8,1710268595,2024-03-12 18:36:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bd4s49/should_i_take_a_1_hour_commute_for_pay_increase/,3,2024

1bd3w4f,Being let go from my job,"Pretty long story and not sure if this is the proper place but looking for advice on if I can do anything or what to do from here. I worked at a company and did their marketing for a few years started very under paid but worked my way up with a manager who became a friend. He ended up leaving the company and I was looked over for the position for an outside source. Also the turn over in the company and especially sales team and marketing team is crazy. In the time I was there the sales and marketing team had always been around 7-10 people and I’ve seen every single position on the team go through at least 3-4 times. I was the longest standing person on the team and that was just 2 years. When interviewing for the management position the CMO (who is a very petty man and it’s his way or the highway. He get very upset quickly and likes to talk down to people to make himself feel smarter and then I front of more people he acts nice a total douche.) He told me he was impressed with my interview and skills but I was lacking experience and hired someone else who ended up not really knowing much and I ended up doing all the work.

Fast forward the manager “left” the company because he wasn’t happy and kept getting chewed out by the CMO.

Now I interview for the promotion but the next day a family member passed away and took a week or so off and WFH for a month to be with family. When I come back to office I am told I didn’t show my manager skills or step up for the position and am getting passed up again for someone who used to be a sales manager that left the company but was called to return because she wasn’t happy at her new job and because the new sales and marketing manager (she has no marketing knowledge or background).  She has a meeting with me and says she doesn’t want to get in my way of growth so let’s make a plan to grow in the company and gives options I can do. I accept she always acted nice in front of me and talked shit about the CMO behind his back about how unreasonable and shitty he was but would brown nose hard in front of him. She said that’s the game and gotta play the game. But I feel like my dignity is worth more so I always stay true to myself I’m very nice to everyone but won’t take shit from anyone who is rude or gives attitude.

Some time goes by and some team marketing members leave. So now it’s just me and the manager. I’ve completed my years objections and some next years goals. Only thing that hasn’t worked is some digital ads. But now she has me looking for someone to replace the missing team member. She ends up interviewing and finding another girl. (It’s also been heard that the CMO preferred younger girls on the team and people and even the manager have noted he’s very icky about it) any way the Friday before the new girl starts I get sent to a meeting with her and the manager and tell me I’m getting let go. The CMO who has been very involved and micromanages the team didn’t come in or say a word to me. 

I’m shocked at this point. The manager reads off a few words then leaves the room and I stop her to say what happened to creating that goal for growth and the path and her response was “sorry you know how the CMO can be” I knew he didn’t like me much because I don’t suck up to him or laugh at his horrible/ sometimes offensive jokes.

They offered me severance but only if I sign a paper saying I won’t bad talk the company basically.

I apologize for the rant and jumping all over the place I’ve never really posted much and am still kinda upset about the whole situation.

Is there anything I can do or do I just move on I feel like I want to give them a big FU but also don’t want to risk anything.

1bd3hzw,I might have 2 job offers coming in at/near the same time.. but for different roles,"and I'm not sure which one would be a better choice. 

I(early 50s) currently live in S. Texas, have a stay at home wife, house, + kids. The kids are older, 1 soon to be in college & the other is a junior in college, so they don't need me around as much as they did when younger. College should be *nearly* fully paid for both via scholarships and savings plans.

**Job 1)** On-site in Dallas area (would require me to relocate so I found a 1B1Ba place for about 1k/month incl. utilities). This is a software engineering management position at a publicly traded company and ***very*** similar to what I have been doing for the past 8-10 yrs. Pay would be 155k + insurance + 5% 401k matching.

**Job 2)** Fully remote *contract* software development position at 100/hr ***all-inclusive, no benefits***. I'd have to acquire my own family insurance in the Affordable Care Act market, or figure that out somehow.

I'm *almost* leaning towards Job 2 since I'm not laying out an extra 12k+ per year for a 2nd domicile. But the appeal of health insurance is strong in Job 1.

However, I'm treating **Job 1** as an interim position since I would really like to stay permanently in S Texas and will keep applying for a position here in town.

I work in texh and today i had a difficult conversation with boss who basically told me ive been underperforming the last year. It was tough to hear because my whole life ive been someone who has gone out and beyond for work and school and always over performed. I kinda felt this conversation coming. The company is great, great pay, great benefits, remote work. But if im honest the work im doing is good work but doesnt motivate me as much as id wish it would. My boss asked me if i was passionate about the work and i was honest and said that i like the work and as much as i want to be passionate about it, I don’t find alot of passion in this. We set out a gameplan for me to improve my work but i can tell this is probably the last warning if i dont pick it up, during the next review season i might be let go. Im having different feelings right now about this. 
On one hand i dont want to lose my job as ive always have done well at my work and its tough because i exceled so well at my previous job but the pay wasnt amazing. on the other hand if i dont feel passionate about it. How long before i either decide to quit or get fired. The work is alot and there is alot of expectations, far greater than i thought thered be when i signed up. I go on-call for 12 hours ince a month and dread the day it comes because it can sometimes get hectic. The higher ups have to go on-call all week once every few months and i just dont know if thats what i want in the next few years of my life. 


I have enough money saved so i can take the hit if needed, and i know money and benefits isnt everything. I moved to a new city around the time i got my job and i like it here but i dont have much family here. Id perferably would want to keep a remote job but not sure if there are many opportunities for that. 

Maybe im just stressing from getting somewhat bad news today, but this has just gotten me thinking whether its time i look elsewhere or not. Regardless of my decision im going to put in the extra work to be a better engineer and get better at my current job.

1bd2lts,"Feeling stuck in underpaid, overworked job with unsupportive bosses, looking for advice!","Hey everyone,  
As the title suggests, I (22M) find myself pretty unhappy with my current work situation and foresee it worsening if I continue with this company.  
To give you some background, I stumbled upon a part-time job to support myself through college about three years ago, starting as an office assistant for a human services company in my hometown. Over time, I've transitioned into more creative roles within the company's operations, particularly in marketing and communications.  
Fast forward to now, I've landed a full-time role as a marketing and communications specialist after graduating. However, my luck seems to have run out, and I'm at a crossroads trying to figure out my next move.  
First off, my bosses are incredibly unsupportive and unreliable. My direct supervisor, Will, is unprofessional and consistently passive-aggressive, undermining my work with comments like ""AI can do your job."" Meanwhile, my other boss, Jenny, tends to complicate even the simplest tasks, making it challenging to meet deadlines, which she sets herself. A recent example is a major project I'm working on – building a new employee website from scratch – which she's derailed multiple times, diverting my focus to trivial matters like setting up for office events.  
But here's the kicker: despite being in this marketing role for almost a year now, I only received a job description yesterday. Without it, my bosses have been assigning me tasks outside my scope and refusing to consider me for a salaried position. Going through the document, while it secures my job, it doesn't bode well for a pay raise. Currently making $20 an hour, which is decent but not great for Connecticut, I'm disappointed to find myself squarely within the middle of the salary range ($35,000 - $50,000), hinting that a raise wasn't on their agenda. What's more infuriating is that my boss's nephew, doing similar work to what I started with, earns nearly $10,000 more than me, despite my longer tenure and more demanding role.  
This nepotism doesn't end there – his friends, also hired through him, enjoy similar pay disparities. So, I'm left wondering, is it worth sticking around? Feeling underpaid, overworked, and unappreciated, I'm at my wit's end with management. Plus, I don't see myself in this office job long-term, especially with my background in comm/psych gearing me toward grad school (if I can afford it).  
TL;DR: Fed up with unsupportive bosses, feeling underpaid and overworked despite being with the company for 3 years. Considering a job change, but uncertain due to current job market conditions and desire for job security.

1bd298b,Working in a Small Team with Clashing Personalities (Advice Needed!),"I'm hoping to get some unbiased advice and hear similar experiences from others who might relate.  
I work in a very small team - just me and one other person. We have completely different personalities and work styles, even though we're in the same field. I would think I'm more relaxed and easygoing.  
Initially, I tried to build a friendly rapport because a good working relationship is important in a small team. We both joined the company a few months apart with a similar seniority/title. Things were okay at first, but over the past couple of years, the dynamic has shifted. We barely talk outside of meetings, and I've become more guarded about my work.  
Here's where it gets tricky:  
Since some tasks overlap with our expertise, I feel defensive and anxious when we collaborate. Imagine someone who is much more outspoken being at a meeting which isn’t in his/her expertise.   
Now and then she would point out mistakes in my work, sometimes texting me at night after hours (most of the time just a screenshot with a circle around the mistake). As much as I acknowledge the mistakes I can't help feeling uneasy about it.

While I acknowledge her strengths (hardworking, proactive), there are moments that I feel she tries to appear better than she is.

Objectively, my own motivation has dipped. I have good days, but on most others, I feel more at ease when my coworker isn't around. It's a tense situation, and while I try to focus on work and stay positive, the negativity creeps back in.  
Any advice on navigating a situation like this, especially in a small team?  
Have you dealt with a coworker with a very different personality? How did you manage it?

2. As a startup founder, what single skill or area of expertise (technical, design, business, etc.) is most important for you to have strong personal proficiency in, rather than relying on co-founders or employees?

I'd appreciate any insights or personal stories from those who have experience starting your own tech companies, especially in the AI/ML space.

1bd0j92,Should I drop out of uni to pursue a career at a large tech company?,"I\[19M\] have always had a passion for computers and programming and basically spend every waking hour working on related projects. I'm now about the finish my first year of a computer science bachelor in the Netherlands but feel like I'm not learning anything. Due to some of my projects I posted online I got in touch with a recruiter which lead to a job offer at a large and well known tech company in the US. I think I'll learn more at that job than by finishing my bachelors.

So should I drop out? Not having to worry about student loans sounds really nice. And I wouldn't mind moving to the US either. It is a junior role but the salary is really nice. 

The alternative for me would be to continue studying and doing a part-time internship.

1bczz8z,I dont know if I should quit or not?,"
I am currently stuck between staying at my current job or moving on to another industry. I currently am a 1099 employee working in life insurance. I’ve done it for 6 months now and have seen some success and it only goes up the more that you do it, but I have began to loose the drive and the want to do the job as it isn’t really something I am passionate about but it offers a lot of potential.

I am considering leaving to go back to a w2 job in an industry that peaks my interest more. It will also allow me to have more time to work on myself more along with other passions I don’t currently have the time to peruse. I have talked to friends, family, and co-workers and can see the benefit of both sides but really don’t know what to do and want to make sure I make the right decision.

On the side of the insurance job the earning potential is high and I’m currently about a month out from a promotion that will open more opportunities, along with I’ve devoted the last 6 months to this and have only gotten better but I just don’t know if it’s worth stayed my if I don’t enjoy it. On the other hand I could go to a job in an industry that I’m more interested in and have more time but wouldn’t make as much but it’s still a good income.

Thank you if you read everything and any advice is greatly appreciated. I hope I explained everything well.",hmmmm549,1,1.0,2,1710257281,2024-03-12 15:28:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bczz8z/i_dont_know_if_i_should_quit_or_not/,3,2024

1bczdr3,Take this time to figure out what I want to do or stay comfortable?,"Hello all, 26(F) here and I am currently pursuing my MBA online. To give a bit of background, this a career pivot for me. I was originally going into social work and found myself working for an attorney for a few years instead and that is when I realized I did not want to pursue social work anymore. I spent a few years working in both legal and social work field and realized I could not do it long term as I lost the passion and felt I would burn out by time I reached my 30s. 

Fast forward a year and I am now working in higher education as an administrative employee. I currently have great benefits, especially the health insurance which was basically the only reason that I took this job. The pay absolutely sucks. I am making less now than I made while in my last 2 years of undergrad so thats saying a lot. I love my coworkers, the job is not bad but it is not what I want to do and I cannot see myself doing a higher up role in this field. My resume is pretty bad as far as diversity and work experience, I have 3 years legal secretary, 1 year social work, now 1 year at the college. 

My issue is I am not entirely sure what I want to do with my life. I was hoping I could break into the HR field but it just seems like a very oversaturated field and I also feel like I will not enjoy it as much. I am really only thinking about HR because I know it is a stable field with many options within various industries. But now I am thinking that is just not what I want to do either. 

I do not graduate with my MBA until Fall of 2025 and I would really like this time to explore career options and maybe snag a couple internships or two. Currently, I am leaning towards financial analyst/planning field. Something I have always been interested in, however, its more of a hobby than anything. I have a total obsession with investments, analyzing stocks, planning future financials etc. I have been indulging in the stock market since 2020 and have been completely OBSESSED since. I have gained a lot of money and have been very successful at it. Over the past year the obsession grew so much to the point I created my own mini books and accumulated knowledge about the stock market. My boyfriend even stated ""you need to make a career out of this."" Well maybe I can? 

I know financial/planning analysts its not all about the stock market, it comes with more in regards to helping those expand their finances to obtain profit and so on. Here is where I need advice, should I leave my job where I have good benefits but little pay to explore other job opportunities? There is currently a firm in my town that offers many internships in the financial analyst field, but only part-time so I will making less money. But not going to lie, working full-time (sometimes overtime) it has been really hard for me to keep up with my studies. I just reached my 1 year at my new job and I feel like I need to explore other options to find my niche. I am also very worried I won't find a job post-MBA due to lack of experience. However, I am very comfortable and need my health insurance. I would lose all my benefits and even retirement (need to stay for 3 years to receive the match). But, my boyfriend and I (8 years very serious relationship) are discussing us eloping so I can be on his health insurance so I can look for jobs or internships I would like to pursue instead of just jobs that offer health insurance that I don't even want to do. He also is head of household and makes enough money where I could not work at all and we would still be fine. So working part-time would not be an issue for an internship or job to gain experience. 

The last 2 years have been non-stop waking up with intense anxiety and just all around being a miserable person because I am spending all this time and energy on things I don't want to do. I know I sound stupid and so Gen Z saying that but cmon, I don't want to be in my 30s stuck in a job I hate making little money!! 

Sorry for the long post, if you made it this far I greatly appreciate it and appreciate any advice/feedback you have to offer.

I have been updating my CVs, following all advice about cover letters, etc. I also have solid networks (which to be fair, I haven't activated just yet), and I am a super competent employee. for realz. just solid references from every workplace I've been so far. but I feel so tired, I feel it is like part-time work on top of my full-time work but with no salaries or guaranteed results. 

But honestly so many rejections just directly, or ""you are so great but we will be going with another candidate"" plus the 3 thousand layers and steps of selection processes, plus the bs of ""we encourage diversity, you should apply even if you do not meet the criteria"" and then you apply and you are bluntly rejected because you did not meet all the criteria.

anyways, now for the actual tips - how do all of you job hunters stay sane, how do you take care of yourselves, how do you take care so you don't lose yourselves in a pit of despair? any and every tip appreciated. <3

Just looking to vent. I’m about 3 months into my new job, and I really enjoy it, the company and the work. I’m 24 and it’s my role out of university. 

Whilst I do really enjoy what I do. The routine of my day to day hasn’t really changed in the last 2-3 years. The whole sitting in front of my laptop (I’m a software engineer), logging off, seeing friends or doing hobbies is getting old and the city I’m in is getting stale. 

I have always wanted to travel, (one of the multi plane journey tickets) but have always been paralyzed by career suicide, I feel like I’ve been making my career my life at times. I do well in work and can definitely see myself progressing but I can’t help but wish everyday that I was travelling, experiencing new things and meeting new people. I feel like it would revive my feelings of what I do and where I live.

I’ve always been afraid of the what if’s and they’ve been holding me back but everyday that goes past I find myself wanting to travel more. I’ve never really travelled much in my life. 

Just lookin some advice. By the time I go I’ll have about 2.5 years experience and I was looking to travel for a year. So will be returning when I’m 26, is that too late / old?

1bcxz69,Tired of crappy jobs and situations ,"I (25f) am tired of my job history. 
I’ve had 4 jobs in 2023. The first 2 were part time jobs when I was finishing college. First was a hosting job that was part time and I left because I wasn’t making money really and I was offered a job at the Post office. I liked the hosting job but money wasn’t there. I worked at the post office for 3 months and when I was hired the post master lied to me saying I would be moved to full time but turns out that was a total lie and I was driving 40 minutes for 4.5 hours of work. I got a job at a bank as a teller and liked it at first but my co worker were so nasty to me. They would yell at me for no reason (legit no reason) and management blamed me. I was tired of being bullied and hated at work because I wasn’t in “the click” so I left. I got a job at a jewelry store and liked it at first but turns out my boss can be so mean. She will pull you into the office and scold and yell at you for about half hour so or and she isn’t nice at those times. It can be nothing you did wrong but she yells at you anyways.  Then she will turn around and be the nicest person in the world. 
I’m not allowed any overtime either and that’s hard. It’s a non commission job so no stress on making big sales for paychecks.  Im tired of being treaded like this every day. 

I have an associate degree in business administration. 
Im tired of getting myself into these crappy situations and regretting it later. I feel like a job hopper because I don’t stay long because the jobs actually suck.

I joined my current company about 2 years ago and grown to being a Team Lead and got AWS SAA. Since it's a startup i'm also the lone software engineer and devops engineer currently in my project. However it's a company inbuilt product and there were talks of spinning it to it's own company. So might have potential to be a one of the founders. On the other hand, the company has a track record of not honoring their words in the past.

My main aim for this year is to get a higher pay and a more specialized role. 

Now the issue is that I have had experience with a couple of roles and languages, not sure which ones to focus on when looking for jobs. Also maintaining a couple of different CVs and cover letters for each role and in addition to the multiple tech stacks is not easy as most recruiters I know use LinkedIn and it might be hard to do this there.

Should I just pick one and go all in or should I juggle my different hats?

1bcvubp,30 working a minimum wage retail position. Looking for advice on how to move forward into a better paying job or how to change careers with zero experience.,"This isn't something I've done before, so apologises in advance if any information provided is missing, or if the nature of the post isn't structurally correct. 

In an attempt to keep this short and to the point, this is my situation. I'm 30, currently staying with my parents with my partner and working in retail, full time, but on near minimum wage. I earn around 22.5k annually, and whilst that's far from the worst life, I can't help be wanting more. 

The problem is the lack of a feeling of pride of having any kind of job satisfaction. I've worked retail since I left school and I don't have anything against it, but the opportunities to progress and the progression path isn't the best, but I genuinely don't know what my options are for making a change, where to search for jobs, how to seek out opportunities. Anything really. 

I'm of course aware of sites such as indeed, I've also considered looking into civil service jobs. My issue there is that honestly, most of the jobs I see advertised, I don't really know much about what they are, what it would involve and how you would even get involved in that career. 

I never did well in school. I wasn't a bad student, I understood most of what was being taught, I just had no motivation to learn and had a hard time concentrating. That's change as I've gotten older. I'm wanting to learn and seek out opportunities and new career paths, but I don't know how to go about doing that. I've only worked retail my entire life. It's pretty much all I know and outside of that, I wouldn't say I have any skills that would enable me to pursue alternative careers and earn a better living. 

The only thing I have going for me, realistically, is my work ethic. I'm consistently one of the few workers who works hard consistently, who is flexible, willing to learn, but in retail, especially at an entry level position, that doesn't count for much and it rarely, if ever, goes noticed and gets rewarded.

So what I'm really looking for is advice. Perhaps some of you have been in similar positions or can offer advice on how best to seek opportunities for starting a new career, earning more money, changing careers with zero experience, anything really. 

If nothing else, I'm looking to learn and make the most going forward from the position I'm in. I of course appreciate all comments given and am hugely grateful to anyone who read the entire post. I tried to make it as short as possible.

Since last September, I've applied to over 100 companies for a summer internship or placement, reaching the final assessment center stage with only three and receiving only offer from Siemens Energy.

I had continously updated my CV and done many mock interviews with positive feedback - I just get the short end of the straw unfortunately.

Here's the crux of my dilemma: accepting this placement would extend my degree to 5 years. Is seizing this opportunity the right move, or should I aim for a placement closer to my final year, considering the conventional wisdom about penultimate year placements? Given my track record with applications, I'm not confident about securing another placement or summer internship next year if I pass on this.

I'm thrilled to have received an offer but simultaneously overwhelmed by the logistics and implications. The placement is a 40-mile drive from where I live, translating to an 80-mile round trip and roughly 2 hours of commuting each day. I've inquired about deferring the placement for a year, but unfortunately, that's not an option Siemens provides.

I'm really torn. On one hand, this placement could provide invaluable experience and a significant edge in the job market post-graduation. On the other, the commute and extended duration of my studies are significant considerations. Plus, the uncertainty of securing a placement next year if I decline this offer is a constant worry.

What would you do in my shoes? Accept the placement and adjust my course duration, or take a gamble and search for opportunities next year, potentially closer to home or in my penultimate year? Any insights, personal experiences, or advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S I do have an offer for summer internship again at a civil company that I did a summer intership last year as well. But I don't see it as beneficial to repeat.",Rowdyking1000,1,1.0,0,1710243608,2024-03-12 11:40:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcv5sn/take_a_yearlong_placement_or_risk_my_chances/,3,2024
1bcv048,Third interview expectations,"Hello!  
  
I am a recent marketing graduate and although I do have some working experience related to marketing, my experience is not directly relevant to the job I have applied for. It is a junior position at a foreign company but they have employees in the country I have applied from.  
  
My first interview was with the HR manager, it went great, she scheduled the second interview on the spot.  
  
The second interview was a bit more difficult. I did present myself quite well and had a pleasant talk. The manager gave me a few tasks, I would say I had more or less decent answers, but I failed horribly at one of them and felt extremely embarrassed. I was waiting for a rejection letter since I thought there was no way they would want to proceed with me. To my surprise, I got invited to a third interview with the team lead from the country I applied from (the company mentioned they usually do 3-5 interviews before hiring someone). The first two interviews were with the employees from the headquarters.  
  
What can I expect from the third interview in such a case? Is it a good sign even though I thought I did badly with the tasks? Is it possible they assessed my motivation and that is the reason they are proceeding with me?  
  
Any advice or opinions would help! Thank you!",ayvikenedy,1,1.0,0,1710243056,2024-03-12 11:30:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcv048/third_interview_expectations/,3,2024
1bcuqba,Please Read this I need Help I am Confused,"I (age=20) am a BCA(Bachelor in Computer Applications) student in a bad college The college was supposed to provide us a selection between two main specialisation that were Cloud computing or Mobile computing. Cloud computing Included Web Development and Container Orchestration and Mobile Computing Included AR and VR technology and also Mobile development, now ofcourse the subject were much more broader but I am generalizing this. I choose Mobile computing but the college faculty and members in general Did not allow us to select it as all the participants included only 8 choose Mobile computing. So they told us to get 50 students or you all with have to go with Cloud. And this is basically a scam but nobody really bothered to raise their voice none of us were good and coding(this coding part won't make sence but at the time all the students were demolarized by few teachers) we could not do anything. 

Now that the root cause has been explained let me elaborate about my problem. You see I did not want to choose cloud even though there are some similarities in the specialisation. My first year went good, my second year was Average and now it's third year sem 6 this is the last semester And I am pretty sure I might not get even normal eligibility criteria to give entrance exams I have few choices let I never gave entrance exams even to join BCA in this college I don't want a college like this one but the problem is I have been depressed for the last 2 years to the point where my mental health is... I just can't call it normal I am having anger Issues to the point where I might have slapped myself 3 time in the last 1 year it's hard to concentrate on my study I can't get out of these thoughts. I will either prepare for MCA or MBA and probably a Year drop because our graduation and Exams are clashing.

I will have to learn Mathematics, Logic/ reasoning, English in both the subjects but additional Programming for MCA.

I am a commerce student, I do have these opportunities but My parents want me to get a job Which honestly I don't think I am eligible for.

1bcu10c,Started a new job but onboarding has been rough. Still haven’t been given access to anything.,"Hi everyone.

Need some help here because I’m really not sure how to handle this situation.

I was recently hired on to a new company and the onboarding process has been rough.

It took them about 5 days to get an offer letter to me, then once that was signed, I was sent a few forms to fill out.

I got those completed on a Monday, but by Thursday had still not received any further communication from the company.

I had a call with my manager and was told to be patient, that they had recently done a lot of hiring and that things were moving slow.

Friday I get a text from my manager that his boss wants to meet with me and went to set up a teams meeting, which I didn’t receive the invite for because he sent it to my work email (which I don’t have access to). 

I ended up meeting with my managers boss because he sent the meeting invite to my personal email. During the meeting I finally start getting more emails from the company to fill out more forms. My boss later admitted that it was his error this didn’t happen earlier, but he’s a new hire and I’m his first hire, so I understood.

The last email I received is that my access to the system was created and that I’d get another email on how to login and set it up, which I never received.

I sent by boss a message Friday that I was waiting for this, as well as yesterday, and was told again to just be patient.

I’m now in my second week, and left my previous, well paying job for this one and really don’t know what to do. Obviously I don’t want to escalate the situation because I don’t want to start on the wrong foot, but at the same time, if I can’t submit my hours at the end of the month, I don’t get paid, not to mention I’m currently just sitting around not doing anything, so part of me is afraid I’ll get fired.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",jacephoenix,3,1.0,1,1710239466,2024-03-12 10:31:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcu10c/started_a_new_job_but_onboarding_has_been_rough/,3,2024

1bcs6zr,What job positions should I be looking for?,"I’m part of a special program for high achieving high schoolers with the oil company Aramco where they pay for my college degree for a specific major they want and I work for them for the number of years I was studying for a degree (4 years). I have a passion for film but my parents said they wouldn’t pay for my degree and I also like a comfortable stable life so I gave up on that idea and went with the Aramco opportunity. One of the majors Aramco wanted was environmental economics and policy. I dont like economics but I love political science and I care about climate change so I thought why not. Now that I’ve graduated I’ve started working as a petroleum engineer system analyst at Aramco (its a vague position, but to give you an idea of what I do I’ll be jumping to different departments every year as part of their employee development program Upstream Carbon Circularity, ESG analysis and reporting, Green Energy Policy Analysis).

Anyways 6 months in and I hate it. Not the job per se, but the economic/engineering aspects of it don’t speak to me, and the country and the coworkers does not fit my personality im getting lonely and theres no one I feel comfortable talking to freely. Also working in sustainability for an oil company involves things I find immoral and its kind of sucking my soul (sorry if you are right wing, just bear with me I’m not here to debate).

So I’m definitely leaving after the 4 year ends, but I dont really know where to look. What type of jobs does my experience attract? I now have a bachelors of science on environmental economics and policy from UC berkeley and will have 4 years experience from Aramco in various sustainability economics/policy departments. Are there specific job titles that exist in many companies that I should look into?

1bcrui6,Think I made a big mistake studying medical science ,"Hi all, 

I graduated from medical science in 2020. Currently 27 years old. Straight after uni I went into a sales position while the housing market was hot and sales were good, instead of going into my field of study. 

Long story short, it was an incredibly stressful job and while I did pretty well I ultimately got burnt out and depressed and now that the market has slowed down I called it quits as it just wasn’t worth my mental health. 

I’ve applied to a few different positions but there isn’t a very high demand for med scientists and the pay is pretty poor compared to what I was doing previously (I was making about 120k and med science positions seem to be around 70k at the moment). 

I’m seriously contemplating completely reeducating myself and studying something completely different. It just feels crippling as I just managed to pay my hecs debt down to 5k ish and I don’t know if I’m too old to study something like law, engineering, or something in IT.  

Has anyone had experience switching careers completely like this? I really can’t see a pathway forward with my current degree.

1bcpg9g,Should I switch from architecture to event management?,"Should I switch from architecture to event management?

I’ve been an architectural graduate for 3 years and worked in a couple of firms. I got into architecture because I enjoyed graphics and art in high school, and thought that architecture would be a logical career decision.

University was challenging but I enjoyed the social aspect and being able to develop my design abilities. My grades were average but enough to get by.

I haven’t been enjoying work for a while. Sitting in front of a computer all day and drawing lines has been taxing on me. I’ve also had a bad string of toxic managers/ work environments that have put me off the industry.

I feel as though my personality type isn’t suited to architecture, and I don’t have the skills or interest levels to pursue a long-term career. I don’t mind the conceptual/ presentation stage, but I struggle with details and constructability. I've been able to work on some interesting projects and learn a lot more about buildings, but I don't feel like the job is the right fit for me. Talking about architecture gives me a feeling of impostor syndrome - it’s not something I’m passionate about. 

For nearly 10 years I’ve also been working casually as a front-of-house member at local events (concerts, conferences etc). This started as a way of supplementing my income, but I’ve stayed on because it’s genuinely the highlight of my working week. The work environment is fun and the people I work with are very supportive. The biggest thing is that I feel stimulated and gain immense work satisfaction from interacting with the guests and helping them out. 

I want a career that energises me and allows me to utilise my interpersonal skills. My passion for events makes me think I should consider a career in the event industry. 
 
I’ve been thinking of leaving my current job and studying a graduate diploma in event management full-time. This would allow me to learn more about the field without immediately committing to a full-time role. It’s a 1 year course so not too big of a commitment. It’s also a distance learning course, so it could work around some additional event gigs. 

It’s a risky move, there’s no guarantee of a job afterwards. I’m also worried about being shut out of architecture if event management doesn’t work out. But I feel this is a something I have to try while I’m still young.",WittyManufacturer280,1,1.0,0,1710220988,2024-03-12 05:23:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcpg9g/should_i_switch_from_architecture_to_event/,3,2024
1bcp9k9,Current substitute teacher w/ a psychology background. Unsure of where to go from here.,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice, suggestions, ideas, questions etc. to poke my brain a bit. I’m having a hard time figuring out what I want to do with my life. I’m 29 and really would have liked to have a career by now but it is what it is. 

This is probably really long so TL;DR at the bottom.

I have a bachelor’s in psych and am currently a “full-time” substitute teacher (I’m still considered per diem but I work in two large districts with sub shortages so I work every day). I enjoy it but miss some aspects of my last job. 

So I worked in the ABA field as a behavior therapist (BT) for about 6 years (basically behavioral therapy with mainly autistic kids). I loved many things about it. I loved the science, the process, the outcomes, etc. I didn’t expect to love it when I started I just wanted a relevant job in the field while getting my BA. I even started to pursue licensure and got my BCaBA (asst supervisor basically) and worked as a mid-level case manager which I loved even more. Designing my own programs, following up with parents, etc. the only thing I didn’t love was training new hires and performing monthly fidelity checks with every BT (important to do but not my fav). I even began to pursue masters/licensure. But I burnt out really really hard. 

There were a lot of reasons why, and a lot of reasons why I wanted to tough it out but I ended up leaving my company and basically went back to being a full time BT except in school. During this time I came to love the classroom environment but behavioral therapy left such a bitter taste in my mouth so I decided to look into teaching. That was about two years ago now and I’ve been subbing for about 1.5 years. I enjoy a lot of it and I have been interested in seeking a teaching credential to go full time.

But the past year has been a lot of work figuring out who I am and what I want the rest of my life to look like. And regarding my career I am very interested in teaching but I realized something: I really miss helping people. I miss seeing my clients grow and change. I miss forging relationships with them. Honestly, I even miss managing crisis situations. They are tough and not fun but very rewarding, and honestly, I kinda of crave them in a way, I never WANT them to happen but stepping in and de escalating situations made me feel like… idk like I was meant to be doing it? I’m not sure how to explain but I felt very in my element.

I can definitely get some of those from teaching but not to the degree I had before. I’ve had great moments subbing long term for the same classrooms. I love the creativity of making my own lessons and I love being with a student with learning challenges, because figuring out how to get them to understand and then seeing them do it is sooo rewarding for me. So here’s my dilemma. 

Basically I loved ABA but I burned out very hard on it. I like teaching but I am not sure if it’s exciting enough for me. I’m interested in other psychology fields or even special ed but I have no experience in the former and the latter has its own issues. 

Some things I enjoy: I like doing my own thing my own way, I like starting things by the book and finding creative ways to teach/help/solve a problem. But I also very much like collaboration. I like helping people. I like working with kids (big brother syndrome lol). I like a mix of both laid-back and challenging, otherwise too easy I’m bored, too challenging I burnout. I like forging a (professional) relationship with clients/students. Also, I like when I can be very fun while still being productive. Being too professional all the time is boring to me. 

Things I don’t want: too much oversight. Fields where it’s “expected” of me to overwork. Lack of consistency with clients, hours, schedule (especially schedule that’s a big reason why working in schools interested me). Having to go back to school that will take more than 2 years at most.

TL;DR I’m subbing in elem schools rn, and I have a psych/ABA background, but I’m unsure of whether to continue with teaching or go back to psych/behavioral health field. Wut do?

I welcome any suggestions or questions!",yungk0k0nut,3,1.0,4,1710220332,2024-03-12 05:12:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcp9k9/current_substitute_teacher_w_a_psychology/,3,2024

1bcnzmg,Need to transition out of nonprofit sector after being stretched too thin,"After spending 8 years at the organization where I interned, I'm now seeking a change but am really not sure where to start. 

Initially, I was very lucky to have been hired directly from my internship during my nonprofit business management certification. I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do and what my skills were but had a great boss who exposed me to so much. Ive gotten a promotion every 1 to 2 years since I've been there and am now part of senior leadership.

1bcndbp,Ex slandering me via Google reviews ,"My ex is posting negative fake Google reviews about me. We only dated for about 10 months and broke up almost 2 years ago now, but is still trying to destroy my reputation. I work for a large company that has many locations across the globe. When I was initially hired, I moved from my home town to a small town for the job, that was very soon after we started dating, we decided to give the long distance thing a try, it was really hard, and after an emotionally and sexually abusive 10 months, we broke up. We visited each other as much as we could (weekends and days off) as we were about 6 hours away from each other. Throughout the relationship, he would call me (often in the middle of the night when I was trying to sleep) to threaten breaking up with me. It didn’t take much for him to change his mind about that - felt more like a threat than him actually wanting to break up. When we would see each other, he would constantly force me to have sex with him, even when I said no - he would guilt me into doing it anyway. 

Fast forward 10 months, he called to threaten to break up with me and I just said “okay”. I didn’t have the energy to fight him anymore. It was over just like that, but it was painful for me because I lived in a small town where I only knew my coworkers, had only my best friend, I lived alone, and had no friends. 

A few months later, I moved to a bigger city to pursue bigger things in my career at the same company. I was happy in the big city, I enjoyed my job and found some friends. The day I moved to the big city, my ex decided to post a 1-star Google review about the company in the small town I worked in along with a very negative review for the company by best friend worked for in that small town. He also created a fake account to post additional 1-star reviews for both companies. I decided to just ignore those and move on. 

However, a couple months ago, I travelled back to that small town for a few days to help out and he posts another 1-star review on the company for the city I live in now, under both accounts. At this point, I have to tell my boss what’s happening. Luckily she is understanding and wants to help, but Google doesn’t allow you to remove fake reviews. My ex doesn’t know what my company even does, just that I work there. He also shouldn’t know that I moved from the small town. A few days ago now, I find that he did the same thing for the company I’m developing myself on the side. My company is very new, it has only been on Google for a short time and I haven’t even had any clients yet, so there shouldn’t be any reviews. But he gave 1-star reviews under both accounts yet again. So the company has 2 1-star reviews and nothing else. What can I do? My own company relies on Google reviews for marketing and promotion. Google won’t take the reviews down because it “doesn’t violate their policy”. 

Is there any legal action I can take to get him to take the reviews down and leave me alone? Ignoring him is not working and it’s just getting worse. My professional reputation is very important for me to maintain because that’s how I get work in the company I work for and my own business. I’m trying to develop my reputation in this new city and he is making that way more difficult than it needs to be. Please help.

1bcmhao,Drawn out and unusual interview process,"I'm having a hard time understanding the situation that I've been in for 3 months now. Here is a timeline:

Early-Dec: my ex-colleague offered to introduce me to managers at another department of a company he joined

Mid-Dec: I was scheduled  to interview with a few managers and the department head. All went well and the department head asked me to help draft a role description. He said that he liked what I prepared. 

Early-Jan: after holidays, I dropped him a note to say that I remained very interested (Whatsapp is his preferred channel). He replied that he was swamped but would get back to me in the next couple days. 

Jan 22: did not hear back for weeks (and I had forwarded a couple things by email to see if it might nudge him). I mentiond the situaton to my ex-colleague and he offered to follow up. 

Feb 6: ex-colleague texted me that he managed to connect... the department head had apparently been sick. The next day I got an apologetic call from him. He said that the team agreed that I would be a great fit. They are not talking to other candidates but it was a matter of waiting for headcount approval. He asked me to stay patient. 

Feb 15: He texted me that things are finally moving on their side and said that either he or HR would call me in the next couple days. 

Feb 20: He texted again to say that he wanted me to interview with two other managers to ""broaden the support base"" and this would help with my compensation discussions. He made it sound like a formality and said that he would prepare me beforehand. 

March 4: I completely the two other interviews. The department head never did prepare me (I texted him to ask, but he didn't answer). One interview went fine, the other was a little awkward because the manager didn't seem aware about the scope of the role as it had been discussed. 

March 5: I texted the department head to say that I enjoyed the interviews and pls let me know if anything further was required. He replied saying he had a funeral to attend and so hadn't been able to prepare me. He said he would get the feedback and would call me in the ""next day or so"" and we can hopefully move on to the next steps. 

March 8: I texted him to ask how things were shaping up since I still hadn't heard from him. He didn't answer and another four days have now gone by. 

At this point, it's getting aggravating. The department head has been really positive and constructive whenever we've communicated, but then he ghosts me for extended periods  and comes back talking about illness/death. I've been led to expect an offer for over a month now, instead i'm trying to interpret this latest round of silence. 

Should I keep texting him, or does it make me seem desperate/impatient? Advice appreciated

1bcmg32,"Choosing between volatile, high pay and stable, lower pay jobs","I’m a writer/content marketer who was recently laid off and thankfully have been lucky enough to get plenty of freelance opportunities, a part time job and as of today, an offer for a full time position as a content manager at a startup. However, I’m not entirely sure I want to accept the position. 

While the payment is nice and it offers benefits, I’m not fully sure I’m ready for the volatility of a startup that develops AI software. I previously worked at a fully remote marketing agency and got used to having flexibility and freedom in my day to day, and after a week the part time advertising job I’ve been working at has offered to bring me on full time and pay me more. However, I’m on as a 1099 contractor and the company doesn’t offer benefits. Instead, they’re offering to pay me more than enough to cover my bills, taxes and there’s a lot of potential for growth at a relatively small company. 

I’m not looking for someone to make a decision for me, and I’m currently considering staying where I’m at because the company culture is welcoming, the team is great, and they’re offering to invest heavily into me as a leadership candidate. But am I crazy trading something I’m comfortable with for a higher-risk job that could pay off just as much in the long run? My main concern is the stability of the higher-paying company – with so much up in the air regarding the future of AI, I’m not sure I want to jump on that train.

1bcmfzv,"Reason I left my first corporate job, and wondering if it was reasonable that I felt it was dysfunctional?","Hi, I'm 25 and only had one corporate job after graduation. I stayed for 1 year 3 months, and just resigned. Reason I resigned:  
The senior associate and my direct manager are like besties. The senior associate is not supposed to be a manager by any means, but once I started making mistakes in my work, she started record keeping all of my mistakes and sharing it with our director. The director encouraged this behaviour, hell, I think she actually requested it.  
The senior associate and director worked as a team to build a case about myself and my coworker (other senior associate) so that we could be dropped like a hot potato at any moment.  
The senior associate micromanaged everything I did, because I was new and didn't know the processes like she did (she was at the company for over 4 years). The micromanaging went so far as to me having to CC her on every single email I send outside of our department. This went on for 5 months until I finally quit.  
Now, Mind you, I work in HR. Is this something you guys ever experienced, and was it wrong for me to not endure this insanity and to leave? Thanks for any input :).

1bcltuh,Mid 30’s career advice,"
Hi all,
First time posting (be kind haha).
I am having a 30-life-career-crisis where I have grown out of my ‘just doing jobs for the sake of it’ and wanting to really work towards something that will set me up for good financial freedom and success for the future

Currently I’m on a 110k salary, which on paper sounds great if the culture was not working over time every day, having no breaks/eating at your desk and everything being a rush resulting in reworks because of rush/poor planning from project teams. 
I work in shop fitting design and the job itself is enjoyable with the variety, however the above challenges make me feel like I am not getting value for my hourly rate with expected overtime and 
unnecessary/avoidable pressures

I have no degree/qualifications, however relatable experience within design and don’t mind the idea of a temporary setback in pay with the greater prospect of larger pay as well as potentially stepping into something physical, rather than office based. 
I have been considering the following jobs:
-Electrical apprenticeship - ultimately to run my own business.
-Trainee linesman
-Rail labourer / electrician
-Air traffic controller
Jobs that paid hourly, good rates and prospects

I recognise I have a good thing are far as good wage, stability, early and consistent hours of 7-3  (if overtime wasn’t an issue). Also am fortunate to have limited obligations with no prospect of kids and a manageable mortgage, so I believe I have the capacity to take a risk or temporary back step in wage, should the end result yield a better income / situation. 
I am the type of person who is unafraid of change and challenge, but simply want to maximise my earning potential rather than donating time and diminishing my wage.

ANY advice at all, whether it be personal experience, wisdom or whether you’ve been through the same thing, would be greatly appreciated. Any recommendations to the jobs I’ve noted or any others, would also be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you!",dale-jaymes,3,1.0,0,1710209857,2024-03-12 02:17:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcltuh/mid_30s_career_advice/,3,2024
1bcl3ow,Tell me about a challenge you have had to overcome in your workplace. Is this a good answer?,"One question that often gets asked during interviews is; 

Tell me about a challenge you have had to overcome in your workplace. I have drafted an answer to that question, tell me if this sounds good. 

When I completed my internship in college, I was tasked with helping to plan, set up and clean up an event for peace day. The event was scheduled to take place outdoors. 

Two days before the event occurred the weather report stated that it was supposed to rain. The plan was to have a table with all of the baked goods. Obviously we could not have that in the rain. There were no indoor locations where this activity would be an option. Therefore, it seemed as though we could not have the table with all of the baked goods on it.  

I spoke to my supervisor and suggested bringing a canopy and a tarp and the table with all of the baked goods could be under the tarp. When he informed me that there was not enough money in the budget for that, I informed him that I have a canopy and a tarp and would be willing to donate it to the school. 

I made sure to bring the tarp and canopy the day before the event, so that my supervisor could inspect it and see it if it suitable for its intended purpose. On the day of the event, I helped set up the canopy. We made sure to do that before the rain started. 

The result is that the the table with all of the baked goods was kept dry. The other people who were tasked with working the event appreciated my donation.",bigelow6698,1,1.0,4,1710207884,2024-03-12 01:44:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcl3ow/tell_me_about_a_challenge_you_have_had_to/,3,2024

1bck7xv,Bad reviews for new job are scaring me,"Earlier this year I accepted a position, and I am moving 2 hours away for this role, my start date is coming up. A few months ago, I saw reviews on Glassdoor that my company can be a little “clique-y” and you would need to like buy into the culture to move up. But today I saw recent reviews (as recent as two weeks ago) that made me very nervous. 

Two reviews essentially stated the company is based on toxic positivity and it is a toxic work environment. The reviews claim the company says want to support you, but silence employees and if an employee speaks up, they are pulled into hours long meetings to discuss why not to question management. Allegedly, you are not allowed to have a bad day, as there is no room for negativity. It was also claimed the company has a high turnover rate, as people either quit or they are fired for “poor performance” despite having positive reviews from management and not having any infractions. Lastly I saw that there is a conspiracy that it is hard to find genuine reviews on the company because they are a marketing based company who try and bump positive reviews. 

The reviews state their mental health has declined since working there, they are overworked, and treated poorly with a few specific examples that are too specific for my post. 

I know I should take negative reviews with a grain of salt and everyone has different experiences and I want to give this company a fair chance. But I genuinely have a pit in my stomach over this. I considered bringing it up to clear the air, but if what the reviews are saying is true, I don’t want to cross any lines.

I think it may be important to mention that I applied and after 4 interviews I got rejected. However a few months later they called me back saying there is an opening and they would love to have me on the team, so I had one more interview before being offered the job. The interviews were positive, everyone seems nice, and the company (per my offer letter) is generous.

The job market is really tough right now, I have been trying to get a job for over a year. This is my first job out of college, and I feel like this is my chance to enter the industry. I am excited for the role and to gain experience, but I’m worried at what cost. I know no place is perfect, but these reviews are brutal. 

Any advice / words of encouragement? 

TLDR; I accepted a new position that I’m moving away for but hearing negative reviews are really scaring me. Any general advice? ",folklore-peace,1,1.0,4,1710205512,2024-03-12 01:05:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bck7xv/bad_reviews_for_new_job_are_scaring_me/,3,2024

1bcisfn,Should I take this job if offered?,"I am a CSR thinking about getting into project management. My current company is very toxic, I have been there almost a year, and am looking to leave but scared to get into another toxic environment. I already feel negatively about leaving so soon at this job.

I had a phone screen with the recruiter and then virtual interview with the hiring manager of a furniture dealer satellite office near me for a project coordinator role, but worried it will be toxic too. They want to bring me in for an onsite interview on Wednesday. 

The office is very small, only about 25 people, and is only 10 minutes away from my apartment. Current company is 25 minutes away. The role is completely onsite. This company just got bought by a construction company, who bought another company just like theirs in another state and is combining forces now. I currently make 52k and they asked me for the salary range I wanted, I said 55 but I should have said higher… they just said 55 is in the range, but after I was able to look on Glassdoor at the other company name, it looked like the salary for this role was reported at 65k.

I just got back from a week of vacation from my current role, and this company would likes to come in on Wednesday at 3 for the interview. I work strictly 8-5, the only way I could go is by calling out sick or going home early sick. I just came back today, Monday, from a week off.

When I talked to the hiring manager, she mentioned how this role is very faced paced, they current 2 coordinators are drowning currently, and they really need help. She said it is a lot of work. And she said the company they are combining with is changing their processes, probably for the better. 3/4 Glassdoor reviews gave “would not recommend”, only 1/4 said they would recommend.

I love interior design etc., but I’m scared that if I take this role, I will be in another situation where I hate my job because I am overworked and stressed out. The hiring manager said the office was very friendly and nice and there was no gossip or drama (opposite of my office) but I read online that the management isn’t good. 

Also, my boyfriend lives one hour away, I’m also concerned that if I take this role, and move in with him in a year, I’ll have to get another new job due to the commute, we would live where he is as he has a farm to take care of.

1bcipxf,Concerned about passing background check. What job title do I put on my resume? ,"Hi all. I'm in the process of applying for jobs and have concerns about my ability to pass a background check for my employment history based on issues with my current job title/role.

I was originally hired as a Communications Assistant, but a month in they ""promoted"" me to Communications Lead, with no formal changes to my contract (dumb, I know). A year later, I'm only ever referred to as a Communications Lead on emails, the company website etc. and have taken on all responsibilities of a ""lead"". My most recent contract renewal that I signed even said
""Communications Lead"", however this is mostly a confirmation to my manager, rather than what the company uses.

The issue is that the HR portal still shows me as a Communications Assistant to keep me within the lower pay grid, since my job title automatically would qualify me for a raise if they officially put it in the system.
I have no idea how this will affect any background checks and how I should go about explaining this on my resume, if at all.

Any advice is extremely appreciated. If relevant, lam located in Canada.

All bosses and head of the department will pick one person from the department that will apply for the promotion process.

Then you get interviewed by managers from other departments and then about 5 out of 12 people (all on the same level), who were picked for a promotion from the whole company, will get promoted.

I was picked from my department, but ended up not getting the promotion. Based on the feedback, I don't have enough experience (6 years + 5 years of education in the field, requirement was 7 years together with education) and that the interviewers had an impression that I'm not ready, but didn't really tell why.

What should I do? I also learnt that I'm having one of the smallest salaries in the team.

1bcega0,Company verbally offered me the job and told me to contact my boss to reach out to them. Now it has been over a week with no offer letter and my boss is wondering when I will leave.,"Hello, I’m currently in a very confusing situation and not sure where to go from here. 

I made a connection with a manager for a company I wanted to work for out in the field. From there, I went through a round of interviews and was verbally offered the position on 3/1. The place I currently work at is a vendor for said company so they told me to reach out to my boss for permission. I immediately did and my boss reached out to their HR team. 

Since it was Friday I assumed they would be off on the weekend and waited until Monday for my offer letter. I never received it. On Tuesday, I reached out to their HR department and was given the contact information for who they thought I interviewed with.

As it turns out, I had actually interviewed with another manager as he stated he wanted me to work for his area instead. The contact that HR gave me told me the other managers number and I reached out to him. I tried calling him but he did not answer, so I left a voicemail and text instead. Since then he had made no effort to reach out to me. The other manager has responded to my communication and told me he would let him know, but it has now been 10 days. 

Here is my main issue: they told me to reach out to my boss! Now my boss knows I plan on leaving the company and am actively interviewing for other positions. This puts me in an incredibly frustrating situation as my boss is waiting for my 2 weeks but I don’t know when or if the other company will reach out. 

Also, the manager who was initially supposed to interview me has kept in contact. Does that mean I still have a chance at this company? I am so confused and would appreciate any advice. Apologies if my wording is confusing.",wavvvvvess,35,1.0,14,1710191352,2024-03-11 21:09:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bcega0/company_verbally_offered_me_the_job_and_told_me/,3,2024

1bcdwhh,Should I discuss a salary increase? (Tech Industry),"TL:DR; I learned a junior colleague makes the same amount after being promoted to same level as myself, should I bring it up or not? 

Just a little over a year ago my company had a reduction in force and layed off just over 8% of the workforce as well as having smaller layoffs throughout the year.  This year has seen a couple of teams getting let go but not like last year. 

Our company met or exceeded goals and I also met or exceeded my personal goals.  Company financials are good, earnings calls went well and company stock is slowly rising.  

I had my annual review earlier in the month and like most in the company I got a strong/strong (9 Box).  We all knew raises were going to be small this year (2%) but they normally give larger equity grants.  

This year a colleague of mine got promoted to the same level as myself.  I have been at the same level just over 6 years.  Having always been told I am on the higher end of the pay band I never thought much of pay disparity.  We are good friends and I asked, “out of curiosity what are they starting junior Level 3’s out at these days”?  He gave me the dollar amount which was almost a dollar for dollar equivalent as mine.  I was a little shocked and then asked what the equity grant was and learned it was the same as mine. 

I have been with the company over 16 years with 10 years in the department I am in and 6 at my current level.  I have never had any disciplinary issues, I usually bounce between strong/strong and middle/right (9 Box).  While my colleague and I are in the same org and now have the same title, our responsibilities are completely different.  I make decisions for the company that impact teams globally, I handle sensitive projects and trusted with C-Suite staff.  

I brought my concerns up with a former manager and they said I should at least bring up my concerns with my current manager.  They did say it is a weird time to bring it up as the company as a whole is tightening the belt everywhere, making teams run extremely lean etc.  

So if you have gone on the journey with me so far, should I bring up the salary disparity?   Would it be wise to make noise when I have been dodging layoffs left and right?  I feel like the wind has been knocked out of my sails, again.  I love what I do but feel wronged.

1bcdgfk,Are all entry level business roles the same?,"I recently switched from finance to marketing thinking it will be more creative (less boring), and it is to some extent; However, I can't help thinking right now, what I did in my finance job and what I'm doing in my marketing job are basically the same TASKS. Excel, emailing, meeting, etc.  
  
My question is- Does it get less boring in a couple years? Or are all entry business roles boring? Am i right in thinking all entry roles are kind of the same and in 2-3 years as you develop more expertise and professional specific insights, things get better/ more subject and judgement based when it comes to daily work? Or is it always just excel, emailing, meeting, etc.?  
  
I can see that my manager is always in meetings, making decisions so I can see how it can get better.

I'm looking for some advice and hopefully reddit can provide some insight I might now get anywhere else. I'm a 29 M currently working as an automotive quality engineer for a tier 1 supplier. But the catch is l'm not a real engineer, I got into the industry out of necessity for a job during Covid and haven't been able to get back into my preferred profession of business (specifically marketing and communications) no matter how hard I try.

I graduated with my bachelors in 2019 and got a post grad internship with a well known automotive company in the marketing department. Shortly after I was hired Covid shut the world down, although I continued to work from home after 6 months with the company my program ended and I was let go.
After this I have taken 3 quality engineering jobs for various reasons such as pay raises and location for my wife's job. Now I'm in my 3rd year of being an engineer and this current position is way more than I can handle.

I’ve managed to get a very specific skill set and develop an expertise in an area that very few people work in. 

I get good feedback, and have learned a ton. I have become sort of an expert in my niche, and my boss just told me he’s promoting me one level to be a low level project manager.

That felt great, but when I see who my boss wants to backfill me with, the applicants are WAY more qualified than I am. I guess that’s a good thing, but most of these folks would be 2-3 years more experienced at the company, and most have masters degrees from elite programs. I only have a liberal arts bachelors from an okay school. 

I get it yeah I’ve been in role for 2 years and know the subject matter cold, while they do not, but I feel like I am not equipped to take on a management role in projects they are working on.

1bccssr,Should I take the promotion whilst knowing I'm going to leave the company? (M28),"Male, 28, UK. My girlfriend has been offered a prestigious job at an international school abroad and, up until last week, my conclusion was that I would go with her no questions asked. I work in a very niche area of interior design/home automation sales with around three-five 'big' players and have been at my current employer for less than two years. I currently manage our clients in London and work with the 'retailers', however, this is a little misleading as 'retail' in London incorporates some of the smaller Architect firms, Interior Design studios and AV companies that work in the area. I'm not fussed about the job, but it pays relatively well (£40k base, around £12k in bonuses), and so leaving to go and live in Thailand for a couple of years sounded like it would be a good opportunity to refocus on what career I'd like to do longer term - a.k.a. not this. My girlfriend will be earning enough money for me not to have to work for a few months and, after this, the idea would be to either go down the TEFL route, or try and make some connections with ex-pats who can secure a hard-working graduate on the cheap. I also have around £25k in savings, so in a low-cost country, I'd be able to bankroll myself for a few months anyway. Employment laws in this country are extremely tough and so getting employment is not going to be easy in the slightest.

As of last Thursday, the current company I am at offered me the most important territory at the company, working on the 'contract' jobs in the London area. This would come with a slight pay increase, not confirmed, but expect it to be around £45k base and £15k bonus and a four month handover period where I get to grips with the new clients and onboard the new hire for my area. That will take me to June and I'm planning to leave with my girlfriend at the end of July.

My notice period is a month (stupid for the company to allow this, I know) and given that I have worked for the company for under 24 months, I have relatively little employment protection if they decide to get rid of me. I was initially planning on giving them three months notice to leave the company on good terms whilst also ensuring that they wouldn't have time to hire someone else in the three months that I've given them notice for (assuming 1 month of listing the role, 1 month of interviewing, and 1 month notice for whoever they hire) but, clearly, I won't give them three months notice if I take this new role as I think they'll be upset and give me my one month contractual notice.

Question is, do I even bother taking this promotion when, firstly, I'll only have the pay increase for the final month of my employment and, secondly, on my CV it'll only show as one month on the new area which will may raise concerns from any future employees? The company know I'm ambitious and I sort of expect that declining an obvious promotion to set off some alarm bells anyway...

Spoken to my parents and a few other older people who have had careers in the City and they are all saying to take the promotion and give the company one months notice. I just don't want to burn any bridges with a company in such a niche area of the market.",throwaway10182024,1,1.0,3,1710187519,2024-03-11 20:05:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bccssr/should_i_take_the_promotion_whilst_knowing_im/,3,2024

I have spent the last 4 years working at a high end BMW repair shop & I no longer like working here. This is mainly due to a lack of growth opportunity and that I am starting to realize that I don’t enjoy automotive service as much as I thought I would.

My long term goals in life are just to live comfortably, not lavishly. 

The options I am looking at now are as follows:

Apply to one of my local plumbing unions and take on their 5 year apprentice program/start working with my brother-in-law and join the union he is part of

Go back to college and receive further education to become a teacher. (Deep down I would love to be a teacher, however I feel like it’s too much schooling for the salary that I would receive and I’m not even sure if teachers make livable wages these days)

I am sure there are more options for me besides what I have listed here, but working in a trade or becoming a teacher seems to be what I’m leaning on now. 

Plumbing obviously seems enticing for the income but I know my body will be hurting down the line. 

Teaching sounds more fulfilling personally and easier on my body. However I worry that I will not be able to support myself and my future family financially.

When I first came in, I picked up quickly on my role. 3 months in, I noticed that the director was pouring a lot of time and resources into a coworker who started at around the same time as me,( Lets call them ABBY).

Senior leadership pulled me aside and told me that I'd need to provide lots of support and that they're going to be pouring lots of resources to make sure that Abby is successful in the role as director. 

I am not upset that Abby is now the director, however I am concern about my career. I am looking to work along side someone more seasoned with lots of experience who can also provide professional guidance. Abby and I have have the same experience with similar background.

While I’m grateful for the opportunity, I’ve found my role incredibly boring. So boring, in fact, that I recently decided to quit to go on a trip, seizing an opportunity that came up.  
My boss, who really values me, offered me the chance to come back after my trip with a significant pay raise; we’re talking about a 60% or 70% increase from what I currently earn. This raise is substantial, more than what I could expect to earn in several years following a typical career path.

  
However, this job doesn’t fulfill me in any way. Beyond being monotonous, the firm lacks organization and I don’t see a promising future due to unpredictable and immature leadership. I don’t feel like I’m learning or gaining valuable experience in any consulting areas that interest me.  
On the flip side, they treat me really well and the job isn’t hard. But, with no additional benefits like health insurance or bonuses, the reasons to stay seem to boil down to good pay and a nice work environment.

1bc9jrl,"Brewer: Injury and Bad Timing, What is Next?","Hey folks. Life is forcing me into a new phase and I'm pretty lost. Also caught in a catch 22 with healthcare and a new, degenerative condition.

For the last 6 years, I (36M) have been building my second career as a brewer/distiller - booze-smith, I like to say. Been training up as a brewer for about the last 6 months, after 2.5 years distilling, bartender prior. Whole ""tech"" career before that filling smartphones full of ads (I am very sorry, world). This was my radical attempt to break free and try to pay the rent with something I actually love. I hit the eject button and turned my van into a tent with an engine to do it.

Anyway, I just lost my job at the only local brewpub on Friday. For all my neurotic need to DO IT RIGHT and to build my skills as quickly as possible, they tell me it is not in any way my fault. Cost-cutting, happening across the entire company. Last in, first out, sometimes the world just sucks like that.

Worse though, I had been working through a limp for about the last 6 weeks and, **one week prior to being laid off**, I learned that I have developed Avascular Necrosis in both of the heads of my femurs; worse on the right. Basically, blood flow has been compromised and the parts of my leg bones that hitch onto my pelvis are dying. Ironically, this can be cause by extreme alcohol abuse, which I've been nowhere near at any point in this career. I do have a proper level of respect for the sauce I make, I just got unlucky. In any case, deterioration is usually in the order of months to maybe a couple of years until I need a hip replacement. Of course, the kind of constant physicality this career involves is not broadly compatible with treating this condition. And, the medical system naturally moves slowly and I will start out with PT and we'll have to see how that goes - can't just skip to the inevitable hip replacement and get me recovering all the sooner.

Or at least I would start on the PT route, but it looks like my health insurance will expire at the end of this month. So I need to find a job in the coming few weeks, so that I can maintain some kind of health insurance, so that I can pay to treat the condition, that will otherwise prevent me from doing my job, which I just lost anyway. And that's all aside from the eternal question of paying my rent in the meantime.

What the hell do I do? It seems obvious that I need a desk job again, and I've got to find one with a haste I've never known before. In Utah, where support services are SO plentiful and the vast majority of people just LOVE the work I've been doing up until this point (/s).

I’ve had a shitty first year (so much so that my program allowed me to relocate schools mid-year, something that’s extremely rare). I’m in a new school now (mostly as a substitute teacher). The kids are great, but I’m bored out of my mind and dread coming here to watch them for 8 hours every day. I’m not teaching content until next year. 

I realized that I like teaching, but I don’t want it to be the center of my career. I want to go back to biological research, a field that I’ve been involved in. I just saw a non-degree program whose application is still opened; I’m considering applying.

I feel like a douchebag for not teaching next year and not completing my teaching program. I haven’t signed anything for next year yet,  and I will finish this year. But it’s implied that I would stay for next year; the school already is applying for my emergency certification. 

I just feel drained as hell, and maybe I’m still adjusting. Should I just stick it out another year?

1bc6w03,should I quit my job after 3 weeks?,"for context, I am a woman in my 20s with considerable restaurant experience in all types, but am specialized in resort work. 

I recently moved across the country to be back in my hometown, and got hired at a local resort to help them open a new outlet as a supervisor. no one else that works here has expertise in the type of outlet we are opening. 

I was hired under the pretense that since I have a lot of experience in this specific type of outlet, my input and ideas were not only welcomed but needed. the outlet is still under construction and the open date has been pushed back 4 times since i’ve started, and still won’t open for another few weeks. I generally like the staff here, but all other management is men in their 40s-50s, and one 18 year old boy. in every meeting so far, my deeply necessary concerns about how things will run smoothly, have been ignored. the space is too small for the amount of product they want to put out, they are lazy with hiring, and expect the impossible. if my ideas aren’t ignored, someone else takes the credit. I am a hard worker, and I love a challenge, but I also know when things simply aren’t possible. 

my main concern however, is that since construction keeps getting pushed back, I am only getting 20 hours a week instead of the promised 45+. I have been offered a job with a slightly lower hourly rate, but with consistent mon-f, 9-5 hours. I am considering taking it 

I feel like it will make me out to be the asshole if I leave now, but none of this is what they made it out to be and I simply need more money. they have not provided more hours when I asked for them. would it be wrong to abandon ship now? they planned on me being the only supervisor and I was initially hired 2 months ago, so I feel as though I am leaving them in the lurch. 

I truly want this other job, and to get out of restaurants in general, but I also want to do the right thing.

Before this, I got my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering, and I've always loved working on projects and bringing ideas to life.  Originally, I wanted to study IT, but things didn't work out that way.  
Recently, I got diagnosed with ADHD, and it suddenly explained a lot of the challenges I've faced throughout the years.  No wonder I felt like I never quite fit in corporate jobs, like the one I had at a bank for a while.  
That's why I'm excited to finally be diving into the world of programming!  I want to create software that can help people with ADHD, something I would have really benefited from myself.  
Here's the thing: I'm feeling a lot of pressure about the next step. I want to get new citizenship, at least permanent residency. Should I try to move to a new country for a more formal IT education, or should I jump right into working as a developer?  The US has great programs, but the cost is a huge barrier.  And in Europe, there's the language barrier to consider.  
On a lighter note:  
My girlfriend  and I are both in this together. We both want to become web developers and live a life of remote work, travel, and freedom!  
I'm also interested in a bunch of other things: male fashion, investing, minimalism, photography, fitness, traveling, and more.  
I'm a big believer in documenting your journey, which is why I'm thinking about starting a daily blog to track my progress.   
What I'm really looking for:  
Guidance on the best path to becoming a web developer or anything else with ADHD.  
Maybe someone out there has experience with going back to school or working abroad with ADHD?

1bc2cmk,Advice needed: Feeling trapped – How should I continue?,"tl;dr I quit my job to do freelancing to stay in Spain. The market is bad and I don't know how to continue my career. Looking for any advice to get a broader perspective.

I'm a 30M German, have a Master's degree in CS from a German university and have been working for the past 4 years as a Software Engineer with an enterprise company in the automotive sector for around 60k which afforded me a good lifestyle in East Germany.

Since COVID the company was 100% remote so I decided last year to go to Valencia, Spain for three months initially because I felt the need for a change and wanted to step out of my comfort zone again. Then I enjoyed it so much that I decided to move here for good in September last year. The weather is obviously great, I've a good group of friends here, I enjoy learning a new language, I'm dating a girl that I really enjoy spending time with and so on. It has always been a big wish of mine to live abroad and I'm finally doing it. So far so good.

Another big goal of mine is to have my own (small) business at some point and I always try to build something on the side in the hopes that one of these experiments gets some traction and provides value to people. Because of that and also because I didn't feel that I was growing anymore in my current company, I decided to quit it to go into freelancing.

Unfortunately, as you probably know, the market is really bad atm and I barely get any response from any potential clients I reach out to but I already got two amazing offers from big companies in the German market with compensation packages that I never thought would have been attainable to me. However, both wanted me to come back to their office in Germany which was the reason I declined them. 

This is my first month without a job and I'm currently sitting on a runway of about 6 months, so my main goal at the moment is to figure out my next career move. I'm using my time to reach out to potential freelancing clients every day and keep myself interview-ready by revisiting DS&A and system design topics. I also continue building my current side project. 

Experiencing this market, however, I feel more and more that it might not work out since most clients want somebody with more years of experience and I might be forced to also send out some applications for full-time positions. Looking into the Spanish market makes me afraid that I won't be getting some decent money (minimum 40k) and a position that I'd like to work in.

Now I'm reconsidering all my options. I'm thinking about sending applications everywhere in Europe just to check what opportunities I'm having and then take a decision, even though I'd like to stay in Valencia. I value a healthy and balanced lifestyle but I can definitely work hard and would also love to contribute to something meaningful. There are also definitely companies that I'd like to work for, e.g. Stripe, Spotify, Apple, to name a few...

What would you do if you were in my situation? Would you continue trying to score a freelancing gig? If you were to send out applications, would you focus on the Spanish market first and only look abroad if nothing is appealing? I'm aware that finally only I can decide at the end but I'd be very happy to get some input from you to get a broader perspective.",nomoresleeep,1,1.0,0,1710161225,2024-03-11 12:47:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bc2cmk/advice_needed_feeling_trapped_how_should_i/,3,2024

1bc22z5,Transitioning from Marketing to...?,"So I have been working in Marketing for 3/4 years now and I'm starting to become a bit fed up with the area itself.   


For one, the ""everyone can do marketing"" is saturating the market as its probably one of the fields that has most opened to the world during this last decade, with a vast range of online gurus, courses, Master's, Post-Grads, etc. It's hard to find an institution that doesn't offer any marketing related course. On general level, most people working within a mid to high level position should be able to provide insights for a effective Marketing strategy (given their considerable experience on the specific industry/product). What they do need is workers to do operational stuff on Canva, copywriting, SEO, ppc ads, blog articles, short videos, etc. I did enjoy doing my Master's in Marketing Management but I don't feel like its been an essential step to differentiate myself.  


The level of expertise required to do the tasks mentioned above is the other point that makes me want to drift away from this field. I have feeling that when I'm a social context, whenever I say what my job is, I get a subtle condescending response from people. \* Oh! You're the Social Media guy :) \* Especially when compared to my gf (she's a medical surgeon lol). Although I do understand we live in a digital era and those who can market their offerings with excellence in the digital space are the ones that will thrive further, I just feel unexcited about it. There's literally 17yo kids on TikTok advertising products in a much more effective way than a room full of senior marketing/advertising execs.   


As I'm approaching 28 this year, I would like to have some clarity and discover a new path to follow. Something that would be more specialised and useful, while still being on the Business space. I have been researching Course, PostGrads and Master's but none as yet hit the bullseye. Data its been a hot path to pursue for some years now and I have a few friends there who are making good $, but its seems a bit monotonous and keen to be dominated by AI in no time. I have also been looking at Product Management but I do lack the tech background that is often required to be a good at it.   


I'm at a point where I'm willing to change my sails to a completely foreign land but I have no compass on my hand. So any suggestions on some interesting tracks I could purse will be much appreciated.

1bc1yv8,Wasted 5 years as a dog trainer - can't get any new jobs. Can't afford college,"I am feeling defeated. I have tried to stay positive throughout the duration of my job search but I really can't any more! I have worked as a dog trainer in a retail setting for 5 years as well as worked in the retail store when I needed more hours. I have been such a good employee, with 100% positive reviews of my training service, and highly valued in the retail team.

I am looking to leave because of a restructure in the company, as well as new management being hostile and abusive. I would like to focus more on my skills with animal handling and training. 

I have applied for every dog training job and vet assistant job in my preferred commute (1.15hrs) and have gotten interviews but never go further than that. I have a speech disability and have definitely been discriminated against in a couple of interviews. Others, seemed like they went PERFECT, but I would never hear back.

College isn't an option. I only make 17/hr and the cost of living where I'm at is unbearable.

What jobs should I start applying for in other fields that won't give me a pay cut? I genuinely do not care what it is, other than I'd like to avoid phone based customer service due to my speech disability. I can't work in retail forever and I am depressed due to the way I am treated at work. Any job that can pay 17/hr without college, I am interested in trying.

1bbxhty,23F- Need some realistic advice about future moves,"Hello everyone! 

This is my first time posting on reddit so please bare with me. I am searching for some advice about my future. I'm the oldest daughter in my family, the oldest granddaughter, and the only one who has  graduated college so I don't have a lot of people in my life I can turn to for career talk. I graduated college in 2022 Suma Cum Laude with a Bachelor's degree with a specific degree in the medical field (think Occupational Therapist/Speech Language Pathologist).  I am now living abroad on a competitive grant (Fulbright) teaching English for the past year and a half. My question is this: I no longer want to attend graduate school for OT/SLP. In fact, I want to switch career paths entirely, and I believe I would like to enter into the business world. But, I don't know if I'm even qualified enough to get a job. Would it be my best bet to attend graduate school in Business before I even apply? I'm feeling really lost, and despite my research I don't even understand what kinds of jobs are out there, or what my options are. I really enjoy reading, coordinating events which has pointed me in the direction of marketing but I still just don't know what is out there.  Are my skills from my undergraduate activities and grant enough for me to enter into the job market, or should I attend graduate school first? 

&#x200B;

Any and all advice about your career path, honest ideas about my chances getting a real job, and words of encouragement is appreciated. My parents have raised me to work hard for what I have, and I want to make them proud and show my family that there is success to be found through education and a world that seems less than accessible.

1bbw5b9,Young and at a crossroads ,"Also posted in r/neuro.

Hey everyone! I’m looking for some advice before I get even deeper in wasted time and debt. I really don’t know what to do with my future regarding both my actual professional career and possible future schooling. I have the privilege of still living with my parents and having this time to figure things out. 

Here’s a little bit about me:
- I recently graduated with a B.S. in neuroscience and cogsci. I prefer the cognitive side of things, but don’t completely exclude the other.
- I’d like a Masters and have looked at programs in the UK (I’m American) because they seem to be better quality + my partner lives there. Not sure if this is worth it other than for experience and certification in something more specific. I also don’t want to drown in loans for no reason (the process of taking out loans also seems more complicated for international study). 
- My strengths lie in writing, analysis, research-related skills, and so on. Some things that have piqued my interest are science writing, intraoperative neuromonitoring, and in general, developmental neuroscience. 
- I worked as a lab RA for a non - wet lab for a while and I liked it, but the pay I’ve heard the higher ups get is unfortunately not anywhere near what I’m looking for. I also do not want to work in academia, especially as I have family that does and I know what the culture tends to be like. (I flat out don’t want to deal with the university staff and students either, lol) I’ll likely work at a lab again soon just for experience. 


I would seriously appreciate any ideas regarding careers I might like and paths I could take academics-wise. More direct paths sound good at this point (i.e., get this certification and know you’re doing it to get this job right after finishing) because of job security, obviously. I don’t want to attend med school, but I did used to want to pursue clinical psychology as it really interested me, if that’s relevant. I want to have a family eventually and have a stable career, but there’s an overwhelming amount of paths I could go right now and it’s hard to narrow it down and choose.

1bbvvba,25 YOF Diagnostic Medical Sonographer Considering transferring jobs due to scheduling issues and callback. ,"I am a new Sonographer and have been out of school and working for this company for appx. 9 months. I started PRN and was wanting to move to a part time position as that would work best for my lifestyle and provide an adequate enough income.  ( My husband is in his medical residency and works 80+ hrs a week, we have 3 dogs, we recently moved to a new state where we don’t have any support system, and are trying to conceive our first child due to medical reasons. ) 

The director of the radiology department was fired and a new one was hired. He made everyone in the department come up with a schedule that covered 24/7  with 4 FT positions and that he would consider adding one part time position. I made it very clear I was interested in doing the part time position if it were to open up. 

Since at this time I was the new hire I didn’t have too much say in the decision which I didn’t mind. The team decided to make the 4FT positions 3 days (12.5 hr) a week and rotating call shift for the weekend of 36hrs. Again since I was new to the department and a recent graduate the last slot open for my department was w/ th/ fr night shift 5:45pm-  6:15 am. I asked several times if there was going to be a part time spot so I could work days. I was told no. Therefore I took the position. 

Fast forward to actually being in the position. I really don’t mind working the night shift too much, I don’t like it but I can do it. It’s really working night shift and then a 36hr call shift that slays me. No one wants to work the weekend so our call shift is Saturday 6am to Sunday 6pm, a total of 36hrs. We each do this once a month. 

 I’m the only one in the department that seems to have an issue with this. Mostly because I work Friday 5:45 pm until Saturday 6:15am and immediately start call. This has been an issue because each time I’ve done this I  get called in typically 30min after getting off and it’s not just one patient it’s usually 3-8 patients (Saturdays are busy) so usually at this point I’ve been up 20hrs … then I usually get an hour or two of napping before doing a few more patients. My one weekend of call I worked 30hrs and got next to no sleep heck I didn’t even get to eat. ( also my drive to work is 45minutes every time I get called in) I broke down crying hysterically in the bathroom because I kept messing up a carotid. I felt it was unsafe and had to embarrassingly call all my co workers to see if someone could help me. Thankfully my coworker came in her way back from church. 

I made it clear in a meeting with another new director I didn’t feel safe doing this and she agreed. (Without my knowledge they were hiring a part time person which made me upset because that’s the position I wanted. I felt manipulated into taking the least desirable shift because they knew they would be hard pressed to fill the position. ) I found out at this meeting and it was decided night shift would split the shift and each do 18hrs of call. Which was significantly better for me. We did this for a month and it was fine. 

Present day : the other night shift employee won’t split shift anymore because we lost our part time person and it requires her to do 2 sat a month and me 2 Sundays a month. She would like to do schedule change every week to accommodate call but I will not because I can’t have my sleep schedule jump all over the place. 

Future: I am on call and working Easter call (which someone changed me to without my knowledge - I was suppose to be working Christmas and Juneteenth) 

Anyways Easter is the same weekend as my call and instead of 36hrs of call I will be doing 48. hrs of straight call w/o sleep because I work Friday to Saturday . I am afraid this will feel like   60hrs of straight work because holidays are usually the worst in the ED due to dr offices being closed. 

I have terrible anxiety and don’t know what to do or if it’s even legal. It surely doesn’t feel safe. 

Any advice will be helpful . Also this is such a long post I’m sorry I’m an anxious person 😫


I’m not too sure what to do. If I stick out

1bbvp6d,"Miserable in my job, niche field - what do I do next?","I have 20 years experience in my field and have always received excellent reviews/feedback and have great personal relationships. I’ve moved from agency side to client side and back again and found an odd niche job. About 4 years ago, I evolved a role in a very small company (<15 employees) with previous colleagues to fit me super well - more operations in a unique area, than being in that specific agency field. I loved the job and the ppl and I really thought I’d retire there…. And then the owner (my first real boss and someone I’d consider a mentor & friend) sold the company to a larger firm (while crappy for me, totally respect the choice). Since my role was specialized, they tried to slot me in to the new company but it didn’t quite work. I tried for 1.5 years but essentially was bored and unfulfilled (despite positive performance reviews). A previous coworker from first company had gone to work for a gov agency and on a casual catchup mentioned there was a posting. I jumped at it, even though I knew it wasn’t quite right and was going back to a position I didn’t really want and it was also slightly more junior than I felt I should be. Now nearly a year in, I’m even more unhappy than before. The politics are ridiculous, an insane amount of requests/work and back to back meetings, and I don’t enjoy the actual job to the point of having regular anxiety. I get along well with my manager but she causes additional stress given her ADHD and micromanaging. She’s suggested I’ll get promoted but at this point I don’t want to deal with the bureaucracy. I’ve started applying to jobs but know the market is tough and I’m in a niche field so it’s hard to know how long it will take to find a new job that I actually want, ideally in a small company as gov is not for me! 

I finally cracked last week (massive panic attack at work / couldn’t function) and shared how I’m feeling with my manager. She was surprised but supportive. But realistically what can she do, the job is what the job is. She told me to take the day and we’d chat this week… I don’t know what to do next….
Financially I could quit and be fine for a few months (not ideal but can make it work), but also know that it’s never good to quit without somewhere to go. I don’t think I can physically do it anymore. I owe nothing to this gov org but I don’t want to burn bridges.  

Do I talk to my manager honestly and try to alter the job (unlikely), do I quit (and potentially struggle with income), do I grin and bear it until I get an offer? Other options? Maybe I could find some contract work with previous connections?

1bbve4w,Life Trajectory Changing at 24 (intl bus/trade),"Hi all, I (24F) am trying to figure out some things and could use some thoughts.

I went to school in Washington, DC for a BS in Business Administration, with my main interest area in international business. I ended up interning in the trade sections of both domestic and foreign governments and loved it.

I then decided to move to France for a two-year Master’s program, but I’m 90% sure I want to leave it after this year. There are many reasons why I’m unhappy here, and I don’t think that forcing myself through another year is worth the financial and personal cost. I went to grad school because the people around me were doing it and because I’d always wanted to study in France (then covid hit), not because it’s necessary for a job I would want to do. Still, if it really looks that bad to stop halfway through, I’m open to finishing it. 

I want to return to DC to look for work, but I’m not sure what type of positions to pursue. I feel like I don’t have any clear directions or “specialized skills” (eg. legal, finance). I still like international business, but I want to move away from trade policy, but towards what? Something less niche? I’ll send out a bunch of applications and see what sticks, but I want to have some sort of goal/path in mind.

For awhile I was pretty set on a career with the US government. Then life circumstances happened, and now I want to move to Canada next summer (after a year of full-time work experience) on a Working Holiday visa. My partner is there and after a year he could sponsor me for PR. So I’m not looking for employment-based sponsorship, but I would still like to be able to get a professional job in Canada and my previous experiences don’t really apply. It is much harder for him to move to the US unfortunately.

Any ideas? Related fields/positions I may have not thought of? Getting into the private sector or maybe even nonprofit? Specific skills training I should look into?

1bbv1j1,My Disappointment in My Career Journey,"29M

Feeling deeply disappointed in myself and my career path is a sentiment that weighs heavy on my heart. When I reflect on my aspirations, I had dreams of pursuing medicine or dentistry. However, the fear of the competitive nature of these fields held me back, I went for civil engineering without much thought of whether I’d like it or not but just coz some of the people my family knew were doing it. 

The journey into civil engineering was not smooth sailing. I found myself wavering, stepping away from it midway, only to return, believing that I had already invested too much time to turn back. This resulted in a prolonged educational journey, spanning 7 years for what should have been a 4 year course.

As I approach the final year of my bachelor’s degree, I cannot shake the feeling of disillusionment. Civil engineering does not resonates with my passion. The prospect of low pay and the overwhelming stress associated with the profession loom over me, casting doubt on my future in the field.

What exacerbates my disappointment is the realization that my chosen path lacks the entrepreneurial opportunities I had envisioned. In fields like medicine/dentistry or even software engineering, I could have pursued entrepreneurship, leveraging my expertise to build something meaningful. However, in civil engineering, the prospect of starting my own company feels out of reach, given my lack of passion and motivation.

Now, I find myself at a crossroads, grappling with uncertainty and a sense of lost potential. I yearn for a career that ignites my passion, provides opportunities for growth, and aligns with my entrepreneurial aspirations. Yet, the path forward remains elusive. 💔",RationalRover_11,1,1.0,0,1710132311,2024-03-11 04:45:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbv1j1/my_disappointment_in_my_career_journey/,3,2024

1bbtoja,I am failing my engineering internship.,"Hello All, 

 I am writing this because honestly, I have no idea what to do. I am 2 months into working at an R&D facility in a Fortune 500 company. This job is VERY detail-oriented and focused on manufacturing. The issue comes in with the fact that I am struggling with all of the details and catching mistakes. Many of these mistakes are like switching around/ writing down numbers, not realizing when something looks wrong, etc... A lot of the data I am producing is being seen by global and regional leaders so when I am making these ""little errors""  they are being scrutinized by leaders in the company.

 There are other interns and they seem to be catching on much quicker than me so that shows me that this is a personal, not an executive issue. I have no complaints about the management they have been so patient with me and are very easygoing. They genuinely seem to want to help me out. This being said I have been put on a PIP since I am not where I need to be. I am working hard to improve but every time I leave work and think I double-checked everything, I am wrong. 

 I do have ADHD and have always struggled with this to the point where I see it everywhere in my day-to-day life.  I have tried to make task lists and write down all my mistakes no matter if I catch them on my own. I am improving however very very slowly since I need to re-train my brain for this attentiveness. This is causing a lot of extra work for my managers trying to explain my mistakes to higher-ups and trying to help me improve.

 I genuinely have the best intentions and feel that I am working hard, but it's gotten to the point where it is playing to my weaknesses and not my strengths. I have realized this is not the field for me, despite this I want to be the best intern possible until the end of my contract. I don't know how to react to this and I feel like a failure. I have gotten in my head about it so much that I am nervous to go to work. Additionally, being such an anxious person I feel like this is the world telling me that I will never succeed. I know I am working myself up way too much about this but I can't help it. Has anyone been on either side of this situation before? Or have any advice for engineers with ADHD? What can I do for the rest of this internship to improve and show my managers how much I care?",Educational_Tart_525,1,1.0,2,1710127956,2024-03-11 03:32:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbtoja/i_am_failing_my_engineering_internship/,3,2024
1bbto7r,Should a quit my contractor freelance role?,"Hi folks. 
32m Canadian here.
I currently work as a contractor ( full time freelancing artist) since about 10 months for a video game studio in the USA.

Recently, I have seen some quiet firing happening at the company, i work at a studio of around 200 people, mainly full time freelancers from around the world.

The pay is good, full time remote, team is okayish nice, but the job is highly stressful.

Like I said, some quiet firing has been happening, and employees who had previously  some good performances are being laid off in discretion ( i discovered it on LinkedIn ). They are also currently rolling out our peer reviews and overall performance reviews.

I have been offered a full time gig in a company in my city, good role, good IP, and I get to build a team, the company is pretty famous, but had some problems of sexism and racism in one of their European studio in the past.  The pay is a bit smaller ( about 15 to 20 k less), but it is a full time position with insurance, parental leave, etc.

I’m hesitating to leave my current contractor position for that job, it has been only 10 months and they gave me a great opportunity to build up a team from the ground up, but this silent firing is honestly making me scared, I have a young 1 year old to take care of, and bills to pay.


Any advice here. I’m under heavy stress on what to do.",Perfect-Future150,1,1.0,2,1710127927,2024-03-11 03:32:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbto7r/should_a_quit_my_contractor_freelance_role/,3,2024
1bbsa68,How should I approach finishing interviews for other positions while i just recieved a job offer?,"Hello all!

I recieved a job offer finally on wednesday last week. However as of thursday I got a call from a old company of mine asking me if I would like a position again. I let them know I had a job offer in hand and they said they can try to fast track with a goal date of the 20th to provide me an offer letter. It also sounds like a 10-20% increase minimum salary over the offer letter I already recieved barring that I do not actually get the job. They fast tracked me so quickly upon hearing this that I have recieved requests this weekend for interviews on monday and tuesday.

That being said, what should be the best way to handle the first job offer? It seems there are two options from all the people I have asked.

1) accept the job offer in hand since its in writing, with a apr 1st start date. but if the new one comes in and is actually better... write back to original company saying things have changed, thank them for the opportunity and continue with the newer offer

2) ask the original offer for more time to evaluate if this is the direction i want to go and say I will provide an answer by the 20th with a tentative start date of Apr 1st (meaning I will have answered 10 days from the reciept of the job offer) Not sure if I want to tell them that I want to let the other interviews finish before I make a decision, I worry that the original job offer that was given will think I am placing them as my backup and thus rescind the offer.

Looking for any advice on how I should play this and move forward with finishing interviews for the old company I worked for, versus a new company that already has given me an offer.

Thank you all in advance!",flipaflip,2,1.0,3,1710123926,2024-03-11 02:25:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbsa68/how_should_i_approach_finishing_interviews_for/,3,2024
1bbs54p,"More money, better job, but long commute","Hi everyone,   
  
I’m thinking through a job offer and would love to get advice from this forum. For context, I’m in my 30s and have a spouse and toddler.   
  
Current job:  
•	Mostly remote, occasional days in office  
•	Some domestic and international travel, usually a week at a time (to me, this is a plus, although it’s harder with a kid)  
•	Pays reasonably well, but not incredibly well  
•	Easy enough but a little boring, and I mostly support others rather than having a lot of responsibilities myself  
•	Reputable company in the field, but not a long-term fit for me career wise. Could probably transition my skills and experiences to a new company and field without a lot of trouble  
  
Job I’ve been offered:  
•	Would require about a 1-hour commute each way, assuming normal traffic  
•	Significant (>20-25 percent) pay increase, but increased commuting costs would likely offset that in part  
•	On paper, more responsibility than my current job (this is a plus to me)  
•	Unknown if I will travel  
•	Reputable organization, one I’ve considered working for for a long time, and in a field I’m interested in. I could see myself sticking around if the work is good and the commute doesn’t become too much  
•	Would likely develop some skills and have experiences that translate to other sectors/companies well    
  
I’ve talked this over with my wife, and she is OK with my accepting the new job, provided that I think hard about how inserting a long commute will complicate our lives (such as daycare pickup, losing a lot of flexibility in my days, etc.).  
  
Any thoughts on whether I’m thinking about this correctly or any other considerations I should take into account?

1bbrx6u,"So, I went to middle management for a promotion/raise","In October 2023, I talked to my manager(John) about a potential raise/promotion, and as I have tried to push it along things have ended up very stressful, but I feel I need to stand up for myself; however, I also don't know if how I feel is the right thing to do.   
Warning, this is a long one. TL;DR at end. If you want the lean meat of it, skip the backstory. Its there to help better understand, and more for me to document how I ultimately felt, as I never honestly had an outlet to turn to.

**Backstory**

A not so quick backstory, I work for a private company with a few thousand workers, but makes billions in profit. The company is family owned, and for all intensive purposes is what some would refer as to a place for ""good ol' boys"". To keep a long background short, I work in a department as a Software Developer, and I'd love to advance in my position to the next title at this company. I do not hate this company, wish any ill will, and have a fantastic working relationship with my immediate coworkers.

Again, I enjoy my coworker, and I care about the company and it's values; however, my situation has begun taking a dive to where I'm beginning to lose confidence. Last January, John told me that I've been exceling and producing great work, I have exceeded in my goals, and I have really become a mentor to my other team members, and if I continued to meet these goals I would have a strong case for a promotion. 

In March yearly reviews came and I got great marks that I met goals and someitmes exceeded expectations, I asked of the defined goals, and was told I'm by all means already doing everything a Senior Software Developer in this role should be doing, and said he would talk his manager about looking at moving me into that position, and that getting a perfect review is something they don't do, but he was going to advocate for me to get a promotion. John has been in my back corner.

Months passed, and our one on ones did not yield much. He spoke to Bob (Middle manager) about it before, but it is a long process, and the companies HR is particularly slow. I accepted this for the time being, but as time passed, and October came and my job responsibilities and challenges became harder to deal with I ultimately asked for another follow up in October 2023.

In this chat, John agreed and reiterated his position that he believes I am ready for this position, but it is out of his hands. He told me it may be benefitial to talk to his manager Bob, but warned me it may be out of his hands as well. I took this advice, and reached out to Bob.

My chat with Bob was less than ideal, and ultimately confusing. This meeting was not short and sweet, but it felt like it flew by. It has been awhile, so the details escape me, but we had some at the time odd conversations. I asked him questions about the organizational structure, titles, goals, etc. and I was given questionable responses that left me feeling a bit confused as he didn't exactly answer my question, instead asked me questions about the company, organizational structure, etc. And I gave him my personal feedback, and every answer had a rebuttal that we respectfully agreed to disagree on. However, the gist of this meeting was that he heard great things from John, and would make an appeal, but iterated to me the same thing that HR is slow, but I'm free to follow up with him for updates. So, I can summarize that what John told me reflected what Bob told me. That was definitely relieving, and I could accept that. I'd love to give more detail. but I never felt the need to document any of this as up to this point I felt everyone was on my side.

A few more months had gone, and from talks with John, he assured me that he KNOWS and is positive Bob did make an appeal, and it would just take time. This time it was December, and I felt it was time for a follow up to Bob for an update or if there was anything I could do such as talk to Bobs manager, or HR to learn more, as well as get feedback from him, and just catch up.

Small aside, around this time in Decemember, emails circulated of congratulating many higher ups on new roles and promotions. This is what ultimately led me to want to follow up, as it was a good sign the company had it in their mind.

This is where I started to question Bob. Our conversation started normal; however, he avoided talking about the promotion, and only reiterated it would take time. I probed a little deeper, and he became visually a little more frustrated.

Types of questions/responses he began asking me:  
'Why does the title even matter? I personally believe they don't, why are you so fixated on this role?'

'The roles and levels at this company are different than other companies. A senior here may not reflect the level of a senior in another role.'

'The pay of this company matches to standard of the area.'

I asked him questions about defining the roles and responsibilities, but he never answered any of my questions, only asked more questions out of me, and rebutted my questions.

I found these questions/responses to be a bit odd and out of left field, and frankly a little defensive, but the tone of it was an honest, but blunt discussion which I do not mind. The end result was the same as before, a weird conversation met with a less than optimistic hope of a promotion. 

I talked to John, who reassured me, that March was rolling around in a few months, which could be a good time for raises and promotions, as that is when annual incentives come around.  
The last time i followed up with Bob (my middle manager), was in mid December, it was now March of this year. My last conversation left me with little hope he would give me a straight answer. Yearly reviews came, and I got marks that I Overly Exceeded Expectations, at our company, there is not a better review you can get, and is exceeding rare for an employee to get according to my manager John. Yearly incentives came, and I didn't receive anything more than the next employee. I was a little disheartened, and ultimately talked to John, who said there wasn't much he could do, and that Bob had put me in, but again it will just take time. A week and a half ago, I decided to pull myself up by my bootstraps, and talk to HR to ultimately ask about promotions within the company, and if I could have some visibility into the situation, as at this point I was confused by Bob's last conversation with me.  


Disclaimer, I told them I did not care if I did not receive the position, all I wanted was information on my current job role, and how I can tend my goals to reach the next role.  


HR reached back out to me that they followed up with my leadership chain, and there would be value in continuing to address my converns with my leadership. They also said their understanding is that progressions are not gauranteed and factor in more than just time in a position/years of experience.  


This is where I became confused. I am at a time in my career, where I should be moving to that next step,had been performing above my role by many means consistently, with Johns stamp of approval.   


Why mention years of experience like that as if that is my argument when it isn't? That was a little confusing. I asked if they had received anything from my leadership, any appeals, or what have you. HR responded by requesting my leadership have a chat with me to make sure nothing has been miscommunicated.  


**Present**  
I was contacted by my middle manager, Bob, as a follow up to my concerns. The overall tone of this meeting was unproductive and a little hostile.  


The meeting started out with a statement, and a question he had asked before. 'You said before you were not concerned about titles, so why are you so fixated on titles now.' I responded that I actually had changed my mind a little on this topic after much thought.   


When I responded before, I told him that the title didn't necessarily matter as much as feeling valued, and a financial increase due to my merits was just as well a sign that they value my efforts and make me feel like I am making progress at this company, not as a job, but as a career. My responsibilities had increased, and even if i didn't have a title, the pay increase would be a sign that they acknowledge that. He said that makes sense, and agreed to that extent.  


This time, I stated I feel the titles do matter. As they set clear bounds and objectives for what my role performs and expects out of me, and without them the bounds are gone, and it's hard to tell where they begin and end. It is hard to know if you are making career progress otherwise.  


His rebuttal to this has been irking me. He stated that at the company, titles don't mean anything. Junior developers can be given AWS cloud architectural tasks, and seniors can be given simple defects. The umbrella has these titles, but everyone is equal in the eyes of the company, and everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and are allowed the opportunity for these challenges.   


Opinion: This is a nice thought, but I personally think it has a lot of flaws. In my company many are overworked, where some are cruising by. Talent is leaving and coasters are keeping the status quo.   


He said he was comfortable in his position, and doesn't even know how much he is paid at this point, and doesn't care. He says he know he will never be VP or anything like that, and is okay with it, and said I shouldn't care either because two years down the line I will be in the same position asking for the next thing, and there is only so much movement in the company that there isn't a point. He stated the roles themselves have a high pay range, which offsets the number of positions.  


That would be fine, but I haven't seen a raise based on individual performance, despite excellent reviews stating I have consistently been exceeding expectations, so I don't know how to feel about that.  


Opinion: I feel he is one of those cruisers, and may be projecting some of this onto me.  


This next conversation leads to my biggest talking point, that is causing me a lot of stress. About our yearly incentive raises (company wide inflation raises), the yearly incentive raise came, and he asked if I was not happy with it. I responded, well from what I gathered it was a company wide thing, and everyone got roughly the same (which is from conversations with other coworkers who freely gave this information).  


This is the response that fueled my stress, and this post. I could accept the previous stuff, but I felt really wrong about this.   


>""Wait, wait, wait.... How did you even know that everyone made the same amount?"" 

I responded, well, everyone has been talking about it.. and..   


>He interrupts,  
""I don't know what you think you know, but you aren't supposed to do that. ive been working for 30 years, and I don't know why you think this now, but you can be fired for this. This can be grounds for firing.""

I made the most confused face at this point. The way he said it didn't feel like he was threatening, but I knew for a fact that this is dead wrong. I wish I had recorded this, and in retrospect because of this statement, i will document all further interactions. I can't change that unfortanetly.  


side note: a coworker recently quit, and stated that another manager had told them not to discuss their raise with anyone else. So this may not be isolated to just this manager.  


I told him I disagreed completely, and he stated I don't need to be discussing that with my coworkers, that it was toxic, and in all his years working has done nothing but breed toxicity.  


This was a bit unprofessional on my part, but I stated ""I disagree, what about 40 hour work weeks? I think a lot of good has come out of talking about your salary and working conditions.""  


The conversation further devolved when I said, I just wanted to make sure I was valued what I felt like I was valued. I know from previous conversations he doesn't care about market value and thinks it is trash, while siting sites like [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) as his source for comparisons. Not a productive chat, but ultimately lead to this question he asked me.  


>What do you feel you are valued at?

Obviously opinion, but what I said: Currently, my total compensation is \~$120k. I stated $130-140k was a fair valuation based on market, peers, and my understanding of my role.  
*Fair warning, he misunderstood me in this moment. He acknowledged my total compensation, but when i stated my values, he thought I only meant salary, without the annual incentives and total comp.*  


His reaction to that; however, misunderstooding or not has really felt horrible. He laughed, not just a chuckle, but a hardy, head up belly laugh, followed by his nose to the keyboard. He simply said ""I very much disagree"", and I stated, ""Oh I meant total compension, not just salary"" and he reeled back and was like ""Oh okay, that makes more sense"".  


But that kind of reaction felt unwarranted. Anyways, I ended the conversation telling him it's okay to agree to disagree, and I respect him and the company, but I didn't feel much better about the situation, but I can accept it.  


That may have been a lie... I haven't been able to accept it. It's really been bothering me.  


**TL;DR**  
I talked to my middle manager and he stated that he submitted me for a position, but it hasn't come. When I followed up, I was met with some hostility, told I've overstepped my bounds by discussing salary with other employees, and ultimately had none of my questions answered when it comes to my goals and jobs responsibilities.  


What should I do? I really enjoy the company I work for, but i don't know if my middle manager is truly reflecting the companies values or if he is reflecting his own.  


Should I approach HR again and see if his thoughts are truly those of the company?  


Should I just drop it, tuck my legs, swallow my pride, and look for another job?  


Did I doom myself?

Has anyone created a stressful situation like this for themselves? How was it resolved, any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",Pokemonxyz,5,1.0,9,1710122858,2024-03-11 02:07:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbrx6u/so_i_went_to_middle_management_for_a/,3,2024

I also messaged HR and the admin of my location about me having the virus. Here's the kicker, my job's attendance policy states I have 3 callouts without sick time-off/paid time-off before I'd be reviewed for termination. Anything additional after that would have me be fired. I get a call today from a supervisor saying I've been fired for attendance even though yeah I've already reached the maximum amount of callouts but I should still not be fired, they've just decided to do it anyway. I find it extremely unfair that they'd just decide to let me go but I would definitely still endure the rest of my 3 month probation without calling out if I'd have to. I'm dedicated to keeping this job and no they don't have a COVID-19 policy or anything that would've protected me. I've reached out to the HR and told them the whole story. I know it doesn't look good from their standpoint but as an employee who got sick this is downright unfair.

1bbntxc,I have worked out a strategy for interviews. Does this sound like a good one?,"A few months ago, I read an article on the recommended behavior for a job interview. In that article, several behaviors (that I had been doing) where not recommended and I did not realize it.

Therefore, I did some research on the recommended protocol for a job interview and worked out a strategy to follow during an interview. Read it and tell me if any of these advices are bad and if there is anything you would like to add that I missed. You may have noticed that I listed behaviors and mindsets, I did not draft specific answers to specific questions. That is a conversation for another day.

1. Take Gas X before an interview. 

This way, you do not fart during the interview. 

Taking Imodium is a way to ensure that you will not need to get up in the middle of an interview to go to the bathroom. Telling the interviewer, in the middle of the interview, that you have to go to the bathroom and you cannot hold it, is really emabarassing. 

You should go to the bathroom before getting in your car to leave for the interview. That is a wise decision just generally, before you begin car travel, go to the bathroom, even if you do not need to. That way, you will not need to go to the bathroom while in the car. 

2. If possible chew on some breathe freshening gum before the interview. 

This way, your breathe will smell good. 

Also, do not smoke or drink before the interview. It is illegal for the interviewer to ask if you smoke or drink, but there is a very good chance that the interviewer will smell it. 

3. Do not arrive more than 10 minutes early. 

You should not be more than 10 minutes early. This means that you should not enter the building more than 10 minutes early, there is nothing wrong with parking in the parking lot more than 10 minutes early. That said, aim to arrive in the parking lot approximately 30 minutes before the interview is supposed to start. Wait until 10 minutes before the designated starting time of the interview before you actually enter the building. 

If the interview starts at 2:00 p.m., aim to arrive in the parking lot at 1:30 p.m. Wait until 1:50 p.m. before entering the building. 

4. Bring a water bottle. 

If you experience dry mouth, you will be able to take a sip of water. If the interviewer asks you a question and you need a moment to think of a good answer, you can sip your water while the interviewer waits patiently to hear your response. 

5. Do not sit in the interview chair until you are invited to do so. 

Stand there and wait to be told to sit down. 

6. What if you cannot think of a good answer? 

Either… 

Ask the interviewer if you can email him/her the answer. 

OR

Politely ask the interviewer if you can go back to that question later. 

To see Richard McMunn explain how that would work, click this link ( https://youtu.be/3PCE7GalxJU?si=Fyue2uiUXCUR5ikQ ). 

7. Do not say “that is a great question.” 

There really is not much to explain here. The interviewer clearly agrees that it a a good question, or else he/she would not have asked it. Just do not say that. 

8. Do not speak negatively about your former employer or coworkers. 

If you where that negative about your former employer or coworkers, that is a red flag to the employer that you will be negative at this new job. 

9. When the Interview asks “why should we hire you?” don’t just give one reason. 

Give at least three reasons. 

10. When the interview tells you to introduce yourself. 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this position today. Having studied the job description, I am confidant that I have the skills, qualities and qualifications necessary to excel in the role. I am a fast learner, I possess excellent problem solving capabilities and I can manage a significant work load. I have an impressive track record of achievement. For example, when I completed an internship in college, my supervisor said that I was a pleasure to have around and that I made the work that we did more interesting. I acted as a positive role model for younger students. I will surely take responsibility for my ongoing professional development. If you hire me, I am sure that you will see a positive return on your investment. 

Also, ask the interviewer what it was about your resume that they liked. Then, reference that strength as much as possible during the interview. 

11. Take a phone interview as seriously as you would an in person interview. 

Dress up as you would for an in person interview. The interviewer will not see you, but psychologists believe that dressing up makes you more likely to act professional. Make sure that your battery is fully charges. 

12. Claim that the job description is perfectly aligned with your experience and qualifications. 

This is a brilliant thing to say and it will resonate positively with the interviewer, if in fact it is true. 

13. I have researched the company in detail and I am impressed with your values, the way you treat your customers and the way you strive to improve. 

Say this to the interviewer. This will show that you are passionate about the role. 

We spend many hours at work. If you are passionate about what you do and if you are passionate about what you do, you are more likely to get the job. 

14. Do not move anything around in the room. 

It is the way that it is for a reason. Do not even ask about why something is arranged the way that it is, it is none of your business. 

15. Do not tell the interviewer that you are nervous. 

Interviewers love confidant people. However, you do not actually have to be confidant, you just have to appear confidant. If you are nervous deep down, that is fine. However, keep it to yourself. 

16. Do not ask; what does your company do? 

You are supposed to prepare by doing your research before the interviewer. Asking this question makes it obvious you did not do that. 

Also, be prepared to answer the question; What can you tell me about our company? 

17. Do not say; I will do anything. 

What you should say is that you are flexible, adaptable and willing to carry out tasks outside your job description, to assist the company. 

18. Never say; It’s on my resume. 

If it is on your resume, then you should remember putting it there. Just answer the question as though the person to whom you are speaking never read your resume. 

19. Do not say that you are a perfectionist when asked about weaknesses. 

You could instead say something like; 

I try to solve problems on my own when I should be asking for help. 

I am not very good at public speaking. 

I have a hard time saying no, so I take on too many responsibilities. 

20. Do not request time off during an interview. 

This tells the hiring manager that you are already thinking about not being at work and you have not even been hired. 

Wait until you have been offered the job, before requesting time off. 

21. Closing statements. 

Try one of these. 

- Thank you for the chance to be interviewed for the role. I have thoroughly enjoyed the process, and in particular learning about your company, your plans and how I can help you achieve them. I genuinely believe I can add significant value to your company and I would love the opportunity to prove to you my worth. Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you. 

- I just want to say thank you for inviting me to the interview today. I have been nothing but impressed with the professionalism and the manner in which the interview has been conducted. I genuinely want to work for your company, and I think you will see a strong return on your investment if you hire me. If you need further information, do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you in due course. 

If the interview did not go very well and there where several questions you where unable to answer, try this. 

- Thank you for taking the time to interview me today. I apologise for not being able to answer several of your questions. However, having studied the company in detail, I really do believe I am a great fit for your company long term. If you hire me, I will work hard to repay the trust you will have shown in hiring me, and I will help your business to thrive. Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you in due course. 

22. Do not say that you do these things in your free time. 

Watch television, play video games, go out drinking with your friends and scroll social media. 

This makes it sound like you do not make good use of your time. 

Also, do not tell the interviewer that you spend most of your free time working. If you claim that you will also be working elsewhere, it will lead the interviewer to believe that you will not be 100% while at work. 

23. When the interviewer asks; what makes you unique? 

Do not tell the interviewer that you are hard working and professional. That is a basic requirement of all jobs. 

24. A second interview is NOT merely a formality. 

You should put just as much effort and preparation into your second interview as you did your first one. 

Often, there will be someone at the second interview who was not there for the first one. This is because the interviewer is seeking a second opinion. 

25. Never say that you have no experience. 

Instead, focus on your strengths. 

26. At the end of the interview, ask the interviewer for his or her contact information. 

This way, you can send a thank you email.",bigelow6698,2,1.0,0,1710111587,2024-03-10 22:59:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbntxc/i_have_worked_out_a_strategy_for_interviews_does/,3,2024
1bbmmqc,What to do? Feel stuck,"I’m 26 years old and work for a Fortune 500 company doing industrial MRO sales in the manufacturing sector. I have been with the company for 3 years now 2 in TX and 1 in CA. I feel proud to work for the company and get satisfaction from my job but I feel stuck. After 2 years at the company I maxed out the pay range for the position I was in and was no longer eligible for annual increases to my pay as an hourly employee at the time. I was told since it’s a sales position it’s my responsibility to make the extra money through my commissions which are paid out on a % to goal basis. With that being the situation I worked and earned a promotion to an Account manager position that moved me across the country to CA. I accepted the base salary with commission with the understanding I would be eligible for annual raises based on performance. This past week my annual performance review came up and I was told I am valued and appreciated and my stellar performance does not go unnoticed, BUT I have already maxed out the pay range for this position and they can’t give me a raise so instead they will offer a lump sum of 3.25% of my salary. I would have never accepted the job if it was expressed to me that I cannot grow my salary past what I signed on at. I’m not sure anyone would. With CA taxes and deductions the 3.25% will come out to around $1300 which feels like a complete slap in the face and gives me nothing to work towards for this next year. Not to mention with 3.1% inflation I will actually be making less money this year. Have any of you had similar experiences? If yes, what did you do?

 I finished my master this year and I feel like I know alot of things I will ever need, but I don't know the tools (softwares) the hiring companies are asking. I  guess that's normal, or at least common, since I have almost no experience. 
 I want to learn. I want to plan my career according to my ambitions. That's where the trouble begins. I have a boyfriend, which I love, but I feel like he's slowing me down. If it wasn't for him, I would already move to a new country, or at least a new city. My choices would be just my choices. He's also an engineer, we could work anywhere, but he fears changes and uncomfort (and he's not as ambitious). I fear pushing him into something that will make him miserable. 

I don't want to chose my career over him, and look back at 40yo, with a rich life, full of experiences, but alone and miserable, regreting it all. 
I don't want to chose him over my career, and look back when at 40yo, with a warm house full of people o love, but counting every cent and feeling I wasted every opportunity in my life, regreting it all.

1bbl549,Need help negotiating my salary with current employer,"I really need help with talking to my boss about my salary. I am currently working 3 jobs to make a livable wage (Full time events planner, rover pet sitter (usually overnight stays during week/into weekend), and a weekend server at a wedding venue (F-SUN)) 

I cannot keep working these 3 jobs, it has been 4 months doing all three and I am going crazy. 

In my full time role, I plan all the North America events for a Med-Large IT company, we have overexceeded all of our sales goals for 2023, and are on track to overexceed Q1 2024. I have been doing this for 3 years. All of my colleagues and executive team members work well with me, they know they can count on me, and have given me praise time and time again for all the events I plan. These events range from 15 - 300 attendees and I plan anywhere from 80-100 per year. They bring together our team and our customers to do business. These events are more experiences than meetings. I work with budgets upwards of 1million on these events. I have been doing this role by myself for the first 2.5 years, we finally hired a 2nd person to assist. Now we have split the events, but I have more and the larger ones. 

I started in the role at $45k, after one year I was bumped up to $50k, after the second year I was bumped up to $60k, and now I am at $65k (effective as of Jan 2024). This is not a livable salary in the state that I am living in and I also live alone. In this past review, I fought for a month straight to get to $65k. They were not willing to budge, but neither was I. I told them I needed to make $80k a year or I walk. That is why they bumped me, but I can't walk as I cannot find a new job. I am not afraid of confrontation or proving my worth. But my boss chooses to make everything personal and does not hear me out for the facts. She called me selfish for asking for a $5k raise this year. Like who does that?? Sure, call me selfish for wanting to pay my bills! 

I really enjoy my job a lot. The people I work with directly are great and I get to travel.  I am not a personal person at work, I am there to work and not to really make friends. I just want to get paid for the work I do and be done with it. I don't know how else I can approach her with the facts that what she is paying me is not enough. I cannot stand having to work 3 jobs to live while also having to travel for this job and work my butt off and not get properly compensated. I am also looking for new jobs, but have not had any luck on that front. I'd like to confront my job again about my pay in the meantime. Should I go above her to the CMO or CEO and prove my case?

1bbkumw,PIP...how to leverage the plan to my benefit?,"Hi! I am 6 months into a role and just got put on a PIP by my manager. My manager works fully remote while I'm full time in office so we have never met in real life before.  I want to know how to leverage my PIP to both cover my butt incase of firing and also improve. Of course I am actively looking for a new job. 

So far I have sent detailed records of all communications at the EOD to my boss with HR on copy to show my attempts to meet the pip requirements.

 I also suspect this is a situation where I am asking too many questions and my ceo is maybe not the most ethical as I'm the corporate accountant. Any time I question their personal charges on the corporate account it's met with some type of snakry comment or repremand. Quotes like ""they aren't stupid to use the card on personal stuff.

the tip of the iceberg was when I asked about $80K I charges made in one day on our company card that I thought may be fraud. It was not fraud but travel cost for a personal vacation for some employees and non employees. I got reprimanded for asking the appropriate employees about the charges and was told to only come to my boss about my questions about charges.

1bbjb0g,"Recently out of a halfway house, have a law degree but no license. What can I do for a good job?","Hi,

I'm looking for general advice on how to restart my working life. To make a long story short:

* I graduated from a Tier 2 law school in 2017, high honors, law review, and started a good job in the legal field.

* Unfortunately I was also a raging alcoholic and did not pass the bar exam. I was able to stay in my job because it didn't require a license. After 2 years though, my alcoholism progressed to the point where I didn't care about my job anymore and I quit with no notice.

* I wandered around the proverbial wilderness for a while, working retail and restaurants or just unemployed, until I finally hit bottom last year.

* I voluntarily went to a detox unit for a little over a month, and from there to a six-month halfway house. I did great there, got a ""get well job"" in retail which I still have, and a sponsor and home group in AA. I completed the halfway house program and moved into independent living a month ago.

So that's where I'm at. I have a law degree and would have had great references from those days, but I burned the bridge at my last law job and haven't talked to anyone from my law school internships or school in years. Since I also don't have a license and would have to retake the bar, I feel like the ship has sailed on being a lawyer and am not looking at jobs there.

But, I don't want to work my ""get well job"" in retail forever.

My basic question is, what kind of work am I qualified to pursue? Everyone and their mother tells me to be a paralegal, but they don't understand law firms don't want to hire JDs as paralegals. It feels like the JD is hampering me more than anything, especially without a law license to go with it.

I'm basically trying to find a new career path, and hear if anyone else has come back from something like this.",Ok_Panda_8071,11,1.0,17,1710100449,2024-03-10 19:54:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbjb0g/recently_out_of_a_halfway_house_have_a_law_degree/,3,2024

* Be more social and spend more time with friends. 

I resigned from my current job 5 months ago, because there was a lot of negativity from top management (gave feedback, it's getting better over time) and the business was not doing great, during my notice period, the company got a new project which turned it's direction and fortune around, to retain me (I am one of the fastest growing people there), they asked me to take one month off (unpaid, but equity keeps vesting) and come back lead this new product (3 teams, \~ 50 people) and acknowledged that they will work on making the top management better. 

However, ever since I got back, I haven't been feeling excited about work; I have been feeling overwhelmed and anxious, I was never this way before and was pretty confident; I have to make a lot of critical decisions every day and each decision makes me anxious, some days are good but some are bad and on bad days I run on autopilot, being zoned out most of the time, even when I am at home.

I feel out of my element sometimes since I am not excited and motivated. I have thought about leaving this job a lot but don't want to disappoint people and my team by leaving again. I tried to suck it up, but I feel stuck, additionally, I am waking up about an hour early before my alarm, and thoughts about what's pending and work keeps revolving in my head, I have started seeing a therapist it has helped tremendously.

I keep daydreaming about taking a long break and working flexibly on low-stress stuff, like open source and consulting, for about 4 hours per day. What would you do in my situation?

I think I screwed up on a project and am dreading the meeting about the work. I had 4 Excel file deliverables. Two of them were with follow-up information from a previous request and two of them were for separate requests. The requests were from another team within my company.  
I completed the follow up information and asked my coworker to look over it when we were both in the office. She wasn’t involved in the projects, but she had mentioned that the files might not be relevant to the request. She had a couple recommendations, but said she didn’t want to create more work for me. I added her recommendations except one because I was running out of time and brain power.  
These are huge files (one of them is 130 sheets) with a ton of information. I spent a lot of hours on them and was working at night and on the weekend to get them done. I am exhausted and tired of looking at them.  
I sent the files to the two people who requested them and cc’d my boss and coworker. I said they could let me know if they had any questions. My boss scheduled a meeting with everyone to go over the work shortly after I sent the email. Idk if the requestor messaged him for a meeting or if he just set it up. I’ve never done a report out for this type of work before or had anyone send me follow up questions.  
I thought that I was doing things correctly and gathering the correct information, but now I think that they wanted different information for the follow-ups. I feel embarrassed and don’t want to make my team look bad. I am tired of the work and don’t want to look at it anymore, but I still want to make things right.  
I’m not very good at presenting on Zoom (it’s something I’m working on) and the files had a lot of information that I don’t fully understand, so I am nervous about presenting and making things look worse. The format of everything is correct (it’s a standard report out that my team uses); I am just not 100% familiar with all of the terms and data.  
My plan was to go into the meeting with confidence and explain the files and the data as best as I can. If they have additional questions or I didn’t meet the expectations, I can go back and fix things. I just feel lousy and realize that I should have asked my boss before sending the files and pushed through the stress to make sure everything looked better. I know what to do for future projects, but it's the report out meeting and recognizing the mistake and seeing people's reactions that I am worried about.  
I would appreciate any advice or words of wisdom that people further along in their career may have for me.",igpay-atinlay-,1,1.0,2,1710093809,2024-03-10 18:03:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbgmcv/seeking_advice_dealing_with_mistakes_at_work/,3,2024

1bbg0gl,Scared to apply for another job.,First I will start off by saying I'm 23 and very fortunate to be where I'm at. Bought a house earlier this year and just had a baby about 8 weeks ago. I make about 90k-100k running heavy machinery for my local municipality and I love my job I don't think I'd want to be anywhere else. There is a position open in a similar line of work related to my experience at my current job for our state government that I would love to apply to. The problem is they actually thoroughly research and call references and I don't want my supervisors to know I'm interested in another employment opportunity. I would be receiving a bump in pay of around 10k to 20k. So easily anticipate making 110k to 120k a year easily. I guess what I'm asking is 10k a year worth leaving the job I know and love for a job making more money and working less but completely starting over on the seniority chart. Thinking about sending the application in is causing me some pretty hefty anxiety.

1bbfbaw,Need help figuring out next steps.,"I (24F) am autistic, and a former “gifted and talented” student. I was academically brilliant and in some ways, still clutching to that side of myself. I have tried going to college more times than I can count on one hand. I hated it, and have significant school related trauma. I passed half the courses I took, and failed the other half. Over and over again, because I hate long term projects and have a mental block from the trauma (or perhaps something else?) I have about a year’s worth of college credits.

However, where my proven interests lie, it’s impossible to be in those fields without Master’s degrees. I’m currently a library assistant, but the wages for this job are impossible to survive on. I also deeply enjoy my work, but in order to go anywhere in this career path, I’d need a Master’s degree in library science to become a librarian. The other field I’m interested in is counseling, and well, that’s a Master’s degree too.

I also am deeply passionate about writing poetry and working on a novel, but neither are likely to generate income. What I truly want to do is work at an animal shelter, but those wages aren’t livable either.

I also pet sit. Privately and for an established company. I have a few clients now, and it’s possible it could be a lucrative side hustle for me if I tried getting more clients.

Which leads me to my last option: medical coding. I know it’s a difficult field to break into, but I’ve done trade programs in the past, and those I seem to be more compatible with.

I would love to be a school librarian, but I don’t know if I have the stamina or the ability to handle college. Truthfully, I’m scared, because I was always told (as a “gifted and talented” student) that college was the only way for me to succeed. Looking at my interests and options, that seems to be true. My dad was very hard on my decision to drop out of school, and since he has passed, I feel like that’s the only way to make him proud. (trust me, I know I need a therapist too, haha)

I’m just at a crossroads, and I don’t want to set myself up for failure trying college again. I also don’t want to say that it definitely won’t work and limit myself, or try something off the cuff on the chance that I could be good at it, with no guarantees of a job after completing the program. I just don’t know what to do, and some advice would be deeply helpful.

Thank you in advance!",lgbtruecrime,1,1.0,0,1710090523,2024-03-10 17:08:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbfbaw/need_help_figuring_out_next_steps/,3,2024
1bbf8ul,Left a short term job off my resume and think it’s hurting me - how can I handle this?,"About a year ago, I had a short term contract with a major technology company go bad and I’m not sure how to approach this when applying to other opportunities there. 

What happened:

My vendor company recommended me for a position for an area of expertise in which I had not previously worked. Think like having experience running Networking projects and getting a contract for SDLC projects. I was clear with the recruiter and account manager that I did not have expertise in this area but would be willing to take on the challenge.

The sponsor at the tech company was reluctant to hire me but agreed. They did *not* interview me, so I did not have a chance to clarify their expectations and to figure out if I was a match for the opportunity. Suffice it to say that this is a lesson that I learned the hard way and I will not accept a contract without an interview in the future. I did feel backed into a corner as I could’ve lost unemployment if I rejected the job in this case.

When I started, they threw a Wikipedia at me and went on vacation for a week. When they returned, they ignored all of my Teams messages and emails with questions, kept referring to me as a “senior candidate”, and escalated to our account representative halfway through week two. (Remember this was day 3 of them actually being around for me to ask questions.) They were angry that I was asking “so many questions” and they terminated my contract two weeks later.

It was a really negative experience. The account manager kept apologizing to me profusely and wrote a letter to HR to say that the termination of the contract was not my fault, that the client was being unreasonable, and that I should be considered for future opportunities.

Since the job only lasted a month and I didn’t gain any real experience from it, I’ve been leaving it off my resume. Many recruiters have since submitted me for openings there and then ghosted me when I give them my previous vendor email addresses. So I think they’re noticing that I left this contract off my resume and I’m getting rejected for that reason.

Would it be better for me to add this experience just to resumes I submit with this company? If so, how should I address how short the contract term was? Should I just give up on opportunities with this organization?

1bbez6r,I've Seen and Been Told that Communications is a Useless Degree And It's Put Me Into a Deep Depression.,"Hello everyone,  
so yes, I am on track to graduate with a degree in communications (you can boo and laugh) but I am constantly seeing that it is regarded as very useless and I've fallen into a deep depression because of it.  
Let me explain why I am getting a communications degree; I am one of those people whose parents forced them to go to college even though I had no clue what I wanted to do. When meeting with my advisor, he said that communications is great because it opens the door to many opportunities and that many employers can use someone with a communications degree. So I bought into that because I thought that being a broad field was a good thing.  
Apparently, according to Reddit and a couple of other articles I've read, communications is at the absolute bottom of the barrel, the worst thing you could possibly get and it's made me even more scared of my future. Maybe it's because I've been reading too much into these Reddit posts which is not good because I am in my own head 24/7.  
But at the same time, are these people on the college subreddits right, or are they wrong, does anyone actually know what they are talking about? Over the course of a couple of days that I have been on college subreddits, it seems like it is mostly STEM majors jerking off to themselves and belittling anyone who does not have a degree in the STEM field. I am not saying these people shouldn't be proud of themselves (I know someone in engineering, it seems incredibly mentally draining), but the way they seemingly attack anyone they feel is less than has taken a toll on me mentally and makes me terrified of where I'll be in life.  
Am I royally fucked, cause at my college they are very strict about letting people change their major when they are close to graduating so I cannot change it now.  
Anyway, sorry for the essay, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you.",Scary_Growth,1,1.0,26,1710089685,2024-03-10 16:54:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bbez6r/ive_seen_and_been_told_that_communications_is_a/,3,2024

1bbe02f,How to bring up commute in interview?,"How to bring up commute in an interview? 

So for some context, I am in Agriculture and fresh out of college. I haven’t had much luck with jobs in my area for the past few months because a large Ag company in our area went out of business so the market has been over saturated with people with more experience than me. 

Anyway, I am in the final stages of an interview with a large grain elevator. The kicker; it’s 60 miles from my residence. BUT, there is not a house within 30 miles of the location with most actual towns being 45+ miles in each direction. So everyone who works there has to commute. 


My questions is, Would a company that is this secluded have a way of assisting with the commute? I know this is asking alot, but wouldn’t they have to make the wages more or offer a company truck to even hire anybody? I would be the assistant manager of the location if I secured the position. 

The major question is how do I even bring this up in an interview? This is one of the larger companies in the grain sector. 

Edit **** Any advice on figuring how much it would cost to commute?? I have figured out how much it would cost yearly on gas but the maintenance on the vehicle is where it gets confusing.

1bbcsw3,20 and no idea what to do with my life,"Hey all. So I graduated high school in 2022, and since then I have been so lost. I’ve worked part time in retail since then (hate it), but I really want to go to university. The problem is I can’t choose a degree. I’ve thought so much about this over the past couple years, and it’s kind of driving me insane. I’ve done a lot of research on things like Big Five personality or MBTI (I’m an INFJ) as well in a desperate attempt to understand myself. I guess one thing I’ve realised is I don’t want a soulless job made to fuel profits, I want a job where my work feels important and makes getting out of bed every day worth it. I tend to be very prone to depression and feeling that life is meaningless and I don’t want to fall even further into that. Any jobs that may be considered meaningful by people (like teacher, nurse etc) seem to be very people facing, but I’m also a very sensitive, introverted person and I worry that if I have a job facing people constantly, it may drive me to burn out.

Any advice would be so appreciated!

Had trouble getting decent work in the industry, but managed to stay in it long enough to learn Premiere (self taught).  Around 2010, with youtube popularizing, and web video taking off, I took some in person night & continuing ed courses in web design. Learned HTML, CSS, Wordpress & more. Couldn't quite get into full computer coding like Javascript or C#, but kinda grasp the concepts.

During 2020, my skill sets came highly into play where I was working. Only, without getting into details the company had a unsuccessful re-org where the assigned a bunch of 'Creative Directors' onto me (ie. CEOs friends & favorties), these were admin types who didn't even know what Photoshop was and were of no help to me. I left, and the company failed.

That said, where I was at was a company kindof slowly riding things out.  Owner (owners son) wasn't adapting to post-pandemic & virtual, business had been slowing over the past 10 years I was told, and most of the office was over 60, on their way to retirement.  There wasn't any push to refresh & renew things.

&#x200B;

I apply to jobs, but at this age, even when getting a Zoom interview, its clear I'm not going to be hired. I'm looking to dive deep into something in the IT/computer field. Ideally something certified or that can be proven.  Willing to do either a bootcamp, or in person training facility.  Considered Java, or COBOL, but also AWS or Microsoft. I know MS changed some things a few years back, no longer MCSE etc, Would Azure have potential?  Also considering Salesforce Developer.

1bbbg95,How to tell boss I want to do something new outside of my department?,"Hi,

I'm an engineer + business grad working in an IT project manager role at a large retail company. I'm about 2.5 years into my career.

Initially my career progress was satisfying, went from developer -> PM in a very large transformation project in ~8 months (on loan from my department). Increased salary by 50% from entry level in 2 years.

I've worked my ass off and my sub-project has gone very well. Everything promised delivered on time and budget. Productivity for my department has increased by 400% as a result. Cost savings as a direct result of my work amounts to >1 MUSD/annually in other parts of the org. Achieved 95% of desired result with 40% of the work by smart planning.

The transformation project is nearing completion, and my sub-project too. All technology & automation is developed, work routines I've created are finalized. The remaining part is just rinse and repeat implementation for the next 6 months or so. I find this very boring though.

I have an upcoming yearly 1-to-1 and tbh I don't know which goals I should set.

I'm stagnating. Nowadays I rarelyr have opportunities to create decision making material to present to top management. I'm much less visible. I no longer have exciting meetings.

I see no obvious room for new fun things in my small department. Either I'm switching position or changing company.

Talked to a few successful senior colleagues I trust about this. They suggested I ask for a meeting with the boss of my boss, present what I've done and propose that I think I can add value to the company in another role.

How do I do this in practice though? 

1. Do I first raise this question with my boss? I don't want him to feel back stabbed, as we have a very good relationship.

2. How do phrase the above?

3. How do I approach this with the boss of my manager?

1bbaiup,My story about leaving my finance job,"I found myself trapped in the monotony of a successful but unfulfilling career in finance. The numbers on spreadsheets and the sterile office environment left me yearning for something more. One crisp autumn day, I decided to break free and follow my passion for cooking.  
Enrolling in culinary school was a leap into the unknown. Swapping financial figures for ingredients and spreadsheets for cutting boards, I embraced the change. Early mornings became pastry classes, and late nights turned into experiments in my small apartment kitchen.  
The journey was challenging. I navigated the unfamiliar terrain, learning the art of flavors and forming bonds with fellow aspiring chefs. Word of my culinary adventures spread, eventually landing me a spot in a cozy neighborhood bistro.  
Trading my business attire for a chef's hat, I discovered a newfound joy in the sizzle of pans and the aroma of spices. The once-unhappy financier transformed into a vibrant chef, eager to share my love for food with the world.  
As I plated a culinary masterpiece for a satisfied customer, I reflected on my journey. Changing careers had been a daring move, but it led to a profound sense of fulfillment. Financial reports were replaced by glowing reviews, and the only numbers that mattered were the smiles of those who savored my creations.  
In the end, my story was not just about changing careers; it was about finding the courage to pursue my true passion and choosing happiness over convention. Crestwood witnessed the evolution of a woman who dared to live authentically and embrace the joy that came with following her heart.

After I graduated (bachelor in communications management), I immediately started working full time as a SEO specialist. Have been working in SEO ever since. (Have thought about doing a masters, but never actually did it.)

Despite a good salary (€65.000 per year + really good pension scheme and other benefits), I now feel that its really time to move into something else / something better. 

Some options/ directions I am considering:

* Growth 
* Brand 
* Product marketing
* Product

As a first step, I did the MiniMBA in Marketing a while back. But I still feel like I need more knowledge to be able to move into a more strategic, more interesting role.

Who has any tips?

Also, I have LinkedIn Learning now but no clue which course to take... Would love to hear if people have recommendations.",argaman2,2,1.0,0,1710075545,2024-03-10 12:59:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bb9rnk/how_to_grow_in_my_career_linkedin_learning_recs/,3,2024
1bb7myy,"HELP!!What's gonna happen next, would I be on PIP or directly fired. Office politics is crazy stuff. ","So I got to know from my new manager that my previous manager who was there in the last 4 months of last year gave me a bad review for last year review cycle. The manager I did had for the first 8 months of my last year give me a pretty good review. I had a dispute with my previous manager who regarding task distribution as I was continuously given the low level task while my colleagues took up the higher level task which good learning and tech stack.

My new manager told me informally that I had been given the bad review of being hard to work with because of that dispute and other more made up issues by my previous managers like replying late on slack (like 1 or 2 hrs, which wasn't the case) and code quality issue. He told me that since passed 4 months I was on performance improvement plan (which I knew about today only) and by the end of the month may be I could get a call from my previous manager (maybe even the HR would be in the call, which he didn't said directly).
 On confronting my previous manager told me that I had made my delivery is before the deadline and he has no issue only issue was regarding my relation with peer (which were good except with him). 
One of my current colleagues was also asked about how he has relations with me and how is my code quality ,so he responded well in my favor

What do u guys think is gonna happen, I am applying like crazy starting today, but it would be great if my current job continues while I do my interview preparation.
I have a meeting regarding this on Monday which was scheduled on my demand what should I say and how should the conversation go.

1bb707u,Stop recommending debt to children,"I'll be clear off the bat: I think the ""college is necessary for true success"" rhetoric is both plainly false and is perpetuated maliciously by the educational industrial complex.

The point of telling kids to go to school isn't to give them the best headstart in life. 6 figures in debt with no employment guarantee is not a head start.

The point of recommending school to kids is to capitalize on social pressure and get easy sale conversions. The point is to get their money.

But I'd say the primary point of forcing it so ubiquitously so early is making sure that no one realizes that they could have and would have thrived without a degree.

It is modern day snake oil. Probably the biggest unchecked scam going.

I'm not saying that all degrees are totally useless. Just that a super majority are, and it's riskier to go into debt straight out of highschool than it is not getting a degree immediately.

You'll be able to get one later. Like that's always an option if you really need a degree lmao.

But it's nothing other than foolish to take on that debt without having any idea what you actually want to do, or if your degree is genuinely required to do it.

The only ""evidence"" that college truly makes anyone more money ignores the burden to call correlation causation. Statistics may show people with degrees earning $1M more over their life times, but that doesn't prove that the degree is what caused the increase.

If nearly every driven and intelligent person is convinced to get a degree (and independently successful people are provided honorary ones) then that driven and intelligent group can be running up the numbers, carrying the people who are in student debt working at McDonald's.

By suggesting it's just the degree that matters to providing that boost, you give people who aren't intelligent or driven the sense that degrees are magically going to net them more value.

And forcing children to make a career decision and go into debt for it when they have next to no life or professional experience is heinously immoral, and I have no idea how it's normalized.

If you are a parent who both forces a college path and doesn't pay for it, you're setting your kid up for failure. It's not pre 2000 college anymore. The cost has gone up, the value of a degree has gone down.

The only thing going to college guarantees is student loans. And if you find at some point in your career that you're hitting a wall that you need a degree to get through, you can get one then. I have no idea why that isn't the logical progression here.

Well I do, it's because colleges sponsor high school guidance counselor's to push their poison. I guess I should say idk how parents fall for this shit still.",nielsenson,1,0.44999998807907104,93,1710065459,2024-03-10 10:10:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bb707u/stop_recommending_debt_to_children/,3,2024

1bb67kz,Need Advice Negotiating Hybrid Schedule New Job Offer,"After 3 rounds of interviews, I was offered a job at a new company and I’m mostly happy with the offer when it comes to salary, PTO, benefits, etc. However, they changed the conditions of the hybrid schedule and working arrangements that we advertised on the job position and discussed in the interviews more than once. I am currently employed full-time at a company that has a mandatory weekly office day and working hours are flexible. Job requirements between current and new job are similar, but new job would have more client facing responsibility. I have also been in the industry for 2.5-3 years and was referenced this open position, so they know I’m cut out for the job. Interviews also went amazing and it’s clear that they like me personality wise enough to fit with the team. 

This past month, the recruiter and reporting managers for this new position mentioned that 2 days would be required in office which I was fine with since my current job has a mandatory weekly office day. I even recall asking which specific days of the week to get a sense of the work schedule. The team I would be joining is very small and mostly spread out across 3+ countries, so I can imagine most team meetings would take place virtually. 

Then, upon reading my contract, I noticed that it mentioned I need to be in office for a min of 3 days and that travel may be expected from me time to time. This honestly confused me since we discussed general details about the work schedule/requirements throughout the interview process, and there was never any mention of travelling so not sure what that entails. I have extremely bad travel anxiety and I would have never considered a job that required this in the first place. 

After skimming the contact, I reached out to the recruiter and HR contact on the thread mentioning that the hybrid schedule was advertised as 2 days and implied that this would be a step down from my current work accommodation. They replied saying this was non-negotiable and I’m considering reaching out to the reporting manager for my team for more clarification on why this has changed and if there is room for flexibility. 

Main reason for job searching in the first place is that I would love to get a significant salary raise this year and that is currently only possible if I switch companies in the near future - internal raises as we know are not that high. A big attractive factor for this new job was the fact that they advertised just 2 days in office since my mental health is significantly better working a hybrid schedule with 3-4 WFH days and I’m infinitely more productive. As much as a salary boost would be amazing, I don’t want to sacrifice my happiness with changing my current work life/balance - small ask, I know. 

So depending on what the reporting manager for this job says I’m going to make either of the following decisions. 

If they mention that 2 office days is fine and no travel is required, I’d asked to get this in writing and likely accept the revised offer. 

If they mention that 3 office days in-fact non-negotiable and travel is a possibility, I’m considering providing two counter-offers:

1.  Begrudgingly accept the 3 day in office requirement, but request a 5-10% salary bump on top their original offer. Request to remove the travel requirement entirely. 

2.  Push back on wanting the 2 day in office requirement that was originally advertised and mention that I would be willing to stay at the current offered salary if this was met. Also request to remove any travel requirement. 

Would these be reasonable counter offers? I understand that they can always rescind or decline, but I feel like I have enough leverage with my skill set and the fact that even if I don’t get this job, I’m still employed with my current company. Curious on others experience on this as well.",nnazev,2,1.0,1,1710062307,2024-03-10 09:18:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bb67kz/need_advice_negotiating_hybrid_schedule_new_job/,3,2024
1bb5yjn,Is a top 10 MBA worth it if I'm already making a decent salary?,"I'm considering applying for top mba programs and if accepted, entering a program at around the 5 years of experience mark, when i'm 29.

  
Currently I'm 28 and have two years of experience in tech implementation consulting, and 2 years of experience as a product manager at a financial services f100 company.

  
I currently make about 130k base and 15k as a yearly bonus, there isn't a clear path to promotion at all at my current company, I only get around 2-4% yearly increases, and I see tons of folks with 5-10+ years of experience more than me in the same title making only slightly more. Also my management team isn't very ambitious about moving up, many of them have sat in their same manager position for 5-10+ years. All this being said, I do have the benefit of working remotely and having very good work life balance.

  
I feel like I have hit a point of diminishing returns in my current position at this company in terms of growth in skills and compensation, however I've had a lot of difficulty recruiting for roles at other companies which pay comparably in the current market.

  
I've been advised by family that an MBA, especially a top one which could cost 200k or more out of pocket (tuition + living expenses), is a dumb idea, especially given the opportunity cost of losing my current level of income for 2 years, and not having a guarantee of even making much more post-grad than I currently do.

  
But at the same time I'm not sure I even want to stay in product, especially at this company. Part of me wants to try something new like management consulting in the technology sector, but I know its extremely hard without target program recruiting. Also, I don't have a relationship or a family to take care of, and I feel like this might be something I'll regret not doing down the line if I don't go through with it. I'm not eager to 'settle down' or take my foot off the gas and coast when it comes to my career, I think I have a lot of unrealized potential.

A recruiter for a competitor contacted me and wants to setup an interview with the hiring manager. I would be doing the same exact job that I am currently doing now, but I will have to be onsite full-time. The pay would be $115,000, plus a 5% yearly bonus. The commute time would be 7 minutes one way. They offer ""unlimited"" vacation time with managers approval, which I'm kind of skeptical about. All other benefits being equal.

With that said, would it be smart to give up my hybrid job for an extra $28,750 a year? I am currently comfortable financially and enjoying my work schedule, but that is a lot of money to not consider. What are your thoughts?

1bb3hvc,Bored of IT?,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking to see if anyone here has had the experience of working in IT and it not living up to their expectations. 

Prior to IT I did an unrelated arts/social sciences degree. Originally opted to go to IT because of the job security and my own curiosity. 

Have since burnt out in the field multiple times. And I had hoped that perhaps doing a related postgraduate or learning outside work could fix the broken down relationship I have with this field. 
But everytime I so much as pick up a book or watch a video I just feel wildly stressed and unable to continue. 

Is it just a side effect of burnout? I am contemplating leaving the field for something that utilises my other skills, as it often feels like mental torture to be in front of a computer digesting such dry information and solving problems all the time. 

It's like I just cannot make myself interested anymore. Ironically I could easily digest knowledge on law, policy, economics, political science, social sciences, finance etc. 

Has anyone ever experienced this?",AccurateClock4,3,1.0,3,1710051802,2024-03-10 06:23:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bb3hvc/bored_of_it/,3,2024
1bb321v,What's next for me in the logistics world after having been in the trenches for 13 years?,"Hi guys,

I'm hoping to get some help from somebody who's been in my shoes before whether it be in this industry or in another.  

So I started in the logistics world at 18 years old because my family was struggling and we needed everybody to pitch in to pay for the house. My point in sharing this is because I didn't necessarily want this to be my career path. But it kind of fit my personality and interests (cars/computers). Here is basically how the last decade+ of my life has been:

**Work Experience:**

I started as a temp building police radios for Motorola. Then was moved to a warehouse employee because I assembled shit too quickly for the assembly line to keep up with, lol. After that company, I then moved to another company as a customer service rep in Ocean containers, then became the dispatch manager/customer service manager for that company for a couple years. I literally ran this company, it was a small one. I even did their accounting. After I left that company, I wanted to get more experience in the industry so I took a job at an Airfreight/LTL trucking company for a few years, and was a dispatcher there.  I left that company and joined a trucking company that worked in Tradeshows. I became the tradeshow coordinator for huge tradeshows at America's largest convention centers and was very good at it because I'm anal and detail oriented and think/plan according to what could go wrong before it does go wrong. I say this with confidence that I don't believe they will ever beat my records for the shows that I did. I made them a ton of money with the contracts I got for them. COVID happened and that was that. Since COVID, I have been a driver, doing Courier work.  I think it's safe to say I really know what I'm doing in the logistics world and have faced just about any problem you could imagine and resolved it.  At every single one of these company's, I was the ""Go-To"" guy whenever big problems needed addressing/resolving. I've got perfect ratings as a courier too. 

Outside of actual work experience, growing up poor I have always fixed my own cars, home problems, computer problems, and am tech savvy. If you've ever watched the movie ""Joy,"" what her life was like, is what my life has been since I graduated high school.

**What I need help with:**

The problem with this industry is that it has never paid me well. The pay was always just *barely* past ""surviving,"" where I live. I never got paid on commission, only hourly/salary, and never over 50k a year, with all that experience.

**One side of me wants to leave the industry entirely and give up on it because company's don't pay. But at the same time, I know that there** ***are*** **people who make a decent living off this. I just don't know what angle I should pursue next. I have always pursued further education/experience in the industry, and now I'm at a point where it's like the knowledge I've gained in my time here, is transferable amongst other angles of the field. Like for example I could easily slide into a company that delivers cars, or produce. I haven't necessarily done that before, but the previous knowledge will easily transfer is my point. I've dipped my feet into everything.**

Working in this industry with limited vacations and barely taking days off has started to take a toll on me and I'm getting burnt out. I really don't know which approach to take next. My reasons for leaving companies was ***always*** pay. They would make promises that they'd increase my pay in the beginning and always give excuses as to why they can't pay more in the end. Frankly I'm tired of it. I'm tired of knowing more than my bosses, and being better at their jobs than they are (from a leadership standpoint too). I'm not trying to be arrogant but it's actually the truth. When I leave companies, they start getting negative ratings. It's because I try to do best for the customer and my colleagues, which I've found to be rare in this industry. 

So my reason for this post is, if you were me, what would you do next? Please consider that I have been in this industry for years, barely surviving (no savings), and cannot afford to go to school to pursue further education.  I am doing courier work now, and still barely surviving. 

Any help would be appreciated. 

If you are a recruiter please do not DM me and spare me with any advertisements. Being that it's on reddit, I automatically don't trust it lol, so do me a solid.",citamlli1,2,1.0,0,1710050178,2024-03-10 05:56:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bb321v/whats_next_for_me_in_the_logistics_world_after/,3,2024

1bayzek,Job offer advice,"Hello all, thanks for reading this! I graduated from my university with a masters in data analytics roughly 2 months ago. Currently the job market for data jobs has been tough so I had to expand my options into different career paths.

After my graduation and lots of emails stating I wasn’t qualified enough to get an hr interview, I ended up getting compTIA’s security +. In my schooling I learned a lot of related information and so I’ve been able to pick it up pretty easily. From all of this I have really started enjoying cyber security and can really see myself enjoying this career path. The growth and different options in these types of roles is phenomenal.

This is my predicament, I recently got a fantastic job offer for an internal audit position. I initially applied for fun and to expand my options, but I really enjoyed interviewing and can see myself doing well in the position. The pay is fantastic, I really enjoyed the team members I met, and overall the company and employees seem to really enjoy their work. However, even though I’m confident I’ll do a good job, I don’t know how much I’ll actually enjoy it in the sense of passion. But this role would give me great exposure to other industries and be a good stepping stone for most business roles.

I am currently also interviewing for a cyber security analyst position as well. I’m on interview 3 out of 4 and can really see myself enjoying this position. My passion for cyber security is definitely there and I can see myself really striving to be great and continuously improving myself in the role. However, a big downside of the role is the pay. This position would require me to take around a 25k pay cut. I can still easily afford rent but it will make budgeting much more important while in the other role I’d have much more disposable income. But this role has the potential to open many doors for me and I think my background can come in handy down the line. Would love to get into pen testing or security engineering.

A big note is that in cyber security if I stick with it for 3+ years it looks like I’d have the potential to make much more than the internal auditor in the long run. I also should finish the cyber interview process before the other role’s start date.

So this is my question for y’all, what would you do? I’ve came up with three options so far. 

Decline the job offer, hope i get the cyber role, and if not just keep trying (I’m in no rush). 

Take the higher paying job and later on get back into cyber if I’m still interested or just work in a related business role.

Or, hedge with my current offer and take cyber if I get it. I’m kind of leaning away from this option since I don’t want to disrespect the comp and burn bridges but.

If you made it this far, thank you so much! Any advice is appreciated!!

1bayl16,"Can't land a job, suggestions requested","Hi all,  
  
To make a long story short, due to decisions I made (related to education and work, not personal) and bad luck, I have a sizable resume gap. Specifically, my last job ended 4 years ago this week. I have spent over 2 years interviewing for jobs (I took time off due to the pandemic which was why I resigned my most recent role since it was business-to-business).  
  
I have had my resume professionally reviewed and made edits accordingly. I would say my interview skills vary. I'd give myself a B+ overall. I recently changed my cover letter to be more personalized. Originally, I was applying to jobs in marketing, now I've expanded to sales, HR, insurance, and administrative roles. I've even started applying to roles that are boring just to have something. By boring I mean customer service and the like.  
  
The point that I am trying to make is that I have changed my search in terms of the fields and location, have gotten professional feedback on my resume, have gotten feedback in terms of my answers to FAQs, and I apply to an average of 10 roles, 5 days a week. Still, no dice.  
  
So I'm trying to figure out some fields I should consider that allow for one to almost run their own business. I have considered becoming an independent recruiter, but am not sure how to go about it exactly. Real Estate is also a possibility, though commerical seems more interesting and suited to my skills than residential.  
  
I would say my strengths are communications, active listening, customer service, analyzing information, and forging professional relationships. My past roles have entailed some or all of this. My weaknesses include math, excessive physical labor due to a bad arm, and some technology although I'm always willing to learn.  
  
Any suggestions? Thank you.",CNBCViewer92,6,1.0,10,1710035552,2024-03-10 01:52:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bayl16/cant_land_a_job_suggestions_requested/,3,2024

1baxdm0,"Given I get this offer, what would be a reasonable salary to negotiate?","Okay, so right now I make 87k after a midyear adjustment, after starting at 84k last year. However, last year we received a letter about our market value, which for me said I should be worth 96,662. This was when I was still making 84k. Essentially, I'm undervalued 15% below market value for my role. That means if I had started out at my true market value, I'd be making 100k right now.

Another thing to note is that we're supposed to receive our raise this month retroactive to January, and this should be anywhere from 2.5-5% based on what I heard last year. So assuming I get the same adjustment as I did mid year last year, I'll be making 90k (although if I were at market value I'd be making nearly 104k).

Needless to say this has been bumming me out but I recently found a role in my company with a range of 92-119k. It's a slightly different role, but close enough that I feel I could negotiate on the higher end given my experience and market value. I'm really hoping my company wouldn't lowball me, especially since I'm 15% under where I should be right now, but my thought is 110k.

1bax64a,How do you discuss with your manager the fact that an employee is being bullied?,"I don’t quite know how to word this. I work in a really small team. I joined over a year ago and it has been clear to me that one employee in particular has been deliberately ostracised, talked about behind their back (heard almost daily) and belittled for things that no one else is, this includes being told off for things that I for example would be told “it’s fine don’t worry”. I have also heard my manager bitching about them.

I know from discussing with another co-worker that this colleague is simply disliked, and honestly I feel really bad for them because they seem to do their job well and seem a very nice person to me.

This is something that really bothers me. I am actually leaving this company soon and I would really like to bring up this bullying with the manager (who I know also dislikes this employee), but what can I say that doesn’t sound bad? It is bad, and I really don’t know how to word it, or if I should say anything at all. I just feel so bad for this employee who has clearly been singled out.

I’m just three classes away from completing my bachelor’s degree. Since last semester, I’ve been requesting my supervisor and manager for an accommodating schedule to attend my final semester, as there’s a scheduling conflict with my work hours and the last two classes I need. However, they kept denying it. At one point, my manager even suggested transferring to a different school. However, my director has an open-door policy, so I booked an appointment with him to discuss the situation, and he approved it after I provided the necessary information. HR also confirmed it’s fine. However, since then, my manager has been acting petty towards me. When they found out it was approved, he said, “You got what you wanted.” Now, every action I take gets scrutinized, and when I call out sick, he replies with, “You’re not within two hours.” Other employees have told me they don’t face this kind of pushback. My manager expects me to go above and beyond, which I’m not always willing to do. Am I the only one facing this issue, or is my manager being unfair? I have also started looking for another job.

From the beginning, I've always charted my own path, unafraid to deviate from the norm. Despite facing significant challenges, including the loss of my parents at a young age and struggles with self-doubt, I've remained true to myself and my passions.

Technology has been my constant love affair, from tinkering with computers to immersing myself in the latest tech. However, my career journey has been anything but straightforward. I've dabbled in various fields, including commerce and animation, and even found success as a photo editor, albeit without much interest.

Now, im 29, I find myself questioning the future of my career, particularly with the advancement of AI and the potential impact on my field. I'm unsure if I've made the right choices and worry about being stuck in a dying industry (as a photo editor).

I'm turning to you, fellow Redditors, for advice, support, and perhaps a guiding light. Have any of you faced similar challenges? How did you pivot your career or adapt to changing circumstances?

1bau7am,How to manage role change/comp expectations?,"I took a job late last year for a bit of a relatively lower salary than previous employers I had worked for (given I was coming out of startup which was low salary +equity) but I took the role given the company and flexibility of remaining abroad. The idea was I would come in as an individual contributor to help stabilize some areas at that compensation with the idea that I could make a case for becoming a partner and getting all the benefits of that (equity/bonus) in time as I would most likely transition to a new role after I onboarded and help stand up some order. Well now, after 3 months they want to move me to a manager position. All others in these positions are also partners and are on a higher band (since we have set salaries across roles)and  I would obviously be taking on more responsibility. This happened rather suddenly and my manager made it seem like they’d like for it to happen this month. I like the company and enjoy the teams but know this new role will be a more stressful one with more time needed.

How do I inquire about becoming a partner with this change while still not coming across as greedy? What are the counters I may face as to why they won’t change that despite role change… I ’m worried they’re going to take the route of “well prove yourself in this position then we can talk” or “we don’t change comp off cycle” any advice or guidance for me?

1battsa,Stay at company in a different role or move on after only 6 months?,"TLDR: current team is borderline toxic but the company seems good. Is it worth sticking around while looking for a new role within the company? 

I’m grateful to be employed after a layoff last year; however, in my new role over the last 5 months I’ve learned more about how my department operates and it’s a mess. Lack of process, structure, communication, and the list goes on. They want to improve and I want to help but their practices and priorities completely contradict what they (managers) tell me. 

I believe this is a problem with the site I work at because it was acquired so formerly operated independently, and I’ve been told by colleagues the culture varies from site to site. 

I’ve only been here coming up on 6 months. I am open to other opportunities within the company but I would be a significant move and I would prefer that my current manager didn’t know. On the other hand, I’m mentally prepared to just move on but leaving after 6 months will be a red flag to future employers though my job history will show I’m not a chronic job hopper—this would be my first.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2018 and co-founded a startup with my partner. The startup was successful and generated enough revenue to sustain my life during those years. However, most of the work was automatic, so I didn't have to do much. Recently, I completed my Master's degree from 2022-2023, and now I am wondering how I can showcase my experience on my resume.  
  
The problem is that our startup wasn't registered, so the only evidence I have is server bills, screenshots of analytics, and Google Analytics traffic. Should I just add myself as a co-founder and proceed with that, or should I only mention the roles that I am applying for? Also, how can I go through a background check with this information?

One of his coworkers had his review the other day and was asked if he planned on doing the IRA... because if he planned on doing the IRA, he wouldn't be eligible for raises to his hourly rate going forward. Also, no one else was supposed to know this information about the cap. Which is also super shady because this one coworker is the only one who would have his review before the paperwork was handed in. 

I know this isn't illegal.... but still... am I crazy for thinking this is not only shady AF but also unfair to them in the long run?

1basn33,Do you consider IT a trade?,"This is an offshoot of a comment on another thread.

What do you consider to be a trade? There are two common definitions that I know of:

Skilled work that doesn't require a bachelor's degree but generally requires some industry specific certification or licensing instead

Skilled manual labor positions specifically.

As such, IT is only a trade in the first and not in the second.

Although I supposes there's still room for a bit of debate on whether IT is just plain white collar. Anecdotally, I specifically chose IT because I didn't need school to find success, and I've never seen a degree weighed more than certifications when it comes to IT people.

1bars8x,Turning down internal offer of a 2% raise?,"I work for a massive company in finance. I am passionate about data analytics. My current role is a combination of finance and data and was a great opp to get my foot in the door at a company I’ve always wanted to work for. With the goal to transition into a full data role. The company has a growing analytics department

I interviewed for and received an offer in a new dept. And while it is not in the analytics department, it is an analytics role. It is described as an analytics role and compared to that of being in the actual analytics dept. And it has the same responsibilities, work, and required skillset. The team has also worked in the analytics department/has the same background

I talked with the hiring manager and he extended the offer. But lo and behold it was for a 2% raise (~89k to 91k). It was pretty disappointing, but i was enthusiastic and grateful and I asked for the weekend to think things over. This is a role I want on a great team

It is indeed a “lateral” move in that the grade level is the same. However, my peers of the same grade level in the analytics dept - doing the same work, having the same skillset, etc make 105-110k. I know this since I am the finance person for this dept, plus have friends there who share their salaries openly

Am I wrong to ask for this range? And to turn down the offer if i do not get it? I would accept 100k at a minimum. HR is trying to save money as is their job, and to them it is indeed just a lateral move. I do not want to get started off on the wrong foot with the manager and would rather speak to HR directly and lay out my case

I feel uncomfortable rejecting it and do not want to look bad. I do like my current team/manager and am fine waiting for another opportunity that I think is fair. I’ve been killing it lately and feel masterful over all of my work but I do want to fully leave finance long-term

I know I will be resentful and frustrated for the next 2 or so years if I do accept the current offer that is basically not making my more for a much more technical skillset",wastew,6,1.0,31,1710017273,2024-03-09 20:47:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bars8x/turning_down_internal_offer_of_a_2_raise/,3,2024

1baqmxv,Is a subpar EOY review fair when quarterly reviews were good?,"*\*\*For context, my role has been highly ambiguous, where my exact role/responsibilities has remained unclear pretty much the whole time I've worked here. I have received feedback that my ability to operate in ambiguous spaces has actually been a* ***good*** *thing, as the company goes through a major transformation\*\** 

For Q1 - Q3 2023, I have consistently been at  ***Meets Expectations*** for the employer I've worked for, for almost 2 years. I have never had any disciplinary or corrective actions. For this specific year's review (2023), Q1, Q2, and Q3 all had performance ratings of ***Meets Expectations***, with mostly positive feedback and encouragement to continue working how I do (with minor adjustments, but nothing earth shattering). 

I am a bit confused, as my 2023 EOY review (which I believe includes all quarters in 2023, not just Q4 2023), I was rated at a ***Meets*** ***Some*** ***Expectations***, which suggests that I am not meeting all expectations. I was honestly not expecting this, and during the review, I asked if this meant that I was in the ""red zone"", or not doing well. My manager didn't say I wasn't doing well, and admitted that my role not having clear expectations was something. (So I'm paying the price for my role not being clear?)...

**1st Question:** My company has announced that it did not meet its financial goals. Is my company intentionally rating me (and others) sub-par, to not give me my whole bonus (which was close to $20K, which I only am going to be seeing a few thousand from now, with this rating)?

**2nd Question:** Is it standard, (or fair) for an EOY review to have a ***Meets Some Expectations****,* when all the quarters in the year were ***Meets Expectations***? 

**3rd Question:** I had 2 development actions mentioned in my review. One of them was how I delivered one of my projects back in Q1/Q2. If this was a development action back then, shouldn't this has been brought up then? The second was a suggestion to get more involved in different types of work (which hadn't been mentioned to me until the review, essentially, and was never brought up). To my knowledge before this review, I was performing as expected. Are these development actions fair, when one of them wasn't communicated timely, and the other was a suggestion on what I should be doing, which was never communicated? 

I am generally feeling like the lack of role clarity is contributing to this, which has kept me mostly frustrated both from a ""what should I be doing today"", and a concern for my ability to meet my performance expectations. I am mostly concerned that with this rating, this positions me for the company to exit me, which is the absolute worst fear.

Any and all thoughts are welcome here. Thank you! ",Fantastic_Cherry_827,1,1.0,1,1710014403,2024-03-09 20:00:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1baqmxv/is_a_subpar_eoy_review_fair_when_quarterly/,3,2024

I’ve taken it up with the manager and nothing’s changed. I’ve been applying to jobs left and right in the meantime with no luck. But I’m at my breaking point.

1banaoc,Should I quit now?,"I recently took a job a start-up. The position is a step down for me but I took it welcoming a break from management etc. 

I am part of a creative services department and was hired to help the internal marketing team write papers and reports. This marketing team makes up data. I tried flagging it for my managers since I did not want to take responsibility for it should they get caught. It got escalated to the client but it hasn't stopped, and this has contributed to a bad dynamic. 

It's been a month and I fear getting my hands dirty with this kind of work. I've documented everything so far but it's not a great way to work.

Should I quit now since I'm only a month in? I fear that I'm in a damned if I do, damned if I don't situation with this job.

1bamukl,Would it ever be an option for me to find a corporate job in nyc?,"I graduated from Acadia University in Canada last year with a bachelor of science degree majoring in nutrition and minoring in chemistry. I completed a fellowship program through Fulbright for the last semester of my undergraduate degree where I was able to live in the USA and work for various sports teams while in school. I learned (maybe too late but I blame this on covid) that I didn’t want to work in the hospital, and I love sports, so sports nutrition seemed like a logical path. But, I also learned that I hate food service and sports nutrition is very heavy on the food service/prep side of things. 

This past fall (post grad) I was supposed to start an MSc. In exercise physiology and nutrition, but decided against starting my research because my heart was not in it. I decided instead to move to nyc to try to find some areas of interest and explore different options. I came here as an au pair with a j-1 visa and was volunteering for various sports teams in my free time (which I have lots of with this job) to have things to add to my resume even if I was hesitant on the sports nutrition route. 

I recently had someone tell me (who knows me very well) that they thought I should look into work in finance and that they thought that my personality was very well suited to this field. They said something more front-of-office/interpersonal relations type of situation, but that they think my calmness, motivation, and communication skills would be an asset in this type of setting. 

I have been studying for the lsat because I was planning on applying to law school both here in New York and in Canada. But this has got me thinking about whether law is where I should be focusing my attention, or if it is even a feasible goal for me to find work in finance or even consulting. If I could find a job instead of going back to school I would prefer this, however I know this is unlikely as I am from Canada. 

Just looking for thoughts and opinions on where I am right now and where it makes the most sense to focus my attention. I am living in nyc and love it so so much, and would love to stay and work a full-time, well paying job here. I could see myself enjoying a corporate job but seeing as I have a science undergrad, no corporate experience and am from Canada- is this possible at all? And if so, how should I go about this. Even if anyone has any ideas about where I can gain experience as I will work for free to build my resume. Thanks so much for even reading this far!

1bamd2l,Feeling left out in the team,"Career progression

Concerns on career progression in the team

I accepted an offer of Senior SWE in a company, with pay grade change and some increase in salary package. 
While working in the team, although my manager did not raise any concerns to me about my performance so far and I am getting some feedbacks that I am picking up things fast, I felt a bit worried because as things goes, I noticed that I am always being left out from the discussions on opportunities such as new projects, team innovation activities and important tasks or roles to take on.

 I am not sure if I am overly sensitive, but sometimes my team lead will jokingly talk about how am I being selected in the first place. I am eager to take on more responsibilities as I felt that I wanted to integrate faster into the team and also more learnings plus job satisfaction, but sometimes I am being  blocked from engaging the stakeholders because we have another peer (which is a good friend of theirs) that joined earlier than me, that he should always be the point of reference, and I should wait for his replies instead of directly getting instant feedbacks from the stakeholders. Also the peer is getting all the opportunities I mentioned above, while I am being bypassed on the discussion amongst them multiple times. I think I am able to contribute more but there are always certain level of non-transparency in decision making, and I feel I am not going to expand my role here no matter how hard I work.

I am concerned, feeling left out and at the same time felt that my path and progression here is being hampered by office politics, appreciate if you could share your thoughts and POV on this scenario.",NoOutlandishness8271,2,1.0,4,1710003638,2024-03-09 17:00:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bamd2l/feeling_left_out_in_the_team/,3,2024
1bambof,Can't find fulfillment,"I'm 15 years into my career and I can't seem to find anything that brings me fulfillment like earlier.

I started my career as a nuclear engineer and after 4 years became bored due to the red tape of the industry squashing creativity. Started teaching myself 3D modeling in inventor. 

I took a job as a design engineer doing gyroscopic navigation. I went from associate, to lead, to senior, to manager in 5 years. But after 2 or 3 years I was just mailing it in and was bored again. 

I left and went to a company to design unmanned vehicles. This company used solidworks, so at least I'd get to learn a new software. But, literally 6 months into the job, I had mastered it. I got promoted to senior systems engineer but that was basically just a title for what I was already doing. I was bored a shit again... 

There was an internal opening for a Program Manager position that I interviewed for and got. Completely different type of job will all new challenges. I was really excited. 

I officially turned over the first week of January and I'm already able to do this job effectively in probably 8 hours a week. The company I work for is old school and requires 40 hour work weeks. I'm already not challenged and bored. 

What the hell do I do? I have a family and am the primary income so I can't just quit to go find myself or whatever. My therapist told me to start taking online courses at work during the day. 

My boss told me I'm on the short list for a Director position, but I have no confidence this will scratch the itch either.

I currently live at home and am saving up and hope to quit this job, move out of state, and get a pay raise before the end of the year. I am also considering looking into grad school (not sure exactly what yet but am looking at marketing, something healthcare related, law related, or advertising) in a few years (money wouldn’t be an issue for this) if my career or salary isn’t panning out in the way I want it too.

I have the worst imposter syndrome and work anxiety in my current position. I feel like I’m totally under qualified and not good at my job and make way too many mistakes. my boss is super nice but wish I could know what she really thinks of me, because personally I don’t think I’m worth the money and wouldn’t invest anything in myself but I’m also really insecure 🥲🥲

I want to hear from others who have graduated recently (or even a while back) and how others are doing.

1balbvo,Should I switch industries or look for a better company structure?,"I(25M) am looking for some advice on my current career situation. I have been an operational manager for a propane company for about a year now. This job consists of managing 4 locations(2 with employees and 2 unmanned stock tanks yards). I manage 10 drivers, 2 service technicians and 2 “yard helpers”. My daily duties consist of vehicle compliance/maintenance, all yard/employee related paperwork and managing the team. I have been pretty successful in this role recently getting a bump from 75k to 85k. Overall I enjoy the role but am not interested in still being in this role passed 4-5 years. 
My issue with the role is mainly the Pto situation and the on call system. First there is no Pto structure here, if I want to take off I can take off but no one will cover for me. The 4 days I have taken in the last year have consisted of me receiving work calls the entire day. I’m Not talking 1-2 I’m talking 30+. This is basically the same with my boss.  My wife and I want to start a family soon and I don’t want to be harassed when I need to take a day off. From what I can see this situation does not get better until you leave the operations side of the company. Next I am not a fan of the on call system. Since we are a gas company we have leaks/emergency’s. I am on call once every 5 weeks but even when I’m not on call I still get calls at all hours for mostly pointless stuff. 
So there is the situation, the questions I have for y’all are:
1. In your experience are all operations management roles like this? If not what field have you experienced?
2. Are all propane companies like this? I work for one of the top 3 companies and have been curious about smaller companies. 
3. Lastly does it seem like I am being underpaid? I cant seem to figure out what a role like this should garner.

1baiauy,Received a job offer 10% above what I asked for but recruiter hinted that the salary can be negotiated.,"I’m quite confused and would love to hear your thoughts.

After two months, I finally received an offer from a company that exceeded my expectations. The benefits are great and the pay is 10% above my request, which I thought was above market rate based on my research and multiple contacts in the industry. I have a good feeling about the position and the company. 

After the recruiter finished explaining the benefits, she asked me if I had any questions. We talked about benefits, and then she asked if I had any questions specifically about salary. I told her that I didn’t have any and that the numbers were clear. She took it as an acceptance and wanted to know if I could start on x date.

I asked if there was a deadline and told her that I’d love some time to think because I’m waiting to hear back from another company and that although the compensation package is competitive, I would like to compare my options. Here’s the confusing part: she replied that I should let her know the details of the other offer because even though what she’s offering is great, she feels that her company’s salaries can sometimes be on the lower end. 

I’ve doubled checked and it truly doesn’t seem to be the case, unless the position is more senior than what its name implies. It almost sounds like she’s inviting me to negotiate. The problem is that I don’t have any leverage to do so unless I receive a more competitive offer from the other company. This is actually a possibility, since it’s for a more senior position but I’m not that excited about the company itself.

Ideally, I get a higher offer from the second company and use that to negotiate. If I don’t, should I negotiate anyway?

1bah5vc,"Is stepping down into a new role a good next move, or is this just the burnout talking?","I appreciate anyone who reads this and can offer any advice. I'm at a decision point and I thought writing down my thoughts and seeking the guidance of others might just help, so here goes:  
I'm mid-30s and currently contemplating leaving my job for another, not the most unusual post, but I want to make the right choice and there's some obvious compelling reasons for but also some doubts in my mind. Here's my current situation:  
• Currently in a technical management position and I've worked in my current company for around 7 years. This company is in a sector which is increasingly becoming in demand so I have as close as possible to job security assurance.  
• The sector also pays very well (not exactly finance level well, but certainly a salary that affords financial security), but there aren't too many sites around the country which are in this sector and they tend to be in far away remote places.  
• It's my first management position and I've enjoyed the leadership aspect of building and leading a team (though good employees are great and difficult employees do make days hard sometimes).  
• I started developing my team in the company around 4 years ago, and because I was the only person in the company to have my prior experience in the niche skill they needed, I had the opportunity to take on a lot of work and responsibility very quickly which has gained me a lot of experience.  
• I have since moved up to overall manager of the department but because it's a niche skillset, I have a relatively inexperienced team. I also work on a major project for the business at a time where the business really needs to be able to deliver, so I've effectively been unable to backfill myself and I'm now doing work about 3 levels deep into my team.  
• This has had a major impact on my energy and mental health - I'm working long hours, weekends, always switched on and always feeling responsible. I haven't properly rested since I took this on 4 years ago. Until recently I used to relish having more responsibility, I was a workaholic I'll admit, but now I'm burned out and it's not easy to begin to resolve that by delegation because the team and the business have become reliant on me being there to keep everything going.  
• I also feel I’ve topped out my learning capacity in this role. I know what to do and how to do it so I’m no longer developing, but because the business needs me to keep the day-to-day going, I don’t have the opportunity to step into a more strategic ‘head of department’ role.  
• I’ve spoken to my manager who is sympathetic but also understands the business’ need for me to be there to keep the team and the project going. So, a year ago they offered me a retention bonus, and my pay rises and bonus have been higher than usual, effectively a ‘please don’t leave’ payment.  
• If I’m honest I also struggle to step back because I know things would drop, the team need the guidance and technical leadership, and the business would just see less progress at a critical time when it needs it. I’d see this as a failure on my part and unfair heat on the team.  
• Over the past 12 months I began daydreaming of retiring early, living the simple life and escaping the corporate rat race. This is escapism of course, but a nice benefit is that I’ve cut my living expenses right back and I’ve been saving as much as I can for early retirement (though I’m still 10 years away realistically).  
• The businesses is in a difficult place, can be bureaucratic, and is under a lot of pressure to deliver, so I can’t see my frustrations about the work environment changing much even in a new role.  
• This led me to start looking at where I place work in my life and consider taking a less stressful and time demanding job – the stress can get too much sometimes, it’s always busy, there’s always a fire burning somewhere and a project manager unhappy with progress. I have too much work for one person, or even realistically two people, and I never get to finish what I need to, hence working at the weekend to attempt to catch up, but this just makes me more tired.  
Recently I got into a bad place, from exhaustion and it coming up to my 5th year of working with this intensity, and I started to look for other roles.  
There’s a spin-off from my current company nearby, which is still in the early stages of a major project but seems to be ramping up. I happened to go on their careers site one day and saw a job which couldn’t have been more of a perfect fit for my experience! I was honestly surprised, it read just like the job spec I thought I was taking on when I stepped into my current role 4 years ago, but without all of the day-to-day delivery pressure which keeps me from doing what I actually want to do. Plus, it’s close by with a similar commute, which is rare in my industry.  
So, I applied. I didn’t want to assume I’d get it and start daydreaming, so I pushed it to the back of my mind, but I also know the experience I have is rare across the country and well sought after; that’s why most people doing my job are contracting and making 2-3x what I do but the downside is they work away from home all over the country.  
The hiring manager soon contacted me directly and said they would love to chat to me about the role. I also had a tip-off from the recruiter that they have been looking for someone for a year and haven’t been able to find the right match. I met with the HM and his enthusiasm for the job and company was honestly refreshing, there is also a healthy dose of work life balance. I’d get to work from home and there wouldn’t be the same delivery pressure. It’s a more strategic role and because the project is in an early phase, there isn’t much of a team yet either. The nice thing is I would get a clean page to create how my area of the project should be set up, I get to take all of my experience and apply it to something fresh and exciting and novel, re-sparking my excitement for my job again whilst being in an environment where there isn’t constant demand on my time, therefore allowing me to rest and recover for a while. The general conversation seemed more of a sales pitch to me about the role, rather than trying to gauge if I would be a good fit. This was after he saw my CV and I think based on my experience he was already pretty sold.  
Due to it technically being the same company I sat down with my manager to let him know I was going to apply. He was pretty disappointed about it, partly because he knows this will leave the company with a big skills gap in an area that they need which will be very hard to replace, but also because I’m a hard worker and we regularly talk about my potential to go far within the business. He also isn’t as familiar with my area and leans on me to manage everything and advise him where needed; I work pretty autonomously and I know he trusts that I’ll make the right decision and get things done. I know myself how thankful I am for people with the right work attitude in my team and I know how I would feel if they told me they were leaving. He’s very busy himself.  
I decided it was best to be open with him and explained the following:  
• The demands of my role (and the extra roles I do) are having a major impact on my life, my health, and my mental health. I used to brush off comments anytime anyone said I should be careful of burnout because I’d never actually been there – but here I am.  
• We have discussed previously about stepping into just my management role at the right point in the project, but that was always in a couple of months, and we are 18 months+ down the line.  
• Even if I do step back, I would do so and watch my team struggle, I would also see another major project starting up and see them struggle (it’s just that kind of work where there’s always issues and chaos). I know deep down I would always want to get involved, and so even if I did step back, I know it wouldn’t be for long.  
• This new role is a rare opportunity. These kinds of project like the one at the spin-off business are major and long, so if it’s not like another one would come along in the next few years, especially not being such a perfect fit, especially being so close to where I live and not a 4 hour commute away.  
• (I didn’t say this part but to add context) The new business is also a lot more of a lean, start-up type environment, with passionate people there who aren’t jaded by the bureaucracy of my current workplace and who aren’t comfy in roles and along for the ride. I do get frustrated watching people earn the same pay as me but who manage to avoid the work. The new company is on a fighting mission to get going and the energy there excites me.  
• I told him I felt that moving out for a while, properly cutting the ties to my current role, is the only realistic way I would give myself work life balance and not get pulled back in.  
• He knows I struggle with my workload and he’s been very supportive. He understood completely and even opened up to say how the business has such a high turnover for this reason.  
• He also said given my experience and how I come across, that it’s not really a question of if I’ll get the role (both he and I are quite sure it’s a safe bet I would be offered it) but just a question of if I’d want to take it.  
Since then he spoke to his manager about it (I’m fine with this) who now wants to speak to me. I know my performance and potential is highly regarded by seniors within the business and his manager said I would be a big loss to the company. He said his manager doesn’t want to convince me to stay in my role, because I think they both know that’s not right given how overworked I feel, but does want to speak to me about an opportunity coming up in the business in 6 months which would allow me to step back.  
I have an interview for this new job next week and also a discussion with my manager’s manager. It seems a no-brainer to go for this new role, but there’s a few things that I have doubts about and I’m a mix of emotions about them. One day I’ll be convinced that moving on is the right thing to do, and the next I’ll be convinced I’m making a risky and wrong move.  
So here’s the doubts:  
• The spin-off company is also in the same in-demand sector but what they are doing is novel and there is a risk it doesn’t become a viable business. I have a lot of job security in my current role which a very good salary so I do worry about the potential of redundancy at some point.  
• The role is also not a management position, I’m not too sure what it is, a technical specialist? It’s a company of only a few hundred people so their hierarchy is quite flat and I think I’m essentially taking a step down, reporting to the kind of manager I am now, I’m being hired for my technical expertise but I won’t have the same position within the business (a large team, a management title, and that always helps for future roles).  
• I used to be career driven and I think I’m less so now. This is probably the burnout speaking but probably some maturity kicking in too. I don’t feel the need to chase a job title or promotion and I’d rather do interesting work, nevertheless, I have worked hard to get the role I have now and in some way I feel that hard work and performance is recognised with a manger title – it just carries more weight, like when interfacing with new people. The new role title is ambiguous and I feel doesn’t represent the experience I’d be bringing to the role.  
• Part of my new role will be interfacing with external companies to establish this area of expertise within the business as a function they can deliver, to benchmark against industry best practice and strive for excellence, I’ll also be dealing with customers to convince them we can deliver that excellence in this field and win work. This is where I feel a job title is important. I want to ask about it but I also don’t want to come across petty in the interview, or overly concerned with job titles, so I don’t know if to just accept  
• Part of me also has a legacy hang-up about ‘stepping down’ and losing a title or position I worked hard for. I realise that sounds shallow as I type this, but I feel I wouldn’t be alone in feeling this way.  
• It’s a relatively small team for now while they build, which is great because it offers me a lot of opportunity to create and define, but it will be a gear-shift in how busy my days will be, or how needed I might feel relative to my current role, which has always given me a motivation.  
• I’ll be starting again, with reputation and workplace connections, and while that’s always the case and does offer some benefits, the project I’ve been on really fast-tracked my exposure to seniors within the business and I won’t have that same standing automatically somewhere else.  
• I’ll find it very difficult to leave my current role, as hard as it is, because on paper I really do love the job. I just have to accept that on paper and in reality are two different things and likely always will be. I also really appreciate my team.  
• This new role also wouldn’t be a pay rise, if anything it would probably be around 5% less, their job post pitched it 10% less but the recruiter knew they could be a little flexible for the right person. I don’t know this for sure though and I suppose is something to discuss in the interview. I was planning on just being honest about my current salary and asking if they can match that, but I’m also conscious that alone might price me out and I’m worried I’d lose the offer by going in too high.  
• I worry that after the burnout haze disappears, that I’ll find career motivation again, but that I might have shot myself in the foot by stepping down somewhat, or that I won’t have the same reputation to get me into higher positions again somewhere new and that I’ll have set myself back in position. I know several of the business seniors are keeping an eye on me and have thoughts about roles in the future (this is from my manager). Having said that, I know the burnout won’t just disappear if I stay in my current role, and I don’t want to become driven for a career in the future unless it’s more of a healthy balance.  
• I also worry if it goes wrong, and the business doesn’t work, that I’d end up having to go back to my current company and find a job – probably not as good fit – because it’s the only other place nearby in that sector and pays well, or relocate.  
So I just keep sitting on both sides of the fence – I want to make the right move but I don’t know how to feel. I’m going to hear my manager’s manager out about the role which might come up in 6 months, but there’s no guarantee and if I’m honest the idea of being able to leave everything behind sooner for a refreshed life is what is getting me through right now.  
Any advice would be very much welcomed. Thank you if you got this far, just typing out my thoughts has helped me understand how I feel and why – now I need to figure out whether to take a leap of faith, or step back from the ledge and not let my current emotions make a bad long-term decision.

1bah5ol,Should i quit my new job?,"Hey Reddit fam,  
New editor here! I just started in mid-February and landed a pretty sweet gig considering my experience.  
  
Here's the thing, I'm not a huge fan of the videos I'm editing. My dream was to break into film editing, not churn out YouTube or TikTok content. But hey, film is tough on newbies, so here I am.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I give it my all regardless of the project. I'm also trying to improve my workflow. But man, the burnout is real.  
  
We do sports news, and news, as you know, needs to be fast. It feels like I can't get creative because deadlines are always breathing down my neck. I'd love to take the time to make something great, but there just isn't any.  
  
Haven't had a single day off since I started, and it's been 8am to 8pm every day. Officially, hours are 8:30am to 5:30pm, but that's a joke. Writers and designers can leave on time, but our editing team always gets stuck finishing things up. It's not like I can work ahead – gotta wait for the writers to finish the script and the voiceover guy to do his thing before I can even start. And honestly, I don't see any changes coming from the boss on this.  
  
Look, I can handle the hours for a bit, but not every day. I just have zero personal life. Plus, I'm not even sure if this editing gig is helping me reach my film editing goals.  
  
So, Reddit fam, what do I do? Quitting feels like giving up too soon, but this constant deadline chase is burning me out.

1bagbcc,"Fired exactly 1 month after hire-""wasnt a good fit"". How can I improve for the future?.","Nothing pointed to there being any issues, even just 2 days ago my supervisor was giving me things for future work id be doing on my own starting next week. They told me today that i was very professional, but not a good fit for this role (not outspoken enough), and offered to mark this as a resignation or be given a different job within the company. Before i started working there, i saw a few warning signs like implied high turnover, the fact that the job is at will being stressed multiple times, and the fact that my supervisor would repeat the office was ""very tight knit/family oriented"", so im not too shocked i was fired. I was a little worried id stick out too much because im usually the odd one out in social settings, but i was bonding with my coworkers and supervisor in different ways so those fears went away.



Whats odd is I had already mentioned in my interview that i was working on being more assertive. i thought they wouldnt hire me based on my answer to that, but they did. ive been in supervisory roles and have several years of work experience in crisis management. people also commonly say im too blunt, direct, intimidating etc. they assured me back then in the interview that the role was mainly to communicate and educate, not be overly aggressive. After being hired i stayed on top of my trainings and started getting ahead, to which my supervisor and other coworkers advised that i pace myself with them and not to skip ahead or anything, just follow the way they were written. I listened to their advice and did what they said. My also supervisor made a schedule so that she could keep up with where i was at, and we had daily meetings where we discussed what i was learning and id always have field work relevant questions for these meetings as well.



Literally any time i wasnt specifically shadowing them, i was in training. I never said no to shadowing opportunities. I asked plenty of questions, helped when we were out, offered help with other tasks, etc. Theyd try to get me to admit the work was overwhelming or too much, but it really wasnt!! I was learning but felt fine when I shadowed. My supervisor got overwhelmed and lost patience more easily, it seemed. 



Obviously sometimes you really are just not a good fit for a job and it is what it is. Im less worried about the social aspect than i am about being a good worker. So my question is, how can i make sure my bases are covered productivity and work-wise for the reasons a supervisor would typically want to fire me? Was i supposed to ask what they needed help with before leaving each day?



I am willing to answer any questions, i understand it can come across a certain way when people post things like this.

1bag2nh,Does the idea of changing jobs and companies give anyone else debilitating anxiety?,"Does the thought of changing jobs give anyone else debilitating anxiety?

I am 31 years old. I have held my (only) full time job with the same company (3 different positions) for 10 years now. Though I have progressed significantly (hired in at $10/hr now make $22) I naturally have significantly more responsibility now. Which I’m not upset about. 

What I am upset about is that after the post covid labor shift, it would appear that I make very close to the same amount of money as the employees that we’ve retained who are completely incompetent. I understand that every work place will have these but at my current place of employment they get less responsibilities and seemingly almost equal pay. The responsibility to pay ratio no longer feels reasonable at $22 / hr. 

For reference I work within the office of a local contractor. I do payables, receivables and other various “accounting” type tasks. I was invited to apply for a local supplier of contractors or a “supply house” as we say. I have an interview on Monday. I have reason to believe that I may get an offer at $28 / hr for a front desk position. Selling parts over the counter, taking orders, and probably some warehouse labor when needed. I’m fairly well qualified, none of this description scares me outright. 

But the idea that my current employer is “safe” and my fear of possibly ending up unemployed feels borderline debilitating. It’s weighing on me heavily. I am going to go to the interview on Monday, if everything goes well there will likely be a job offer. Hopefully at $28/hr. This is over a 27% increase in what I currently make. Are job offers expected to be accepted or declined on site?

I think this is my brains way of dealing with the anxiety of major change.  On paper it sounds stupid to second guess a large pay increase. But there is value in the piece of mind knowing that I will likely never be let go from where I am. Even if I’m not satisfied with my pay rate and the responsibility distribution. 

TLDR: scared to leave comfortable job for a 27% pay increase. I’m being dumb right?",Synthyx,13,1.0,7,1709985280,2024-03-09 11:54:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1bag2nh/does_the_idea_of_changing_jobs_and_companies_give/,3,2024

1baf524,"Working 8.5 hours Monday thru Thursday and get each fourth Friday off as the hours are made up for. However, you have to submit your time card each week at the end of the week.

Here is where it gets confusing…
The office pays bi-weekly, but are subject to submit our timecards every end of the week. Why? I don’t know. That’s where fall in concern and questions starts coming up.

Here is the concern…
Let’s say if I were to work half day due to a doctor’s appointment one day and I want to make it that 4 hours, I can only be permitted to make up for that half day within the week of the progressing timecard. Not the week within the bi-weekly period, accordingly to the HR. Strange, because I know old firms runs pay periods bi-weekly where I can always substitute my hours within that two-week pay period flexibly and then submit accordingly per scheduled payroll. 

The HR said that if I were to make up my hours the following week, I have to put that under OT (I’m hourly). Which doesn’t make sense when it should make up for the previous week if that was when my half day happened and this is still within the bi-weekly period.

I recently got promoted 4 days ago as the new project manager of a digital marketing agency. I used to be their SEO specialist for almost 7 months and they really appreciate my work as an SEO.  
  
They like my reports, the way how I make and present my marketing strategies for the clients, roadmaps etc. etc. My boss always value my idea and allow me to work on my own decisions as an SEO specialist.  
  
In my previous position as an SEO, I know everything about the contents for the site, website design and navigation (mainly front-end), I do medium graphic design for the blogs, social media strategy, do press release and much more.  
  
Obviously, these are the reasons why he made me the company's new project manager. He offered me the promotion and asked me if I'd be willing to accept it. The reason why they hesitate to hire a new project manager is that they don't know the nature of clients. I basically know majority of our clients and I have foundation of who they are.  
  
NOW, I have zero experience of managing tasks, absolutely NOTHING! I'm 24, and my team mates are years older than me and they know everything about their tasks - of which I'm not. Everything is new to me!

1bab13h,Should I switch industries or look for a better company structure?,"
Hello everyone,
I(25M) am looking for some advice on my current career situation. I have been an operational manager for a propane company for about a year now. This job consists of managing 4 locations(2 with employees and 2 unmanned stock tanks yards). I manage 10 drivers, 2 service technicians and 2 “yard helpers”. My daily duties consist of vehicle compliance/maintenance, all yard/employee related paperwork and managing the team. I have been pretty successful in this role recently getting a bump from 75k to 85k. Overall I enjoy the role but am not interested in still being in this role passed 4-5 years. 
My issue with the role is mainly the Pto situation and the on call system. First there is no Pto structure here, if I want to take off I can take off but no one will cover for me. The 4 days I have taken in the last year have consisted of me receiving work calls the entire day. I’m Not talking 1-2 I’m talking 30+. This is basically the same with my boss.  My wife and I want to start a family soon and I don’t want to be harassed when I need to take a day off. From what I can see this situation does not get better until you leave the operations side of the company. Next I am not a fan of the on call system. Since we are a gas company we have leaks/emergency’s. I am on call once every 5 weeks but even when I’m not on call I still get calls at all hours for mostly pointless stuff. 
So there is the situation, the questions I have for y’all are:
1. In your experience are all operations management roles like this? If not what field have you experienced?
2. Are all propane companies like this? I work for one of the top 3 companies and have been curious about smaller companies. 
3. Lastly does it seem like I am being underpaid? I cant seem to figure out what a role like this should garner.

I am trying to determine what an appropriate amount of time is to start applying for jobs as I'll be applying to all healthcare/ hospital related jobs where the license is required. I will likely have my license in the 1st or 2nd week of June due to the time it takes to get my official transcript & degree conferred, then sent to the social work board and then issued.

So, if I would have my license in hand by let's say June 10th (give or take a week), how soon should I start applying?

I'm considering upskilling in the embedded domain and exploring side hustles to boost my income since my current salary isn't enough to support my family. I'd appreciate any advice on potential career pathways and suggestions for side hustles that align with my skills and interests.

However there was a family emergency that I need to go back to my home country to take care of my family and not sure when will I come back, so I quit my job. Now 5 months past, I am back and everything back home got taken care of and started looking for a new job again. The job market is bad and I really miss my old job and my team. I left on good terms with my managers and keep close contact with 2 of my colleagues. However My old position has been filled, should i text my manager and ask if I can come back/ anything open? Or just move on and find a new job?

1ba6464,Should I finish my bachelor’s or focus on certifications? ,"I'm reaching out for some guidance as I navigate my career path in talent acquisition. Here's a bit about my journey so far:

I didn't follow the traditional college route, but instead spent over a decade working in behavioral health services. I ended the career only making $50k / year.

In my late 30s, I made a career switch to a healthcare staffing agency, where I quickly excelled and became one of the top recruiters. I made $150k in 2023. 

I worked along side recent college graduates as the old guy on the team, but becoming the number one recruiter felt amazing.

Recently, I transitioned to an in-house corporate talent acquisition role for a large organization, and I'm thrilled to be part of such an amazing company. My base salary is $110k, something I never could have envisioned just 2 years ago.

I feel incredibly lucky, because I only have 2 years of recruiting experience! 

I am still in awe that this even happened. 

I've just started this new position five days ago, and I already see myself growing with this organization for the long haul.

I need career advice.

Should I prioritize completing my college degree, which I have two years left to finish, or focus on obtaining human resources certificates?

I'm eager to advance within the company and want to ensure I'm taking the right steps to do so.

I would greatly appreciate any insights, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share to help guide me on this journey. Thanks in advance for your wisdom and support!

I was a SAHM but I never wanted to be a SAH. I go nuts if I don't have any stimulation outside the house.

Just last year I went through 3 jobs: 1st one I quit because they demand a shift I work at instead of the one I wanted and were shady in how they operate in regards to how you take your breaks. Plus the 10 to 12 hours a day were a quick burnout.

The 2nd one lied about flexible schedule even tho their website literally says, ""work whatever schedule you want!""

And the 3rd one I had to quit because I was sharing a car with my spouse and it nearly broke down.

1ba5anf,How do I go from copywriter to content strategist? ,"There’s a major disconnect going on in my career. I’ve been a marketer for 10 years and fell into copywriting. I’ve mainly been a copywriter but I do have experience in content strategy and management working for smaller companies where I had to wear multiple hats and manage a team. 

I know this market is crazy right now for marketing roles but I can’t even land an interview for a content managing or strategy role. How am I ever supposed to level up? 

I’m currently a contractor writing for a tech company and I’m trying to weasel my way in and get more responsibility. They need someone to manage content because it’s like the Wild West right now.

1ba4g97,Applying for disability fell through…,"Tl;dr I’m someone in Florida with disabilities + knee surgeries that needs help applying for office/administrative/remote work, but I keep getting my applications denied. I have very little resources and I’m desperate.

I’m a 28 y/o male with Ehlers-Donlas Syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and for the last 10 months I was applying for disability. After an update from my lawyer, I can anticipate waiting another 1-2 years for my application to even get looked at. Being this long without health insurance, as well as all of my other bills, even with help of my family, I’m completely broke after this process.

I went to culinary school in college and enjoyed my job in the kitchen very much. It wasn’t a lot of money but I took pride in my work. It was genuinely fun, at least as fun as work can be. However, I got into an accident (not workplace related) and tore my ACL and needed knee surgery. Returning to work was hard, and only got harder. By the time I left the kitchen, I had lost a lot of weight and my health was in the dumpster. It was a hard decision, but applying for disability allowed my body to recover/get rest from my time working, and it probably saved my life.

However, I need to reenter the workforce and I cannot do kitchen work anymore. I’ve been applying to do office/ remote work but I haven’t heard back from a single place or get denied immediately after submitting my applications. I have 5+ years of experience as a hotel front desk, so I genuinely do have office skills like phones, emails, computers, etc., but it doesn’t seem to matter. I’ve been admittedly picky with choosing an employer, but health/dental insurance benefits are non-negotiable with me. I’ve done about 40-50 applications with no word back from any one.

I’m desperate and I don’t know what I need to be doing, but I’m on my last $400 and something needs to happen. Advice on my resume, where I need to look/apply, what I’m doing wrong, what these sorts of jobs are looking for, classes I could take to make my life easier etc. would be appreciated.

I applied to a new private school and got offered the position for the next year. The only problem is that due to lack of professional references, they have to contact my current employer. Unfortunately, I had no choice but to inform them. So I asked my vice principal if it was okay to list her as a reference and she said it was fine. 

Ever since then, however, she’s suddenly been making my job near impossible, and she even threatened me by saying, “I won’t be able to help you out with a reference if you don’t shape up.” I’m paraphrasing a bit but that was the sum of it. She micromanages like crazy and even texts me at odd hours to nitpick what I’m doing in the classroom. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it’s really starting to come off like she doesn’t like that I might be leaving.

1ba1mlg,New Role Not a Fit 9 Months In,"I am an attorney with 15 years of diverse experience in both litigation and transactional (private practice, federal, state government) I started in a new role about 9 months ago, in a new practice area after relocating to a different state. Just prior I had been in private practice at a small firm. 

When I got this position, I was excited because it’s an emerging area of law, I wanted to be at a bigger firm than my last one, and the firm appeared to have a good reputation based on my research. 

I spent the first 6 months giving the firm the benefit of the doubt, attributing the challenges to adjusting to the new role and environment.  

But I have now come to the realization that it’s the job, not me. 

The legal work itself is easy and I can tell that I am not being challenged enough. 99% of my time is spent working for a singular client with very specific procedures and protocols that take up more of my day than the actual substantive work. I don’t have adequate paralegal or admin support so most days I’m drowning in filing or other admin. When I do get help, work quality is poor and deadlines missed, so I end up doing the work myself. I don’t feel like I have done anything of value yet. 

But my biggest problem is that the environment is toxic. The team is dysfunctional with people constantly throwing others under the bus, managers putting people on blast in meetings or via email for “mistakes” (usually due to lack of training or communication by management). Management is not approachable, and most people work remotely and hide behind passive aggressive email. This is a hybrid office, but most people just disregard that and do what they want, so while I’m in the office no one else is. 

l come home from work drained, exhausted, not wanting to socialize or do the things I normally enjoy. I thought I was having health issues but have now realized it’s related to the job. 

I am not in the position to quit without something else lined up but I am not sure where to start looking or how to explain why I’m looking for something so soon. Im no stranger to challenging or demanding positions but this experience has been really demoralizing. Kind advice appreciated.

1b9zfsx,Offered all the responsibilities of a higher role but not the title & pay,"My boss is getting promoted and wants me to take his old role, which he will soon be vacating. The new role would meant that I would go from managing 2 different functions to 6 and this role always has a very clear title that is standard in all businesses (like CFO/CRO, etc.). 

However, while he wants me to take over all the associated responsibilities, the board does not want to give me the title or official promotion in job levels. Apparently some of the board members, think the company should evaluate hiring someone from the outside with more experience, rather than promote and develop from within. Also, these board members think they should run an external search to see if they can find a better candidate, in which case they would allow me to go through the process while in the meantime I would have the role on an interim basis. 

I have seen interim exec positions become permeant, but more frequently I feel like in these situations the internal interim leader is just being used as a placeholder and is allowed to go through the motions of interviewing so they feel like they have a shot but in reality they really don't. So, while the experience would be great, even on a temporary basis, I'm inclined to respond with if they run the external search, that I take the job and give it my all on an interim basis, but I would also start looking for new opportunities as I don't see this as the company investing in me (so why should I invest in them). Is this fair, or is this career suicide?

I would be ok, to take the role on an interim basis if they agree to not run a search and let me do the job for a set amount of time with agreed objectives and if I achieve them, they give me the formal title and promotion. But I want to tell them that if they run the search, I'm basically out as this would signal that I have reached the limit of my career development opportunities at this company.

1b9yjk2,Should I take this Management Position?  (Pay vs Passion),"Hey all, I (26M) have been in the grocery industry since I was a sophomore in highschool (2014)  so about 10 years now.  I worked my way up from a grocery clerk to a Frozen Dept.Manager to Dairy/Frozen Manager over the course of just a few years until my store was unfortunately sold and shut down.  I worked a year in a grocery warehouse as a pallet picker until I learned that a new grocery store was opening near me.  I applied and was thrilled to see that it was my old Manager from my original store who would be running this new one.  He instantly hired me, but it was for a Dairy/Frozen Clerk, not a Manager, because they had a 40 year grocery vet filling that role, and my one other new coworker was also a Dairy/Frozen Manager at his last job meaning my entire department was made up of previous Department Managers.  Fast forward 2 years and my Dept.Manager was promoted to Assistant Store Manager, leaving the Department Lead position open.  Needless to say me and my co-worker (Now my best friend after working together since the store opened) both applied for the position, and after almost a week of interviews and waiting it was decided that he would receive the promotion, not me due to him having managment experience from multiple departments in the past and not just Dairy/Frozen.  We went out for drinks to celebrate and made sure we were both cool with the new situation and not harboring any bad feelings about how it turned out.  Fast forward a couple weeks and I learned that my store is hiring for a Front End Manager position which would come with a 3 dollar per hour raise bumping me from 21 per hour to 24 per hour and eventually 26 per hour after two more years.  Upper management is pushing me very hard to apply for the position, implying that they want me to have it and would rather not post the job publicly.  I was even approached by two of the other front end Managers asking me if I'd be interested in the position and trying very hard to convince me to take it.  I feel very conflicted because all I've ever known is Dairy/Frozen.  I always imagined myself being a Manager in that department for my entire career, but now that my co-worker got it I won't have the opportunity to move up for several years at the earliest.  Should I take the Front End Management job that pays much more but I'm not as familiar or passionate about? Or should I stay in my current position and just do what I'm familiar with for less? I think I know in my heart that the right answer is to take the promotion, not only because of the massive pay raise, but it would also diversify my resume so I could potentially earn a Dairy/Frozen Manager job in the future when we expand to another new location.  Does anyone have any advice or experience with a similar situation? I only have one night to think about it before they post the job to the public.  This is a major life decision for me and I would really appreciate insight from others.

1b9yevg,Going Back to School,"Hi all, 

I'm looking for some advice/tips/comments on my situation. 

I'm in my mid 20's going back to school from the ground up. After high school, I went straight into the work force, got a couple of good jobs since then and have mostly been self taught. In that timeframe, I also met my wife, and we have one son, about 3 yrs old now. 

However, within the last year or so I decided I was going to go back to school to get my PHD in physics. I've always liked to discover and learn things, and enjoy science and math so this isn't new for me. However, my experiences in the workforce are primarily in electrical/manufacturing trades, IT, engineering, and management. While I have always had positive experiences with my interviews, I get asked very often about not seeming like I know what I want to do, and it's making it harder to get jobs. I've always stayed at my previous jobs anywhere from 1-5 years. 

Am I crazy for exploring so many different fields? I don't usually agree with jobs that are always looking for a lifer, but the question is brought up enough that I'm starting to doubt my decisions. This next year, I will be moving for school and will need to change jobs once again. 

How can I better explain my situation to recruiters an turn it into a strength instead of a flaw. Any extra advice?",Prix5700XT,1,1.0,0,1709929918,2024-03-08 20:31:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9yevg/going_back_to_school/,3,2024

It will be with the same team as I've been on since I was hired on as a contractor, and as far as I know, I am not competing with anyone else at this point, as they've committed to hire three contractors from my team, and I'm 99% sure they already had a good idea who they wanted to hire.

1b9ya8r,Should I switch paths or keep on trucking?,"I started university at 27 with no real plan for my degree, I just figured it would lead to a better career/life because that’s what everyone tells you. I majored in psychology because I found it interesting. When I was getting close to graduating I applied to any job I felt somewhat qualified for because I still wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I ended up getting a job in digital marketing at a local university. While it’s a “good job” I don’t find it enjoyable and don’t want to continue in this field. 

I’ve always had a passion for nature, plants, animals, etc. so it’s making me want to get a degree in biology/ecology/environmental science. I’ll be 32 soonish and if I did go for it I’d be starting another degree at 33. Should I go for it if I feel like it will make me happy or should I try to forge a path with the degree I already have? I’m feeling pretty lost. I want to get started on a career and not continue living the student life but at the same time I want to feel some sort of passion for what I’m doing.

I keep hearing how important social media and building your personal brand is.  I'm considering getting LinkedIn and social media but am concerned about an opening myself and my employer to harassment by a family member.

I do not have social media, as I come from a troubled family. My uncle, ( Call him Chet, whom I've been no contact with for 10 years) has a habit of calling any number associated with me and leaving abusive, often violent  and threatening messages. Chet is a violent mentally ill drug addict. He has called up previous employers and yelled at anyone who was unlucky enough to talk to him, the last receptionist was reduced to tears by the experience.  Before leaving the state, he used to show up at my work. 

Fortunately through a sale and a merger, he does not know my current employer, so I've been spared for several years.  He's homeless as far as I know,  and so somehow has avoided police here and where he is currently being willing to do anything to get him the help he needs.  

TLDR: How to use Linkedin/ Social media for career growth, w/o opening myself and my employer (current and future) to harassment by a mentally ill relative?

1b9xk1n,19M looking for guidance,"

Not sure how to word this or if I need to follow some sort of format in text. 

I won't be naming companies nor college institutes due to risk of identification.

I (19M) have been struggling to find a job for about 3 months, (Context: I live in London, UK) When I left college (16-18years), I set out my career to be in the Film &TV industry, I believe going to university was a waste of time because I already attended a Film college that I graduated creative media certifications from, and you don't necessarily need to go to university to get into film because at the end of the day the career experience matters not the qualifications. 

When I left college Ive had a few jobs here and there and also have worked at a post production company for a year as an assistant. My end career goal is to work in the Live News industry, I have made an effort and have connected with a few people inside of the News industry - I ideally would like to be in a video editing position, but also I am quite of a geek when it comes to computers and tech so I would also like to be a broadcast engineer for the news industry. 

During my time in the film industry I've noticed a heavy majority is contract work, to which I'd rather have a permanent position - and noticed News companies (although they do have contractors) tend to have more permanent positions.

Now, back to my current stage and would like guidance on. I wouldn't know, If I wanted to be heading towards the news industry, to carry on getting film jobs (to which I have had a great struggle at finding), graduating from university with a communications/networking degree (computing degree for 3-4 years), Joining the Army (minimum 4 years but they provide you apprenticeships if you want to have a signal Corp roles (cyber engineer - British army) then to join the news industry with qualifications gained, or even to just try and find apprenticeships (which is almost as hard for me to find jobs). 

I'm not sure which route would be best, keynote: I have a girlfriend of already 4 years to which lives in another country - I ideally would like to leave the UK to migrate and live with her as I believe the costs / affordability is way too expensive to live here. With her plans, she's going to university and would likely graduate in about 4 years time. 

My own thoughts, if I continue with jobs it will always be a cat and mouse game finding job to job. If I go to university, I do gain great qualifications but it's a problem with student loans (yes I only pay if I earn over a certain amount but a loan is still a loan) and probably won't have money in the time I would like to move out or even migrate. I have been considering the army for a few years but of course there's a risk of my life being cut short, and with the way politics are you never know what's coming in the next few years; but if all is fine in the end, I'd have a lot of money just simply saving since there's almost no expenses and ideally I'd have qualifications too. If I go down the apprenticeship route, I'd definitely need more help finding courses for me, I wouldn't know how to find a lot of apprenticeships and not sure if the majority of them are paid courses or not (as in I have to pay to be a part of apprenticeships).

Any help anyone? 

If you need more questions answered then let me know I'll be more than happy to answer.

Thanks all for the read,

ANY HELP PLEASE.

1b9w9mg,Feeling isolated and lonely at work ,"I work for a big company but my individual team is very small. It's just me, my coworker and my manager. I thankfully have a good relationship with my manager but they are rarely around (works in another part of the office and has taken on additional projects). My coworker is very cold/distant. We have to get peer feedback on our evaluations and he said ""I don't know why they hired her. Her attitude towards work doesn't align with our values."" I tried to be friendly at the beginning but I think it's best just to ignore him now. He treats me more like a subordinate than a coworker and it's so unfortunate I have to deal with someone like this. 

I haven't met anyone else who seems friendly and it seems like people just socialize within their teams. There are some teams who always have lunch and happy hours but I guess that is just not in the cards for me. I know I need to meet more people outside of work but it's just hard. I'm feeling very isolated/alienated and I feel like I just don't belong here. How do you not take it personally?

While I wouldn’t feel comfortable divulging in detail what happened, would it be appropriate to give her a heads up in a vague way that there are some personal difficulties I’m feeling with that may briefly impact my work performance? Really don’t want to get fired. While I anticipate still putting my best foot forward and doing great work, I imagine my output might not be as strong/fast for the next week or two while I process.

I just graduated, and I want to try a different industry. I have about 4 months until I hit the 12 month benchmark. If I want to get vested 100% I have to stay min 2 years at the company.  
I am so conflicted because I want to leave so much, but I also know the job market is horrible. I dread this work, and a lot of my friends tell me I should try to stick to it for to truly see if I like it once I get through the program.  
I have not liked this for more than half of the months I have been working here. I hate to say it but I will say it: I am not good at this work, and I don't enjoy it. I want to try something else before it is too late to change and I get stuck.  
I have an issue of not wanting to disappoint my boss and fellow teammates for leaving as soon as I hit 12 months because then it will feel like all the work was for nothing, and they are short-staffed in this industry since it is so specialized. Also, they are nice people too but because I am not good at this work imo, I often get stressed because my boss is sometimes hard to work with. They are a nice person, but when working it is difficult to not feel stupid around them, and I get intimidated all the time.

1b9ujfi,Which career path/field should I go into?,"I’m a recent high school grad and I’m starting university pretty soon for an Economics BA program. I applied to econ and stats programs because I initially wanted to go into data analytics/science, as it had a lot of what I’m looking for in a career: math (I’m very good with numbers), coding but not TOO much of it (I like coding but not enough to be a dev), and can pay well. But the recent over-saturation of the field, tech layoffs and general state of the job market has been… unnerving to say the least. It’s making me wonder if I should’ve just sucked it up and gone into engineering lol. 

I’m open to going into finance, even though it seems to be way easier said than done, especially as someone who only took science classes during high school. A lot of the job descriptions and terminologies are pretty confusing to me. I’m also kind of intimidated by the whole “breaking into finance” aspect (though to be fair networking seems to be a huge deal in every other field nowadays.) I’m also in Canada, where salaries seem to be 1/5th of those in the US for the same roles.

On grad school: I do plan on pursuing a PhD, but I’d like to do so after working for a few years first after college and getting some job experience. 

I’m posting in this subreddit because I’d like outside opinions and advice from professionals on what field/jobs/career paths I should consider that play to my strengths and skills. I’m very academically inclined and have good grades, particularly in math and chemistry. I’m introverted and mildly lack in social skills, but nothing that can’t be improved with a little self work. 

I’m open to everything (except engineering) as long as it has high earning potential (I spent much of my life in poverty and I’d like to work hard and use my skills to never live through that again.)

1b9ubjk,31 F seeking guidance on how to proceed with career,"Experience and Education:  
  
Experience:  
I have been working as a linguist for the past 6 years in the same position.  
  
Education:  
  
MSc in Computational Linguistics (2020)  
BA in Literature (2015)  
Both degrees are from reputable universities, although they are located outside the EU.  
  
Current Situation:  
  
I am 31 years old and have been feeling a bit uncertain about my current job. While it used to be satisfactory, I have noticed signs that my colleagues and I might be facing demotion. Consequently, I am considering transitioning to a new career. Some of my colleagues have successfully made the switch to data science, which has inspired me to pursue the same path.  
  
I have some background in python and ML thanks to my MsC. At the beginning of 2024, I started learning machine learning algorithms. I have been studying regression, polynomial regression, SVM, k-means, and other relatively simple algorithms. To supplement this, I enrolled in Codecademy to refresh my Python skills. I have completed Python 3 and am currently working on finishing the elementary Python course. My plan is to continue learning and developing my skills in machine learning as a data scientist on this platform.  
  
I don't have connections in the programming industry, which has made it challenging to secure job opportunities. I have applied to some positions on LinkedIn, but unfortunately, I have not received any responses. I have never participated in hackathons or Kaggle competitions, and my GitHub profile is relatively empty. Although I completed some basic projects on Codecademy, I don't believe they are noteworthy enough to showcase on GitHub.  
  
Relocation and Career Options:  
  
My company offers relocation opportunities, but the process is lengthy and uncertain. Recently, the HR department informed me that the relocation process has become more difficult, and approval is not guaranteed. This uncertainty leaves me in a dilemma. While I am eager to leave my current country, I am also determined to transition into a new career.  
  
Options Considered:  
  
Option 1: Apply for relocation and simultaneously work on becoming a data scientist. If I receive a job offer or sponsorship from an EU country, I will relocate and transition into a data science career. Otherwise, I may have to wait for the relocation process to conclude before pursuing a career change.  
  
Option 2: Seek a data scientist job or internship locally to gain relevant experience and enhance my career prospects. I can then apply to EU-based positions, potentially increasing my chances of securing sponsorship.  
  
Option 3: Apply for PhD or master's programs in Europe focused on data science. This path may offer a more guaranteed route to acquiring a work permit and starting a new career. However, it will require a longer time commitment, and there is uncertainty about acceptance due to my limited ties with academia in recent years.  
  
I am seeking guidance and suggestions on the best course of action to achieve my career and relocation goals. Any feedback or insights from the community would be greatly appreciated.  
I look forward to hearing from you.",wearyaard,1,1.0,2,1709920177,2024-03-08 17:49:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9ubjk/31_f_seeking_guidance_on_how_to_proceed_with/,3,2024
1b9tmb4,Am I settling for my raise?,"I’ve been at this company for almost 2 years (officially in 2 months it’ll be 2 years). After being with the company for 10 months, my boss above me got a new job and left. His tasks got divided and handed off to myself and my other coworker. I did not receive a raise for it. There aren’t really any performance meetings, I’m sure if I asked for them there wouldn’t be any issue in that but this is my first office job and I am nervous on how to go about things like that. I figured I’d just do the job+ new tasks for a bit then ask for a raise when I felt more comfortable. I asked for a raise a month ago (first time asking for one) so I was working here a year and 9 months with no previous raise and my boss (he was above my boss that I reported to and has been here the whole time) said “Oh you beat me to it! Was gonna talk to you about that in a couple weeks! For sure a raise will be put in place soon!” My boss is retiring at the end of this month. There was another meeting last week to explain I will now be reporting to the shipping supervisor with a new title (I was business manager now I am customer success manager but it’s basically order entry, communicating between sales, accounting, and shipping, licensing & warranties) They asked if I was interested in doing more with the company and I said yes (I’m not but I want more money so what else am I supposed to say lol.) After this I was pretty excited because I thought it would be a good raise coming since I had almost 2 years commitment, took on new tasks when my old boss left, and now being talked to about expanding my tasks.

I was told it would be a 5% raise. I know normally it’s a 2-3% raise for people but am I settling? I just don’t want to be settling for less and I was making 54k and now it will be around 57k. It’s just not enough. What do you all think?

Should I wait til I am assigned new tasks then ask for an additional raise?

Researching for my role is hard because it’s very vague and if I look up customer service the average is like 45k but I don’t think that’s an accurate description of my job.

A: $128k salary + $15k bonus. 28 PTO days. Great work life balance, if anything too little to do at work, but zero growth and a several years from any kind of promotion. Stale

B: $140k salary + $30k bonus. Comes with promotion in title vs job A. Unlimited PTO so no payout, potential for high workload and more stress, but great prospects for future growth/promotion, and lots of professional growth

1b9s4z7,Major Career Change vs Safety and Stability,"I currently work as a policy analyst for the Canadian government. I make quite a good salary and have all the benefits and flexibility I could ask for from this job. I started working in 2018 after graduating from university, studying political science. The thing is, I've grown to really dislike my job in the past few years. It can be mind numbingly boring, projects move at a snails pace due to bureaucracy and even when it's busy the work itself is not stimulating for me. I've been applying to other departments in government but the hiring process is extremely slow and competitive so it hasn't resulted in anything in the 2 years I've been looking. The more postings I look at the less motivated I get to apply. They seem like more of the same and I fear that a new job would only be stimulating for a few months until I get bored. It's starting to have a real impact on my mental health, and I feel like I would lose my mind if I have to keep doing this for years on end.

I've been considering going back to school for a few years now. I found a passion in drawing during the pandemic and have been learning since 2020. I have taken one-off classes and am learning through online courses. I have a desire to become a master in this field and work as an artist for a game developer, comic books, or animations, and eventually run my own studio. I feel nothing like this towards my current career. However, I am still an amateur artist so I'd like to go back to school for illustration/animation/concept art but most programs require a full-time in-person commitment. I've tried self-paced online courses but I find it difficult to keep up with when there's no consequence to not doing it, if that makes sense. 

There are a few issues I want advice on. First, is that I bought a condo two years ago and have a mortgage and bills to pay for, I certainly could not afford it on student loans. I could sell it and rent something more affordable (difficult in Ontario's housing market) but I feel like I'd be shooting myself in the foot by getting out of the market now that I'm in it. I can afford the full amount of the tuition for the programs I'm looking at now, I just can't keep up with everything else without my current income.

Second, is that the art industry is extremely competitive and does not pay all that well, at least for entry level. I think I would be taking a 20-30k pay cut, but it may be worth it to do something I'm passionate about. There is also the issue of AI art replacing a lot of roles, it's hard to imagine how much that will impact the industry in the future.

Any thoughts on this? Anyone else make a major change like this even if it didn't seem like a logical decision lol?",Extension-Nobody-631,1,1.0,0,1709915040,2024-03-08 16:24:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9s4z7/major_career_change_vs_safety_and_stability/,3,2024

1b9rp5s,Had a rough start to finding a career and need help getting stable ,"I 29F started out going to school for Graphic Design and Illustration (I know, I know). About a year out of college I landed a position as an on staff illustrator for a seasonal stationary company.

That company was failing and after about a year I got caught up in layoffs and the company closed. I had a lot going on at the time, basically my life was already in shambles and when the lay-off hit I was devastated. I had to move back in with my parents and become a caretaker to a family member for a few months. 5/6 months later I was finally starting to interview again and then covid hit and jobs dried up.

I know I made mistakes and let myself fall out of the career. I should have done more during covid but at the end I was desperate and needed SOMETHING so in 2021 I took a job as a bank teller/loan officer. The job was fine. I liked the stability of a 9-5 and I got comfortable.

Well after 2 and a half years the branch that I was working at closed (in person banking is dying) and I'm back where I started. If I go back into banking I don't really want to work the same position. I hate sales and goals with a passion and I'm tired of customer service. The position doesn't feel stable with banks constantly closing and everything moving online.

I would love to get back into an illustration career but I feel like I've just lost too much time. I graduated college nearly 6 years ago. My skills are rusty and the career just feels so unstable with AI art coming along. I also don't know if I could land another on staff position and have such major confidence issues I don't know how to tackle the hurdle of self selling and advocating that comes with freelancing.

Maybe I'm giving up, but it's just me. Even if I did get back into illustration I have no partner to depend on in between projects. I want a stable career I can make a comfortable living wage off of but I have no idea where to go or where to start. I did manage to pay off my student loans (one perk of being stuck at home) so I'm not against having to pay for some education but do not want to put myself way in debt.

Sorry for rambling I'm just feeling lost and frustrated and any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.

1b9rm2y,Putting in 2 weeks notice of availability change (from full time to part time) ,"I, 26f, work for a very small non for profit rehabilitation clinic in Canada. The company has about 6 employees, and we serve a very niche population. Recently, I’ve had a few things going on in my personal life- my mother had a total knee replacement and she requires a lot of aid at home, as well as, I got a new part time job, that offers guaranteed hours and that’s close to home (I currently drive 1+hr one way to get to work). With that and a bunch of other things, I’m going to be providing my boss a 2 weeks notice of change of availability to ensure the company can still run. 

However, since my mums surgery, I’ve had to take time away from the company which my boss wasn’t too enthusiastic about (of course), and now, after talking with my mums physio, she’ll be having appointments twice a week for the next 7 weeks. These appointments times run parallel with my clinic hours. I’ve let me boss know that one two days out the five I work, I have to start an hour later and my boss is livid and is requesting her and I have a meeting on Monday morning to discuss a few things. My family and I don’t have the funds to put my mum on wheeltrans, and we’re a 1 car family, so I’m literally the only one who can bring her to and from appointments. 

The reason for my post is, to ask for advice on how to tell my manager that my availability to work will now go to 2 days, instead of 5? I can tell she’s already very upset with me starting an hour later and I’m nervous for her reaction when I tell her that I’ll be moving down to part time.

Despite four rounds of interviews, they postponed my final round to January then to march. Recruiter however called me to congratulate me on making it till here early in January before silence started. 

After months of waiting and minimal responses, I finally reached out expressing my frustration at end of February (after 3 ignored emails). Surprisingly, the recruiter replied within two days, but only with an automated rejection. It's been disappointing, and I'm left wondering if this treatment is normal. 

As a new grad excited to enter the industry, this experience has been a letdown, but I stand by my decision to assertively request a response, even if it meant facing rejection. 5 months is too much, and being an international student with limited search period made it so much worse but I plan on staying resilient 🫡 I can not let L recruiters like her win.

1b9q6zp,"I keep hearing advice to be empathetic with someone, but how can I address that the relationship is not a one way street?","I am having difficulty with a colleague, primarily around communication. I have ADHD, so I understand that I do not always communicate easily with people who don't have ADHD. I initially thought this may be the issue so I tried to find training to better understand how I currently communicate ideas and how I might need to adjust that. I recently encountered a few situations that seemed *off*, and I suspect the issue is deeper. I do not suspect this is solely because of how I communicate.  
With my history of ADHD and only being diagnosed very late in life, I have developed lower self-esteem, and the value I have for myself is not healthy. I mask it well; I have a Theater degree, and the experience removed a lot of fear, and what some people would consider shame, I suppose. So, I know I appear outgoing, fearless, and confident, but I am not. I have let people walk all over me, I have been trying to be a people pleaser, and I put others before me because of the lack of self-valuation.  
I am finding and owning that I am as important as others. My needs also must be met, I deserve to be happy, I deserve respect, and I deserve space. Musar, the Jewish movement, helped me realize I give too much space and I need space of my own.  
All advice, though, especially professional, attempts to placate another party. The platitudes are like ""think of where the other person is coming from,"" ""don't rush to judgment,"" and ""try to meet them where they are."" This is fine - I agree with the theory in it. But none of them also say to value where you are, when or how to shut down someone overstepping their bounds, or when the other party isn't doing the same for you.  
I agree with servant leadership. But I don't agree with a servant mindset at the expense of myself.  
So with my colleague, **how can I express that while I will try to see things from their point of view, I expect the same? And while their feelings are valid, mine are too?** And how can I prevent this colleague from resorting to being the victim or shutting down?",HolaItsEd,1,1.0,4,1709910417,2024-03-08 15:06:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9q6zp/i_keep_hearing_advice_to_be_empathetic_with/,3,2024
1b9oh64,New job not working out in first week,"First, a little bit of background. I have been with my current company for about 5.5 years and have held two positions in our IT department. A little over a year ago I was volun-told by my boss to learn a RPA developer program that only one other group in my entire company used. Little did I know that they had only been using this product for a year themselves. So after learning and developing bots to complete daily tasks, I found I really loved developing these Bot projects. I found an internal job on my company's automation team that I thought could further my knowledge with RPA development.  This new job came with a considerable pay increase, almost $10k, but no more remote days. I did convince them to allow me one remote day after training is completed but it has never been mentioned again. And yes, I have this in writing.  Therefore I would be commuting a hour and half each day to work in office.

Three weeks later. I started this new job Monday (5 days ago) and it is not going as I would have hoped. I have not worked on one Bot or developed anything. Everything I have learned so far has been more of a project management type role. I was told in the interview that there would be some documentation/pm tasks but that was 20% of the overall job. In reality, it is more like 60% PM, 30% secretarial work, and 10% Bot monitoring.

I now have my doubts that this job is truly what I thought I was getting.  There is no structure (which my personality needs), there is no one to train me, and my new boss has already lied on me once by telling another developer something different than he told me. Essentially throwing me under the bus. 

I really feel like I have fallen for a bait and switch by this new group and would like to move back to my old job. I know for a fact my old boss would take me back because he has already asked if I want to. I didn't hate my old job or team. I left thinking I was going to gain new skills, which I can clearly tell already that I am not.

Is it too soon to tell if I should give up on this new position? I am writing this to get some unbiased opinions.  TIA.",momma2read,1,1.0,2,1709906064,2024-03-08 13:54:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9oh64/new_job_not_working_out_in_first_week/,3,2024

It's actually a top 50 public business school in America. Now, the problem is that I got 60 of my credits transferred, but not calculus 1. This is because I obtained an associate's degree before taking calculus at community college. Even though I got a B in the course, it didn't transfer. As a result, I didn't attend the university and instead went to another lesser-known state school in my area. It wasn't diverse, had no reputation, and didn't offer the same return on investment or salary outcomes. Eventually, I dropped out of college. Last year, in 2023, I discovered that the other campus of the state university would have accepted my calculus course. The admissions staff never informed me about this, and it would have only taken five minutes to make the necessary changes and checkmark on my application.

Fast forward to now, I go an offer! It’s official, we already have starting date (May 6th), and I got the contract to sign. There is a 10-15% pay increase w respect to Intuit.

Google has been my dream since college. But I can’t stop feeling so scared and guilty. I’m scared I’m not doing the right thing and that Google is not better than Intuit. I’m scared of the layoffs, and that I’ll be working harder and more hours. I’m feeling extremely guilty about leaving Intuit since they treated me amazingly for the past years. I got promoted with a 20% increase, they’ve done everything good to me - and I’m just leaving for no reason.

The main reason I’m doing it it’s because it’s early in my career (23 years old), and I think Google’s name will look good in my resume, and in 3-4 years I’ll be a senior and have more doors open. 

Also, if there is anyone here that has experience with giving a notice to a company they loved. How do I close in good terms? How do I make them not hate me for lying to them during the past months (recruitment process). How do I pass the message I’m thankful and it’s all about business? I was thinking of giving my notice next week, so that I’ll give them a month notice.

1b9j2pv,Is this a stupid move?,"I am an Oxbridge graduate (vet) currently working as a consultant in a firm which does very academically taxing work. I have been there for 16 months, and have just received a pay rise, taking me from 33k to 37k. I know they value me, but I'm unhappy there, as it is in a city I don't like, I'm tired of the nerdiness of it, and there are poor career progression opportunities. I want to gain more experience and skills across the whole product life cycle, so I have been job hunting. 

I found a job that really excites me based in a city I want to move to and is 45k, but found out later in the process that it was a FTC, only taking me to the end of the year. I am still considering taking it though, which would mean having a(nother) short stint on my CV and needing to keep job searching all year. BUT, it would give me good training experience and would give me a kickstart to get going with a startup concept I've been meaning to revisit for years, as the role is directly applicable to that. This is very optimistic of me for personal reasons, and I'm currently being contacted by recruiters for potentially more impressive jobs so it might not be the *best* role for my CV.   


My tenancy runs out in a few months and I'm going to move to the same city anyway, and try to negotiate working from home if I stay with my current job. I will still be job hunting if I don't take this job. 

What would you recommend? My parents wouldn't touch it with a barge pole, and I do see that. But part of my wants to take the risk and see what happens.

1b9ij0e,Want to quit but can't seem to find another job even after 1 year of applying ,"Currently in an IT operations role and feel like I'm stuck in my current job as it's constant stress, long hours with toxic backstabbing colleagues. I've applied to hundreds of jobs since last year and still haven't managed to find another role. I entertained the possibility of quitting last year, but in hindsight, I'm so glad I didn't as I would still be unemployed by now!

I actually have several years of (relevant) experience, but I think other employers see me as overqualified and a bit ""introverted"", and I don't know how to get around this. The market seems to only care about hiring entry level or C-suite types right now, and nfortunately, I'm not very outgoing so my network totally sucks. 

I really don't know what to do tbh so any advice would be appreciated. I could just stay in my current role and stop caring, waiting to be fired one day.

1b9hj6s,email tone - too formal? worried about sounding passive-agressive - am I? If so what to do now?,"I work in a project-based environment. Most projects run once a year in 8-week cycles. I have different leads for each, who are not my bosses. The project I am working on right now was designed 4 years ago and is running for the 4th time. 

Last year I got a new lead for it. He is also new to the company.  I spent a lot of time onboarding him because he was new to the company and because of my institutional knowledge. He kept the project the same. We do a large portion of our work remotely and I have never met him in person, only on Zoom. He's also leaving the project when it's done this year and giving it back to the previous owner.

In the run-up to this year's edition, he asked me for my input and I gave him 2 suggestions. He followed one, and not the other. It's no skin off my back to not follow my advice. I don't get paid to make decisions. At the same time, bc there have been issues, it's a chance for me to make changes that will make my job easier next year, if he implements them. The piece he followed went well. The piece that he didn't follow, though, garnered complaints from our stakeholders. This, combined with low engagement from the stakeholders, makes me wonder if he doubts himself and is leaning on me.

In Week 3, he asked for more feedback on a different process. I gave it to him, with a clear description and examples. In Week 4, he asked if we could meet to revise. I told him I didn't have the time, but sketched out a solution and advised him of the issues in it that I wasn't sure how to resolve and he could do what he wanted with it. Again, it's not my job.

It's now Week 5, we have to start implementing the process. He emailed me yesterday saying that my co-workers and I could just work off my sketch and design the process, but was also open to any suggestions. My 2 co-workers are new this year and have not done this project before.

I sent a frank response. I told him I appreciated his confidence in me, but that, essentially, this is outside my job description and specifically within his. I attached the policy that says so, which I'm not sure if his boss gave him. I also advised that I did not have the time to do as much, anyway, in terms of time and managing the team with coworkers. One of his issues that he himself brought up in his message is that he and his family have been sick the last few weeks. So, at the end of my email, I said I hope everyone recovers and as a parent, who similarly to him, lives away from family, I totally understand that it is hard but eventually will get better once community is built.

I thought I kept the mail as neutral as possible and spent 1.5 hours crafting it. We work in a very political environment, with several different nationalities. However, the after sending, I realised that my level of formality could be taken the wrong way, along with my wishes for people getting better. The lead's message was a few lines and informal. I tried to recall the message in Outlook, but only succeeded in deleting it for myself. 

I really don't know what to do, or if there's anything to do.  I also wonder about my email tone, in general. In person I'm fun and known to be laid back, smart and also really nice. Many people say these things about me. But online, I sound completely formal. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, but medication helps for a while and then stops (we are still titrating, and I am in CBT). Maybe I'm overthinking this bc rumination is an ADHD tendency.  I wonder if my differences in communication also come from that in terms of being literal and over explaining. I haven't disclosed my ADHD at work. It's now the next day and I could hardly sleep, which is why I'm here on Reddit.

Am looking for advice - 1) was my response out of line? 2) what to do if my lead is upset and the email bites me. I know my boss would support me (lead has another boss), but I don't want the lead to malign me to his co-workers, who can be my lead on other projects. And 3) how to be better at communicating via email. I'm sorry to be vague about my job, but we are very niche.",KittenBula,1,1.0,0,1709879962,2024-03-08 06:39:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9hj6s/email_tone_too_formal_worried_about_sounding/,3,2024
1b9gzxu,I think I lost hope..,"I will try to keep it as short as possible, and I would really appreciate anyone that could give an opinion or a suggestion on what to do. 

Im 28 M, got a bachelor degree in 2020 in Business administration. Worked a sales job for a few years but unfortunately when my performance dropped, I got absolutely crushed by my superiors and I have made a promise to myself that I would never do sales again.

It has been a year of unemployment, been applying to a lot of jobs, either missing experience for most of the jobs, or over qualified for the jobs that I want to do temporary. Thought of studying again but that would cost me money that I don’t have (it is quite expensive in North America). 

So yeah, I am lost and hopeless. I have given up on applying, and slowly giving up on living. If you have any suggestions or advice to where I should be headed, it would be highly appreciated

1b9f2de,Young Professional Conundrum,"As the title suggests I am in a bit of a predicament. For background purposes, I am a 23 year old graduate with a degree in Finance. I have been applying for graduate schemes for the last 2 months with a bit of success yet no offers so far. These schemes I am applying for are mainly in the city 90 minutes away via train and would require me to move into my own place/flatshare, something which people I know have done. In the meantime I have been trying to find a part time job to keep me going whilst applying for these schemes.

For a part time job, my dad told me to apply for a trainee role at his old company which I was unsuccessful with however the recruiter for the company suggested another role which is full time and a proper career job and after my interview I have been offered the job. The problem is that this job is in an industry that doesn't interest me and is only a 30 minute drive away so I would stay living with my parents. I feel hesitant to accept due to not wanting to rush into a career I have known about for 1.5 weeks at 23. 

The toss up is either accept the job at my dad's old company with worse pay and in a less enjoyable sector but live cheaper with my parents or risk getting or maybe not getting a graduate scheme which pays 5-10k more yearly but allow myself the freedom to live on my own. Outside of work, my friends have a flat in the city 90 mins away and would want to live with me which is a big plus for my social life whereas if I was at home still, the majority of my friends wouldn't be there. One point to note is that I had a role in a graduate scheme last year however due to other factors outside work meant that I was not able to pursue it for very long

To provide some context, I have been with my current organization for around nine years, serving in various capacities as a subject matter expert, project manager, and program manager.
 In the new role, the task would be to oversee the global portfolio management function.
Organisation is an Automotive system supplier of solutions and technologies to big and small OEMs. 

 While I do not have direct reportees, I report to the leader of the Product Line. This role involves close collaboration with Product Group Leaders and Regional Product and sales Leaders to ensure an effective execution of Product and Market strategies at a global level.

Given the dynamic nature of the industry and the responsibilities associated with the position, I am keen to understand the community's insights and industry standards regarding compensation for similar roles.

Hi, so I had an interview with this advertising company and the HR screening went well and i was able to make it to my the second round interview, which was a 45 minute interview with the manager of the program I was applying to, it was mostly behavioral questions 🧿. So the interviewee started off explaining about what the company does and how they make their money, then she talks about her role and she asks a little background I spoke about that, my education, major and a little bit of what know about the company. Then she asks me a few behavioral questions. Its a data driven role so she asksee me questions like how I measure KPIs, I told her, it depends what they were looking for, whether it was engagement on social media, or usage of Roolay dollars on campus or even through raffle tickets. Then I spoke about my integration of data analysis in my marketing work and my core classes in my major and what the courses teach🧿. Then she asks me a few questions about group work and team members not being able to meet deadlines and I explained I would a lot work based on someones bandwidth. Then she asked me tell me about a time where an employer gave you useful advice, and I explained that my supervisor told me to go to restaurants and meet people and introduce myself to create better relationships with eateries and vendors. I don't think that was the best answer, but I couldn't think of anything else. Also she asked me which excel function I liked I said I like the calculation functions that add, subtract multiply etc. She said there were 6 interviewees and only three will proceed to the next step, they told me last week that ill get to know by the end of the week but its the end of the second week and i haven’t received a response from them.

Recently my one boss has been nothing but rude, given me a nonstop attitude, and has acted like they didn’t want me there in the first place. My last shift they also went as far to assign me with more work, which I generally don’t mind, however was an absurd amount alwhile expecting it to be absolutely perfect. Nonetheless, I was contemplating walking out right then and there. Today I was told that my next shift I will have the same task assigned to me and I was even told to bring a change of clothes as the task could get “dirty” (job is one where you are expected to look good, not dirty). Amidst all of the frustration that has built up throughout the past few weeks, I impulsively quit via text and politely thanked the team for the opportunity, however would not be able to keep the position anymore and apologized for doing this the day before my shift. I want to throw in that I know how shitty of a thing this is to do, and I am not like that. I just felt as if enough was enough at this point. After telling one of my friends what had happened they raised the idea, originally as a joke, that what if my now ex employer were to contact my current and talk negatively on me.

It's been amazing being able to save money, but at this point I value having my own place and independence more than stacking any more money.

I feel like it's something I need to do as I'm watching life fly by, but I worry about what that would do in terms of my career I.e. take away any bargaining power, hurt potential job prospects, etc. I'm currently applying in this city but worry the fact that I'm 1000 miles away it's making it more difficult to secure a job when they could go with a local candidate.

What I want is a role where I can sit down, not feel like someone is looking over my shoulder (current boss has a camera directly behind me), know what I'm doing with easy to understand standards, and NOT BE BOTHERED (asking me what I'm doing everyday isn't gonna make me like you better). 

But I'm asking a lot already asking for a livable wage. 

So, I want a career change. Even if it means a salary decrease, if it gives me peace of mind, I can live with that. But what can I change to? College was only useful for the degree and NONE of the training, so using that as a way to open up opportunities sounds like a losing gamble. And getting experience takes time and is yet another gamble that can easily backfire on me. 

I'm completely out of ideas. I don't have any skills to sell (that anyone wants in the job market), but Solidworks. Any advice would be appreciated.

1b9angr,Annual salary increases?,"I graduated college in December 2022 and by February 2023 I got a job working for a company that I interned at the year before. It’s a customer service based remote position, at a mid-sized fully remote company. My salary when I got hired was $49k which was the high end of the salary range for the job posting. 4 months ago the company did some restructuring, so I got moved to a different team because the main account I worked on was moved there, and that same day my new manager went on medical leave for 3 months. Since I was the only team member with experience on this account (which is a very detail oriented and particular process), and the manager left before he had time to assign additional team members to the account, I was the only person working on the account for those 3 months, and I was taking on additional tasks that are supposed to be handled by a different, more senior position because there was no one else to do it. And this was in addition to the other accounts I work on. Now that my manager is back, he started to organize training for my coworkers to also work on this account as of last week, but my coworkers feel that the account is really difficult so they have asked me to prepare additional trainings and guidebooks for the account. Apparently the company has been struggling the past 8 months and they have made it known by doing a hiring freeze, OT freeze, a round of layoffs, and eliminating performance bonuses. Yesterday I had my first performance review with my new manager, and this was also the year end performance review where annual salary increases come in. My base salary increase was about 1.7% at roughly $800 more annually. My manager told me that this year the salary increases were determined based on performance instead of everyone getting the same rate like they did in previous years, and he also told me that my increase was higher than the average for our team. I find it hard to believe that and I’m wondering if I got screwed over with my increase especially considering how much more responsibilities I’ve taken on, or is this a normal amount for a relatively new employee who came on right out of college?",clovercolibri,1,1.0,5,1709859555,2024-03-08 00:59:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b9angr/annual_salary_increases/,3,2024

First interview with HR manager was a success and i received an email he told that CEO of the company would interview me. It happened and what a coincidence,we are from the same city with the CEO,he liked the way that we are compatriots and he kept on repeating that he liked me so much,he told that he had interviewed another candidates and didn’t like their ideas,visions etc and he told that he would like to move on with me and in order to meet me he will travel from another country to our city just to meet me and we will not have an interview but just introductory meeting. During the interview all his talks were focusing on “you will”. I mean, he didn’t say anything about “you might” he was directly telling me that “you will come to headquarters, get your training,then go back home and manage the business as it’s yours, you will meet accountants and lawyers and if you don’t like them ,without asking me , you can change them” and during the interview he didn’t address me with my name but he addressed me either “Sir” or “Mr.” I am way younger then him and i was expecting him to address me my name only. Also , he didn’t ask me any questions about myself,about my CV etc but it was kinda like a discussion for the future of the business and medium term goals and also marketing strategies. I already felt like i am part of the team. In the end of the conversation he thanked me too much because it’s the way i am and he told me that he has many positive thoughts over me and repeated the dates of his visit to me and he said that he will give me the keys of the business as soon as he comes to our city.So, do you think it’s over and i got the job?

1b98q8j,"27 years old, two degrees that I dislike (JD and BBA) and seemingly nowhere to go—ideas on roles to target next?","Like the title says, I have a BBA in Supply Chain, and a JD from the same institution. I got the JD because I really didn’t enjoy supply chain, and people always told me I’d be a good lawyer. My undergrad degree is paid off thankfully, but I have about $140,000 or so remaining on law school. I know the rules say no sob stories, but I feel like the context is important, and my back is against the wall.

I practiced commercial litigation at a mid-sized firm in a large city with a great salary, but the work was making me miserable to the point of contemplating suicide daily and showing up an hour+ late to work for months. I resigned after a year and a half on the job in early 2023. 

In Summer of 2023 I moved back in with my parents to work at a small firm in my hometown doing transactional law (renewables, estate planning, probate, etc), which I thought would be preferable to litigation. It is, but barely. I truly loathe the law and legal profession, and I started to have those feelings about the profession during the summer before my final year of law school. I just ignored them because I had a nice job offer. 

At present, the depression/anxiety has crept back and I continue to do my job very poorly, despite all of my circumstances being objectively improved. 

I took some very expensive aptitude testing that was no help at all—it just confirmed my suspicions that my brain is not geared towards practicing law. 

I desperately want to work for a larger company doing something that uses the skills I have developed. I’ve realized that I crave the feeling of working as part of a team, and I just don’t see that in any of the legal roles out there. I really want the opportunity to develop within an organization, rather than build up my own practice as an “island” within a small firm. I was super involved in extracurriculars in my academic career, and have been missing that feeling of contributing to a system that works well. I always have thought about joining the military, but I don’t think I could get waivers for the mess of mental health issues that have cropped up in the last couple of years. 

I’ve considered roles in compliance and contract management, but I worry that those are positions that are pretty much siloed off in businesses and work under the direction of practicing attorneys anyway. I have no idea what are some reasonable roles that I should consider targeting given that my debt is massive and I essentially have to start from square one. 

And because I know I’ll get advice about mental health, after my resignation I spent several weeks in intensive outpatient therapy, over a year in therapy, and am currently doing leaps and bounds better than I was. I am on medication, exercise regularly, have an active social life, and got out of an unhealthy relationship that compounded my professional problems.

Then, this job offer came along - to work in financial risk for a different company. I saw it as an opportunity to gain solid knowledge in finance on top of my data skills.

1b94xoz,"Formally resigned, boss begged me to stay and I agreed. I’ve now had my work given to other people and was taken off my usual duties. What gives?","Hey everyone! I’ve had a puzzling experience with my management and am looking for advice/insight. 

For context, this role is at a government office for a major US city. My onboarding was really suspicious (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/s/wW9oMsRLmR)) but it turned out to be at a real government office. 

I started this role about six months ago and have followed my work parameters exactly. The workplace offers Flex Time (latest clock-in allowed is 11am). I was usually clocking-in by 10am and staying the full amount of hours required. I had confirmed with my supervisor over email that these parameters were allowed after a one-time incident where I stayed late to finish a heavy workload. (Overtime is not allowed). 

I had a performance meeting with my supervisor the other week and she informed me that I was breaking the rules of Flex Time by “always” coming in at 10am, despite my Flex Time hours being confirmed by her in an email (which I showed her). She ignored what I showed her and told me I was never supposed to be using it, despite her being the approver for my timesheet and always approving them with those hours. 

I was also surprised to be accused of “slacking”. For context, a specific amount of assignments are sent to my online portal which I usually complete way before the end of the day. My supervisor knows when I clear out my work queue and she had never given me additional work. I told her that if she had assigned me additional work I would have been more than happy to complete it, but she never assigned it to me. She told me that it was my responsibility to make sure I get more work, which doesn’t make sense as she is the only person with the credentials to send work to my computer queue. 

She had kept hinting that all of these “infractions” would “add up” and could lead to termination. The next workday I formally resigned with the HR department and was dropping off my employee laptop/etc. when my director (the boss to my supervisor) rushed into the HR offices and begged me to reconsider. 

After a long conversation with her, she told me that this was the supervisor’s first time conducting a performance review and she had actually requested not to do it. She said we could work something out between me and the supervisor and I agreed to stay.

I’ve gone back to work as normal, but things seem a little suspect. For starters, they took me off the schedule for a weekly meeting I usually run as well as preventing me from working with my usual department. 

Additionally, a lot of the work that usually goes to my queue has been rerouted to my elderly coworker’s computer, who has never worked with these systems before. I’m now at maybe 50% of my previous workload. This struck me as strange as the whole reason I had my negative performance review was because I finished my work “too early” and then had nothing to do.

I’ve been trying to look out for myself by spreading the minimal work I have throughout the day, so that their (albeit rudimentary) activity monitor (which only tracks website history) shows that I have my assignments open the entire workday. 

Basically, I’m worried that they asked me to stay just so they could fire me at my next performance meeting in a month. I feel like that would be a big waste of time and money though, as they’ve obviously been paying me and if they wanted to fire me anyway they should have just let me quit when I did.

TL;DR: I formally quit my post due to a confusing performance meeting.

That person was eventually hired a year later and all I got was a recommendation letter.

The position is something I'd be passionate about and feel quite qualified for.

So, from my understanding I should ask questions. What kind though would make me stand out and seem more interested as a candidate? What to avoid? What to lean into? All of it.

1b90n2b,I got a degree remotely at 23. I’ve been working seasonal travel jobs since i was 19.,"Like I mentioned in the title, i have done quite a bit of traveling as a young adult. I first moved to hawaii for a summer camp after my first semester of university. I was about 19 then. I decided to stay for the fall season, do class remotely, and work throughout the winter. My university had remote education opportunities (even before covid) and i took advantage of this to work in hawaii during that fall. It was the dream. I stayed in hawaii until covid hit. After covid i was back home still in class remote. Time went by and covid eventually cleared up. I moved back to my job in Hawaii. I was there for about a year and I completed my Bachelor’s degree remotely. I moved back for graduation. After about a month i moved to work in colorado for the summer. I worked at a mountain bike resort on their trail crew. After the summer i saved up enough money to spend two months in Thailand. My cousin teaches english there and lend me his spare bedroom. After those two months i landed a job in New Zealand at a similar camp. I am now an outdoor instructor for school groups. I’ve been lucky to find jobs that offer little to no rent onsite housing. During school I was on scholarship, had financial aid; so I have no student debt. I have previously experience serving/bartending, working for a few radio stations, Growing up i lifeguarded at a waterpark and did all sorts of jobs during the fall/spring.

To get to the question: I have a bachelor’s degree in Multidisciplinary Studies with a concentrations in English, Media Communications, and Music. My current job is at a camp in NZ and after my contract i think i want to make a career change. Working with kids has been rewarding , but i want to do something different. Something that aligns with my degree. Potentially something i can travel doing. What type of job should i look for?

I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s in Applied Science and a minor in health. Originally, my plan was to pursue a master’s in teaching to become a physical education teacher. However, after subbing for the past few months and questioning the ease of landing a PE job, along with concerns about pay and behavior issues, I’m reevaluating my path.

1b90c5l,Considering the switch from physical labor to the tech industry. Any advice?,"Hello, 

I'm seeking stories of others who switched from manual labor jobs to the tech industry.

I'm considering new career directions and the IT industry seems appealing in many ways. For context, I have a BA in Geography (never ""used"" it) and have experience in labor jobs - wildland firefighting, moving, commercial fishing, and now cooking. I never considered the tech industry when younger because I saw how addicted my father was to working (as a software engineer) and how it made him a largely absent figure in my life. From a young age I've told myself I'd hate working at a desk. 

Now, after 10 years of working manual labor, I've decided I'd rather not continue destroying my body and making relatively low wages. I value financial stability, geographic flexibility, and continual learning. I can satiate my need for physical exercise and outdoor adventure in my non-working hours. 

I'm sure many others have done this transition already, and I'm curious what their stories are. Was the switch worth it? How long should I realistically plan for to make the transition from where I am now - full-time cook - to a solid entry-level position in the tech industry (i.e. junior developer, cybersecurity, etc)?

1b9099x,Worried I won’t get a job as a data scientist if I start my career in something else?,"I have a bachelors in data science and masters in digital marketing. 

I got a job as a data engineer at a great tech company, Q4 results made them realize they don’t want to pay any entry level positions anymore.

Months later I’m still searching for a technical position and there’s hardly any DS graduate positions at all. Im having some luck in marketing and business analytics but I feel almost stupid for getting my masters and I’m so worried that working in these fields will risk me never becoming a data scientist. 

I just thought 10 months of addition to my profile with another semi technical skill would be interesting. My engineering offer worked in marketing ideas. But there’s so little entry positions open right now. 

I feel like I fucked up at 24, despite having a degree in data science because I did a 10 month degree in something else for a list of reasons. Worried working in sales analytics with not any modeling or something means I won’t be considered competitive much at all.

1b901sq,I would like to better understand how a person can prove to be a manager,"As the summary states.  I have been told many times in my life that if I want to be a manager, I have to show that I can ""Manage.""  Ok, this makes sense 100%.    
In my mind, I look at being a manager as someone that can make the cold hard decisions that foster productivity through team collaboration, organization, direction, coaching, and most importantly, negotiation (to name the first few points that come to mind).   
To further explain my mindset or approach that I am taking, to demonstrate my ability to manage, I have dressed the part, developed plans, schedules, business reasons and cost considerations for said project to be developed and executed a specific way.  
What has happened, now, and in the past, is that I will verbally be told that I am empowered to ""do what is required,"" without having any requirements provided.  I will execute the project or task as if I am a manager, documenting, planning, coordinating, and communicating the entire time.  When meetings do occur, obviously questions and comments are made that I fully address, however, the project ultimately goes no where out of me not actually being empowered to manage anything or anyone or, seemingly, the intent of the project, regardless of verbiage and diagrams used, is lost on those receiving it.    
I suspect that I am not actually perceiving any of this wrong. I have spoken diplomatically as like so many other managers and I only get pushed back.  
As an additional mention, what I have found years ago is that I could talk plainly (normally), but this appears ""intimidating"" for whatever reason.  I then interpreted this to speak diplomatically, but regardless of how or what I say or do, it gets lost on whomever I am working with.    
I'm not really sure what to do, what I am doing wrong, or what I am missing.   
I'm hoping that someone could provide some insight or confirm the suspicions that I have.

1b8zzse,Should I be looking for a new job?,"Sorry this is so long. I would appreciate the read and I hope you can give me some advice!

I (29 M) and work for a large auto manufacturer in engineering. I make $94800 per year before taxes + bonus (~10k past 2 years based on company performance)
My wife (27F) is a nurse and works part time for our excellent health care coverage and our fun money

We own a home and do not want to move (Michigan)

My wife and I just had a baby at the end of January and I am out on paid paternity leave for 3 months. 

I also suffered an extensive injury 13 years ago which affects my daily life and means that I need physical therapy every week and need to spend extra time taking care of myself everyday (think epsom salts Baths, Yoga, workouts and stretching throughout the week).

I currently work on gasoline vehicles but my passion is in renewable energy and electric vehicles. I have interviewed for some internal positions in EVs but unfortunately a hiring freeze was implemented before I could move. 

Overall pros

1. I love my co workers and especially my boss. He is a fantastic hands off manager and as long as I get my work done doesn't hound me about my hours worked

2. Up until I go back to work, the job has been remote since covid

3. I probably have been putting in only 20 hours per week to my current job which, since we have been remote since covid, has given me a lot of extra time with my wife and to take care of my physical health. I feel very fortunate for this and would not expect this flexibility at a new job

4. My wife and I have discussed having more children in the future and the paid leave is awesome AND the company offers 40k in IVF/reproductive health help that we may need to use in the future (my wife gets 20k from her work and has excellent health benefits)

5. Self directed 401k (i love investing and finance) and if if put 10% in they match 8%
 
Cons
1. I have only gotten 2-2.5%% raises since starting 5 years ago and because of the size of the company my boss has no say over raises (he has tried multiple time). Moving to a higher paid position in a different department would mean working here another 3 years (8 years experience needed)

2. When my leave ends, we are back in the office 3 days per week (45 minute commute) AND they will be monitoring time spent in the office for possible disciplinary action (cant work a half day there and go home to finish the work day). This will make it hard to take care fo myself in the way that I have been

3. The in office environment does not have assigned seating so it will feel no different than working from home with coworkers scattered all over the huge campus (which will be a physical problem for me to get to people)

4. I am much more productive in my quiet environment at home

5. I feel I am underpaid now considering I have a masters degree (energy systems engineering)

6. This job is not my passion and With how the automotive industry is changing, this job may not be available in 5 to 10 years.

I am torn. I have a buddy who has offered some connections for jobs and have been reached out to on LinkedIn about job openings. I almost feel like interviewing around (especially while on leave) is betraying my boss and I also feel as if I would be wasting my time home with my family. But I also know that this job isn't my passion and I have taken advantage of multiple battery technology and other ev college coursework learning opportunities offered by the company. In my spare time at home I have also been learning programming to widen my skillset.

I would appreciate some feedback. This is my first job after college. So I feel like it's difficult to change jobs now that I am so entrenched in the company.",twaoneywuan,2,1.0,3,1709831813,2024-03-07 17:16:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b8zzse/should_i_be_looking_for_a_new_job/,3,2024

1b8z1tw,Tips for navigating a sexist work environment (remotely) as a woman? Specifically how to soften your language so you don't come off as threatening to extremely fragile egos?,"Particularly with:

* How to speak verbally and write in ""softened"" language rather than direct communication, since anything direct is seen as curt or harsh
* The company is less interested in finding solutions, they just want to pass everything around and not take responsibility for anything. But this is done in a very subtle way
* Your boss and boss's boss have sexist stereotypes about how women should behave (gentle, always smiling, etc.), and literally any type of assertiveness or directness is seeing as being headstrong
* When a director-level coworker you have to work with is incompetent, blatantly rude and refuses to be helpful or answer questions. This is the type of person who will come out and say, ""oh you seem frustrated or annoyed"", when you're trying to get clarification from him and he's trying to shift the blame away from himself
* Again, when any type of clarifying question, correcting someone, or asking the status of anything is seen as a woman being frustrated
* Being expected to modernize and grow a program, but your boss, his boss, and leadership will not clarify direction or goals in order to do your job. They also will not step in and help when you need help from another department. The theme here is to find the balance between coasting and trying to do what they want, even when they aren't telling you
* When director-levels and above prefer the path of least resistance and try to step around stuff

Stuff like adding more emojis to slack or messaging, without appearing as passive aggressive to soften direct communication.

1b8yl9i,Recovering from a career mistake and losing motivation - how do you recover?,"For reference, I am a male in Canada, 40 years old.  

For my teens and twenties, I was a very ambitious and hard-working individual.  I was never top of my class, but my work ethic always helped me punch above my weight.  I went to a B-level/Tier 2 university, but got a great job out of school and worked my way up  in IT/consulting with my eye on getting into product management.  Every goal I set for myself, I accomplished and I couldn't see any challenge I couldn't overcome.  I went to grad school in 2014 and got my MBA from a great school in Canada and after that I just fell flat.

After getting rejected / no response from several firms, I accepted a product management job at a telco and I feel this was my mistake.  I worked in this role for 5 years trying to find an exit into another product role but could not do so and eventually gave up and went back to consulting.

I wanted to get into product management because I wanted to help create useful software then watch people use it and improve.  This was driven from thinking about the work I enjoyed most in my career   
 \- deep analysis/research on a topic and having to build Excel models/PoC code to demonstrate this, but no one wants me to do this anymore - I am only ever asked to rescue deeply flawed projects / very complex programs.

Although I've moved up, have a great salary and am well regarded, I can't stand what I do.  I'm a generalist and continue to do project-management type work which, although I can do it - I hate it.  I hate not being a SME / chasing after others.  More specifically, I hate myself professionally and feel like a failure for not achieving what I set out to do.

I don't know how to recover from this / reset with myself.  This failure has killed my motivation and ambition and I can't seem to get myself to care about my work.  This mental slide into apathy scares me.

Apologies for the long rant, any advice from those that have been ambitious and faced a challenge similar to this is greatly appreciated.

But I feel like a Customer Service Chat Bot. I currently help to respond to chinese merchants who face issues using when using our products. I am a chinese speaker but the vocab used here is very specific and I find myself relying on translators a lot as speed is key when responding. This leads to a lot of misunderstanding between me and the customers. 

Furthermore, because these are typically e commerce merchant I sometimes find myself in situations where I do become customer service and answer question not related to our product and instead about the ecommerce platform.

While doing this I am also on my final semester and will graduate with a degree in Industrial Engineering. The money is good and my coworkers and supervisors are quite nice. The issue is I am frequently being told I need to be more proactive updating about my scheduele. And while I understand that, I also was not told I would be put in a role that requires me to be present the whole time I am not in class.

Truth to be told I should have realised the expected level of commitment did not match what I was willing to provide. When my direst auperviaor talked about skipping class for her job when she was in uni as well. I dont see myself in this job long term. But it is a position with the promise of full time employment after graduation. And when I think of that I pray they would fire me instead so I dont have a reason to stay. In such a compatitve job market now I dont have the financial luxury of just quitting and I see myself taking the role if I do not have any other prospects. But after a week I can feel myself start to feel burnt out, on certian days it feels worse then when I worked as a waitress in a restaurant.

1b8unzi,Is obtaining a JD in criminal law first a smart choice if I intend to pursue criminology and forensic psychology in grad school and my career path?,"I hold a bachelor's degree in psychology and am seeking a fully-funded scholarship for my graduate studies. While my primary interest lies in criminology and forensic psychology for my master's and PhD, I'm contemplating the addition of a JD with a concentration in criminal law.  
My motivation for pursuing a JD stems from a long-standing curiosity about criminal law and a genuine enthusiasm for the academic challenges it presents. I believe that acquiring a JD, particularly from a competitive school, could enhance my profile in both future job applications and graduate school admissions for criminology and forensic psychology. I also think the knowledge of criminal law will make me do my future job better.

1b8ucw9,[CAREER QUESTION] ENGINEERING IN THE US,"Good day everyone. I'm about to migrate in the United States in about a few weeks from now with my family thru family-sponsored visa. I'm just wondering if y'all can give me tips on where to find a job?

For starters, I just graduated last September with a Bachelors of Science in Electronics Engineering (BSECE, was known as Electronics and Communications Engineering) here in my country. I had a job last November as a Systems Engineer, but I only lasted for a month and half since it was also on short notice on my end that we are migrating soon.


We are planning to stay around Spring Valley, California. I have been finding jobs thru LinkedIN, however, I'm seeing very little opportunities since most of them have a minimum experience of about 2 years, or that I should be pursuing Master's degree first. I also can't see my *actual* course, I'm only seeing electrical engineering or computer engineering requirements which are related to my field, but I'm not sure if it's qualified (As my actual course is, again, **just** Electronics Engineering).

Right now, I'm looking for jobs that are closely related to my field (i.e. hardware engineer, or anything that relates to circuits or microcontrollers and stuff), although I'm also open for anything in I.T. field (like my previous job).


I want to get a job immediately so I can finance for myself, but is it necessary to study for master's to get a job? Any advice will be greatly appreciated!

1b8suuh,How feasible is it to change from civil to software?,"Hi everyone, before I go ahead with my question I would like to thank anyone taking the time to read this I truly appreciate it J

Okay so to keep it short and simple, I work as a Structural engineer but I would love a career change.

To give you some background about me, I am 24 and I have graduated with a first class in Civil Engineering (not sure if my degree matters but I’ll just put it here just in case). I have been working in the industry for 2 years and I really do not see myself doing this my whole life. I have always been into tech and pc’s especially, I have built a couple and my friends always ask me for advice when it comes to tech related stuff. I have also done some coding in the past so I have a very basic knowledge but nothing that a couple of yt videos won’t teach you, so I definitely still have alot to learn and to be honest the idea of that excites me since I really enjoyed the experience of learning whatever I know now. (I know a little bit of python and java). I have always been into problem solving and enjoyed maths and physics hence why I picked civil engineering but unfortunately, I just don’t find it anywhere as interesting as I thought. Ideally, I would love to work in the tech industry, I feel like I will genuinely enjoy my time in it due to my passion even tho I know the work itself will be relatively hard when compared to the basic stuff I do in structural engineering. Also, I really look forward to the possibility of working remotely as I don’t personally enjoy being around people much (I don’t mind it if i have to, but i prefer my own space). I still live with my parents and they have been kind enough to allow me to save some money from my job, so around May time I want  to quit my job and spend the entirety of my time learning some programming languages. I will start the learning process now, but I do plan on doing it “full time” in May. The plan is to then do a masters in computer science or something similar to fast track my way to getting a job. Some people say that this is faster than just doing a bootcamp but please correct me if I’m wrong.

 

Soo, I guess my questions are, would it be possible for me to pursue this assuming I am prepared to put in the hard work? If you were in my position, how would you go about making the transition between the careers, would you rather do a masters (go into more debt lol) or go the bootcamp way? Do employers care about how you got the coding/programming knowledge (youtube/online vs doing an actual cs degree)? Do you have any advice in general?

1b8rupc,Transitioning to a new job and shaping my career,"I'm at a pivotal moment in my career and could use some guidance as I navigate between two intriguing job opportunities.

The new job offers a promising increase in salary and benefits, coupled with the opportunity to join a larger team that can foster my professional growth. They've also expressed their support for me to pursue a cyber tech degree, which aligns perfectly with my aspirations.

Conversely, my current job has presented an alternative path: a new role where I'll have the autonomy to shape my responsibilities and define the trajectory of my work. Unlike the new job, I won't have a structured team, allowing me to take on diverse tasks and craft my own niche within the business. Furthermore, they've committed to supporting my pursuit of a cyber tech degree.

I find myself torn between the structured support of a new environment and the freedom to carve my own path in my current role especially since my only 22. 

For those who have encountered similar dilemmas, how did you weigh the elements involved in your decision-making process? What considerations should I prioritise in determining which route to pursue?

1b8qe24,I don't like my career,"M22, I'm an automotive technician. Recently been dealing with a wrist injury making it impossible to do my job. I'm also wondering if I'm gonna be able to even return at the moment. I make 23 dollars an hour, I have an associates degree of applied science to automotive. I've seen what this industry does to peoples body's. You can't really expect to make money if you can't work like an athlete anymore. You get into your 40s you're basically done, you need to either slow down and accept the lower pay or find a new job. The work is aggravating and can get sweaty bloody and dirty. The shop is loud. There's lots of toxic odors and fumes. My skills might not be useful forever if we transition to electric cars how much work is there really gonna be for us? I don't like the mandated overtime in this industry, and I don't like the toxic work place culture. 

I thought about it and I wanna go back to school to be a radiologist technician. I would probably make 25-30 an hour starting. And I would be able to do this job for my whole life rather than just for the next 20 years. I can see myself being happier in the medical environment than automotive. Especially because I chose to work on cars as a teenager and as an adult now I lost a lot of interest in cars and i just view them as depreciating assets now. 

I know I would have to work hard but I ultimately can see this extra work greatly improving my life and might even lead to me further pursuing a medical career. I can bring my tools home and carry the skills I learned from wrenching and move on from my life. I'm leaning towards making up my mind, but I just want someone else's opinion. Maybe someone who has experience being a rad tech or just advice from any automotive tech who has left the industry. Thank you!

My manager kept promising me of a big project, when they won the project they assigned my colleague in that project. 


They only included me when my colleague said she’d need a supporting resource, mind you my colleague and I are the same age, same experience and same STEM background. 


Even in the project, I’m still treated as a supporting resource, every time I try to step up and take work they only see my colleague. E.g. she was gone for the past two weeks on a leave and I took care of everything, but as soon as she came back they forgot abt me.

1b8p176,"Should I quit, complain, or stick it out at a job I just started due to sudden/frequent travel demands (i have health concerns and a young child)?","I just started a rare career opportunity that seemed proper for me salary-wise, learning, growth,  but the only downside for me was that travel was required. I knew “minimal” travel was indicated/ involved which was not clearly defined but was proposed in the 1st round interview as an “if needed” client scenario. On the 5th round/offer (a referral source insinuated I’d be getting the offer just prior) so was psyched, but the hiring manager indicated the possibility of more “periodic” travel which was not exactly what my referral source described (same role). In retrospect, I should have asked more questions but felt it was a bait and switch. I did indicate that i had a toddler and would not want it to be too frequent or periodic. I accepted the offer with this looming in the back of my head but with the support of my husband encouraging me esp bc of the much needed salary increase. 

Aside from the Mom guilt of separating from my kid and navigating the unexpected with childhood also this. 
Just some bg: I was diagnosed w/ vestibular migraine in 2020 and have taken a while getitng back to a baseline but triggers can include motion, driving, travel. Took a lot of therapy and work to be at a point I could tolerate a plane but needless to say im not 100% there and have anxiety about symptoms returning with all this travel  (all at once) and have not driven long distance in years.   I’m now a month in (90 day trial period) and will be dealing with my 1st work trip soon which entails such unreasonable logistics. (Multiple site visits and 3-4 hr long drives in between remote locations in a trip spanning 4 days). From my understanding from the others in this role, this is just becoming more frequent (although it wasnt prior) as business is expanding. I had assumed it was easy city travel in/out. Again I blame myself for not verifying earlier. Regardless,
What should I do? Is this good enough reason to quit now to avoid the anxiety and unknown as a mother? Should i discuss these concerns w/them so soon to ask for a remote only opportunity?

I think I'd love it on the short term, but not sure if I'd regret it afterwards because of the few job opportunities I feel like there are in the field. The other option is a degree in urban planning / climate adaptation in the city. It is a way more practical, 2-year degree. I like that it is about making cities more sustainable, and that it teaches me practical skills. It is also designed to teach the skills needed in the workplace right now within the field and there's a lot of job opportunities. It would feel good not to worry about getting a job.

1b8nlnc,Am I going to regret sacrificing time for overemploying myself?,"Hello,

I am 26 and have been working as a full-time software engineer for two years. Before that, I was an intern and worked other part-time jobs while in college/university.

I have had part-time and contract/1099 instructional positions for the past 4 years now. Most recently, I secured another part-time position that is very optimal for what I was looking for. Here are my current hourly commitments and incomes:

&#x200B;

|**Job**|**Weekly Hours**|**Annual Income**|Time at Company|Environment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Software Engineer|40 (Full-time)|$105,000 ($50/hour)|2 years|Work-from-home (WFH)|
|Part-time instructor|5-8 (Part-time)|$6000 ($25/hour)|2 years|WFH|
|Part-time instructor|\~10 (Part-time/1099)|$8000 ($25/hour)|Just started (New Employee)|WFH|

Overall

Recently, I've been considering picking up another job with hopefully more hours and maybe more pay. I just have a few concerns:

1. **Time/Effort**: I previously worked a second full-time job, but it did not work out. Overall, the specific hours were not ideal. As this was a second job, I was not really looking for anything with intense commitment and it required too much of that between multi-tasking and dealing with belligerent/confrontational customers, and I was eventually fired. I found myself always having to be using my time for something either personal or work-related (laundry, personal paperwork, etc.). I would like to spend more time learning valuable tech skills, but I lack it with working about 60 hours per week.
2. **Lacking in software skills/time to learn**: I've always felt a bit behind my peers with my tech and software engineering skills. I've always worked multiple jobs and never had the time to learn new concepts. Recently, I've had some extra time and still have not done as much as I've wanted. I used to want to be in the top tier of software engineers, but I'm older now and out of university for some time. I did not attend a top university and I feel so far behind in many situations.
3. **Lack of commitment to SWE job**: With my job as a software engineer, I pretty much stick to a 8-5 schedule. Since the company is very large, I find myself unable to proceed with my work because I lack experience/information or because I do not have access to certain resources. I feel guilty in some ways about logging off at 5PM because a lot of my team works later (usually until 7-8 PM). Sometimes, I am required to work later, but there is overtime that is paid in those cases and it does not happen often. I have always maintained a habit of only working more hours than expected if paid for the extra time. I check email and messages for work after hours and would respond like if someone specifically needs me, but I never get into habits of actually logging on to help someone unless it is urgent and understandably necessary.

The ideal second job I am looking for is probably a 25-35 hour/week job. I would like to work some job in technology or technical capacity. Even tech support would be fine, but I would prefer to be doing support in a B2B environment and not a B2C one, and those are hard to get from the applications I have done so far.

I have also thought about doing freelance software development, but I don't really know where to start . I've always thought that by the time I secured clientele and finish all the work (with more stress), I would have made the same amount of money with a lot more effort, but I probably would have learned more in the process.

Most recently, I've been feeling very alone but with a lot of money. I'm not dating anyone and I don't really have any friends. I always find myself excluded from friend groups. I had close friends before, but they eventually all drifted apart or stopped responding. I was always told that after 30 or around the time everyone is married, the whole ""friends"" and ""social"" aspects go away. Sometimes, I feel like an asshole with always ""having to work"" and ""moving on"" to the next pocket of time I am getting paid for. But, I feel insulted and let down when I hear of people making more than I do. I believe I should be doing better than I am today. I feel like I lowered my standards 10 years ago and I have not felt as great about myself as I used to. I've recently been feeling that I'm getting older and ""YOLO"" advice is starting to really get to me.

I don't really have any expenses right now since I live with my parents. I'm not a homeowner, I am not divorced or separated, and I don't have children. I'm just putting all this money in some aggressive S&P 500 funds and watching it grow in hopes that some day, I'll have nice things and won't have to work anymore. I'm planning to get married at some point, and I'm hoping to pay my primary mortgage off early so that my wife won't have to work as much as I do.

So, any thoughts on what would be the best option for a another job right now? And am I missing out on life by working a lot?",anonymous2454,1,1.0,5,1709792762,2024-03-07 06:26:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b8nlnc/am_i_going_to_regret_sacrificing_time_for/,3,2024
1b8nhsq,"Career tips for new grad (ON, Canada)","Hi 

I got my BA in Psychology in Ontario Canada. The courses I scored in most were developmental psychology. Enjoyed cultural psychology and social psychology as well. 

I have a certificate in mental health first aid. Also certified in standard first aid and CPR. 

I have 8 months experience working part time at the student career development office helping uni students with job search and resume and cover letters etc. 
As part of this job, I facilitated 1 in-person and several virtual workshops on topics such as intro to resume, intro to cover letter, intro to interviews and intro to job search. I also wrote a blog article https://www.uwindsor.ca/career-development-experiential/1188/reminder-take-care-yourself-during-your-job-search

I have 16 months volunteer experience at my university as a peer counsellor to help students with emotional support and referrals. During this period I helped plan a bunch of outreach activities like a book club night, pot painting, games night all to promote the centre’s services and promoting self care. I also got training in trauma-informed care, suicide prevention, substance use, developmental disorders etc. 

I have previously done a summer job where I did - transcription and proofreading for an author who got her book published by penguin random house India. 

That is my educational background and work experience.

I am an international student so I know what it is like to adjust to a foreign culture, have learned a lot about myself. I have lived experience with depression and anxiety (potentially adhd/autism, I have yet to be assessed) 

Having said all that, I want to work in mental health + social work + healthcare industry. I am incredibly (sometimes a little too much) passionate about mental health advocacy and understanding human psychology. I know I need to have a masters or a PhD to work as a therapist or equivalent. But for the time being, all I have is my bachelors degree and the desire to help my community and people in general (especially vulnerable sector)

I will do my masters at a later time as I haven’t yet decided what I would like to specialize in. Not sure yet if clinical psychology is the path for me. 

The reason I’m posting is… I’m looking for any and all advise or tips you all might have regarding the direction of my career and how to make it fulfilling. And also what kind of jobs I can look for (pls drop some keywords to start my search) 

It doesn’t have to be healthcare or social work per se but anything that utilizes knowledge or understanding of human psychology. 

Please do not comment that having a bachelors degree in psychology won’t get me anywhere. I don’t want to take on the whole world on day 1. Just want to make my way into the field and make some difference in at least somebody’s life.

1b8na3t,Should I Accept the Offer,"I applied for a job after a client I have been working with for the last year suggested I apply for his position after he was promoted. My current job is in environmental consulting and the new job is in mining. I interviewed and am now weighing the terms of the offer I received. It's very attractive... with bonuses the pay is almost twice my current salary (225k vs 115k). Great benefits too. I would have to move within a year to a beautiful, albeit expensive mountain town. The obvious ""pro"" is the compensation package. 

My reservation is I love my current job and team and I wasn't looking for a new job. This kinda fell in my lap. I've also only ever worked in my current job (14y)...so a change is kind of a big deal for me.

My current job is also very flexible...I am 100% remote. New job would be 3x days in office. I currently feel a bit isolated, so some time back in the office is ok with me, although I'd prefer 1-2 days a week.

Lastly and perhaps most importantly, I also spend about 2-3  months out of the year working remotely from my mom's place...she is older and it's very important to me that I can continue to visit and work remotely while I'm there. The new job is a desk job and can be done remotely. But I worry that a new employer would not be open to this kind of arrangement.

So, what do you all think?

1) Work for an industry you are passionate about, enjoy the work, but is paying you less than you would like, and you also find that you end up clashing with the company's culture, people, and management styles.

I left my career in education just as I was transitioning into Assistant Superintendent level positions due to sudden onset disability. I have spent the last 6 years getting my health together and ready to step back into the field. It would be career suicide to disclose my disability during the application process (it's a chronic illness that is pretty controlled now and invisible until it isn't.) How does one explain my absence? Most of my former supervisors have since passed away during the pandemic or moved on and we lost contact. I spent the intervening years doing fellowships or contract work. Should I use former clients as references? I have been told to take a step back into Principal type positions and work my way back up but references may be an issue.

1b8lx5q,Should I leave small company with family ties?,"I’ve worked for several years at a small engineering firm. I’m related to the owner of the company. With it being small and me having worked with them as I went through college I’m already in a management role within the company even though I only graduated a couple of years ago. I generally have liked the job but as I’ve progressed into this managment role I’m more stressed, enjoy work less, and feel that I’ve learned about all I can from my superiors. I also keep getting tasked with things that I don’t enjoy and not given tasks with the type of work I am passionate about (which I’ve expressed to them).  The career path I’m on is to become a principal at this company which could very well be the most lucrative opportunity I’d ever get long-term in the field.  I get paid well now not being a principal, but I know I could make just as much or likely more with less responsibility if I got a corporate job.

I am beginning to feel less passionate about the types of projects we do and have interest in learning more and working on larger scale projects that I know generally are awarded to large corporate firms. I know my experience at this small firm has given me a lot of opportunities to gain a variety of skills that are rare for someone as early in the career as I am so I’d be an attractive candidate to anyone.   

If I left my job now, I wouldn’t have the option of coming back (I’d left once before and came back already for a corporate job in the same discipline for which I’m less passionate about now).  I’m afraid that if I go the corporate route in the discipline I’m drawn to, I won’t like it how I think I will and I’ll become just a cog in the machine and lose my power to play a significant role in the work I do. I’m afraid that if I stay the course I’m on, I’ll live a life full of stress and lack of passion for the work I do. Either option will long term be able to provide for my family. I am just paralyzed with fear at making the wrong decision- a decision which will affect the rest of my life.

I’m usually a happy person but lately I’ve been in a funk. I do like the people I work with but I’m losing interest in what I do. The last few months I’m losing sleep because I’m stressed or dreading going to work the next day.

When I was 18 I graduated highschool and started looking for a job. No one would hire me. I mean nobody it was crazy. Since I couldn't find a job I started freelancing and writing to make money.  Still kept looking for jobs but couldn't find any.

At 20, I got a real job but was fired in two weeks after making the stupid mistake of forgetting to charge my computer and having to leave work early. I quit freelancing and tried looking for a 9 to 5 job for four years. No one would hire me.

At 24 I realized that I've been unemployed for 4 years. So, I went back to freelance writing, gig work,  being a independent contractor and baby sitting.

1b8jvpc,"Built a business, now I need to build a career","Hi everyone! Quick background story: 26M, just moved to the US, dropped out from some no-name college in Europe (Business Bachelor’s) because while I was there, I was helping the family business (located in the US, so the hour difference was killing me) and “visiting” them to work every summer and Christmas vacations, so finally 3 months ago I moved here.  
  
My experience? Couple months short from 6 years growing that business from nothing to 6 figures, Excel, analytical thinking business-wise, some data analysis (very low level) and honestly I think more knowledge than the degree would ever give me (mind this is a blue collar business).  
  
So, we come today. Business is already set and done, we are not planning on expanding (even though we could) because family already makes enough to pay a nice house, is looking to buy a 50k car and 2-3 vacations per year.  
  
What’s next? This is not my business and I am honestly not interested in continuing it, just wanted to set my family because they migrated to the US not that young. I am really interested in data analysis mostly or maybe business analysis of some kind with data involved; preparing for it I am studying SQL, Power BI, more Excel, Python (and some extras like cloud services).  
  
What kind of job level should I look for? Is looking for a data analyst position just an impossible dream? Do I have to start from some entry data clerk job (I hope not, honestly)? About the business analyst positions, I guess I start looking at early careers too?

So I have ""just"" started a new job (Nov 2023) it's a sales job in finance... I am not great at it trying hard though, doing extra hours, trying to learn.
I make base + commission. So far I have hit commission once, in Dec, but last 2 months.... not even close. 
My commission target is doubling as the first 3 months you have a lower target to get you on board. 
This concerns me slightly due to being soooo far off making commission last 2 months.

A bank has opened a position in the same field but more managerial and less salesy. Based on the role and exp listed I think I would be a solid/above average candidate.

The pay would be 17k above my base wage but obviously no chances at commission. 

The reason I am looking is due to being a bit disheartened in the outcomes and then the doubling of my target to earn commission. 

Am I jumping too soon? Should I be giving this position more of a chance? ",ThrowRAThrowAwayRat,2,1.0,2,1709779175,2024-03-07 02:39:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b8j4b0/change_jobs_or_not/,3,2024
1b8ij5l,Law or acting/directing/producing. Please help!,"Hi, this is my first time asking question so not sure if I am doing it right. Here's what I need help with:

I am 31, female. I took the LSAT and got a 99th percentile score. I have a good GPA and I'm fairly certain I will get into a good enough law school with some decent scholarship. But I am struggling to make this jump because I want to get into acting/filmmaking instead. My family and friends think I am crazy since with my LSAT score I could get into the top law schools and have a very successful legal career. 

Background on me: I came to the US from a third world country as a student. I was always the top my my class and got here on a full ride scholarship. I wanted to make this move to filmmaking/acting career even before I came here but it was impossible in my native country. I thought I would somehow figure it out in school once I got here, but I had to get a STEM degree (reluctantly because I needed to have a way of staying in the US after my degree). Then I had to basically get a job and get my employer to sponsor my permanent residency and then couldn't leave the job until I became a permanent resident last year. During my time here, I realized I have excelled in anything I had an interest in, for ex, I would always start at the bottom and then almost always rise to the top in any activity like dancing, singing, writing, public speaking, etc. I wanted to emphasize this because I believe this quality will probably also work with my acting/filmmaking skills. I know I will start at the bottom but within a few years I can probably be very good at those skills. And I also don't need to become an Oscar winning actor/director. I just want to be able to do this job and be old working in this field.

I am in a major dilemma because I am a 31yo female whose biological clock is ticking. I also gathered courage to leave my abusive husband last year. While not having kids maybe an advantage because I want to switch career and get into  filmmaking but I am also dreading how to navigate this super competitive field. Since I had always been good at school, there is no doubt I will succeed in law school. But when I imagine myself as a 50 year old lawyer, I just keep imagining this massive regret that I could not gather enough courage to pursue what I really wanted to do. That would make me miserable even if I am a very successful partner making millions every year at a prestigious law firm.

Also, may or may not be relevant - I have about $500k saved up in investments. I am planning to not touch this money until I am 60. Even at a 7% return, this money will grow to about 4 million dollars by the time I am 60. So even if I make no money working in the film industry for the next 30 years, I will still retire fairly well. This will allow me to work without any anxieties about my financial future and being a homeless bag lady at my old age.

About my personality - I am the kind of person that would rather work 14-16 hours in a job that I find interesting that work 6 hours in a chill job. This tendency got especially exacerbated in college and I used to get D's in the easiest classes while get A (actually 100 on most tests) in the most difficult high level math classes. So I NEED to be intellectually stimulated and challenged, and I would love for me to find projects that make me want to work 20 hours a day. That is the definition of a fulfilling life for me. I know this is not how most people think, but this is ME. Please help me figure this out.",lsat_student12345,2,1.0,0,1709777558,2024-03-07 02:12:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b8ij5l/law_or_actingdirectingproducing_please_help/,3,2024

It has changed from a looser, work on what you want and you will get a % of the profit type roll, to a more rigid corporate structured roll. This isn't a problem for me, except at this time, I have not progressed much in my career since starting this job. Today, I was told that the structure of my team, which is currently just me and one other person would again change. Now it is being split into two, with director-level roles opening up for each part, and I will be given the choice to apply to my new department's director position. I was also told that I would immediately be the favored choice.   
I’ve been craving more responsibilities and challenges, so ordinarily, I would eagerly embrace the opportunity. However, I was informed that it’s a one-way street, and if I don’t meet their expectations within 3 months, I’ll be let go. This gave me some pause, mainly because it made me believe that they do not have confidence in me for this new position. Overall, I have a good job that pays well, and I'm confident in it, but I still want to grow in my career... that being said, I don't want to take a position if the most likely outcome is getting fired 3 months from now.

My goal in my career right now is to learn as much as I can. I'm not totally sure if I want to be a software engineer, but I have had the most experience/exposure to that.  
I'm currently a soon-to-be graduate this coming May and I'm unsure if I should join the workforce as a Software Engineer at a Defense Company in San Diego or a two-year rotational program as a Systems Analyst at a bank in New York.  
I've tried to make a pros and cons list which I'll include below as a point of reference. I want to be able to gain the most out of my first job which would make me more marketable for future job prospects. I would really love any insight or opinions you guys could give me! (Also feel free to dm me)  
**San Diego**

* Job Title: Software Engineer, Hybrid
* Company: Defense Company
* Base Salary: 88k
* Team: Software Development
* Software Engineer
* Focus on applications used across the app
* Languages: Javascript, NodeJS, Angular

**Pros:**

* Job security/stability, permanent position + Job title
* People are nice, WLB seems more chill bc defense
* Higher pay
* In-demand languages, I know what I'm getting myself into
* Larger company (93,000 people). Better name-recognition and alumni network?

**Cons:**

* Will likely end a long-term relationship
* Defense industry
* Slow-paced, pigeonholes me into SWE

**New York**

* Job Title: Systems Analyst, Hybrid
* Company: Old, Private Bank
* Base Salary: 75k
* Team: Rotations (So not one specific team); will be placed in teams according to my resume initially (and business needs?); unsure about the experience I'd receive. Spoke to some successful alumni who had exposure in DevOps, Frontend Dev, and Workday Integration. Across the board with tech I can learn.

**Pros:**

* Better industry (interested in both tech and finance)
* Ability to learn multiple types of tech(?) More freedom to move around and explore career paths.
* Closer to long-term relationship/great location. Love NY
* Nicer office, nice people

**Cons:**

* Weird Position title/temporary, unsure what I am gonna be doing for 2 years
* Salary is LOW for NY, which is HCOL.
* Bad entry-level job? Unsure
* Less support/alumni network.
* Company culture and WLB seems slightly worse.
* Transferability of skills?

Both companies have about the same name WLB/culture and recognition, though the NY job has a better office. Just wondering which job I should take to open more doors and increase career growth I guess. Thanks in advance for any help!

So I work for a large ish non profit. We have a large HR department and a union which I am a part of.

When I was offered the job, the salary offered was at the bottom of the pay range they were required to publicly list and lower than I wanted. I countered, explaining my reasons, market rate, my exp etc. 

I then had a meeting with the head of HR and she said she hears what I’m saying but was clear that it’s non negotiable as this position is slotted for this exact amount regardless of other circumstances or candidate and that because there are 4 people being hired for this role and the nature of the position, each person in this role will be making the same amount as the others so negotiating is a moot point. 

So I trusted what she was saying and accepted at the lower amount and have been working here for almost a year. Now they are going through restructuring and eliminated a role above me and offered that person the chance to either be laid off or accept the same role as me and the 4 others which will now be expanded to a team of 5. They are also letting this person keep their salary which is about 10k higher than me and the others in the role, becasue they say it is still in the pay band for our position and position grade. (Note this person has also been on the team for a similar time as the rest of us and also less than a year).

So naturally I feel misled since I was told each person in this role would be making the same amount and that the salary for this role was locked in with no room to negotiate. Do I have a good reason now to approach HR or my manager and ask that my salary be updated to reflect this new team restructure?",thirsty_pretzelzz,1,1.0,7,1709766031,2024-03-06 23:00:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b8e4qx/feeling_misled_about_salary_amid_changes_should_i/,3,2024

1b8c9vc,Financial Call Center Hell,"Hello everyone and thank you for reading. I work in the financial services industry at a large wirehouse. I have been here for 5 months and I have never experienced a more toxic and brutal work environment in my life. 
First off, it is a call center. We take back to back incoming calls all day for shit pay, no bonuses, and are micromanaged to death. We get no breaks at all. I have to almost run to the bathroom and make sure no one sees me or realizes Im in After Call Aux... Yes I know its illegal but they do it anyways and somehow get away with it. If I show up to work early a manager usually pings me to ""hop on the queue"" even if its not my shift. Im a financial advisor, licensed with my series 7 and 66 and all, but my job is almost entirely clerical. 
I would have left this hell the moment I realized what I got myself into but my wife wants me to stay due to the alleged benefits I will receive from staying here. She is pregnant with our second child and due soon and I dont know what to do. 
My doctor explained to me that no amount of perceived workplace benefits are worth divorce or the psych ward which is what will happen to me if I continue at this job. I have developed off the charts high cholesterol and really bad physical health issues along with depression, panic, and constantly think about unaliving myself due to this job. 
Secondly, I have experienced racism, workplace bullying, and even threats to me physically here. The turnover here is atrocious with almost no one lasting more than a year. 
So, next week I have a couple interviews lined up for financial planner positions at small RIA's and I hope I get the job. The crux of the issue is that my alleged benefit, think paid parental leave, is supposed to start next Sept and my wife wants me to stay at this place to be able to take advantage of that, but I know i cant mentally cope with that. For the record, I was at my last job for 7 years and have a great relationship with my previous manager and coworkers. 

Please, if someone could give me some advice I would be forever thankful. ",Dense_Paper260,3,1.0,0,1709761657,2024-03-06 21:47:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b8c9vc/financial_call_center_hell/,3,2024

1b8awux,Put in my notice but have to miss days for interviews within the notice period? ,"Put in my two weeks but have to miss a few days/partial days for interviews.

So essentially my current company screwed me over by promising me a promotion for several months before they decided to give to my coworker/ unfortunately my best friend, instead. HR issued a simple “sorry for the misunderstanding” when I brought this to their attention. My boss is the only person I am upset with. 

Obviously there’s a bit more to this story, but this about sums it up. It was so unfair that my friend considered not taking it, but I urged her to anyways. So as soon as I found out I put in a 2.5 week notice on the spot. I work in a field where it’s easy to find a new job, so I wasn’t worried about not having anything lined up. 

So I have three interviews scheduled over the next week, and … oops… they all take place during workdays. Tomorrow I have a doc appt at 10:30 that I need to go to before I lose health insurance (they just so happened to have a cancellation, and this is an appt. with an oncologist, so I’m going). Then I have an interview I’d already scheduled at 3. So I’m going to miss the entire day. When my boss asks why I can’t come in for a half day, I’m just going to say the doctor appt took longer than expected 🤷‍♀️ 

I think there’s a chance I’ll be fired for it, but if not, then I have another full day of interviews next Wednesday (lol) so I’ll have to miss that day. This would be 2 weeks and 1 day after I put in my notice, so whatever. I didn’t owe them the extra 3 days. I am willing to work every single other day included in my notice, but I have to get another job so the interviews are more important obviously, and none of them offered times outside of typical work hours.

So I guess I’m just looking for some advice on how others would navigate this situation. If I don’t get fired tomorrow, I’m sure I’ll be fired next week. I guess it doesn’t really matter , but I didn’t want to completely burn any bridges. Do you think it’s too late for that all things considered? Thanks!

1b8aenk,Applying for a job with the competitor,"My region has two major specimen processing labs, let’s call them Lab Alpha and Lab Beta. I currently work at the smaller one of the two, Lab Beta. In fact, I’ve only been working here for a month.

 I just completed my training and finally passed my competency assessment after 2 failed attempts. I do bloodwork and various other tests as well as specimen sorting. 

Before I got hired at lab Beta, my dream was to work at Lab Alpha but unfortunately they weren’t hiring at the time. They have a higher hourly wage, an extra $4 per hour, and a much more stable schedule. Lab Beta however pays less, and expects you to drive to whatever lab they tell you (within an 80 kilometre radius). They can call you as early as 5 am which makes me a bit anxious because I’m not sure how I can plan my day if I’m never able to tell whether I’ll be working or not, since I’ll be given such short notice as opposed to a typical timetable schedule, which lab Alpha will offer.

I just got a call from my friend who works with lab alpha and she let me know that they are indeed hiring now and that I should send my resume in. Because I already have some experience there’s a good chance I’ll get hired.

My question is, is it rude for me to apply to lab Alpha after struggling through training for a month with lab Beta? I just don’t know how I can look my manager in the face and tell her I’m quitting after just a month. I definitely don’t want to tell anyone that I’m applying to the competitors, has anyone else been in this situation?

1b89w2f,I'm at a career crossroads and not sure what you choose.,"So I find myself in a very difficult situation and I'm having a difficult time making a decision. I'm in the middle of a massive career choice with two options.

I could stick with my current job of almost 10 years which has a significant amount of vacation time, health care insurance that covers almost everything at a low cost, the option to have days off almost whenever I want, and a total annual salary around 92k now and 102k in 2027 with an eventual Pension after 25-35 years. The caveat is I don't necessarily enjoy the job. It's a VERY toxic work environment. Management is basically encouraged to set people up and try to fire them for anything they can and it is the kind of job where I constantly have to make sure I'm doing everything correctly which can be pretty stressful.

The other option is a supposedly incredibly healthy work environment with a small group of people where I really think I would be valued as an employee. I would start at 70k and should be 80k salary after 90 days. But significantly less paid vacation time, pretty good health insurance, and not a lot of availability to have days off but if I do have a good reason they would work with me. Plus they match retirement up to 3% of my total income.

I'm leaning towards the other option as the current job I have is incredibly toxic and genuinely I do not enjoy it. The customers are great, but the management is basically tasked with firing people for anything they can. They'll even purposely not warn someone that what they're doing is wrong just to ""gather evidence"" against them to build a case.

TLDR: The black and white is my current job would be better financially (100k a yr + Pension) in the long run but management is basically trying to fire people, so if I could make it to the end of my career it technically would be better. But the other option is still a good pay (80k a yr + monthly bonus around $200) and a work environment where I think would be valued, but ultimately I would have to retire at an older age and wouldn't make quite as much.",Automatic-Jury5729,1,1.0,1,1709755964,2024-03-06 20:12:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b89w2f/im_at_a_career_crossroads_and_not_sure_what_you/,3,2024

I am a front desk first contact person, and she has systematically stripped away my accesses and authorities to information. However, what bothers me at the moment is if she is passing my desk when a visitor approaches the desk, she interrupts my interaction with them and usurps me. There is a process to one of my duties, which involves having prior knowledge she doesn't have because SHE DOESN'T DO MY JOB. Today, as she walked by, she took over a conversation, the kind I have handled many times--because I do it every day--overriding the questions I was already asking the individual. She went looking through the file cabinet behind me for something that I already knew wasn't there.

1b882uj,"Need help overall, much appreciated if you take the time to read this","Hello all, hope you are well. 

I will share my whole story in this paragraph. I was born in Thessaloniki, Greece in 1998. I finished high school with a near perfect GPA (19.7 / 20 ) while taking mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and programming and had the opportunity to go to any greek university I wanted because of my grades. I decided to go to medical school after finishing high school, at 18, so I applied and got accepted. A couple months later I started facing some serious mental health problems which only got worse as the time progressed. Overall I was in an awful state health wise from 18 to 23. It took me 2 years to recover completely but after all I didn't manage to get a degree. I quit medical school in the meantime because I could not cope. I have only worked at Teleperformance Greece for almost a year in this whole period. I have 135 IQ and my only skills are computer literacy, speaking English, speaking greek, and a lot of soft skills from my role as a Customer Service Advisor. Right now I am still at Teleperformance Greece but I am getting paid peanuts and there is no career progression. I have applied for some roles as a Greek speaking customer account advisor for a betting company which will be paying me a normal salary if I they decide to hire me but I will have to relocate to Malta.

Overall, there is not much I can do, from my point of view. I do not think I will manage to start university again in a new field from the beginning and live for 4 years without a salary. 

What would you do if you were me? Any advice will be greatly appreciated. I think that a 7 year gap in my resume is unfixable.

1b86k8b,Job offer/college goals?,"I am a 21 year old enrolled in a high end business school. I recently applied to a job at an electrical supply warehouse, doing sales. Job title sounds super fancy despite just making sales via customers in person, otp, and via email. I got the job. 

Pay is $25/hr with 10% commission they expect me to sell ~$350,000 worth of material per year and after four or so years I could move to “outside sales” with same level of commission but expected sales to be ~$2,000,000 a year… yeah I could be close to HENRY at that point. Lots of bulk selling supplies to other suppliers and larger unions. This could be a good gig. Here is the catch though. I am going to school for my MBA and accounting and have dreamed of a more corporate career. Maybe not too harshly but definitely something in consulting or directing. The kind of job where I can show up at 9AM wearing a suit and tie, start wrapping up my day and 2:30 or 3:00. I also crave autonomy. Seems like every wealthy person with a career can make time for life at a 1pm on a Tuesday. 

There are opportunities to move up in this company. I personally plan on never staying at a company longer than ~4 years once I have my degree to maximize earning and gaining seniority asap to achieve that beautiful autonomy. 

The only downsides to this job is you have to start a 6:30AM. BUT I can leave at 3:30. I was also told I could skip my lunch and either show up at 7:30 or leave at 2:30. 

This is my first full time job while doing school full time as well. And I am worried I could be in over my head but this is a HUGE offer. I mean the math comes out to well over $30 a hour when you add median commission. I really take pride in my education, my gpa is ~3.9 and I am on the deans list at a top 10 business school. 


Should I take the job and maintain school. Should I try it out and if I start fucking up my schooling should I quit. I will say there is zero opportunity for part time work at this company. But there is no overtime as well getting off at 2:30/3:30 leaves ample time for schooling I’d assume. But no more late night studying.  

I have already had to drop and reschedule several classes that took place in person first thing in the morning. I am honestly just terrified of burnout or failure by trying to over achieve.

If this is off topic or not allowed please remove or let me know. Thanks in advance for listening to my rant, and any advice is warmly welcomed.  
My inability to get a job has reached insane heights. I have a masters in healthcare administration and I'm trying to get a consulting position. I've been trying for about 1.5 yrs with no luck. I have truly tried it all. I had professionals create my resume, and linkedin page. I've applied to firms of all sizes and prestige, connected/tried to connect with many recruiters and fellow professionals. I've applied to so many places with referrals. The worst part is that out of probably nearing a thousand applications, I've gotten like 2 first round interviews, so I have nothing to actually build on or improve. Using glassdoor, linkedin etc, I can also see who has the jobs I'm applying for, the position's general salary, and in some cases who likely got a job that I applied for. Rarely will it be someone who comes close to my education and experience. I'm also in no way overqualified because I hit the basic qualifications, and most of the preferred qualifications without going over them. I understand that posts like these have been on here and people go thru the same thing. However, from what I've seen it'll be from someone who is at least getting some interviews then ghosted, or someone who has a useless degree, or someone who is fresh out of undergrad. I acknowledge that this may be a little bias, but I feel that very few people are in my situation.

1b83cqx,Should I join the military?,"I graduated in December with a computer science degree. I was initially proud of myself since I not only graduated but did so with a 4.0 GPA, but I’m no longer proud anymore for a variety of reasons. I won’t bother going into all of the reasons why, but one major reason is that I can’t even get a job interview. I think I have a good idea why too.

While I’ve been in school for the past 6 years, I’ve only had one job that lasted a year. That was 4 years ago. I left that job because I relocated to another city to finish out my degree, and I just never worked after that while in school. I’m almost 27 now and I’ve only had two jobs my entire life. One job I held for 2 years before attending community college. The second job was 2 years after that, which I held for a year. These are serious gaps in my employment that I’m sure some recruiter is looking at and either laughing at the gall I have for applying, or they’re immediately tossing my resume without a second thought. I don’t know how to overcome this. If I stop applying and get a basic retail job right now, then these gaps are still going to exist. Realistically, I’ll have to get like 5 years of continuous employment to overcome it. However, if I do that for a year from now with no relevant job for my degree, then my education becomes irrelevant. Not landing a relevant job after school is yet another reason for them to toss my application without a second thought.

The more I think about it, the military seems like my only option in life if I can’t even get a job interview for what I went to school for. If I go in enlisted, however, I probably won’t be given a job pertaining to my field. This would also render my degree useless, but I guess I could focus on a military career and just do that? Is this realistically my only option? It seems like it is to me, but I don’t know what to think anymore.

1b82lss,"Interim Promotion, No Raise","I work for a Fortune 500 Company, and have for the past seven years. I started in an entry-level call center position, and have since worked my way to a status as a 'senior representative', though my duties are the relatively the same as when they started. I've interviewed for a coaching position twice (basically, it's a support role for my current job), and did not get it. The third time I interviewed, I received an offer for a 6 month interim position for the role (it was clear it was an interim role). 

However, there is no increase in pay. I want to be clear I am grateful for the opportunity, and this promotion, albeit (potentially) temporary, will provide me with skills and responsibilities that will be a welcome addition to my resume and assist me on my career path. However, I still feel that I should be receiving an adjustment in compensation for the higher level work and increased responsibility. 

There are a couple of other factors at play as well. 

* We just received our yearly pay increase, and I feel that this will be brought up if I ask to negotiate a pay increase. However, the increase was 4%, and while appreciated, I'm still making less than last year due insurance premium increases. 
* I am behind in my career (I'm 37). This is mainly due to being undiagnosed ADHD for most of my life, which meant school was difficult, and I spent a lot of my life thinking I was stupid and not trying. It took my seven years to finish my bachelor's degree, I spent a lot of my 20s traveling and teaching English in different countries. I finally settled in the USA around the age of 30 and got a 'real job'. 
* I know I am accountable for my own career and path - but navigating it has always been 10x harder due to being ND. I'm not looking to argue this with anyone, but that's the reason. I'm in therapy, receiving treatment, and the first year after I received treatment, I received glowing reviews for my improvements at work. I'm never going to have a job I'm enthusiastic about due to my ADHD - I just want a job that I can tolerate, so I can enjoy life on my own time. 
* This promotion is extremely valuable to me, and will be key to me getting out of the 'entry-level customer service' trap that many find themselves in. I understand that this is a great opportunity and I'm extremely grateful for it. 
* I'm worried about coming off as ungrateful, but I know if I phrase it correctly and approach it in the right way, I won't. You don't get what you don't ask for, right? Worst that can happen is I'm told 'no'.  No one is going to advocate for me, that is up to me. 
* I have already accepted the position, so I may have screwed myself in that respect.  


Any advice on how to navigate and approach this?

1b82fav,Career Pivot/ Dissatisfied in Current Role & Industry,"I (30M) currently work in real estate private equity in a finance & operations role and have become disillusioned with the nature of the job itself and the soul crushing hours. It’s particularly bad at this company, just this week we had an emergency AHOD in my department at 7:00 pm to address questions from upper management that lasted hours. There doesn’t seem to be any realistic way to set boundaries with this firm as it just seems this is how things are done. I feel like my only solution is to leave but that’s where my particular conundrum comes in: I don’t even really want to stay in this industry anymore and want to transition completely. 

At my last firm I worked closely with our “IT” team and fell in love with Python and software development just through observation of what they were able to do. I realized I want to be more hands-on on the technical side of programming, it just interested me from the jump. I decided to enroll back in school to pursue a second degree in computer science starting this summer with the full intention of learning as much as I can and continuing down that path. 
I don’t mind working a full-time job while taking courses but it cannot be in my current company. I’m working way too many hours and they’re erratic. I fortunately do have enough saved to take some time off from working if necessary although I’d rather not have a glaring gap in my resume. 

My problem is I now don’t know what role I could transition to that makes sense in me trying to bridge the gap from my previous experience to what I’m trying to do. What are my most viable next steps from your experiences?

1b7yong,Coworker is too intense?,"Around a month ago, we had a new starter join our team at work. I don't have anything against them personally as they seem like a genuinely friendly person. However, they are really stressing me out at work because of how intense they are. 

To give a few examples:

- They often stand behind me and look over my shoulder as I'm working. 

- They stand around waiting for me to join them for lunch / wait behind me for me to return to the office after lunch.

- They make comments such as 'I think I've annoyed (my name)' and 'You can stop talking about me now' when they re-enter a room.'

- They regularly ask me for feedback on how they are doing and for me to let them know if there's anything they're doing that annoys me. I am not their manager and this makes me feel uncomfortable when they ask this of me.

- Messaging me when I'm off sick.

--

Since they started, it feels the whole dynamics of the team have changed and my colleagues don't sit in the office any more as they find it difficult to concentrate with the newbie trying to make conversation or constantly asking questions- which is beginning to isolate me from everyone else.

I'm looking for advice as to whether I'm overreacting and just need to get over it. Or if there's something I should be doing, as it's starting to affect me mentally.

At the moment, the internet, although it sometimes didn't do much good for my mental health sometimes for personal reasons, is more useful than my own fucking family in explaining things to me and in comforting me in moments when I really want to be heard and understood. Luckily, my family didn't throw me out of the house because of my sexual orientation or my religious beliefs (I'm not religious) because, according to them, they still ""love me"", but they are still homophobic (especially my mother, my father is much less homophobic and he even had a gay male person as a friend and schoolmate, but he is still not entirely in favor of me having a different sexual orientation although he rarely expresses it) and my mother is resentful that I abandoned Catholicism. Maybe she almost never causes me problems because of my sexual orientation (although sometimes she annoys me a little in a notoriously irritating way for not being a religious person like her), but she does because of other things and that is too frustrating (and rarely sometimes she infantilizes my autism in a subtle way, which is, without a doubt, very irritating for me). Anyway, I'm also not entirely open about my sexuality with my parents because of their same homophobic attitudes... Also, I don't really trust them at all, so I'm not entirely open with them anyway.

So, well, I have a conservatively religious mother who is a b&tch that I really hate, a more libertarian conservative father but who still doesn't fully understand me nor does he understand at all how my own feelings work (by the way, my dad also has autism spectrum disorder like me and I still can't believe that we are still both different people) and a centrist semi-closeted lesbian sister with an introverted cold character; very simple, superficial and shallow speech; and with a propensity to get very irritated if someone or something bothers her too much. 

The thing is, well... A lot of things have happened since I finished high school in 2020. I don't want to mention details at all. The story is very long, complex and... I just don't feel like telling any of it.

The thing is that I will go back to university this year.  I will study at USAT (Universidad Católica Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo) here in Chicayo, a private university and the most prestigious in the Lambayeque region (there in the United States there are ""states"" and here in Peru there are ""regions"", thank you). My parents cannot pay more than that, they say that me being in other cities is more expensive for them and they prefer that I stay in Chiclayo. My biggest dream (although, at the moment, that dream is impossible, pathetic, impractical, very expensive and very far away from where I currently live right now) is to be a creator, director and writer of animated series and films.  I also want to be a musician and music composer.  And I also want to be a writer, cartoonist and illustrator of my own novels and/or comics... And I would also like to be a film actor.  And, well, my biggest dream is to be an artist, to be recognized, to make a living from my art and to be happy with my art.  I really want to be an artist and I feel like I was born to do it.  However, that dream is impossible now (besides, art degrees are not available in USAT nor in my city... What did you expect? I live in a third-worldist country in a crappy third-worldist provincial city!)... And, well... And now, thinking about it, everything I just said above about my desire to be an artist is completely pathetic and stupid... I guess I will never be happy... Why do I continue living then?

And, well, there are doctors who make a lot of money and are respected, but I'm not interested in medicine and I'm not interested in working long hours (if I want to help people, I prefer to do it in a different way). There are the engineers who make a lot of money and are respected because they are logical and cold people and not pathetic dreamers like me, but I am not interested in mathematics... Yes, I used to get decent grades in mathematics in school, but I still consider that I have math anxiety and that I hate math. If I have just offended mathematicians for this, I apologize, right now I grant you permission to insult art, colors, shapes and artists, because we artists are dumb and stupid beings who do not easily recognize that we are inferior to STEM people, thank you. Kindergarten, elementary or high school teacher? No, thanks. I wish school teachers good luck, but I am not interested in suffering more than necessary with work, administration, and/or rowdy students, nor am I interested in making less money than I would like to make. Police or army?  No thanks, I'm a weak, sensitive crybaby... Plus I'm not interested in initially earning less money than I would really like to earn. Sex worker? I don't even know where the gay brothels or gay bars are in my city... And although Grindr makes things easier, sex would be completely boring for me (the first and last two times I had sex last year as a bottom I didn't I didn't feel pleasure nor was I attracted to the people who f$cked me which made the sex disappointing)... Also, I wouldn't want to earn less money than I would like to earn nor would I want to suffer sexual abuse, so... No, being a sex worker would not be ideal for me. Studying Audiovisual Communication or Journalism? No thanks, being a journalist doesn't interest me. I am not passionate about telling stories that are not of my creation. I am also not interested in studying Audiovisual Communication since I am not interested in creating live-action films and/or live-action series (in addition, I studied Audiovisual Communication for a while at another university (in the city of Piura in the Piura region... Yes, the names of that one city and that region are the same) before abandoning it... And in the end I abandoned the career for many reasons and one of those reasons is because I did not have a bit of creative control in the audiovisual works that were done in groups... They told me: ""it's okay, but that's not how it's done""... URRGH!!!).

Business administrator? No, I don't think I'm suitable for that career. One of the reasons my semi-closeted lesbian sister chose that career is because she told me in a cold, dry and direct tone of voice: ""I love capitalism."" And, well... The thing is that I'm not such a fan of capitalism, to be honest, but hey. And also, on another occasion (maybe last year), while I was with her and her girlfriend in a taxi, she told me in a dry, sarcastic, mocking and provocative tone: ""I like my career, because it is focused on finding SOLUTIONS.""  And she said the word ""SOLUTIONS"" in an even louder and more mocking tone meaning in an implicit tone ""you are a useless failure."" Yes, I'm a useless failure. She is right. In addition to the fact that I am not a die-hard fan of capitalism, I am also not interested in managing companies or people in areas that do not interest me or that would not make me happy.  Yes, I want money and I want it no matter what, but... I also want to be happy.  

Do I have to be willing to be very unhappy and very miserable to finally have the opportunity to make more money? Do I? :''(

Again, at the university where I am going to study and in my city, there are no art degrees at all.  Furthermore, I have discovered that I would also not like to work in a minimum wage job for life until I die and that is why I decided to return to university with financial help from my father. Also, please, make fun of me for being a useless idler who isn't willing to work a part-time job or two. Yes, I am a useless idler, a hateful failure and a botched abortion for not wanting to suffer working one or two part-time jobs while studying at university, but, for the moment, I do not want to work one or two part-time jobs, because I would like to concentrate better on my studies and because I value my free time a lot. Insult me if you want, humiliate me if you want... You can even say me that I must commit s$&cide for being a burden to society. You have permission to do so.

And, well, the only option I had left was psychology... A few weeks ago, the pressure to choose a career was great because time was running out so I chose psychology. However, that choice was not a completely random choice. Lately I have had a certain interest in what lies behind human emotions, human behavior and human relationships. Also, some of you may already know me as the Reddit user who asks a lot of questions... So I hope you guys know what I'm talking about. 

However, I'm not sure... Have I chosen my career correctly? Have I? I'm not sure and I'm really scared. I am very afraid.

But hey, the thing is that I will have to endure 5 more years in hell until I can graduate at the end of 2028. From the time between the end of 2028 and the beginning of 2029 I have to take action and get out of that damn shitty place (Chiclayo) forever away from my family in search of my own life... I don't know if I will have to move immediately from Chiclayo, but if there is a chance to leave and have a more comfortable and happy life in another Peruvian city better than Chiclayo, in Lima (the capital and largest city of my own country) or in another part of the world much better than my own country, I would do it.

I just want a very happy, comfortable and calm life in the future with many opportunities for people like me. In a place or in a city where I can finally be myself, be free and be able to fulfill my biggest and most cherished dreams in the future (I hope that is possible, but hope is not my strong suit, man). A future where I can get a boyfriend with whom I truly fall in love, with whom I can marry (I hope that one day, in the future, we gays can get married here in Peru) and with whom I can form a family in the future if we both achieve the stability and economic abundance that we dream of achieving so much. If possible, I hope that we can both move out of the country to another place to find a different life where I can finally meet my goals or that I can leave the country to find a different life where I can finally meet my goals and find my future love of my life in that same different place. 

However, that is not possible now, I first have to concentrate on achieving goals here first in Peru, which is the most realistic, pragmatic and convenient plan available for me. However, Latin America is a land where political, social and economic uncertainty is the norm, which is why, personally, I am very afraid and I even wonder if it's really prudent or intelligent for me to think about achieving goals here first in Peru, but hey.

Anyway: 1. Is my career choice right? 2. Where should I go?",Responsible-Way5056,1,1.0,0,1709728493,2024-03-06 12:34:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7ylfv/1_is_my_career_choice_right_2_where_should_i_go/,3,2024
1b7xx3y,"New manager didn’t go through with promised promotion from prior manager. Still being asked to hire 7 people, have 5 working for me at same level, some make significantly more than me.","Yesterday, for the second time in as many years, (at a different company this time) I had a call where I was told the promotion I was supposed to receive (to director) is not happening. I was told this during the same conversation where I was told my performance for the past year is the second highest rating (~20% employees receive) and that a person under me who I had to work tirelessly to have promoted (they deserve it) did go through (happy for them) - to my level. I was told that it was simply because 2 months ago as part of a reorg where I was put onto this new team, my new manager, who this convo was with, was ghosted by my former manager. He said he didn’t have the words to write or answers to give during calibration sessions to put me forward for promotion, and realized that meant he couldn’t promote me.  He says he didn’t know enough about me and wasn’t getting responses from my old manager. So ultimately an org change out of my control negated a year of very hard work, relationship building with key stakeholders and leaders, and obviously positive results given my rating. 

This does not sit will for a myriad of reasons. First, I have 3 current employees working for me at the same level (Sr. Manager) one of whom was laid off as a director last year and brought back in under me with a demotion in title and level, but no change in salary. He is managing one of the 4 programs I am accountable for. I had to have his comp review yesterday where I shared his raise, bonuses, long term incentive and total comp in the 10s of thousands above me. I have 2 more I’m currently hiring for out of 7 that will be the same level as me and target comp is higher than mine. 

Second, the promotion process is months long with many forms to fill out, calibration session to make your case against similar level prospective promotions cross functionally, and back and forth waiting. It’s clear to me that my former management “had better or more important things to do” since I was no longer under their org structure, and my current manager is promoting the people he knows and worked with for a long time over me because he “doesn’t know me.” So the promotion process and org change effectively cancelled my promotion to director even though it’s been acknowledged as earned and deserved. 

Third, my boss told me next promotion cycle (6 months from now) I’ll be considered again. I’ve had a lot of carrot dangling happen in my career and somehow find myself back in that spot for the 3rd time (for a promotion to director). He’s signed me up for some in-house leadership program as a consultation, even though I’ve clearly shown and demonstrated leadership skills effectively and much more so that I see many other directors whom I work closely with showing.

Fourth, another reason I was told it is not happening is because I only have 3 employees currently. Soon to be 10. But since I don’t have that bigger team yet, they won’t promote me yet. This is bologna. I work with 3-4 director on a daily basis who have 0 employees under them. There is no requirement like this. 

Lastly, I was hired to do strategy work and somehow  find myself leading multiple very large programs because I stuck my neck out and contributed where I didn’t need to. The company noticed this, assigned the new responsibility, changed my job by adding to it significantly (under promise of year-end promotion), but now won’t promote.

I’ve already applied to 5 positions since this convo yesterday and plan to continue looking today.  Never thought I’d be one of those people who quiet quit, but not sure what response there is other than that while I look for a new job when they want to quiet hire.

1b7xbj1,How do I get my chatty boss to buzz off??,"I like my job and it is pretty low-stress. I am paid for what I know, take care of what comes my way, and have a lot of downtime that I am happy to fill with an internet connection.

I also have a supervisor who bends my ear over the most inane BS known to man. As a father to twins and reader of philosophy, I enjoy a good silence. She is a person who seeks to fill silence with her own voice.

She talks constantly about her neighbors, their pets and other personal details about people I never met and don’t care about. I feel like she eats into my “social battery” in a way that makes me less engaged when I get home to my family.

She has been out sick for an extended period of time, and I honestly felt happier, less stressed, and more productive during her absence. She is a friendly person, but lacks the respect of the office. People look to others for advice and decisions, yet she is still my direct supervisor.  

If she was a coworker, I’d be far more comfortable simply turning my chair, saying I’m busy, and ignoring whatever mundane details she happened to be spewing. I work in an open office and my desk is between her office and the only exit, so she is constantly popping by for meaningless chatter.

My best idea so far is to find a way to call my desk phone from my cell to interrupt her, but I’m afraid I’d be caught talking to myself.

Any other ideas on how to get my boss to cut the chit chat?

1b7wjia,Question from a 20s guy to a 30s guy who has the real answer for how to live 20s so that we don't regret in 30s,"I AM 22 YEARS OLD.
I have many interests. There are too many things that grip me. I used to go very deep im topics such as hypertrophy strength training mobility etc. In short fitness stuff. Then I thought that was just an interest and it won't go anywhere, so I started studying finance. After 2 years, I now think that finance is so mechanical and I like stories, creativity and building stuff more.
So I have started a food related business in my city and I really do not care about cooking. But then I tell myself I need to do it because it has started to bring in some money. So I should be less emotional and more rational. 
But then I have interests in academia too such as psychology and philosophy. Those topics come easy to me. I understand the deep abstract ideas easily and with interest. 
I also like drawing. I also want to make videos and tell stories through it. 
It feels like i am very scattered. Anybody I watch or read, i start to imagine myself going on a path at which that person went. I start wanting to become that person. To do what he did. And it annoys me.
While everybody says I should be exploring, but I have felt this while changing from finance to a business that in any area i want to become even good at it, i need to put in at least 2 years. In that way if i keep exploring i will be 30 very soon. And then too i will have interests left to explore.
So how to i differentiate between merely interests and the things that really grip me and that which i should focus solely on.

1b7weyl,I’ve enjoyed a decade’s worth of a decent career in the music industry but with this recent layoff I’m one of hundreds of ultra-qualified people in NYC right now and those jobs for me are scarce.,"I’m waiting to hear back from a recent interview, but otherwise my prospects are not obvious at all and I’m not keen on the “spray and pray” method of job applying if I can help it. My network is full of extremely smart and well-meaning people who simply can’t do much more than refer me, at the end of the day. And that would only happen if there were jobs at their companies to begin with!

For some more context without giving *too* much away, the Big 3 of the music biz are all facing an identity crisis with what they offer artists. It’s not a good time to be at a major right now, especially after having talked to a bunch of glum staff, some of which are even requesting to be laid off themselves.

I guess my question boils down to this: how do I pull a reliable income in this environment? I’m considering indie labels and artist management teams, but overall it’s just a weird time for the biz. 

I want to stay in NYC as this is where my spouse also has her career. I want to pull a decent enough income (my base was 105K) to be able to live in this HCOL area. I’m not afraid of rolling up my sleeves and doing gig work if needed. 

I also have a side passion for print design (I have a design background as well) and have chatted with local stationery stores about how to include any products of mine in there, but this feels like pennies and dimes compared to what I need to pull in order to live here.

My lease is up in June. Three months and change doesn’t feel like it’ll be enough, especially if it’s this much of a climb these days. I can’t plan on luck either. I’ll make it as much as I can but I can’t plan on it.

Would love any advice, thanks.

1b7wcn7,Making less after 3.5 years,"So I started a new position with a new company that gives small cost of living raises every year even though it doesn’t match actual cost of living percentages. They pay half my health insurance but my insurance rates have gone up so much that I’m actually making less than I did when I started, not even counting cost of living increases. 

The company CFO constantly tells everyone no when they ask for raises because they can’t afford them right now and they need to work on being more profitable. He always asks then to write up a letter to explain why they deserve it and even if they do deserve it he typically tells them he just can afford to pay them more.

My husband advises against it due to the long commute and exhaustion it may cause. As I'm seeking input from everyone around me, their thoughts are important and helpful for my decisions. My mom suggests taking the opportunity since other offers are scarce, with the possibility of finding a better job later.

1b7vq5y,"First job as a new grad physician assistant, stressed and need advice on effectively communicating with my boss","I am 4 months into my first job out of PA school working directly with one physician at a private orthopedic surgery clinic. Based on patient, peer, and colleague feedback, I feel I have been doing well and I am learning quickly and efficiently, despite having no previous experience in the specialty that I work in. I am seeking advice on how to communicate/ask for positive feedback with the physician I work directly with who is also my boss. Here is the background: I am a very reserved and polite individual who has never needed a ‘pat on the back’ to know I’m doing a good job, whether it was at school or previously held jobs. I’m 100% aware that constructive criticism is essential to the learning process and always welcome any type of feedback. But, after 4 months of working with this physician, he has only offered negative feedback and delivers it in a way that feels like he is treating me like a child and doesn’t really understand the level of what exactly I know or don’t know, even though I always verbalize politely if I’ve already learned or have experience with something. A few examples:
1. giving me peer-reviewed research articles to learn from (which is great) but saying that he found articles with ‘words that I will understand’ when the article discusses very simple pathophysiology which I understand or am already familiarized with these concepts before and if I don’t understand I know where to find reliable resources to clarify explain the concepts
2.  during surgery, he will ‘pimp’ me which just refers to doctors asking medical/PA students questions about the procedure/anatomy/pathology to assess knowledge. I usually know the answer and have studied in depth before I go into the surgery, but when I answer incorrectly (which has happened 3 times out of easily over 100 questions he has pimped me on) he gets very upset and yells at me in the operating room and in front of the other staff members instead of having a professional discussion and making it a constructive learning opportunity. It’s very embarrassing and awkward in front of my colleagues 
3. asks me to give a detailed report on a patient with specific information regarding the history and exam findings (even if it is not pertinent) and when I do he says that my report is too long and that ‘all surgeons have ADD and zone out during report’. I am always as concise as possible while still including what he requested and keep it under 30 seconds. At least once a week, he will get angry at me for not including a certain piece of information when I very much did include it, but he is usually on his phone when I give report and not paying attention. 

I don’t let constructive criticism affect me mentally/emotionally, but after 4 months of never getting positive feedback and the only feedback I do get is condescending, it is beginning to make me less confident in my work and im developing anxiety and avoid asking him any question at all to avoid being berated and embarrassed, which makes me look like I am not interested in learning. I have approached him twice and very respectfully asked if we could have a debriefing once a week about what is working/not working, what I should focus on more, etc because I am still training and I want to do the best job I can for our patients and daily work flow. He says sure but seems uninterested when I try to bring it up at an appropriate time when we are not busy. I have never had an issue like this before and I’m feeling discouraged and stressed when I am passionate about and enjoy the job.

1b7v1pu,"Debating whether to stay in role, manager keeps adding tasks to workload","I work as a cloud admin, but my manager keeps adding extra things I need to do in addition to our projects. I do 2 to 3 projects that each take around 8 weeks to complete, but it will be going up to 6 soon. Along with that, I have to get a cloud certification, do a excel like 10 hour course by the end of the year.

 Recently, my manager added that I have to do a mock migration where I setup the domains and everything, and it has to be due by April. Along with that I have to take a Zendesk customer service course, through LinkedIn that is a 6 hours long and has a 60 question test.   

Along with that my manager doesn't want to help much when I ask questions. And will oftentimes say review prior calls or make me do this training course or something when I ask questions. Which makes me feel it's punishment and extra work for me anytime I ask a question.
  
It's also weird that it's happening the week before I took vacation. I mentioned that to the manager and she just said oh I forgot that you had vacation this month, when its literally on my calendar, and I first brought it up to her in January. Along with that, we had a business trip this month also. So, idk how they expect me to do all this in 8 working days. She offered to move it back to mid April, even then that doesn't seem like enough with all these projects.

A lot of the meetings are also weird and we just talk about the weather. It feels more like I'm a number and its impersonal. They also didn't say anything on my birthday when it passed. Idk if its just cause I didn't notify them, but I think the manager had to have seen it in her system.

So do you all think this sounds like too much or is it just me? And would it be worth leaving jobs even if for a lesser role with lesser pay, or am I just overreacting?",ElectricOne55,1,1.0,0,1709715052,2024-03-06 08:50:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7v1pu/debating_whether_to_stay_in_role_manager_keeps/,3,2024

1b7udvm,[CA] Boss is trying to isolate me by forbidding I speak to my team.,"My boss brought me into his office and shut the door. It felt like an intimidation tactic, as I am rarely ever asked to go in his office. He then said I'd be involved with a project including ONLY us two, and that I could not discuss it with anyone—not my team, not my department head, not my supervisor, nobody.

He told me the project was something I HAD to do for my job. If I had a problem with it or said I couldn't do it, he said there'd be a big problem. No creeper vibes. Just the air of a weird power trip.

I suggested a project in my department I thought this might be regarding. He refused to answer, saying only that he'd tell me eventually. Maybe this week, maybe next. I asked a couple more questions and he took extra care to make me feel stupid enough to stop asking questions and just let him ramble.

Eventually I got enough clues to confirm that he is indeed talking about the project I suspected. Still, he refused to tell me straight up, and emphasized that I was FORBIDDEN to talk to anyone about this. Tbh it made me pretty uncomfortable. He's known to put ridiculous projects on people until the more reasonable directors catch wind and intervene.

I am 99% sure what project this is about, and it's not a project I can take on. I've made it clear that I cannot take on this additional workload, and that I do not have the skills to do such a thing. There IS a staff member who does have the capacity and skills, and they are willing to help with that project.

This boss is EXTREMELY difficult to work with and I avoid crossing his path at all costs. We rarely work together and operate in different departments. I want to avoid getting roped into his shit but today's ""secret"" meeting was so uncomfortable and intense, I was caught off guard and did not know how to respond.

Should I call him tomorrow and say something? Should I talk to my direct supervisor, even though he intimidated me into thinking i am alone in this psychological chaos? We don't really have an HR person. The accountant says she's kinda like HR but it doesn't seem official.

I'm hesitant to wait because he's the type with zero regard for someone's work day. I can see him barging into my office one day and demanding I help with a physical errand that takes up my entire day and puts me behind on my responsibilities.

He made me really uncomfortable today I wanted to quit. My dept's team is extremely cool, efficient, fair, and insightful. We typically handle everything as a team. I just feel so confused and anxious about this situation. I don't know what to do.

No one in the new team really knows what I’m doing, even the boss. It’s also a 1 person job. If I quit now, they’ll have to pick up from scratch what they don’t know. Also these are involuntary responsibilities for them most probably. 

I’m thinking to inform the boss 2 months ahead for any transition needed. But not sure this is the right way. Please share some advice if you’ve been in the same situation.

1b7t4iz,I have an internship opportunity asking for advice and guidance ,"Hello everyone, I just to preface this by saying I don't posses a deep knowledge and I'm asking this for guidance and advice.I'm a junior ML engineer. 

I'm recently got offered an unpaid internship in ML to create an ai trip planner for a travel app the thing is this company works in many different countries so I suggested fine tuning a pretrained model for each country they work in. The thing is I thing this is a big scale project is it possible to learn how to do it alone as an intern.

I've met with them and from what I understood They want something similar to travel moji or trip planner AI. Which basically recommend fully planned trips based on user profile.

So my big question is is it possible to do this as a junior developer? and if so how what models should I use and how to use them?

Please any advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this if you have any advice please don't hesitate.",zoyafromthemoon,1,1.0,0,1709707409,2024-03-06 06:43:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7t4iz/i_have_an_internship_opportunity_asking_for/,3,2024
1b7so8m,Thoughts?,"Hi all, 

I applied for a company in a data analyst position. First interview (interviewer was 20 mins late) but it went really well and the interviewer was a guy who was very friendly and nice, asked a few behavioural questions and said he thinks Im a really good fit but according to my background I might wanna think about it and try a different field. I felt weird cause it was confusing to me what he said. 
Anyways, next day I got a call from the hiring manager that they would like to proceed me to the next interview. 

So today for the 2nd interview, a manager joins 10 mins late again and 1 other interviewee did not join at all. So she goes on saying, what do you do in your current job? Thats it. I answered. 

She asks me the name of my current manager twice??? I felt super weird answering that. Is this normal to ask that randomly? She goes on saying Im jusy here to answer your questions I dont have any questions. Honestly she was pretty cold and looked like she has no clue about the role. She said we're forming a new team. 
I asked few questions.
So the interview ended in like 10 mins.

Im feeling super weird cause it felt like she really wanted to know my current managers name, I would understand if it was for a reference check after they offered me a position but in an interview?

1b7sgn4,Considering Career Change at 35,"Not fully happy with where I'm at. Wouldn't even said I've ever had a ""career"" but simply ""jobs"". Did 2 years of college, decided I didn't want to pursue that career path and started working in a completely different field. I've mostly worked in industrial distribution, with a few different roles in a couple industries. From warehouse to inside sales to currently operations. Not overly satisfied with my current situation due to lack of upwards mobility and not crazy about my co-workers or manager.  
Thinking about a career shift while staying in generally the same field. Willing to take courses and training and attain any necessary certificates to do so, but not looking to go get a 4 year degree as I will need to continue working full-time and not crazy about beginning a new career from the bottom at age 40. Thinking back over my working life the parts I've enjoyed the most and I think was the best at was working in the warehouse. I took pride in my inventory accuracy and efficient movement of goods. The logistics made a lot of sense to me. I definitely did not like sales as much.  
Which possible careers are worth looking into further? Considering:  
\- Future salary, job opportunities and availability  
\- Can obtain necessary training/certificate online in 1-2 years or less  
\- Within the general area of previous experience

1b7s4fs,What do I do with my psychology degree?,"Some context-

I'm a 22 year old junior at Rutgers. I majored in psychology originally and have always been interested in pursuing a career in it, and added human resource management subsequently to my degree because I thought I'd need it as a back up plan.

I have no money and 0 generational wealth. I'm working a part time job that pays like $18 an hour, and I know it's dumb but I just found out about internships and research programs like last semester (immigrant parents did not teach me anything about the world or college and I didn't pay any attention to it in high school)

I have been struggling with mental health for pretty much my whole life, and just recently started caring about my future, so I'm just now starting to freak out because I have absolutely no experience in this field. No clubs, programs, internships, research, nothing. The closest I have to experience in either field (HR or psych) is my job now- I do a lot of HR tasks and I work with children of all age groups, some with learning disabilities and autism.

I don't really know what to do. I also don't know what I want to be... I know I'd love being a professor, but that doesn't seem to pay as well as I thought it would, so I considered being a psychologist. I know that I'm interested in personality and developmental psychology, maybe even family trauma.

I'm graduating in Spring of 2025 (hopefully) maybe Fall with a bachelors. I have a 3.3 gpa that is projected to grow if I continue at the rate I'm going now. I'm pretty scared about what to do after that. I know I can't get into any PhD programs without research experience, and they are quite selective ( I heard a clinical psych PhD program is one of the hardest to get into)

My question is- what do I do? Should I quit my job pursue the PhD and try to get as many internships/ research experience as I can before graduating? Do I just take a job in HR and abandon my dreams of working in developmental psychology? Are there other options that I haven't considered, outside of a psychologist or professor? I wouldn't mind therapy or social work or counseling if it paid well, but it unfortunately doesn't seem to. Should I consider grad school overseas so maybe it is less expensive?

I'm sorry for the long post, I'm kinda having a breakdown LOL.",Ok_Assistant_7059,1,1.0,2,1709703943,2024-03-06 05:45:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7s4fs/what_do_i_do_with_my_psychology_degree/,3,2024

1b7rqty,I feel like a fraud after job rejection,"
My team had two open roles, three people including me applied and I got rejected. Mind you, I had one of the toughest years of my career last year and everyone recognized that the campaigns I handled were no easy task. I got three recognition during townhalls and one award separately. A rating scale of 4/5 in my performance review. I gave the interview for both the roles and got rejected. The feedback was I am not ready and I don’t work well independently, constantly second checking and validating and they need someone who works by themselves. One of the candidates joined 8 months after I did and is not even a year old in the team and got a promotion. 

Now, along with my own team I applied for another role in a different team and it looks like I may be selected. The HM for the other team spoke with my manager and said they’re about to make an offer. I don’t want to jinx it, but yes. 

Now I’m afraid, the roles are all one grade higher and needs less direction and independent work. After the feedback for the rejected roles im worried I may not be suitable for the role an offer would be extended for. I feel like I’m a fraud despite the good work, based on the feedback I’ve received I feel I won’t be able to do what they’re looking for and will realize they made a mistake. I don’t know how to overcome this feeling of having mislead someone in an interview and they may be choosing me.

- Camera and post departments on two feature indies
- Self-produced/directed a handful of award-winning shorts
- Wedding videos
- Community access TV while I was in college

I’ve applied to multiple places for internships and yet to find one and I was thinking to get into data analytics or something with tech ,but I’m scared because of the mass layoffs tech companies are doing because of AI.Companies prioritize saving costs and cutting costs, CEOs don’t care about the people. Many people are losing their jobs due to this, because business people’s mentality is “why hire 20 people to do a task, when I can use AI and save much more money” I work at my dad’s friend’s company 🧿🧿🧿 which is a start up that  is barely a year old and is a digital transformation consulting company. Specifically IT consulting 🧿🧿. So I attended a few events with the founder like a business symposium related to AI in business (where CEO’s were talking about using AI to save costs in their business and using AI for firing and hiring and implementing AI in decision making), tabling events and even a career fair at an ivy league school where I represented the company. I go to a state college in north jersey 🧿🧿🧿. The purpose of that company is to help businesses transition into modern IT infrastructure for them to efficiently manage their business and stay in touch with cut edge technology. My role is a marketing as well as learning role. As well as a strategic role. I’m learning about different types of cloud vendors and how its different from data centers and on on premise systems. I completed certifications from Google on digital transformation, I did an Oracle cloud certification (its a little rusty) and other cloud certifications are pending. I’m learning fundamentals of python and creating small programs and soon am looking forward to handle business cases 🧿🧿🧿. I’m learning SQL 🧿I did some certifications in UX design as well. I wanted to combine all my skills and build a portfolio using my designs skills as well as analytics. I started off as a graphic designer but progressed into marketing then did like a UX certificate 🧿 then got into this IT consulting stuff and am still learning about IT. I want to go into tech but i’m scared now because of AI and that business symposium….oof 🧿🧿🧿. Resume is below🧿

1b7qass,Do you think the way my coworker acts is better than the way I act? Or do you think it doesn't matter?,"I feel like my coworker and I act pretty different at work. I was curious if the way she acts seems better? The job we both have is just a standard office job where we don't interact with customers and most of our day is spent in front of a computer. The company is a large company. Probably about the 30th largest in America. We probably interact with about 100 people at the company.

How she acts:
- she talks with a lot more enthusiasm than me whenever she talks
- when she walks by most people in the hallway she smiles and says good morning
- I would say she talks a lot more than me in general
- She seems to care a lot more about her appearance than me. For example, I don't think I've ever seen her wear the same pair of clothes and they always seems fancy if that makes sense.
- I would say she acts like a perfectionist basically. Like if I misspell a word in an email on accident she'll talk about it for 30 minutes.

How I act:
- I would say I don't really express any enthusiasm at work
- whenever I walk by most people in the office I usually don't say anything and look at the ground in front of me. Unless, they say something first.
- I wear khakis with a polo shirt probably 99% of the time. Also, most of the shirts are the same style and/or color. I don't really care about impressing people by what I wear.
- I would say I don't really act like a perfectionist at all. I just believe more in the idea of getting things done basically. For example, if a website doesn't look perfect to me I think it's ok and can be fixed later.

1b7pwbw,"I have no clue what I want to do in life, looking for some advice.","Hey all,

  
I hope you all are doing well.

  
So, I (19M) have no clue what I want to do in life and need some peoples insight/advice or what I should do.

  
I am 19, from Canada, and have enrolled to go to college this year in the fall. I had planned to go to college the past two years, and decided I not to go. I have to go this year, because I don't think my grandma will let me keep living with her if I don't and I know if I don't go back this year I won't go back at all.

  
I've been thinking about going into computer science, but I just think I'm too stupid to go into computer science to be honest. I do have an interest in technology, and have done some very minimal coding in python and I don't mind it, however, I just don't think I have the brains to do all those classes that come with a bachelors of science. I didn't do pre-calculus in high school and all the universities in my province require pre-calculus 12, but to have pre-calculus 12 I need to do pre-calculus 11. I have enrolled to do pre-calculus 11 online but I just don't understand it. It's also so hard to do the online pre-calculus class after working all day, going to the gym, cooking dinner, still having some chill time and have a bit of social life. It also doesn't help that I just don't understand it. I know it's an excuse, but it's rough lol. The only main reason I've been thinking about computer science to be honest is because it's a good career field. I like technology, I like that a lot of the roles are remote, and the income is good. I can start at my local college, but I would need to have both math courses done before September. I think if i really focused and reduced my hours a bit at work I could possibly do it, but if I'm struggling this much with high school pre-calculus, 4 years of university doing harder stuff (university calculus, chemistry, etc.) will probably be rough. But, I think I could do it if I really tried. I also see how oversatured the job market is which turns me off a bit as well, but the job perks does seem nice.

  
My local college offers a program called computer information systems I have been thinking about as an alternative to computer science. The course has quite a lot of coding type courses, but also has a business emphasis which is interesting to me. I do also have all the requirements for this program so I don't need to do anything extra. My only concern is how employable the degree will be and how much I may struggle to find a job with this degree (though I may struggle to find a job in general). Though, from what I've seen, it seems once you have experience in the tech field experience is preferred over your degree. I also feel like I may regret not getting a computer science degree instead. But, I don't know if I even really like coding.

  
Lately, I have been thinking about maybe going into political science to become a policy analyst or something similar. I actually am quite interested in politics/world affairs/history and I enjoy writing and doing research type projects or things. I don't want to dox myself, but I work for an indigenous band office and currently have two years experience there as an administrative assistant. I am not indigenous, but I have been quite involved growing up with indigenous events/protocols as my sister-in-law is indigenous who I am very very close with. I have noticed a lot of indigenous organizations hire policy analyst and having almost three years experience working for a band office may give me a bit of an advantage. I have however learned recently that actually for a majority of policy analyst roles/jobs they accept political science degrees or business administration degrees. My local college apparently has an amazing business program and I think I would actually enjoy going to school for a business degree. But, once again, I am worried about job prospects for either a political science degree or business degree.

  
I have also thought about going into a trade, maybe become an electrician or work in HVAC but I just don't think I am cut out for the blue collar life LOL.

  
Really, all I want is a job that pays well and allows me to have a good work life balance (not having to work 10 hours a day, having a consistent 8-4 job). Though, I guess everyone probably wants that. I would ideally like to make 70k-90k a year. I would LOVE to make 100k-150k+ a year if possible, I actually would really like to make 150k-200k a year at some point if possible. I honestly feel like social media has really ruined my perception of money. I use to think I wanted to get a coding job making 250k+ a year working remotely working 35 hours a week, but I have realized just how uncommon that is and only a very few lucky individuals get that opportunity. It seem everything online nowadays says you need to make 200k-300k a year, but honestly making 80k a year is super good and I realistically would like to make that. A goal of sorts.

  
So, these are kind of the options I have been considering. Although, I am open to any suggestions of degrees/jobs to get. My boss has told quite a few times she sees me being a boss one day/managing a large operation, but, I don't know about that, haha.

  
Any insight/advice from your life experiences or just opinions/thoughts about my post would be greatly appreciated. I am all ears for anything. I am probably over-thinking things to much, but I just don't want to end up with a degree I am unemployable with or doing something I will be miserable with. I want to try and make the wisest decision as possible, if it's possible!",kilawnaa,1,1.0,0,1709696942,2024-03-06 03:49:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7pwbw/i_have_no_clue_what_i_want_to_do_in_life_looking/,3,2024
1b7plii,Advice (or prayers) would be appreciated,"I (24m) am getting my masters in applied health informatics right after I got my undergraduate degree. Before the pandemic I thought I wanted to be more health care oriented, however since COVID id much rather be on the more technical side of things. I have worked as a physical therapy aide, and haven’t worked in two years and my masters is all online. My internship is in person and it’s coming up soon and I’m freaking out and my anxiety is through the roof.

1b7pj5q,How do I create an exit strategy? ,"I currently work for a for a small Community College managing their community recreation center (30hrs/wk) Additionally I assist in the college marketing department (30hrs/wk) all under one salaried position. Long story short my degree is in marketing and someone got fired and I was told to fill that role with no additional compensation. This was about 16 months ago.

In that time things in the rec department have become filled with drama. To the point where I get yelled at by a community member atleast once a day. I don’t mean the occasional disagreement more so an attack on my ability to maintain the facility accompanied by screaming. This stems from two things. Firstly a lack of decisiveness from the board to either renovate or shut down a pool (which has people in an uproar) as well as a cut in funding resulting in sports leagues having less money for refs resulting in lower quality refs. Which causes people to cuss and scream at me as I am not managing the league adequately. Due to this I no longer feel this company is worth working for. 

I have an MBA, 3 years marketing experience and 2 years management experience. I currently make 50k in rural Michigan. I would like to stay in Michigan and move into a full time marketing role but I need help creating and exit strategy. 

Side question is this normal? Do other people experience community members telling them no one likes them, they should go die, and scream at them every day? All with no support to remove these people from management as we are a community facility.

1b7oly2,Having a really hard time picking between 2 great career opportunities,"Little background about me (25m). first; I've had a passion for photography since middle school, and went to an arts focused high school where I took college level photoshop and photography classes. When I graduated I did a year in college studying psychology, decided college sucks, and dropped out. Worked retail for 2 years, then got an entry level job in customer service and sales ($10/hr) at a large photo studio company (Many locations across southeast US), eventually transferred over to over to photography department, and became a manager ($19/hr), pretty much doubling my salary in two years. However, we had slow seasons every year, so my salary was more like $36,000. I was a photography manager for a little over a year and a half, so 3.5 years at that company, before I got laid off last month.  Now for the jobs:

&#x200B;

Job A: This guy was a former fighter in a big league (I want to keep things vague but he was making $45k a fight at least), and left that to join the sales team of toy manufacturing company (current annual revenue of \~$30 million). He was there for over 10 years and when he left he was the director of sales for the East Coast of the US (people under him were making $200k/yr so I'd imagine he was making a lot more than that). A few months ago, he left that company to start his own toy manufacturing company. He was able to use relationships from his previous job to get some real good contracts going; he's got licenses with TMNT, Sonic, etc. However, he's unable to keep up with the workload as the only employee, so a mutual friend of ours referred me and I was hired this week as his executive assistant. I make $20/hr to start but he's stated multiple times that number will go up.  

&#x200B;

Job B: I got a reply to my application to this job the same day I my friend told me about Job A. It is a photo editor for, coincidentally, a *very* large, international toy company. They are the owners of the best selling toy of the year and are worth at least $100 million. I did very well in my first interview, they told me they'd get back to me in a week, but they got back to me in less than 24 hours. I have a second interview tomorrow and if I had to guess, I think I'll get the job. It pays $60k/year, which is almost *double* the salary I was making at the last job.  With that out of the way, I'd like to list my pros and cons of each job:

&#x200B;

**Growth:**

&#x200B;

In Job A, the potential for growth is crazy. If he can get the company off the ground I could be looking at a 6 figure salary in a few years, which is something I never dreamed of. Meanwhile, at Job B, they said I'd need to spend 1 year in my role before I could transition into another one. However, it's a huge company and they are continuously growing, and the interviewer said that growth is very common in the company.

&#x200B;

**Freedom:** 

&#x200B;

In Job A, there's a lot more freedom by nature of it not being a corporation and there only being 2 employees. I had to step out for an hour and a half today and even though I just started, he was totally cool with it and still paid me for when I was gone. I wouldn't have to jump through HR hoops to get time off, if I was a few minutes late cause of traffic it wouldn't be a big deal, etc. Job B is a huge corporation, and I'd imagine small decisions would have to go through multiple people before changes happen, at least that's how it was at my photo studio job which was also corporate. There is benefit to being so large though, as the brand would look great on my resume and it would likely be much more structured and a fun place to work. It's also a lot more stable and less likely to fail (although from what I've seen from Job A it seems unlikely that it won't be profitable).

&#x200B;

**Career Field:**

&#x200B;

I know next to nothing about the toy industry, but I do love toys, so it will be cool to get the upper level, insider knowledge on that in Job A. I'll also be able to develop skills I don't have yet as an executive assistant. With that said, Job B is in a field I know I already excel in and have a strong passion for, and have extensive experience working in. I think I would enjoy the projects in Job B more. Job A isn't really a creative job, but he did say  I would be able to work on projects like product photography and packaging design in the future. 

&#x200B;

**Commute and Hours:**

&#x200B;

Job A's commute is 12-20 minutes depending on traffic. Job B's is 30-45 minutes depending on traffic. However, Job B is 4 days in office, 1 day WFH, 8:30-5:30. For now, Job A is a 9-5, but once I get trained and knowledgeable in the industry, I will be able to decide my own schedule.

&#x200B;

**Responsibilities:**

&#x200B;

In Job A, I'd get more responsibility. He's swamped with building up the company right now so he'll have no choice but to give me some big projects (which he's already said he wants to do once I'm ready) to help with his workload. If the company gets big, I'd likely also get my own team as well and be able to set policies and precedents there. 

&#x200B;

**Team:**

&#x200B;

In Job A, it's just me and him for right now. He's a super cool guy, and I like working for him, but unlike me, he doesn't have much interests in the licenses he has and we don't have much in common. Not really a huge con, but most of my friends I've met through work so it'll be a little weird not having that environment. In Job B, I'd likely be surrounded by young creatives who I'd be able to form friendships with and have things in common. By nature of it being a large team though, communication may be difficult as opposed to working directly with the only other employee in the company who is also my boss.

&#x200B;

**Pay and Benefits:**

&#x200B;

Job A is $20/hr which is \~$20k/yr less pay than Job B's $60k/year for now. If it picks up though, I could be making a whole lot more than Job B. Both jobs are higher than my \~$36k/yr at my last job though. Because Job A's company has just started, he doesn't have any payroll or quickbooks or anything set up, so there are currently no benefits, but I've been told they will be coming in the future. Job B has 2 weeks paid vacation with it going up a week every year. There are also 9 sick days (I've never worked in a job with limited sick days, but I rarely get sick so I don't think this will matter). Health insurance is 100% paid for by them, but I don't know if it's any good and I'm pretty happy with my current insurance anyway. 

&#x200B;

My friends aren't sure which one to pick either and think I'll be happy in either one, but I don't want to regret the decision as it's going to affect the rest of my life. I'm losing sleep and my appetite over which job to pick lol. Solid advice my friends have told me is that I can probably nail a corporate job in the future, but unlikely to have an opportunity like Job A again. On the other hand, Job B was the 25th application I did and was the only one who reached out with an interview, so I don't know how easily I could get a job like this again. One friend who used to be my boss said I would probably be a better fit for the less strict Job A, compared to the HR and paperwork of Job B. Other friends have stated that working for a recognizable brand like Job B is super cool (and tbh I do think it would be cool to say ""I work for Job B""), and likely comes with some cool perks like previews at new toys before they're out, working with licenses I love, and maybe even getting free toys.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I've got 2 really good jobs lined up, Job A, which doesn't pay too much right now but has the potential to make me a lot in the future, and Job B, which is in a field I love and has above average pay, but in a corporate environment.

1. that POC/women might get strung along in futile interview process just so the company can hit their DEI interview quotas?

2 Or, white males might get passed before even getting a fair chance because of DEI hiring initiatives?

1b7n1ed,Can an Offer Be Rescinded if You Cannot Verify Something in Your Background Check? Advice,"Hey everyone, Im a college student and I got an amazing internship in the summer as an engineer.

For some reason, I cannot find any legit evidence that I actually worked there and now my background check won't clear. I got hired (fast food place) because a friend worked there so my interview wasn't really an interview it was just casually talking to the manager, I signed any work-related forms in person so nothing over email I can use.

So I am looking for a job in Early Childhood Education, specifically preschools and nurseries, but I have noticed a large amount of centers are run by religious organizations and churches.

She sent an email to the staff explaining that payroll cuts meant some of them would be getting fewer hours. She wrote that most of our payroll has to go to the store leadership team, leaving whatever’s left to be divided up among the sales associates. 

I am, again, a full-time keyholder. I’m a member of the leadership team. I have zero hours this week, while our three part timers have been given around 20 hours each.

Proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and After Effects, I also have experience with Figma and foundational knowledge in UX/UI design from a Google UX course. Additionally, I've studied digital marketing and run a somewhat neglected Etsy store selling digital art. While I've attempted to sell Notion templates over the past two years and creating content around it , it hasn't been very successful. I enjoy exploring new things and consider myself a fast learner. Currently, I'm diving into 3D design, with a grasp on modeling, texturing, sculpting, retopology, and rendering using Blender.
I'm also good with AI tools.

1b7k8id,Early career: Good salary but no learning.,"So, I graduated (23 M) and started working for a good company since late last year. The pay is really good for my level (entry level software engineering for a hardware company) but there seems to be no new learning.

 During the interviews, it seemed like the work was going to have machine learning but now, not doing anything apart from basic software development (in python, not even sure if that counts) and data analytics. I am very much worried because I am seeing my technical skills degrade, like I do try to work on external projects or learn new technical stuff but with work taking over a lot of time, even weekends at times, this has reduced by a lot. 

Can someone advise how I can deal with this? 

PS: Money is sort of important for me at this point as I had student debt which I have almost cleared. Also, I need to be employed as I am on a nonimmigrant visa requiring work sponsorship valid for 2/2.5 more years after which I plan to return to my home country where there is a paucity of good jobs with decent earning opportunities (so need to maximise my earnings).
But at the same time it scares me because I am very early in career and want to prioritize learning at this point.

1b7jtjo,Position relocated between interview and offer,"I just received an offer for a position in a well known company that I’ve been interviewing for about 3 months. Originally the position was located in a city relatively close to where I live, about 30mins commute. After 3 months of interviews, assignments, and back and forth with recruiters I finally received an offer, but it turns out the position/team relocated during my interview process to another city which will add another 40-60 mins to my commute. I was negotiating salary based on the assumption I’d be at first location and the added commute to the new location seems like a significant change. 

I had already shared my salary expectations and they gave a counter, then I countered and they gave me another offer within the range I was looking for. Does the location change seem like fair grounds for further negotiation? I guess they can always say no and I can accept and that’s that? I don’t want to be unreasonable. 

I realize that if I had started the role earlier and already joined the company they would just tell me my team is moving and I have no say in it.

Now that I got promoted my chances of moving to a manager role have been pushed out by a 1.5 - 2 years and I am not sure I can stand being an analyst that long. It seems like the obvious answer would be to leave but I’m worried this could back fire on me. For one, outside of my role this company has been fantastic for me.

 \- 401k  
 \- lots of vacation time  
 \- low stress environment/workload  
 \- great teammates and company culture  
 \- 2 days/week remote work  
 \- job security, very stable company

Cons:  
 \- far from music/acting opportunities  
 \- longer/expensive commute  
 \- although starting pay has been great, there is not much engineering career progression for my role  


New Job (private company in the city):

Pros:  
 \- 401k  
 \- higher pay  
 \- shorter/cheaper commute  
 \- could allow me to live in cheaper neighborhoods because I am already in the city. (with current job, I have been limited to looking for apartments in the city near the major train station so $$$)  
 \- more potential for engineering career progress  
 \- easy to get to music/acting auditions, gigs, and networking opportunities

Cons:  
 \- risk of higher stress environment  
 \- much less vacation  
 \- no government pension  
 \- job stability would not be at level of current position

Just some things I have been torn about and wondered if anyone had any advice. Thank you, I really appreciate any feedback!

1b7fhr3,"Need advice regarding a job ""mistake""","Hello.  
  
So I've been applying to some jobs after some personal issues. I applied to the psych-related field, as psychology is my chosen career, and I ended up hearing back from a job that offered a position as an ABA Therapist. I was actually hired by them back in 2023. However, once field training started, I had to resign because the job heavily conflicted with university. They were sending me more than an hour away from my location, and my work hours clashed with my classes. Since I was going to graduate the next month, I decided it was best to resign on the post and focus on my education instead.  
  
However, I ended up hearing back from the company and had a quick interview with the recruiter, and the following day, she sent me an email asking for my information (such as a TB Test, my University Diploma, Driver's Insurance, and I9 Documents) and availability. I had to make a lot of phone calls in order to receive my TB Test and get hands on my Insurance Policy (weird insurance things) which took about 2 weeks.  
  
Finally, after I had all of my information, I got a call back from the recruiter to have another interview focusing more on what I wanted to achieve, as well as confirming a training schedule. Two days after, I received an email confirmation saying "" Welcome! We are excited to have you as a part of our team."" They then gave me an account to log in and complete a checklist for the onboarding.  
  
I felt a sense of relieve since I've been job hunting for a while now. However, today, I got a phone call from the onboarding manager, saying that they were going to revoke the offer, as it was a mistake. I was confused. ""What mistake?"" She then explained that the email was not supposed to be sent out and that I was not eligible for rehire since I had resigned without a notice. I was extremely frustrated because 1. I had an extremely valid reason for my resignation, and 2. I have been doing so much and put other offers and interviews on the side because I was officially hired. They literally deemed it as a simple mistake.  
  
I am extremely angry and frustrated right now. The onboarding manager said she was going to escalate this issue with her chief and would get back to me today. Is there anything that I can do regarding this situation? I am in the urgent need of a job, and this will set me back at least a month of progress that I could have put in with other jobs.  
  
Any information helps. Thanks!",Your_Moooom_XD,1,1.0,0,1709670205,2024-03-05 20:23:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7fhr3/need_advice_regarding_a_job_mistake/,3,2024
1b7f4x8,Any advice is helpful,"Hey mates


  Going through a bit of stress and could use advice. 

  I have my Bach in Science of Psych. The idea was to use this degree and go into the medical field. I’m in the process of applying to Physican assistant programs and I’m kind of at a loss. I’ve been denied from 8/15 schools thus far. To add insult to injury, the I was laid off recently from the ems job. The job itself was just a means to an end to acquire hours for my PA application, I should add my certs for this job are soon to expire, I should also add that I still live with parents. Now that that’s done, I feel no reason to put myself back into that high stress, demoralizing job. 

  I’m currently unemployed, and the job market isn’t the greatest for someone in my situation. The fact is that those 8 rejections have sown doubt in my parents’ minds, and now I feel the pressure of to just go through my plan b, an accelerated program to get my nursing degree, and get my Nurse anesthetic license after another 2 years. Those programs cost 30-50k, and I’m unsure if I want to take on that debt for another bachelors degree. I also truly don’t like the idea of go to school again after a few years for an NA program. I’m at a loss because my plan A just feels as if it’s failing, and I’m reluctant about my plan B. 

 Not sure what I should do any advice is appreciated. ",ScanningThaScene,2,1.0,0,1709669364,2024-03-05 20:09:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b7f4x8/any_advice_is_helpful/,3,2024

1b7ddjk,Being underpaid? ,"Hi all,

I am 24 and early on, into my career in Finance.
I am an analyst level, who has recently got promoted from Junior Analyst to Analyst.

I have found out the Junior Analyst on my team earns a considerable amount more than me (about £20k more than me) and the other Analyst earns about £35k+ more than me.

Being as unbiased as possible, I am given the most responsibility on the team generally (which shows in the promotion I received) so feels quite bad I earn much less.

I tried to rationalise it by our work experience. This is my first job out of uni, the Junior Analyst has about 5 months more of experience than me and the Analyst has about 3 years more of experience than me. I guess that can explain some of it but I still feel like I’m being underpaid here. At the end of the day I am doing more work and am a higher title than the junior analyst but I’ve been told by some people in the space that ‘that’s just how the industry works.’

So am I right to ask my manager about this or would it be a bad call to do so, given I’m early on into my career and shouldn’t ruin any relationships

I have a mechanical engineering degree, almost 5 years experience and my P.eng. My recent work experience is as a project manager with capital projects and my next goal is to get my PMP this winter/spring.  
I'm looking for names of Canadian based engineering companies that have some of or a combo of the following:

* Hybrid work schedules at a minimum, with the opportunity to work truly remotely during those hybrid remote days, I.e. not restricted to my house/hometown area.
* Any companies that have programs where you can work anywhere in the world for a few weeks a year or even have international projects that I can get sent out to!
* Preference to be BC or Calgary based, although i’m open minded to other locations
* International travel (bonus for Spanish speaking countries as I want to become fluent)

I’ve already researched a few companies that I have job alerts set, but if anyone has suggestions of companies that offer these perks, please let me know their names and I’ll add them to my hit list!  
If you also have any suggestions on qualifications, courses, knowledge improvement that will help me go towards jobs with these kinds of perks, please let me know that too!

City feels like it is very slow to progress career wise and I should have joined at a later point in my life when the perks of city work are more valuable.

Because of this, they are completely switching my position. For context, I work in R&D on our raw materials (RM), and they want me to switch to product development (PD) side. I am happy to still have a job but I am devastated. I loved my job with the RM group and have had many opportunities to switch to PD if I wanted to, but I didn’t want to. I knew there was always a chance they were going to cut my boss’ role, but I thought I’d be moved to another group and keep doing my job (keeping the same role just under someone else). To be frank, I just have no passion or desire for this changed role. I plan to talk to my new boss / his boss about my feelings on this, and see if there is anything that can be done to keep my current role or close to it (I am a big advocate of “it doesn’t hurt to ask”) but could use any advice on the situation. Do I have a leg to stand on? I know the answer might be to find a new job, but I do like working for this company and love my original job. 

Other important facts: I was hired on specifically for this RM group role.  There is no applying or pay raise opportunity even though it’s practically a completely different job. My role is very well established, I don’t think they realize what they are cutting and how much this will affect our relationship with procurement

1b79sy2,Just need some advice or opinions - UK based,"Normally I’m someone who just deals with issues by myself because I tend to figure them out either quickly or through some reflection, however, now I’m pretty much stuck with no solution of what to do.. any help or advice would be appreciated (be as harsh and blunt as you need to) 

Just some quick background info to lead up to my issue, so I’m a mathematics graduate with a masters in investment banking (basically took out a private third party loan to help cover this as my part time job wasn’t much and I pretty much come from a humble background so hate asking parents for things like money) - in case it’s worth noting I graduated in 2019 

To basically summarise a long term career search I basically found the job I wanted in the industry I wanted early last year, however, I didn’t pass my probation which obviously sucks and it’s the first time it’s ever happened - I’m obviously getting y CV out there, applying, doing all the normal.

I’ve been unemployed since November which sucks and literally whilst I’ve been applying everywhere I get the general response from when I was applying for internships (not enough experience, background isn’t great, other candidates were better suited etc etc). Tried applying for part time jobs with no luck for some reason. I’ve tried venture into other fields whilst tailoring my CV for it but I get told I’m either overqualified for the role or because of my education and work history they automatically assume that the investment industry is still my passion. 

Now that private loan I took for masters isn’t like SFE I have to pay regardless whether I’m working or not which was fine up until now as they’ve increased the interest I pay on it to 20% and obviously my JSA doesn’t even cover that.

So literally just want some advice on what you guys would do if you were in a similar situation to mine.

Normally if I had emergency savings built up like my friends it would be fine however my entire work history after uni literally never paid me enough to make it possible (mainly due to that loan I pay but also because I’ve worked up and down my side of England from Brighton to St Albans - I’m from London).

1b79hfi,Time to leave my high-pressure job?,"I’ve been at this job for about a year and a half. It’s a small business government contractor and I do business development/proposal writing. I’m about mid-level and make $90,000/year (NCR). I came to this job under the recommendation of a former boss who works here now.

There used to be someone of equal experience who worked with me, but she left, and was replaced by someone who also eventually left. Recently they hired on a very junior level person, who is helpful but can’t do a lot of higher level tasks.

My workload has started getting insane. I’m used to a high-intensity environment usually thrive. But with this job, I’m constantly underwater. I’m fine with working evenings/weekends when actually writing proposals (industry standard), but I find it ridiculous to do so for just normal operations. 

I burn all my cycles on the “must-do” tasks I’m assigned and end up with no time for the “should-do” tasks, which I’m then chastised for. If I sacrifice perfection to get things done by deadline, I get chastised for that as well. I output a huge amount of high quality work but it’s never enough. There are three recurring meetings every day which can consume anywhere from 45 minutes - 1.5 hours.

There’s also an independent contractor here who is my self-appointed work nemesis. She’s a primadonna with a massive ego. She gets offended by absolutely everything I do, makes my job more difficult, and talks trash about me behind my back constantly. As far as I know, leadership hasn’t done anything about this.

There’s really not much opportunity for advancement here, and I doubt they’ll give me a significant raise. I’m supposed to get bonuses from contracts won, but I only got $1,500 from a $20M win. Typically in this industry, these bonuses are a percentage of the total win value as compensation for unpaid overtime. They’re supposed to get me Top Secret at some point which would be good.

I took this job initially because I wanted to get a wider range of experience that would be difficult to get at a large company. But it’s starting to seem less and less worth it. I can’t figure out if I’m just burned out and frustrated or if I should be looking for something new.

1b78jbp,"Struggling to find a job I’m qualified for that pays what I make now, but job is insufferable.","Context: I’m 24 with no degree and work in the car rental industry as a City Manager, which I have been for 2 years now. I have been in the car rental industry for 5 years and flew up from counter rep to assistant manager to branch manager to city manager. I now run 2 offices and am responsible for the fleet of an entire city. 

Since February of last year I have been miserable at my current job, after getting looked over for a promotion after my boss/mentor quit (which, honestly, was wishful thinking anyways). Since then, the top brass has made a bunch of changes to both the bonus structure and pay structures, and I felt as if I should have received a pay raise for running multiple locations (promotion to city manager was a change in title only), this was denied and I moved on from asking. A couple months later, they restructured the bonus system and I lost incentives for one of my stores, as they deemed it unfair that a manager has the ability to bonus off multiple stores, so I lost the extra income there. I also live within a mile from one of my offices, yet I am told I need to spend 4-5 days a week at my office that is 90+ miles away and I need to cover my own gas and not be on the clock when I travel to that store. 

There is hardly any support from our back office or even my boss, as every time I ask for help with a problem I get the same generic answer of “ we need to figure it out” and then it never comes up again even when I ask for updates. They say my payroll is too high, yet I hardly have enough staff to keep the store running 16 hours a day without hindering the operation. It is starting to affect my personal life, as I am working 50+ hours a week plus the 3-4 hours a day of drive time to my other office, as well as being available by phone during normal business hours even on my days off. 

I have been putting in applications elsewhere so that I could cut down on the travel and make it make sense, but I can hardly get an interview set up with anywhere that isn’t 100% commission, which I don’t feel comfortable taking.  I know it’s because of my little experience and lack of degree, but it feels hopeless. Am I whining too much? Do I just need to suck it up and keep going? There is no further room for growth nor will there be any time soon.

1b787x2,"Who should I be more afraid of, my boss or the whole company?","Basically, I feel in the ether that budget cuts are gonna be heavy handed this year. While no one from my side of the department has been laid off at all, last year faced some pretty vicious firings on the other side of the department. However, I think one had to do with “company culture fit.” Aka higher ups liked this guy but everyone working with him hated him. Then his two associates got the dump too. For a fresh start overall? I really don’t know. What freaks me out the most is that a big higher up recently “retired,” but the rumor mill is reporting they were pushed out because of budget.

Anyway, for me, I just got a good end of year review. I’m on a team of 3, consisting of my manager and one other person hired after me. The two of them get along a lot better because they’re both the same demo and both type A. This didn’t bother me before. 

Now, I’m freaked lol recently, my manager has been getting complaints about being “hard to work with.” She’s super meticulous, and apparently people are complaining her tediousness is slowing down our process. Since that happened, she’s been absolutely slamming down on me for every little mistake and using language like “you’ve been here long enough to know better.” I don’t want to be the fat trimmed from the team if cuts come along.

Last detail to mention, my team’s function (the 3 of us) is easy to outsource. It’s cheaper to do it in house, but there are a lot of benefits to outsourcing. 

Looking for a new job is not a good option for me. I’m contracted to this place through a lot of tuition reimbursement. I’d have to pay a lot of money back if I leave.

What I’m saying is, do I:

1. Suck up to my manager in hopes of getting back on her good side. Hype her up in my review with our big manager. Dismiss the complaints about her to try to prevent outsourcing our team.

2. Express that my manager is a little difficult to work with. That the complaints are true. That way her feedback on my performance has less weight.

3. A mysterious third option lol

1b76pue,Do I stay or go?,"So I've been looking at moving in my company to another group offering 92k-119k (I currently make ~87k). I told my boss that I applied, and we just had a talk about it. It went... eh.

He basically made the case that this new position would be a step backwards for me, not forward. He told me I'd be making significantly more money if I just stay another 2 years to get promoted (tbh, I'm not looking to stay in this company past 3 years, let alone my current group). My current salary band's cap is 132k, but I doubt I'd get anywhere near that at my current place. We also got a letter last May that basically told me I'm worth 96k, but that they won't raise my salary because I'm paid ""enough"" in their eyes (84k at the time). The new position's cap would be 141k.

Now, I did agree with him on a couple things he mentioned about my group vs the potential new group. He said I could get pigeon holed since the new position has the need for something pretty specific, whereas my current position offers pretty broad opportunities for growth. He also claimed that the new group is onsite all the time (although the company does offer 50% remote). My work life balance is important to me right now, but if I'm making significantly more money and working on something I'm passionate about(which I would be) I can try to balance coming on site more. 

Anyways, there's more context I can provide if asked but my question is, do you think my boss is just trying to keep me and deter me from looking elsewhere? Is this new opportunity actually better for me? Especially since I plan on leaving before 3 years, it makes logical sense to me to maximize the money I make. But I know it's also important to weigh every factor. So, ask me questions or provide your insights please.

1b75wre,Lost at the minute and don't know where to go? ,"Will make this short and to the point.

Background

Currently 29, male, from and living in UK. I've got a 1st class music degree and have worked in sales, account management, market research and operations. Recently got made redundant but before I did, I thankfully secured my dream job (management consulting in a big global firm, not top 4). The job doesn't start until September and it's not in UK - it's in a very expensive European capital city. 

I already feel so behind my peers, I now don't have a job, and the job I do have for September is a graduate job (I only graduated two years ago), meaning the pay will be around 35k euro, in a city that's quite expensive. I'll likely have to move home before I start in September because I don't have a job atm. 

I know there is a lot of opportunity for progressing within the management consulting company but I really feel so shit about having to start right at the bottom. I could apply for sales roles with my experience in the hope that I can land something and make more money but I really don't even know if I'll like it, and my gut is telling me to go with this role, as it's a proper career path, whereas I will feel like I'm not learning skills in sales. I know in a few years I should have the experience to ask for more money or will already be on good money but the short term financial hit (not being able to save, not being able to do anything) is really getting to me.

Part of me is saying to get into a sales role and work my ass off to make as much money and save as much as possible to play catch up with friends etc but the other part of me knows that taking the grad role will be more interesting and will provide more career satisfaction in the long run. I'm so tied with what to choose. 

Anyone been in a similar situation before and how did it turn out? Or any advice for me in navigating this?",Efficient_Paper_2817,1,1.0,0,1709647321,2024-03-05 14:02:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b75wre/lost_at_the_minute_and_dont_know_where_to_go/,3,2024

1b74zdo,Obesity nudging jobs ,"Obesity Nudging Jobs

Hi,

I want to work in behavioural insights and creating nudging measures to combat and reduce obesity rates as it’s quite a personal issue I’ve had, and I love the idea of working towards goals that I care deeply about on a personal level. 

Does anyone know what businesses, consultancies, specialise in this specific area? Just like a list of some would be very helpful for me! 

I’m quite keen to get moving with this career goal, and plan on going back to school to do a masters degree, hopefully in psychology or just stick with public policy/marketing like I planned. Either way I would be looking to apply for internships or work experience between now and September, and then also for next summer in between first and second year of the course.

I like the idea of getting contracted work from the government or partnering with retailers to advance this goal of nudging people into healthier choices, for example, conducting market research to see where an adapted shopping trolley could work and in what shops, then redesigning it, implementing it and monitoring the results to see if it improved peoples food choices.

1b74eo0,From £30k a year to over £150k a year in 2 years,"In 2021 I started working in a small seed stage start-up in sales earning £30k a year. I was sold on the dream by the CEO that I would have loads of equity in the business and once we raised a series A, my shares would be worth a lot of money and that I would be one of the first hires meaning I could be leading a big team. Amature mistake looking back now ahah  
  
After a year of working in this start-up, my salary didn't increase and I knew that this was a sinking ship. I recognised the following.  
  
  
  
High employee churn - loads of employees would get fired with 6 months or less  
  
Changing business models 5x over the year - this is fine if your building a crazy new tech or your operating in new industry, but we weren't doing either  
  
CTO of the company left - huge red flag  
  
CTO of the company left - a huge red flag iness - again huge red flag  
  
The company kept hiring overseas and always paid less then the market  
  
Everyone was working 14 hours a day  
  
Once I knew that this start-up was a sinking ship, I started researching about proper sales jobs i.e sales jobs that pay you a good base and commission on top.  
  
For context, this is what I learnt about SAAS sales / tech sales, and I immediately knew that this was a much better opportunity than my current job.  
  
For context this is what I gathered about saas sales.  
  
  
  
As an entry sales person, SDR, you can make up to £45k base and £75k+ OTE  
  
As an account executive you can make up to £65k base and £100k OTE (commission on top)  
  
Enterprise sales reps make 100s of thousands.  
  
Armed with this information, this is what I did.  
  
  
  
Built out a plan of attack, researching companies, industries, locations and putting all this information into a spreadsheet  
  
I applied to loads of SDR and AE roles  
  
Within a few months, I landed a new AE role in a small tech start-up as a first AE, £45k base £100k OTE.  
  
I worked there for about 1.5 years and again I realised I had made the same mistake even though I was making a lot more than my first job.  
  
Long working hours  
  
High employee churn  
  
Lack of business vision  
  
And the fact that the business could go under anytime soon  
  
So I started working on a new plan  
  
  
  
I only applied to start-ups with significant funding building in AI, ML, Cybersecurity and any other industry that is taking over the world  
  
Created a list of the top 20 companies that I liked, based on funding, remote work, top investors, £50-100m in funding, positive glassdoor reviews, high employee growth count, positive G2 reviews, Linkedin insights about growth and employee tenure etc  
  
I then spent 60 days aggressively applying, networking, cold calling, cold emailing everyone  
  
60 days after this process, I landed a new role, £77k base with a potential to make over £150k, fully remote as one of the first sales hires.  
  
This was a 2 year journey, but it can be done by anyone if you strategise well and attack fast you can 5x your salary very quickly. I did get lucky multiple times but I worked my ass off and I didn't give up until I found something I knew I deserved and something that is worth while my time.",Revolutionary_Web687,1,1.0,1,1709642933,2024-03-05 12:48:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b74eo0/from_30k_a_year_to_over_150k_a_year_in_2_years/,3,2024

My mom says “welcome to adulthood” but I know this can’t be it.
See I already know a bit about adulthood, I moved out at 17 and had a job I loved cutting fruit in produce at an upscale grocery store. I paid my rent and utilities on time and sure I didn’t have much money left but I was at peace. My landlord raised rent and suddenly my pay wasn’t enough, plus I missed my family so I decided to move back home while I looked for a better job that was more of a career. That’s how I became a medical assistant, I’ve always thought I loved the medical field, I was inspired by my mother and grandmother who were both nurses and I’ve always loved science.
Fast forward now, I’m constantly anxious about going to work, my Sunday scaries start on Friday, I cry a lot, at home and at work, the pressure of making mistakes, dealing with angry customers, there’s also never any acknowledgment or positive feedback, it’s always negative. I’m just not motivated to do this at all. I wake up started and panicked on Saturday mornings because Ive had a nightmare about work. I can’t even use my brain towards any other tasks because I’m so consumed in how to improve for a job that I don’t even like. See, learning in school is one thing, but being in the feel is a whole other game. 
Now don’t get me wrong, I love working in a general sense, but not in a career that I have no interest in.

I enjoy writing big essays for fun, giving girls life advice, I’m an amazing cook and I also love travelling.

1b71i8g,How do I deal with a colleague who weaponizes incompetence?,"I'm working on a project for a new CRM program and the colleague I'm talking about is one of our testers. He is around 50, works in customer service and he used to lead the department but was demoted.

Of all the testers he is the only one who calls me daily. Each time he calls me I notice he hasn't progressed past the test for which he called me last time. The program is very intuitive, but I'm partially giving him the benefit of the doubt, because he's from an older generation (but honestly not even that old).

There are several ""workcenters"" where you have to basically test the same stuff over and over, but still he calls me to ask about something I've already explained him before. He calls when he can't find a button within a few seconds, he calls me if something doesn't work from the first try without checking whether he followed the correct steps, he calls me with questions I've explained him once or even twice before...

It's all to the point where I think this is no longer normal. I've tested everything before, so did my manager and several sales reps, no one needed to be held by the hand like this one colleague and he's been working with our former CRM program for years.

How to deal with this colleague? My manager and I are starting to think he really doesn't want to put in the energy and figure things out on his own.

1b6zsze,Paranoid my job is already finding a replacement for me,"Hey ... feel like I may be paranoid about a job I just got hired for. I have been in the application process since December for a job, and found out I got an offer last week and had also signed the agreement last week. The recruiters were lovely, but it was brought up in my interviews that they were concerned I would eventually leave the role, as I have my Masters in a slightly different feild. I have had bad work experience before, and honestly I am just wanting a job with good training and support, rather then something that is exactly what I did in my degree.

Yesterday I had seen an advertisement for a graduate position in the same role I was just offered. It is a graduate program so slightly differnet with higher pay, but exact same responsibilities listed. I guess I'm paranoid that the recruiters and manager are already thinking of a replacement for me. This company is pretty big and has offices all over the world but the team im working with is small, male dominated and middle aged. I was under the impression I was replacing the survey technician who is a graduate as he is travelling over seas. When i initially talked to the recruiter last year, she did mention not many people had applied for the role, aswell as their are no graduates in the team (except for the guy leaving).

I was made redundant in the most awful way at my previous job (was not given written notice), and treated so poorly. I'm so paranoid about this happening again.  

I'm pretty new to the work force, graduated in 2022, so I don't know much, I guess I'm just already starting to feel worried",Late-Recording-2259,5,1.0,2,1709624851,2024-03-05 07:47:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6zsze/paranoid_my_job_is_already_finding_a_replacement/,3,2024

i struggle with anxiety when it comes to new things, people, jobs, etc. however, once i meet people enough and get the hang of things, people tend to find me a reliable employee and friend. 

today was my first day at a new job, and i was super anxious. i slipping up my words and wasn’t fully able to follow up in conversation with coworkers. anxiety-free me wouldn’t struggle to keep the conversation alive. i’m not normally socially awkward, but sometimes my anxiety really trips me up. i really love this role and my coworkers were sweet. i’d love to get along with them, but i don’t want them to think i’m weird or incompetent. 

some things that i have tried, yet the anxiety persists:
1. exposure therapy - purposefully trying to start conversations with random people 
2. a motivational pep talk beforehand 
3. breathwork. 

would appreciate any pointers/tips. thanks in advance!

1b6weky,I think my co-workers are talking about or enquiring about my personal life without me present.,"Please remove if this isn't the right subreddit for this and apologies in advance but I'm going to be as vague as possible. 

I had a co-worker ask me a personal question about my life. The question would've been fine if it didn't specifically refer to a piece of information I had only told one separate person at work before (so not the person asking the question now.)

The question wasn't about anything particularly innappropriate like my love life but it's something I try to avoid talking about at the workplace regardless.

I didn't think it would've bugged me but then the thought of my co-workers talking to one another about something I like to keep private has been weirdly upsetting me for the past week.

I don't think I'm going to do anything about it now as it's not that big of a deal, but if I do find more people know this piece of information, should I speak to someone about it or just leave it?

EDIT: Just for clarification, I had only told the one person this private information about me in the first place after they asked a similar question to the one I got last week out of the blue. And I didn't know how to shut down the conversation or avoid answering gracefully without being rude. So some tips and pointers into polite ways to not answer a personal question like that in the workplace would be appreciated as well.",NewWayToCope,1,0.5,3,1709612938,2024-03-05 04:28:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6weky/i_think_my_coworkers_are_talking_about_or/,3,2024

1b6w1p0,Need Advice On a Situation I am Facing at Work,"Hey Folks,  
I am new to Reddit so I am sorry if this is not in the preferred format, but I am hoping I can get some advice on a situation I am facing at work.  
I have been with my company for a long time and it is a large corporate environment. I have had a very successful tenure during my time with the company and have been promoted several times to the point where they created a different position that didn't exist before to have me take on a larger and more advanced technical role for the business area I am in (been doing this unique role for several years). I have received the highest possible performance evaluation (only 10% of each business unit can receive this score) on my annual evaluation every year since my first year with the company. This is not to gloat or pat myself on the back, but wanted to frame the situation in that I have built up a tremendous amount of goodwill with my department and the role I am doing ""was"" (I'll get to that below) my dream job. There were two things that have happened recently (likely related) that completely turned my work world upside down.  
The first issue I have run into has occurred over the last month and half. My bosses' boss has been sending me a lot of projects and work and this has prevented me from doing the responsibilities I love doing at my job. This extra work has been non-stop and assuming this doesn't continue, this work will take me several months to complete. Unfortunately, there is no one else in my org that has the technical skills to do these projects so they are all being sent to me. My current job is extremely busy as it is so all of my projects have to go on hold because the work I am being assigned takes priority (since it is coming from our department head). I have mentioned to my boss that this is getting a little overwhelming and stressful and the response that happened two days after I first mentioned this shocked me (I'll explain in the next paragraph). Since I have had that conversation, I have received three new projects in the last two weeks from my bosses' boss, only adding to the stress I am facing.  
The second issue (and way more impactful on me personally) occurred shortly after I mentioned that I was feeling a little overwhelmed by all of these additional projects. My boss granted all of our technical access to another employee in our org who is several steps below by title. My boss informed that person that they were going to have them trained to be my replacement and wants me to train them on my responsibilities as a way to help me out since I am getting slammed with work by their boss (my boss is not denying this). I was extremely upset by this and scheduled meetings with my boss and my bosses' boss to explain why this upset me. Firstly, I would have liked to have been involved in the discussions surrounding what responsibilities I could give up or train on that would actually help free up some of my time. Another option I would have been comfortable with is if they would have created another version of my role and have me train this person to do that job, with those specific responsibilities. Another thing I wanted to mention here, is that I have made it very clear to my superiors that I love the role I am in and don't want to advance anymore. It is perfect for me and what I want out of a job, and there is no threat from me to either of their jobs in the future.  
I am embarrassed to even write how this situation has made me feel. I can't sleep well anymore. I am not eating as much anymore. I don't even enjoy my weekends or free time after work anymore. I am strongly considering getting professional help, but I also have a great support system in my family that I have been able to stay afloat for now.  
The conversations with my superiors were positive in that they said the right things but I cannot ignore the actions that played out (I have always felt that actions speak louder than words). I stressed two concerns I had over the second situation. The first is replacement has strong meaning in the work world so I was actually concerned my job was in jeopardy and I was training my replacement. The second option (and probably more realistic in this scenario), is that I am going to lose the responsibilities I love doing and my full time job is going to turn into all of these extra projects for my department head that I am not as passionate about and I don't enjoy as much.  
Both of my superiors said that I am the most valuable employee in my department hence why I am getting these extra assignments. They both have raved about me in the past and I get a ton of exposure to our department head's boss for all of these extra projects I am doing. The performance reviews are also filled with very nice things about the impact and value I bring to the team. I don't think either of them are bad people and I like and respect both of them.  
Thank you for reading if you made it this far so now on to the point of why I am asking for help. I am not comfortable with the arrangement of training this new person (even after the two discussions with my superiors). As much as I tell myself that my superiors are likely not lying to me and they have no history of screwing over another employee in my time in the department, I for some reason just cannot get comfortable with the training arrangement they have. I want to inform my manager this week that I want to start exploring other opportunities in my company over the next couple of months and can lead and document a transition plan that will cover some of the responsibilities I have. I don't fear retaliation as people change jobs all of the time at my company and even if I trained this new person on the stuff I do, it is going to take at least a year (probably multiple years) for them to be where I am at. We unfortunately need to get approval before posting out to a new role internally so this conversation would need to happen eventually regardless.  
I don't want to make a decision I will regret. I like the people I work for but the way it went down (my manager is new to this type of role and maybe overlooked the possible impacts of these actions) has bled into my personal life and affected my mental health. This job was a dream job last year and was the happiest I have ever been at work. I could ignore the first issue as just a busy period before I can get back to the things I like doing at my current job. The second issue was me losing all the trust I have built up for years and years which I value greatly in the workplace. Do you think I would be making a mistake by pursuing other opportunities and ending the goodwill I have built with my superiors? I am so torn on this but know I will hit a major breaking point over the training arrangement as I am going to be reminded of it every week while I am training this person.

1b6w0ol,Need advice on how to prepare for a meeting after not getting a promotion. ,"I was informed they were going in a different direction for a promotion. They said we appreciate you taking on more responsibilities and projects. That my ownership of the projects was evident by the results, but I just didn’t have enough experience yet. He said he struggled to make this decision because he feels I am a strong asset to the team. I honestly expected this. I have about 2 years of experience in my role. What I didn’t expect was how frustrating it would feel to essentially hear there’s nothing to specifically work on, just hang around a little longer. 

I was told they would set up a meeting with the VP and Sr. VP to talk about how they can help me get the experience I need to progress in my career. 

I’m not sure how to prepare for this meeting. I’ve raised my hand for every opportunity for and never turned down additional work. I’m not sure what else I can do to get more experience. I manage most of the team’s biggest projects and I’m a bit concerned about getting strung along.

Embedded salaries are lacking where I am and so are job opportunities. I find it hard to get much more than the bare minimum done. There just seems to be bullshit at every turn. I ask a simple question and it turns into a meeting. The build system is broken (again). Leadership is pushing their shiny new tool to track OKRs and make themselves seem relevant. I commute to the office just to take meetings on zoom. You know the drill.

I can't afford a master's and most of the certs just seem like cash grabs...

This lack of direction makes it hard to learn new skills outside of work as I don't know what I should focus on.. first I wanted to get my CCNA, then decided I should focus on security, then changed my mind to learn F#, then decided to learn nothing at all and go touch grass instead.... and then back to F#.

When it’s good, it’s good but lately the downside has just been impacting my mental health. I’ve been at the same company for the past 3 years and I feel like my experience has been mostly negative (from a quota attainment and pressure perspective) and it’s impacting my personal life, friendships and relationship, because I feel insecure about everything. I feel like I’m negative all the time and stuck in fight or flight and just constantly feeling vigilant that I’m going to be put on a performance plan. Real or imagined, the fear is crippling to me.

1b6v9fb,Should I job hop despite having a good situation?,"Hi all, I’m a 28M who’s feeling like I’m falling behind career wise. I have a good job in data analytics and even just got a promotion this week to senior analyst but I’m way below where I want to be. I thought by now I’d at least be a manager and hopefully a director however I have made a couple career changes to this point which have set me back. For reference, I moved from revenue management (3 years) to FP&A in a different company (1.5 years) to moving to Data Analytics for the past 1.5 years in the same company.

Now that I got promoted my chances of moving to a manager role have been pushed out by a 1.5 - 2 years and I am not sure I can stand being an analyst that long. It seems like the obvious answer would be to leave but I’m worried this could back fire on me. For one, outside of my role this company has been fantastic for me. The work life balance is great, I feel respected by my manager/team, and have good job security. Would it be worth it to trade all of this for a higher role? Or maybe I should milk the good times? Has anyone else been through something similar and made the jump? If so, what happened? TIA

1b6unio,Stay somewhere safe or take a risk and a raise?,"Do I stay with my current job or take the offer? Posting on fiancés throwaway I don’t have a reddit

I 22m work currently as a full stack engineer at a midsized SaaS company making 105k pre benefits, 110k post. 

I’ve been in my position for one year and my company currently offers a standardized annual 2.5% raise. 

There doesn’t seem like much room for growth based on continuous promises of promotions to others on the team that have gone unfulfilled.

The job in question is a full stack position at a much smaller sales company, been in business a long time and have a tech team of about 3. It pays 140k base a year plus benefits and bonuses, which I was told were plentiful. I really impressed the team in my interview and basically got the offer out of the gate which I’m happy about.

Both fully remote. 

Why I’m thinking of changing: obviously the pay. Also, I previously worked 5+ years at a small nonprofit as a lead tech guy and I think I like smaller team dynamics more. I feel my current company is very corporate and the ladder and very strict and manufactured. This company seems to bring the opposite of that. 

There’s also been drama lately with new HR rules that require doctors notes  to use previously allotted paid sick time or you’re placed on PIP, and my recently ex-close friend due to personal differences who I got the job through works with me which isn’t the most comfortable of situations although not unbearable. 

Why I’m nervous to change: I guess I’m comfortable. I feel like I have job security right now. My fiancé and I are about to buy a house and start trying for kids and while the extra funds sound nice they’re not 100% necessary and I worry I’ll switch to something and lose it and end up affecting our plans. The company seems chill but I’ve also seen my fiancé work at places that hide their crazy until she’s hired and don’t want to end up like that. Also I did 5 years at one job then 1 year at another, I want another longterm job if I can so I don’t end up job hopping too much.

All this time, I have been clear that I am seeking growth and will make an attempt at an internal transfer to another team, and the entire time she has said she's supportive.

But when the position finally posted, she acted offended that I am interested and denied giving a letter of recommendation. I've also noticed that she gets upset when other hiring managers ask me to apply to their teams, she would say it's unethical for them to poach me without approaching her first. And lately she has been recommending that I apply for specific roles in the company, and upon digging I know they already have a candidate in mind so it would be a waste of my time.

I can't think of a way out of it but to change companies. I want to stay internal but not sure how I can overcome her lack of support to transfer, and frankly this experience has soured my trust in her. This relationship no longer feels mutually beneficial, and this is demotivating to continue performing for someone that doesn't have my interests in mind.

Is there any way to salvage my situation without leaving the company? Do I need to build advocates who are willing to circumvent her? Or will this bridge burn either way?",Despicable-Toast,3,1.0,2,1709607658,2024-03-05 03:00:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6ulap/manager_not_willing_to_support_internal_promotion/,3,2024

1b6tlgx,Worries of Job Competition! Broad General Business Degree or Niche Major?,"I'm currently on the path to a bachelor's in marketing but every day I realize more and more how saturated the field is becoming. I feel like influencers and others without degrees are just starting from scratch and landing all these jobs, making my degree useless. Should I change my major to general business? This would give me options in marketing but also finance, HR, etc. The only thing holding me back is that because it's a broader major it might be harder to get accepted for jobs (ex; being accepted for a finance position over a legit finance major). Has anyone gotten a degree in Gen Business? Have you found a good job? Would you recommend I figure out exactly what I want to do and go for something niche instead? Thanks!  
  
Also, may be beneficial to know I'm in my first year of college and as long as I stay in the business range (which I 100% plan to do) I can change my major until the beginning of junior year without 'wasting' any time or credits.

1b6pp6y,What should I do? Tough Life Decision.,"Hello!

I need help with this tough life decision. Thank you in advance for hearing me and providing feedback.

I'm 24. I finished my undergrad 2 years ago (B.S. Biology). I was originally going to school to become a Doctor. Like many, I found out that this wasn't quite where my passions lie. I decided that maybe I could become a Physician Assistant (PA), therefore, I've been working as a medical assistant to gain the clinical hours necessary to apply to PA school. I'm now at the point, where I must decide if I want to spend 100,000 and 2-3 years to become a Physician Assistant.

Most of my motivation for becoming a Physician Assistant, is that it would set me up for a good career with a good work life balance. However, it is not my dream job. Most of my motivation to become a PA is that I could eventually work part-time and then spend the rest of my time doing what I love: comedy and writing. Although I have no doubt that I could be a great PA, I would never feel fulfilled, just being a PA.

I don't like the idea of spending 2-3 years just to get a safe job that I would only want to work part-time, however, the sacrifice of only 2-3 years would set me up for a great career that I would always have, making enough money to support myself and a family. In a time as of now, where money is scarce and the future doesn't look very optimistic, it makes this a hard question to answer.

Have you had to make a similar life decision? What did you go with?

Is PA school and the life of a PA too demanding to have free-time?

If I choose to give up on a PA career, what could I do for work while chasing my aspirations?

It's tough, because I don't know any other careers that I could work part-time.

1b6ofa5,Entrepreneur/Business Owner Career Help; Help Me Focus!,"Hello, friends. I'm seeking career change advice. I have an entrepreneurial background with significant experience in K-12 education businesses and tech/e-commerce, now seeking stability (if that's possible) working a 9-5 gig to rebuild some savings before moving on to the next business. I have a bachelor of the arts with a business focus (music business) so I'm hoping I can figure out what to do without getting another degree. Music does not pay what I need it to pay so I am looking for other ideas.  
After facing business challenges post-COVID (closed two brick-and-mortar stores) I discovered product management as an option, but I've learned that I likely won't get into PM without first working at another startup (not my startup, which doesn't count according to some recruiters I've talked to) or a bigger company in a product-adjacent role. 

I also looked into coding boot camps to pursue software dev positions, but the market seems to be a nightmare for mid-30's career changers given all of the layoffs and I don't want to commit to 6 months of education if I'm going to spend another 6 months unemployed.  
Preferences include M-F work, hybrid or WFH, and avoiding door-to-door sales (leading me to consider tech roles). I'm in the Greater NYC area. I do not have a technical degree, though I can ""talk the talk"" and have built many websites and a handful of businesses using no-code tools, including e-Commerce and service businesses. I've raised capital, too. VC jobs could be interesting but seem impossible to break into, especially at a wage I need at this point in my life.  
What types of roles should I be looking at that can get me to the 6-fig range in the next year or two without wanting to claw my eyes out scamming grandma into paying $60k for a $25k roof as a sales rep at a solar/roof company, and without going completely back to square one income?  
I'm ""narrowed down"" to:  
\-Assistant product manager (I have been applying and got a pro resume done)

\-customer service at a tech/startup co  
\-Business analyst/similar (I'm finding that this is very tough to get into without a CS or financial degree/MBA or similar)  
\-SaaS sales (Applying to these roles, but I do not have a specific focus here; the depth of this category is massive. So many variations and paths here and I'm not sure where to focus)  
I am financially strapped and very stressed trying to figure this out. I blew all my cash on trying to keep my previous business afloat, have not had income in months, and need help focusing my efforts. Recruiters are telling me I'm in a tough spot in this market because companies are nervous to hire past business owners for fear of them leaving to start another company (probably true), and that with my non-traditional history, I will have an uphill battle against fresh MBAs or CS grads, or those with a history of traditional jobs.

Nearly three weeks ago, my company laid off 10% of the company and gave various reasons. Some were told their positions were being eliminated. Some were told it was a cost savings effort. I don’t believe any of it. My team was laid off. It’s now solely me, handling the work of a handful. It’s less than ideal.  
I thought for sure that the company would offer me a decent pay bump and a handsome bonus for all of the new responsibility incurred. I’ll also be expected to train the new hires. Yes. My coworkers that were laid off are now being replaced after they heard “your position is being eliminated.” I was told that I am to help rebuild and direct the new team toward their responsibilities that will be updated(by me).  


My manager had told me today she had pleaded with senior level leadership to readjust my pay and bonus(after she found out I was staying on the team). I believe she made an effort. I contacted one of my former coworkers. He shared the confidential document showing his severance...it included his bonus. His bonus is higher than my bonus. I had more high visibility and measurable deliverables last year. I own more products. To top it off, I had mentioned to multiple levels above me last year(and earlier this year) that my expectations were to be promoted this year and join a new team that better fit my career trajectory. They have overlooked this at every opportunity. It really sucks.   


Tomorrow, I am having a conversation with an executive that I've got a fairly good professional relationship with. I know it's likely impossible that they'll readjust the previously allocated funding to retain my employment with them. I've got a few great reasons to leave, not enough to stay. I'd love to search for a new role at my own leisure. I'm also known to be fairly direct in conversations.   


What should I avoid in this talk tomorrow?  
How should I approach possibly getting more money?

1b6lxgp,Early 30s. Moved back home after 5 years in Florida and in the middle of a career change and I think I made a mistake.,"My brother passed away about a year ago after battling alcoholism and mental health issues for over a decade.

I was in the middle of pursuing a career change from nonprofit fundraising to wildlife conservation and / or veterinary medicine when this happened. I was doing everything I had ever wanted as a kid. I went back to school to study something I loved. I was volunteering to rescue manatees. Everything was going right until this happened.

I got home from my calculus class and my dad called me and told me that my brother was dead. Losing a sibling has got to be the most excruciating pain.

I fell into a deep depression and had to take a medical withdrawal from my courses. My husband and I decided to move back home about 4 months ago because I was not well. I was just numb. I thought I needed to be close to family.

And now, I can't remember why I felt that way. Why I felt things were so bad that I needed to pack up and leave everything.

I felt so lost until about January. I started reading a book about a veterinarian's life and it really inspired me. I started to feel better and applied to a community college here to restart my classes.

But now, I'm not feeling it again. I miss my life in Florida. I miss the path I was on. I wish I could go back in time and decide to stay there. I feel so lost. I don't know what to do.

I made a list of goals in January to help me stay on track and to remind me what I want to do. But it's easier said than done.

I know for sure that I want to go back to school. That I want to live by the ocean again. That I want to help wildlife. I feel like I lost the fire I had when I first decided to pursue this career change and I'm trying to figure out how to get it back.

Only internship was with a nonprofit where I put together marketing and training materials on alcohol/health related issues for coalitions in our state. Total healthcare experience is 6+ years of direct care but little administrative duties.

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life but i’ve been able to still work through it. Was put on a PIP at my first postgrad job ($40k/yr) it tanked my health so I was unemployed for about 6-9 months. Got another job for $60k/yr but had a 2hr commute each day for training — was staying at hotels during the week. That lasted for 2-3 months before I quit. Couple months later I took this $15/hr job because my savings were running low.

tldr: 32, bachelor degree, making $15/hr with no benefits, plan to move states <1yr, 6+ years direct healthcare experience, mostly entry level jobs, little office and administrative exp, how can I pivot out of this field quickly or into a more higher earning position with only low level job exp?",cmuflyingCplace,5,1.0,5,1709585258,2024-03-04 20:47:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6lpwt/32_college_grad_making_15hr_how_to_advance/,3,2024
1b6l833,Data governance career: is it a valuable start?,"Hi guys! I'm towards the ending of my master degree in data science, coming from a background in humanities. I had recently an opportunity for a stage for a data governance role for a company. They've told me that the role is supposed to be initially on the data governance part but then it'll switch to a sort of interdepartmental role where I'll cooperate for digital projects and data stuff, being sure that governance is implemented and respected. More than this is difficult even for me to explain because is difficult to understand correctly, since it is my first experience in the data field.

The question is: how is the data governance field/management in data as a starting point? Where it can lead? Also, AFAIK, I see those roles more as senior roles instead that junior positions, am I wrong?

I would say I've probably heard about 100 people say out loud how being a Software Developer is one of the best careers.

Do you agree with this? Or is it maybe that I've been around people who are biased about Software Development as a career?

1b6knf0,How should I go about changing careers from sound to programming?,"Dont know how to change careers, would appreciate some outside perspective  
I'm 22, in Europe, I did a 2 year degree on Sound (kind of like a trade school equivalent) and I kind of regret it, I love music and all that but I don't like the jobs this degree gives you, and they're mostly low pay.  
  
I'm currently in a mostly remote job that I don't really like, in a country I don't like, but I have a lot of free time I'm just wasting doing nothing. I have complete job security for 1 year from now, after that I don't know what will happen.  
  
I'm drawn to programming , partly because I've already learned some in the past on my own and I like it (but I have a very hard time studying on my own), and also because of the possibility of higher paying and remote jobs. I have no idea which area of programming I'm more interested in.  
  
I was thinking of doing a 2 year online degree on programming. It's an online private school (around 2000€), and it's apparently pretty easy-going. Of course, as I've read online, this means you don't really learn much, but you still get an official diploma, recognized by the government. I was thinking also of doing, simultaneously, [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), or some similar online (free or cheap) course, where I can actually learn and build a portfolio.  
  
I also thought of going to college for CS (not that expensive in my country, sometimes even free), but I already tried that when I was 18 and it was disastrous (admittedly, I was in a very bad mental space back then). Also, I could still do this after the online degree and, supposedly, finish the college degree in 2 or 3 years, instead of 4.  
  
Don't know how much of a clutter this post was, I've been thinking about this for a long time now and I'm still completely loss. I would greatly appreciate some help.",ThrowawayGKenobi,2,1.0,6,1709582693,2024-03-04 20:04:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6knf0/how_should_i_go_about_changing_careers_from_sound/,3,2024

1b6jfag,My long-awaited promotion costs me my best friend,"Three years ago, when I began my career, I was fully employed. Within my department, there was a girl my age who was friendly enough. Being an introvert, making friends was always difficult for me, but she took the initiative and approached me first. Soon, we were talking every day and became very close. We discovered we had similar childhoods and bonded over many shared experiences. It was the first time since first grade that I felt so comfortable with a friend.  
Last August, our manager suddenly left the company, leaving her as the most senior staff member with me following. Upper management offered her the managerial position, which she immediately accepted, and I was thrilled for her. Despite starting from scratch with no endorsement, she took on the challenge. However, she faced obstacles as other departments demanded results for projects that were previously the responsibility of our former manager. Despite her efforts to contact him, he ignored her for weeks. Upper management offered little support, instead blaming her for not documenting everything upon taking over.  
After five months of hard work, she managed to settle most projects and significantly improve the department, but it took a toll on her well-being. She was constantly stressed and on edge, visibly shaken whenever her work phone rang. I did what I could to help, assisting with schedules, data entry, and meeting summaries. However, when I couldn't meet all her requests due to my own workload, she didn't respond. Two weeks later, she requested a demotion.  
Recently, I was promoted by upper management. While she congratulated me in the group chat, our interactions since then have been strained. When I attempted to talk to her, she would nod and distance herself. Throughout the day, I checked on her, but she brushed off my concerns with few words. Later, she seemed cheerful and engaged with others in the office, which left me feeling confused and hurt.  
Discussing the situation with my sister, she suggested that my withdrawal of assistance may have contributed to her decision to leave her position, possibly leading her to blame me for her perceived failure. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, I am hesitant to confront her again or express how much I miss our friendship, fearing further disappointment.  
Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.

1b6huj2,Resigned From Position & Looking ,"30 M.
About two weeks ago, I quit from my position as a Content Strategist for my alma mater’s Alumni Association.
I worked there for a little over a year, and it was a disappointing experience to say the least given the lack of leadership and disorganization. 
I was hired under the pretense that I would help bring some much needed energy to their campaign communications, citing their failure to engage alumni as well as their failure to establish an effective tone and voice that was both professional and younger. I quickly realized this wasn’t going to be the case.
My supervisor is an individual who avoided any form of confrontation with people that were impeding our work, choosing instead to throw his subordinates under the bus. According to him, our goal in working there should have been to ensure that everyone enjoyed working with us.
In recent months, things became very toxic in the workplace out of nowhere. He became heavily critical of the work I was producing, and he reported me to Employee and Labor Relations for allegedly not producing quality work for several months despite previously never speaking to me about the concern. After going back and forth through emails and meetings, I was so emotionally and mentally drained that I quit, opting not to give them a two weeks notice but instead quitting effective immediately.
While I do have a side gig that pays well, it is a freelance position, and I’m in search of something full time.
Does anyone have any advice that I should keep in mind during this time?
This is a terribly condensed account of my experience there, and I can’t stress how disappointed I am in my alma mater, but I do feel that making this decision was for the best.",_thewolfofwalmart,1,1.0,0,1709575952,2024-03-04 18:12:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6huj2/resigned_from_position_looking/,3,2024

1b6hq1c,Did not get a raise despite being eligible for one – worth pushing?,"Context: My company does compensation reviews on an annual basis in March. The cut-off date for new hires to be eligible for the increase is a Nov 1 start date. I started in mid-October, while my new manager started in early November. Our hire dates differ by two weeks, but only I was eligible for a pay increase. My manager is new to our company so I don’t know if she was aware of this, but I didn’t get a compensation increase this year. The submission to HR was due well over a month ago and my coworkers were notified of compensation increases this week. We are a small firm so I don’t think she would have been specifically notified that I was eligible. 

I was hired during an opportune time and had a few competing offers — I’m very young but qualified for my role, and correspondingly I’m currently compensated significantly over the market rate for my experience level and I know there are general concerns about internal equity for my current compensation level (people my age at my company are compensated about $30K less than me on average, but I am performing well at the job level I’m being compensated for, which is several grades higher). I also received a quite large signing bonus a few months ago.

How much of a deal should I make of this and how can I best bring this up to her? I am very new to the company, so I’m still trying to make a good impression. I know I’m entitled a raise but a bit concerned about the optics of making a big deal so soon after getting hired.

The new generation seems less concerned about spending decades in the same company and more interested in the value of diverse experiences. I've embraced job hopping over the last 3-4 years, and it's been a game-changer. Instead of being stuck in one place, I've absorbed knowledge from various companies, gaining insights into different problem-solving approaches.

Interestingly, I've noticed that this approach has translated into a significant salary increase. Today, I find myself only under my boss (who appreciate the diverse skill set I've acquired through my multiple experiences).

Maybe it's just the Monday-blues but I'm not feeling well today at all.",Parking_Reputation17,69,1.0,53,1709572131,2024-03-04 17:08:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6g7m9/i_feel_like_in_order_to_get_ahead_you_have_to_be/,3,2024
1b6g095,I(26F) don't know what I want to do and need to pick brains from all walks of life,"Okay so basically I have tried out about 4 different types of jobs and haven't found the one I see myself moving up in. I have tried food&bev, retail, hospitality, and tech support. I'm not truly interested in any of these. I do have a Bachelors in IT, but I figured out I don't like it too much. I also don't care for programming and thats a huge part of it.

&#x200B;

What I liked the most is the position I had in retail. It was Fulfillment Supervisor at a Target. I basically helped fulfill online orders within time limit and helped reach metric goals by delegating the team. I guess I also didn't mind being a barista, but not because of the hospitality part of it really. More like the speed and efficiency part of it. 

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong - I don't hate people. I'm just more introverted. I'm not the super bubbly type. I currently work in a hotel and it is draining. I ""fake it till I make it"", but at the end of the day I feel the most exhausted and unsatisfied I've ever felt at a job. 

&#x200B;

So with that, I believe I enjoy: numbers, metrics, clear goals, less hospitality oriented, and something that has clear opportunity for growth. Less physical if possible, but not completely opposed to it.

&#x200B;

Anyone have any ideas to what I might like? I feel like toast I'm doing so much research and I need help from people with experience.

Me: No University, 3,5 YOE, First Job, Not USA

  
Current J:

* Underpaid, barely above minimum wage, chill job, 4 days of HO,  no team, additional 5 days of holidays. I am roughly 10% under the Median for my Education+YOE+Location+branche. Although, all those ""Calculators"" return some strange values....
* I want to leave the company, but it´s not urgent.

  
New J: 

* 34% more pay than now, 20% more pay than median, chill people and job, 2 days of HO, longer commute, no additional holidays,
* I already know the team and company
*  Before we begun the Interview Process my Minimum to switch Jobs was \~7% under the current offer. But now I kinda want to ask for more, lol. I asked for \~10% more than the offer and the Recruiter was shocked by the amount. (big eyes, lound inhale, told me)
* I have already heard that they refused Candidates because they asked for way too much money.
* They asked me if I want to join them.  


Okay, what should I do next? Should I send a ""Thank you, I will need some time to go over your offer Email""?   
What´s with some of the descriptions/benefits in the offer I do not understand? Ask immediately or on a later Mail?

1b6fozu,"Relocated, but $40k to go back","Recently accepted a position out of state that gives me security, stability, and amazing benefits including a pension in the public sector. Problem is, it pays me $40K less than a position I previously applied to and am NOW (After I relocated) being considered for in the private sector. 

Current state I moved to offers a slightly lower cost of living, less people, safety and better education. Aside from the shift in weather and less income, I don't see many drawbacks.

Problem is even with all of the above reasons, I'm having a hard time turning down a potential $40k.  

The move hasn't cost too much if needed to eat my losses and move back. 

On one end I think of holding onto the current job i secured while I look for another that pays more here, but on the other, the bump in pay in my old state, although not as secure, is at the upper threshold of my profession. 

Would love to hear opinions.

1b676nr,Looking for advice on job offers while trying to change your career path,"Hello all,

I am looking for advice because I am really not sure what to do. I'm 26 and I have been working for 1 year in a specific IT field (field I have a degree in), but I am not satisfied with what I do and I feel like I chose the wrong path (I already felt like that before graduating, so it's not a new feeling). After a long reflection, I think it's time to pursue another career path, still related to IT but not quite the same, and I started following an online course and informed my current manager that I would like my role to change over the next months. 

However, a few weeks back I sent my resume for an open position at another company to do almost the same exact thing I do now and they called me this morning for an interview. And a few days ago another company contacted me on LinkedIn asking me to apply for an open position (similar role - and they have an office in the city I am quite desperately trying to move to, even if the job would be partially remote). 

I am torn. I am aware that the role I cover at the moment is not what I would like to do for the next 5 years, and I am willing to make a change. However, I don't have a degree in the other field and I am worried that I will never be able to get a job with that other role any time soon (and in my country, unfortunately, most companies don't care about MOOCs, courses and such).

I'll talk about it with my therapist soon, but I would like to know if any of you has ever gone through the same crisis and how you faced it. Thank you to anyone who read through here and stops by to share their experience.

I'd like to get some advice and thoughts on my job situation and future plans, especially considering my new role as a parent to a five-month-old daughter (Of course my prio 1 before anything else💙). Here's some background about me:

I'm 35 years old and hold a master's degree in Human Resource Management and Development, as well as a master's degree in labor law. Previously, I've worked at a trade union, including as an ombudsman and investigator within the labor market.

Currently, I work as an investigator in labor market and administration/advocacy at an employers' organization. I enjoy certain aspects of my job, such as delving into issues related to the labor market, administration, and economics. However, there are also challenging aspects, particularly regarding communication within the leadership team and difficulty finding peace in an open office landscape.

Another thing I'd like to explore is the opportunity to write more, such as reports and longer pieces. I want to feel like I'm truly developing and that my work is making an impact.

Today is my first day on parental leave, and I feel an indescribable relief at being able to spend time with my daughter until September 15th. I'll also be taking an additional four months of parental leave from the beginning of next year.

At the same time, I have a dream of someday conducting research. I've discussed the possibility of becoming a collaborative doctoral student with my boss, but it doesn't seem to be a priority for them.

I would truly appreciate any serious and constructive advice, support, and recommendations on how to navigate all of this so that I have a plan for myself when I return to work. 🙏",emillindstrom,2,1.0,0,1709541682,2024-03-04 08:41:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b663uc/my_next_step/,3,2024
1b65d2s,Software dev looking to level up/improve,"I have a bit of a unique situation. When I joined my company, i was working on a platform that was accessible (I am a blind screen-reader user), and I could get a lot done. I had some huge improvements, and that department still remembers me because I was one of the main developers. Most of them were performance fixes or huge quality of life fixes that made the lives of internal employees better.
I was moved around a bit, and ran into accessibility issues, which lead to me being fairly slow to get tickets complete, and also progress like I want. Recently, I've started resolving a lot of these issues. I found the right connections and time to let me spend time filing accessibility bug reports, as well as help organize and put priority on these tickets, and then work closely with the dev mostly doing all the accessibility fixes on the frontend to provide advice, testing, and most importantly to thank her, because she is the reason I'm gaining my job confidence back.
I'm working on fairly large issues again, and making really great progress in learning the new codebase and contributing. I'm also working on networking across the company so that I have more contacts and resources, can have more of an impact across the company, and can help move initiatives forward with regard to DEI as it includes accessibility.

As my side job, I am co-managing a team of 8 contractors that I worked closely with my co-director to recruit, hire, onboard and provide constant training and feedback for. I schedule one-on-ones once a month with them, and I've received great feedback so far; from the recruitment being one of the best they've done to us being great managers to work for. Our turn-over rate is really low. I believe this is a combination of willingness to advocate for them with the company they are contracted through, as well as spending time to provide one-on-one mentorship and help as needed. This part is particularly easy for me because I love working with each of them, and if I'm proud of anything, it's how much the team has grown.

The team also uses a portal that I built specifically for this work, using Django. The cool thing about this is I can iterate as we have business needs, and it works to deliver what we need in terms of time tracking, task management and timesheet generation.

I'm also working on building out an app geared toward mental health that market research has shown will be really useful. I am doing all the back-end work for this, devops, and most of the front-end as well. I plan to hire someone with working eyeballs to make it look good, but my goal is to turn over a fully complete app and let them touch it up with colors, graphics and animations.

I have two questions with my novel out of the way. First, what resources can I lean on to build and become stronger? I'm always reading articles on software development, joining talks, listening to videos and anything else I can. I also started reading books on management when we onboarded our contract workers because I really want to try to do the best I can there. Some people talk about a coach or mentor, and I'd really love to find someone I can bounce ideas off of/chat with in my field outside my current company.

Finally, I'm really curious where I go from here. I feel like I've hit a point where I'm struggling to find goals or things to work on. Not because I think I'm the best or the top of my field by far, and more because 2 years ago I would've never invisioned myself co-managing a team like this, working with the company directly and having the impact that we do. I'm really interested to find some paths or ideas I can start working toward that will have a meaningful impact on my career and my progression and would love any advice or tips.",sorressean,1,1.0,0,1709538746,2024-03-04 07:52:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b65d2s/software_dev_looking_to_level_upimprove/,3,2024

1b64ids,Career advice for somebody of inferior intelligence ,"Hello, all. This is a topic that I’m too embarrassed and ashamed to bring up to anybody IRL, so I’m really hoping to get some worthy advice from you guys. Throughout my whole life, it’s been very apparent to me that I’m not “smart”. I consistently fail to grasp concepts of any sort that are beyond elementary level. I’m often the only person that doesn’t get the joke. I never pick up on any nuances that a “smart” person would. I always performed poorly in logic-based classes in school (mainly math and science related classes). 

I’m certainly a proponent of the “believe in yourself” mentality, but I think it’s important to understand that there is a fine line between being realistic and lying to yourself. I know that I’m an honest, punctual individual that will work from sunup to sundown without a trace of a complaint. Unfortunately for me, I’m at a point in my life where I don’t know where to turn. I’m in my 20s and am hoping to luck my way into a career that pays middle class wages, won’t chew up my body and spit it out by the time I turn 40, and doesn’t require a mental capacity beyond surface level.

I have no experience in any trades such as mechanics, welding, construction etc. I do not know which one I want to do yet, but I have a bit of an idea. So, I have a few questions.

1. How hard is it to go into a trade foundation program blind?
2. What trade would you recommend? I am leaning more towards mechanics, instrument tech, or welding. I am not interested in plumbing, construction, or HVAC.
3. Are any trades 'easier' to go into if you have no experience?
4. Should I go into a foundation program first, then look for someone willing to hire me, or find someone to take me under their wing and help me through school?
5. Being a woman, how competitive/tough can a primarily men driven career be to work in? I am already somewhat familiar with that, but have not gone through school or worked in a career to fully know.

Sorry that was a lot of questions. I know I want out of my career, and want a head start by looking into this now, so by the time next June comes, I have a path and some money saved up. I just do not know where to start. I do not have many people in my life I can look to for guidance and help.

Any information is appreciated and DMs are welcome. Thank you in advance to all who take the time to help a gal out.",Luggernaut12,1,1.0,0,1709533528,2024-03-04 06:25:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b6403r/anyone_have_any_advice_or_guidance_for_me/,3,2024
1b63vqq,Is my employer trying to terminate me for moving states?,"

 I work as a financial controller for a company with offices in multiple states and work hybrid. Usually 2 days from office 3 days from home. Since about 1 year ago, I asked my boss if I could move states as my partner is looking to relocate home given his mum is unwell. The date was tbc as it depended on my partner securing a new job as he is a doctor and cannot work remotely. The city I'm moving to has a smaller office and none of my immediate team are there, but others I work with in the company are. I kept my boss updated every step of the way.
My boss said it was all fine and that they actually couldn't reject such a relocation unless I had competency issues, which she said I had none of. I was told by Human Resources that I'm a high performer in the company and she would get me a signed letter approving the move. Fast forward 11 months. I have 3 weeks until I move and still no letter approving the relocation, despite me following up weekly and being told it's all fine just waiting on busy people's signatures. 
Anyway, just last week, my boss called me out of nowhere and said there's been complaints about me in the company not always answering the phone and also scheduling non essential things during work hours. I was so confused and demanded to know who complained, and offered to send her my call log which shows if I do not answer, eg in a meeting, I shoot the caller a message and then return the call later. I get all my work done and achieve good results. I believe the non essential thing was the time I went to the gym at 12 when it is quieter. I asked my boss if it's because I took an earlier lunch break. She was vague but told me lunch is at 1, non negotiable. This is all news to me as it's always been flexible here.
Also when my grandma was in hospital literally on her death bed, I logged off a little early to say goodbye. Then i took a day of compassionate leave for her funeral. told my boss this. But none else as its very personal. Also family comes before work!
My boss told me if I'd be more open about my personal life maybe people will be more understanding. But they're all huge gossips, so why would I?
I'm feeling very stressed and like they're trying to create cause to fire me or not let me relocate soon. I do not have savings.
Please let me know your thoughts. Sorry for the rant!

1b631w8,Changing my career choice help,"Hey everyone 22M. Been working in construction since 19, specifically fire protection. When I was 19 I thought, “cool no college or trade school and I get to work my hands!” It was very exciting at first. 

However the 3-4 years I’ve done this job it’s been a constant uphill battle that honestly feels like I’m going nowhere. If I could go back in time I’d choose a trade more useful like hvac or electrician. Fire protection is one of the highest paying trades but it is by far filled with the most corruption out of all of them.

Drug abuse on the jobsite, verbal harassment and abuse, foreman showing up hours late, a bunch of man children that have no passion for their careers.

 I practically had to break my bosses arm just to get me started on my books after all the years I put in and honestly I’ve just had enough of the depressing environment you have to be around. None of the foreman actually teach you anything and would rather just use you to do the labor they don’t want to do. 

I’m a level headed hard working young man and I like to do things the right way, but in construction that makes you a pussy bc all the guys there are insecure and have very fragile egos. 

For a while now I’ve always been interested in trucking. Getting a cdl just sounds like a smart move even if I don’t end up enjoying it, it opens tons of job opportunities. 

But I am at a crossroads right now. I am unemployed as of recent. I was making $24/hr which is pretty decent. I’ve worked at 3 companies in fire protection 1 big company and 2 smaller companies. I DESPISED working in big companies that’s where you have to deal with a bunch of assholes but the only other companies near me that I can apply to are huge companies. 

I also don’t want to join into a company making them pay for the apprenticeship and books just to leave.

I was thinking about applying as an Amazon DSP driver for the time being to save up for trucking school. The pay is $20-21/hr where I live which is still a chunk of change taken away from my normal checks. But I figured it’d give me a small taste of how working on the road and navigating will be and I’d be able to avoid some of the mental anguish I feel towards the construction industry.

What do you guys think?",bdusainsiaoo,1,1.0,0,1709530268,2024-03-04 05:31:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b631w8/changing_my_career_choice_help/,3,2024

My options are -

1b5we99,Which job would be less mentally taxing? ,"I’ve posted this before but modified it. For context, I’m 26 years old and trying to finish up my bachelors degree, but I need a job. My options are either a gov customer service role with the county tax collector or a service/sales representative for a top 20 bank. They would both be full time, 9-5. I have OCD, general anxiety, and health anxiety. My concerns are getting yelled at, covid exposure, car accident, being overwhelmed etc.

1b5slno,[25m] Crossroads Conundrum: Career Success Meets Existence Void,"Hi everyone,  
  
I'm here seeking advice as I navigate through a pivotal moment in my life. My journey began in a rural area, facing educational and financial challenges, leading to an unconventional high school experience. My passion for math drove me, but mixed exam results meant closing doors to top universities. At 19, I joined the workforce, accepting an offer that merged work with weekend studies in IT, financed by my employer. This path led to a bachelor's degree in computer science from a shitty college and a successful tech career.  
  
Despite these achievements, including purchasing my own flat and maintaining a stable relationship, I'm haunted by what could have been, especially in mathematics. I realize I lack hobbies, passions, and a deeper understanding of complex topics, leaving me with sleepless nights and a yearning for more.  
  
Seeking Advice:  
  
Considering revisiting formal education in math or related fields, despite potential challenges. How do I navigate this decision?  
How can I find balance and fulfillment outside of work?  
If you've faced similar crossroads, how did you decide on your path?

  
TL;DR: Successful in tech but missing my passion for math and feeling unfulfilled. Considering further education but uncertain of the path forward. Seeking advice on balancing career, education, and finding personal fulfillment.

I also had the idea of going to be a Ultrasound Sonographer because they make really good money, only thing is I’m not sure if I would enjoy it/ be happy in that field. If anyone has any insight or thoughts of career paths I can take with this degree I would really appreciate your opinions.

1b5qtrw,"Currently out of high school, applied to different schools, I have choices but not sure.","Recently I graduated from high school. I am currently doing nothing but trying to figure out what to do with my life. Apparently no one wants to hire me, hate the job market, and I am taking a gap semester. So, the real talk is that, I want to do something that has internship option, so I can maybe have a chance after graduation. I got accepted into a commerce program and a aviation program. I love planes, my dream was to be a pilot since I was five years old, but seeing how bad the job markets are, that dream isn't realistic plus the debt is huge in aviation. I want to do commerce because that's the only choice, engineering is beyond tough, and health is beyond competitive, so that's the only option. I feel like crying rn because of how fast life changes after high school. I am not going out of my city, I would only do it for aviation. Now, since aviation is expensive and pretty competitive, I want to have something to fall back on such as commerce - finance, this university offers a internship for eight months as well. So, in general, do you think should I follow my dreams or do something realistic then follow my dreams?

I feel so inadequate and embarrassed that I’m almost 30 and I have no idea what else to do to at least get a job making more money. All of my friends around me are better off and I feel like a loser. 

I’m currently going for my associates of arts degree. I’m really interested in psychology/journalism/creative design. I’m the first to graduate high school and the first to go to college in my family so this is very uncharted territory. I’ve got no real guidance.

1b5kwew,Career Advice,"Hey everyone!

I just had a very basic question.  Would you recommend focusing on a specific job category or would you basically just apply to everything?

A little about me.  I just finished my Master's in International Affairs with a major in security and intelligence studies.  Sometimes I think about focusing on criminal intelligence jobs.  As in over time building up skills that directly apply to such positions.  For example I took some statistics and gis in grad school but then I would have to build on that.

Or do you just try to apply for everything?  I feel like when I was studying in grad school professors and other alumni might say oh you'll never know where you'll end up or something like that, but I don't think that's very helpful advice.  I think tailoring for positions you want would be better.

I went into grad school thinking I would focus on terrorism in West Africa.  I switched over to studying or focusing more on China.  But alphabet agencies and really any intelligence analyst position seems very difficult to get into.  So I'm just looking for something in between or hey who knows if I go some other route.

To turn this situation in my favour, I have had extensive experience dealing with German stakeholders, including the regulator, for 5-10 years, with English being the primary language of communication. I am currently intensively learning German through a course.

Although I am excited about the interview, I am also anxious about my language proficiency. I am dedicating one week to intense preparation for the interview. Any advice on how best to approach this?

1b5jnc5,What should I do next? Looking for your advice,"I am an Onboarding and Implementation manager and have a cushy remote job earning around 130 K a year at a medium-sized tech startup (series C around 200 ppl).  Its more of a Customer Success function with a slightly more technical tilt. I'm very fortunate in my current situation. The work is easy, low-stress and I'll likely keep getting raises of around 8 K/year

So here are the issues:

1) There aren't a ton of these types of roles out there that are paying what I currently earn and I feel a bit too reliant on this company/job. These roles are typically junior Customer Success roles, but at my company its a bit more respected/paid and separate than elsewhere. Ever since the macro-economy shifted to higher rates, the company hasn't been doing well. Not terrible. But there have been some layoffs recently. I also think the management team is making a lot of bad decisions concerning the product and the future of the company.

Ideally, I'd like to move into a management role in Onboarding and Implementation. At this level, it seems the qty of the roles paying what I want evens out with others in the GTM org like CSM lead or Solutions leads. Getting into this role or a managerial role at my current company seems unlikely for quite some time (unclear exactly how long but certainly years) given the needs of the business and job openings. I've also considered possibly a shift into sales engineering. One of my colleagues just did this, and I'm taking a wait-and-see approach to see how it works out for them. Possibly a good exit when another role like that opens up.

With all of this in mind, I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I'm very comfortable at the moment. On the other hand, I'm pretty worried about the future. It feels like now is the time to act, while I'm in a non-stressful situation and can bide my time. I'm just not sure what to do to protect myself or if I need to do anything. 

Does anyone have experience with this type of role? If so what was your trajectory? Can you share advice based on what I've described? Welcome other's thoughts too!

1b5jb1t,Should I switch to software engineering?,"I'm seeking advice on my career direction. Should I continue on my current path in operations, or should I gradually shift towards software engineering? My main objectives are to maximize my earnings and ensure future stability. Both fields are fulfilling to me, so I'm not concerned about job satisfaction. Additionally, I'm considering relocating to the US; I'm currently based in the UK.

Here's some background:

I'm in my late twenties and have been with the same company for over five years, currently a senior manager. I oversee a team of more than 40 people across various countries, earning over £100k annually, including bonuses. I enjoy the autonomy in my role, blending operations with data science and product work, and I thrive on leading and coaching my team.

Additionally, I have a passion for coding and have been freelancing as a web designer and front-end developer for more than 10 years. I hold a computer science degree and I am proficient in HTML/CSS and have a basic understanding of JavaScript. However, this was always my side skill, never the main source of income. 

Given this, should I devote more of my free time to improving my JavaScript skills (and possibly learning Python, which I find intriguing) with the aim of transitioning into software engineering in the future? Or should I focus on advancing in my current field, where I'm on track to become a director, though there's no set timeline for this promotion?

As for which sides in software engineering, i’m leaning more towards more back-end areas, ML combining the tech part with commercial optimisations maybe. Not staying in front-end.

I'm currently facing a challenging situation and could really use some advice or suggestions. I'm a 26-year-old (turning 27 in May) working as a Scientist in Analytical R&D for a reputable Pharmaceutical MNC. I completed my Post Grad in November 2021 and started working in January 2022. Despite performing well in my job, I'm losing interest in both work and life in general. The routine feels monotonous, with little to no work-life balance. I come home just to sleep, and this cycle repeats for 5-6 days a week.

My main concern is that I feel undervalued and undercompensated for my work. Despite being rated as a 'High Performer' in two appraisals, I'm only earning 25k INR per month. I don't anticipate a significant raise in the upcoming appraisal either. I'm also skeptical about the future career growth in my current role. While the pharmaceutical industry offers stability, I see limited opportunities for advancement or higher pay. It's frustrating to feel like I'm not fairly rewarded for the profit my company makes from my efforts.

I'm exploring opportunities for a career switch, preferably in a life science-related field, where I can receive fair compensation and better prospects for growth. On a personal level, my parents, who were both teachers in a small private school, are retired, and my grandmother requires care due to health issues. Their combined pension of 4.5k isn't enough to cover expenses, especially with my current salary. We don't have any ancestral property, and my parents' savings have been depleted by loans for our modest home. I don't have siblings either and am a single child.

I feel a sense of urgency to improve our financial situation and provide my parents with the comfortable life they deserve, especially considering their declining health. Despite attempting various banking/government exams, I haven't been successful. This adds to my anxiety, and I'm unsure about what steps to take next. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your understanding and support.

There was a bus I was supposed to catch to get to the game but I missed the bus and when I missed the bus I told myself l've been out of high school for years so it's okay. Then I had another desk that I was walking down these stairs and when I got at the bottom I saw a guy that came to high school right after I left and he was carrying a sousaphone and I was asking him about his plans after high school. Then he walked up the stairs but then came another sousaphone player (btw yes this is the instrument I played in high school lol) and this time it was a girl I didn't know the girl but I knew the horn lol. This sousaphone was a Yamaha and this horn was pretty heavy to carry. So I asked her if I could carry the horn and she said yes and when I started carrying it I started to feel so excited. The horn was so hard to carry but I was so happy to carry it. I've had so many dreams about band it's ridiculous lol. So maybe it's time that I try to go after it.

1b5dx91,How to make a useless degree useful?,"I (23M) have just graduated college with a BA in English and a minor in History. It took 5 years and a major change but I finally did it. Going into college, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do in terms of a job. I was on a baseball scholarship, and had still not given up the dream of a career in baseball whether it was as a player or some other way. Well, that crumbled when I destroyed my shoulder which required multiple surgeries.

So, there I was in a sling trying to figure out what to do next. For some reason the prospect of teaching was the first thing that ever interested me. I was always great in English and history, not to mention that working with kids sounded like a difficult but rewarding experience. Yet,  just a couple years have passed and so quickly everything has changed. 

I currently still live near the university with my wife whom I married this past June. We met in high school  and she is not only an absolute knockout  but an exceedingly hard worker. She finished nursing school a bit before I graduated and has been working at the hospital for the last 10 months ($32-$45/hr ish depending on a few factors). Meanwhile, I have been working as an auditor for Courtyard for $19 per hour.

The job was great while in school, but now my wife and I want to move back home which is 4 hours away. I am desperate for a better job to start supporting my new small family. I have been looking for a job there for about 3 months and haven't had much luck. I've applied to hotel positions as I have worked in hotels since I was 15, and the prospect of a career in hospitality doesn't sound too bad. I am also working on my teaching certification but in the mean time, I need a new job. Hell, if I end up liking it maybe I can teach later on in my career. Lastly, I could go the safest route which is as a fishing guide for my dad's small business. The work is tough, and I would spend a ton of time away from home, but the compensation is pretty good.

My wife has about 20k saved to my 5k. I have a car that's about half paid off that I would like to sell or trade in for a cheaper truck (my current vehicle is much too sporty for the more rugged area we are moving). I am learning how God damn difficult it is to get started but honestly, I know I'm already pretty damn lucky at the end of the day. I just want nothing more than to put my head down and start making as much money and working  possible. I have no issues working, and the dream one day is that my wife can return back to school and get her masters. 

The meat and potatoes: With this degree, I am finding it very difficult to find any jobs with relatable experience. It's also hard for me to answer the ""how much do you think you should make?"" Question from employers. I know that I bust ass and help my coworkers and that I am a person who can pick up day-to-day operations quickly. However, I am young, inexperienced in most fields, and lacking reccomendations in relevant areas. Most of the time,  I say an amount on the lower end of their pay range. If any of you could drop some advice, I'd appreciate it. I'm really trying to branch out to other areas and apply for anything that interests me. The area we hope to move to is where we are both originally from, and the cost of living is fairly high. I've been looking primarily for jobs that pay 45,000-70,000 per year. An income in that range should allow us to live very comfortably for the foreseeable future. I am just so torn with what to do. While I feel like the skills and certifications I possess are worth something, I just don't really know how high I can realistically shoot right now and still stand a chance. If I ditch the guiding and stick with getting my teaching certification while still pursuing a potential separate career, am I damned to work at minimum wage? If I need more experience, what should I pursue? Once again,  any advice is greatly appreciated.",Jman13511,2,1.0,40,1709460921,2024-03-03 10:15:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b5dx91/how_to_make_a_useless_degree_useful/,3,2024
1b5cp0i,Promoted and now colleagues have changed towards me ,"I work in a corporate firm. In my team, there are 3 of us and then our boss. Recently, I was promoted. I was told I am a role model and exceeding at my role. Last year was exceptionally busy for me so it's great to get that recognition! My other two colleagues were given smaller pay rises and constructive feedback on how to make it to the next step. They have not taken this well.

We all started at the same time and they think they should have promotions also. They have been bitterly moaning about this every single day, bringing down our boss and saying they are effectively doing the next level ups role just without the pay. It has been draining because I can see where they need to improve to get to the next level also but I stay out of it.

Lately, they have started making comments towards me and it's upsetting. I think what I'm struggling with is the fact that they are my peers and we've all lent on each other and now I don't really have anyone to lean against.

1b5bx32,Starting as a web designer/developer trying to become a Product Owner But I am still confused and Need a guide,"Hey there!

So, I'm around 30 years old, and I've been working in the web development/design field for a while now. When I first started out, I did a bit of everything – designing websites, turning those designs into actual web pages, and even making templates for WordPress. I did this as both a freelancer and as an employee for different web agencies.

As time went on, one of my old employers asked me to join them again, but this time not as a developer/designer. They wanted me to help build a team and take charge of some projects. It was kind of like being the boss of a product, even though they called it a project manager. (It's also needs to be ownership of product but because many of companies doesn't have this position before or they are small they call it project management).

Later on, I found a remote job where I mainly do Quality Assurance (QA) work, but I also help out with project management stuff. It's similar to what I did before, but now I'm making sure everything works perfectly and helping manage how the projects are going.

But lately, I've been feeling a bit lost. I'm trying to find a professional job in Europe, especially in Germany, but I'm not having much luck. Even though I have a good background in tech and can handle projects and products, I'm not an expert in any one thing. This worries me because I'm not sure what kind of job I should be aiming for.

Sometimes I think about going back to being a web developer, but I'm not up-to-date on the latest technologies like React and other frameworks. Learning those would take a long time, and it feels like a big obstacle to getting a job.  
  
So, I'm wondering if you could give me some advice on what I should do next?",MattyWithX,1,1.0,0,1709452976,2024-03-03 08:02:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b5bx32/starting_as_a_web_designerdeveloper_trying_to/,3,2024

I graduated May 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Exercise Science with the ""end goal"" to become a physical/occupational therapist. Throughout my time in college, I knew that I was making the wrong decision with my major but it become too late for me to switch. As a first generation student and only child, I felt a lot of pressure to please my parents and it seemed like the best option for me at the time. Since May (9 months post grad) I have been trying to figure out my next steps.  
I have always loved beauty. Since middle school, I would always do my makeup and watch so many beauty gurus. I currently work at Sephora as a Beauty Advisor, to of course save money, but also see if I can further my dream in working in beauty. I was hoping to learn more about the corporate side of beauty since I have never really wanted to be an influencer or create content. I have just always been a person who likes more of the behind the scene stuff.  
I love jobs where people are like brand experts and receive product for free to test out and are known like Sean Garrette (Esthetician) or even beauty journalist who's jobs are to just write about beauty and receive free stuff. That is such a dream to me.  
I would love any advice/tips on what I should do in terms of a career path. Is beauty just a hobby that I should push to the side? Is there more to it?  
Another note is marketing/pr are such hard markets to get into especially without connections or a specific degree, which I don't have.  
I have so much more to say but please any advice would help. I genuinely have no one to ask or to look up to so I feel lost.",youdeservebettter,1,1.0,0,1709447383,2024-03-03 06:29:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b5afhk/careers_in_beauty_advice_and_help_pls/,3,2024

About me:
- I am proficient in and enjoy mathematics, especially calculus. I am in my third year of calculus currently (right now, I’m taking a dual credit multivariable calculus course and earned top marks in my previous mathematic courses).

- I am super passionate about the environment and would love to have a career that involves helping the planet. This is top priority for me.

 - I do not enjoy biology or chemistry.

- I love animals

- I enjoy traveling

- I don’t mind working in a team

- High salary is not the top priority, but of course a livable wage is important (considering I live under my parents roof, any full-time worker will probably laugh at this statement lol I’m aware, and I admit this will probably change once I’m actually graduated)

1b57o8i,Relevance/ importance of a degree for an experienced IT engineer,"35 years old, working full-time for the same company over 15 years now. Currently in a Systems Engineer role earning over 6 figures (AUD). Doing a mix of level 2/3 support, project management, vendor management, architecture, integration, admin, and even a little development. I’d say I have a decent resume in terms of experience, excepting the single company issue.

  
About 2 years ago I figured I needed a bachelor’s degree, so I began to study IT online with an Australian university. I’d never studied for a bachelor level qualification until now, although I have other relevant sub-degree qualifications and some certs.

  
The quality of things at the university I'm studying with has completely gone to hell and I can hardly bear to continue there for another 2 years. I’m burned out and depressed.

  
So, I'm at a crossroads. I don't have a great sense of the job market because I've essentially been institutionalised being with the same company so long. And I'm worried that if I need (or want) to get a new job, it’ll be impossible to maintain or advance my income without a degree.

  
*How important is a bachelor's degree in today's IT job market?*

*If I drop out of my university course, will I be crippling my future career prospects?*

*If I am forced to re-enter the job market, will I find it very difficult to at least maintain my current level of income?*

  
I’m especially interested to hear the perspective of recruiters and hiring managers, but any advice is greatly appreciated.

I’m in the third year of my law degree, I have an A- average, I currently clerk for a sole practitioner part-time and have had very positive feedback from him, I’m personable and liaise with his clients/have been in client engaging roles previously. 

If I practice, I’m interested in corporate/commercial law (I have had A’s in the relevant courses so far and have enjoyed the work). I have very little interest in working in a big firm. My partner and I are planning on having children a couple of years after I graduate and for that reason I don’t want to be working weekends and nights. We own a fantastic house an hour and a half out of the city (public transport or rush hour traffic) so having a WFH/hybrid job would be the ideal. Obviously not common for law firms.

The end goal would be to make good money but we have no need for me to be making anything crazy. 

TLTR: What would you go into as someone wanting to work 40 hours a week and eventually make a good/humble salary, WFH/hybrid would be a huge benefit, so open to not practising but does enjoy and is good with commercial/company law subjects, gets good grades and will graduate with relevant work experience?

It was due to a small policy misunderstanding, and it’s a policy I would NEVER have to use in the positions I’m applying for. It doesn’t even involve customers or safety. I am eligible for rehire with that airline in 7 years. Since I got fired, I’ve been receiving unemployment insurance, and have been applying left and right for airline positions. What I’m mainly focused on, and applying for is flight attendant positions. I’m over qualified for this position as I have that airline experience, and am currently holding an Associate degree while still attending college for business. I’m proud of the resume I have, as well as I’m sending out cover letters to try to get a more competitive edge. I’m getting a lot of interviews for the flight attendant position, and have been making it through the final rounds with a few, but I’m not getting any job offers. Every final interview I’ve had I’m asked questions about my former employer, so there’s no way to avoid talking about my termination. I honestly think I’m acing these interviews, and that I would be getting this career if it wasn’t for my termination. It’s hard to say as I know this industry is competitive, and some try for years to finally land this job, but I can say I’ve done so much research on how to successfully pass these, and win the recruiters over. I know the termination makes it even more of a challenge to do that. A few airlines aren’t even giving me an interview, and I feel that it’s because of my departure with my last one. I’ve been telling recruiters essentially that “I was let go due to a policy misunderstanding and that I can definitely get into more detail on the specifics if they want (they never ask). I’ve learned a lot from this experience, and assure you that this won’t happen ever again. I would like to say that I’m eligible for rehire as well.” That’s pretty much it. I keep it short, but maybe I shouldn’t? Every other question I get I pride myself of being the best on every aspect as well.

1b54tpg,"Feeling stuck, what’s your experience finding the next step?","
Hey everyone, I'm interested to hear about your experiences or recommendations regarding this situation.

27M. I have a bachelor's degree in Business with a minor in IT. My internships were in Data Analyst positions, which were okay but not entirely fulfilling.

Currently, I’m a pre-sales engineer at a large global tech company. There doesn’t seem to be a clear path for career growth and development here, and I worry about the transferability of my skills to other companies/industries. Essentially, my role involves consulting, requiring more knowledge than the sales reps about our products/solutions and how they integrate into our clients’ environments. This role also does not involve any coding, so my analytic and coding skills are rusty.

Lately I've been exploring various certifications to see if any particular skill sparks my interest. The idea of pursuing an MBA has also crossed my mind.

My questions are: 
1. What do you do after pre-sales to actually develop skills/help career growth?
2. What were your experiences when you realized you were at a career standstill? 
3. How did you discover your career goal, or what you wanted to do long-term?

Any other insights or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Got me wondering how much of a raise or percentage increase would it take to convince other people to leave a good secure job they reasonably like when they don’t need the extra money?",Cool-breeze7,1,1.0,20,1709428769,2024-03-03 01:19:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b54l0j/how_much_of_a_raise_you_dont_need_to_leave_a_good/,3,2024
1b53tfj,Network Tech or Biomedical Tech,"
Greetings All, 
So I am 34 (F) trying to decide should I continue to pursue a Network Technician career or change to Biomedical Tech. I actually have to complete my Bachelor’s in Computer Networking which I last took a course for back in 2016. I took a break to prevent burnout and to save a little money so I wouldn’t have to rely heavily on financial aid to complete my degree. However, I ended up enjoying how much money I was making full time a little too much. But now after eight years as a line cook and one year as a postal carrier I’m ready to commit back to school. I’m over giving my nights, weekends and holidays to jobs I don’t even see myself wanting to advance in. As in I never could see myself being a restaurant GM and I can’t even see myself being a supervisor or manager for the post office.

While I’m committed to going back to school idk if I want to continue the career path I’m on. At this point I want something lucrative I can dive right into but I know in the IT field certifications are key which I don’t have any of. I have tried studying for the Network+ and A+ exam on and off but never get through the study guides. Also I know besides the prices of the exams a few of the valuable ones require a few years of in field experience as a prerequisite, which I also don’t have. So I’ve been considering other technician jobs that don’t require a lot of certifications or even apprenticeships (Electrical Tech) and came across Biomedical Technician. 

The college I attend has a two year program which I figure would cost and take the same amount of time it would for me to get all the IT certifications to make me an eligible candidate for most companies. I might be overthinking the whole certifications thing and probably should just stick to my original path but that’s why I’m posting here for opinions. All are sincerely appreciated.

TL:DR: Want to return to college to get away from dead end jobs.

1b533gk,My Partner or My Future Career?,"I am currently a aerospace engineering senior in my 5th and final year of college. I am also in a long distance relationship of 2 1/2 year with the person I plan on marrying. I am currently searching for jobs, and after a lot of work, have finally started to hear back from companies. I even gotten an offer. The issue is I need to respond in a week and I don't know what to say. The position puts me within 30 min of my partner, but the company isn't the best and it's not the work I actually want to be doing. It's still engineering, but not my actually interest. 

So, I guess, a couple questions:
1. How important is the job I get right out of college?
2. Should I sacrifice a potentially more interesting job to end the long distance? I love them a lot and it hurts being this far, but I don't want to resent them or our relationship down the line.
3. Is it bad to accept the offer now, even if I may turn it down later? I would be holding out for companies that I don't know if they would even give me offers and this would at least provide stability.

Additional info: The company offer is from a large corporation through a temp company. The other companies are around 2 hours away, putting me at a minimum and hour and a half away from my partner. I have an old car, so traveling is difficult and my partner will still be college for at least another hour and a half.",AceOwlten,8,1.0,24,1709424662,2024-03-03 00:11:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b533gk/my_partner_or_my_future_career/,3,2024

1b50bt3,"""Meets most expectations"" at yearly performance review","I (31F) work in tech but in the business org, so I'm not an engineer. I've been at this company for 5 years now and this is my second meets most expectations during a performance review. First one was during the first half of 2020 where I was understandably burnt out because of the pandemic, so ok.

This one I felt was entirely undeserved and unforeseen. During the first half of 2023 I was working under a manager who wasn't even based in my own country and was a terrible communicator - he never raised any flags to me, never gave me feedback that I was underperforming in his eyes (we were talking promotions!!) and he hit me with a ""below expectations"" during the mid-year calibrated signal. Thankfully we reorged and I changed managers during the second half - a much better one who communicated clearly, set out an action plan for me and clearly told me I had improved from that calibrated signal and was meeting all his expectations, if not exceeding them. However, he explained (in great detail, I don't think he was lying tbh, he seems to like me) that due to my ""below expectations"" signal HR wouldn't allow them to rate me ""meets all"" and so I ended up with a ""meets most"". I wasn't put on a training plan or anything as they feel I'm meeting expectations now.

This was just to give context, but since I work for a company where toxic positivity is the rule and no one talks about these things to give the impression that everyone's perfect, I don't know what to think about.

Is it really that common to get ""meets most"" as a lot of people say? Is two ""meets most"" in 5 years too much? I've had 3 exceeds and 3 meets all expectations during that time - so it's not like I'm terrible at my job (I think). Does high management and people who stay a long time in the company get meets most too? Should I be looking for another job before they get the chance to terminate me?

I'm trying not to overthink it but I'm a fantastic overthinker so I kinda just wanted to hear some stories since no one in my office will share them lol",theskymaid,3,1.0,3,1709417574,2024-03-02 22:12:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b50bt3/meets_most_expectations_at_yearly_performance/,3,2024
1b4zp4l,"Seeking Advice: Combining Control Theory, Machine Learning, and Applied Math in Graduate Studies","I'm an electrical and computer engineering undergrad in Portugal, considering a switch to machine learning or applied math for my master's. I've completed Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization and have worked on deep learning projects, including those with transformers. Currently, I'm exploring reinforcement learning and plan to study game theory. My goal is to understand these fields better before deciding on my master's focus. I particularly enjoy signal and control theory in my studies, alongside complex analysis and differential equations, though I don't plan to work directly in these areas. Instead, I aim to apply this mathematical knowledge in programming, avoiding complex proofs.  
I'm contemplating a Ph.D. and a career in either industry or government, discouraged by the competitive and flawed academic career path. I'm leaning towards a master's in electrical engineering with a focus on control theory but want to keep options open for deep learning and applied math. I'm curious if it's possible to combine control theory and machine learning in a master's, possibly within a single department, and whether a master's in applied math might be more inclusive of my interests.  
I'm also concerned about learning unique subjects like control theory at a level not offered by online courses, while also wanting to maintain the ability to engage with and apply self-learned topics like game theory in my advanced studies. I'm questioning which department (CS, math, or electrical engineering) would best suit a master's or Ph.D. combining control theory and machine learning, if such programs exist in Europe, and how online learning in game theory could integrate into my postgraduate studies.

1b4z8ap,Humbly requesting help on navigating job offers...,"Hi Reddit.

After nine months of unemployment, I have two potential jobs to consider. One issued an official offer, the other emailed to tell me to expect an official offer Tuesday. I am struggling and most of my family or friends have worked with the same company for years so I am humbly requesting any advice you all might have for me.

Job 1 is an excellent company who made clear in my final interview that the person they hire in this role will be developed from the start to replace the person training them. The role is essentially entry-level, starting pay is $26/hr with average medical benefits and no retirement benefits mentioned in the offer.

Job 2 is working for a university. This role is less what I had in mind when I started my job search, it seems less focused on my career field and more administrative. The job is remote 3 days out of 5, pay is 21-24/hr(HR said to expect an offer within that stated range). Employer pays 95% of medical premiums and pays into PERS. This interviewer also specified that the current manager hopes to retire in the next few years and wants the person they hire on the fast track to leadership.

If all things were equal, I'd take Job 1 without looking back. That said, my partner and I are in our late thirties with very little to speak of in the way of retirement. 

So, in addition to being unsure which role to choose, I'm not sure how to proceed in general. I am thinking of reaching out to Job 1 to inquire about current or future retirement options. Should I mention that I have received another offer and that retirement options are my biggest concern? Or just send a brief inquiry and not mention the other offer? I am neither aggressive nor an effective negotiator, so I have no idea what I am doing.

1b4xjo2,At a bit of a cross road and could really use some guidance.,"Hey all,

I work in a very niche field I was able to get into with a BA and work my way up through the ladder into management. Last year I left a 97k a year job to go to a start up where I’m making 105k plus a good amount of equity that vests in one year. The problem is I am super miserable. I have been given project after project that is just not doable with the resources I have. Last week I was given a new project that is maybe the worse I have ever seen. This is all due by the end of the summer and I am not seeing much of a successful path forward at all. I don’t have nearly enough resources to do it and it’s looking like it will be a summer from hell for sure. My coworkers are all similarly underwater and stressed and burned out so I can’t get much help there. I can request new hires but the training lead time is months not days so I don’t know how much it will even help. For reference on a project this size I would expect to need like 5-10 people easily. However it’s just me and one other fresh out of college grad.

I am thinking about taking a pay cut and going into project management. I have some potential leads but the pay is definitely going to be less, probably 95k a year max and no equity. However the projects do sound genuinely interesting and it would also give me an office which in my position is actually really nice after working from home with my partner past five years. Is this dumb? Should I suffer through for another year and hope this start up takes off? We are in series B funding I think it is, and set to meet our sales goal for this year but I don’t really see our production capacity being enough to pull it off. I am 32 with no kids, 95k is enough for me to live on but of course more is always appreciated. I have been suffering pretty severe burnout and at times screaming at my computer I’m so aggravated at how impossible everything feels. Any tips? Experiences? Anything is massively appreciated I don’t have to anyone to talk to about this and I am struggling.

1b4x1qu,Is a bachelors degree worth it anymore?,"Hi everyone, I’m 20 years old out of school at the moment. I have around 80 credit hours from CCP and taking classes for three semesters post high school graduation. Some of the credits are towards occupational therapy, but then I switched my major to hospitality once I graduated high school. 

I work a full time job where I make okay money for where I am in life, it’s a $19/hr management position (located in Ohio). It is in the field of my “current major,” and could be considered a post degree job for a lot of people in my major. To make a long story short, I soon realized into my schooling that the only positions where you make great money in hospitality is in general management positions. I already am not a huge fan of even being an assistant manager at the moment, and I can’t see myself going down that road— I just don’t want to end up doing that long term, I’ve learned it’s not for me. I’ve concluded that most of the jobs that I would want to pursue in hospitality are either scarce in the job market or pay very, very little. 

I’m at a point where i’m taking a break from school to figure things out. I’m working full time, so if I wanted to finish my hospitality degree, it would probably take another 3 years. I’ve tossed around the idea of just getting an associates degree in something like dental hygiene to cut my school time and make guaranteed really great money, but I have a lot of people telling me that I should just finish out my bachelors degree even if i don’t end up perusing hospitality, just so I can have a bachelors degree on my resume for other jobs I may want. I am already 35k in debt from student loans. Should I go back and finish my degree, get an associates degree instead, or is school even worth it with how expensive it is anymore? I’m open to anything, this is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a career plan set in stone and I don’t really have any ideas on something I’m passionate about that I’d love to donas a career.

GEOGRAPHY:
-I don’t find the careers high-paying ( teacher for example)
LAW:

1b4vcej,Leaving after 6 months,"I have been at my current job since September. Since then, it has been an up and down rollercoaster of emotions -- essentially, I was hired under the impression I would be doing a certain set of things, but after hire I realized I only do these things for a small fraction of my time in the office, and a majority of my day is focused on phone calls and interfacing with potential clients. I know this is a common thing, especially in entry-level office positions, so I wasn't necessarily shocked. I decided to stay and give it a shot, but unfortunately due to my boss' unstable moods and lack of consistent tasks or guidance, I'm deciding to move on.

  
So, here's the deal. I interviewed for a position that is more concise and focused, doing tasks that are within my skill set and more enjoyable than what I'm doing currently. This place called me the day after the interview, offering more than what they advertised for. I told them I am definitely interested, but would like to think about it over the weekend (I knew I would say yes anyway). They sent me some hiring paperwork in the meantime, as I have a background check to do before official employment, and within this hiring paperwork is the document that needs to be filled out by a previous/current employer -- essentially just an employment verification document.

1b4v01t,Unusual discussion over offer letter (USA)?,"I recently received an offer and the preamble to it felt a little unusual. The in-house recruiter called me to indicate the hiring manager was prepared to offer a salary of X (a good salary for me and fair by my research, but about 8% below the rate I'd asked for), and asked if I'd be inclined to accept it before they make the full, formal written offer. I told them I'd need a full description of the potential offer in writing to consider before indicating a decision either way - the recruiter sent me an informal email with the details.

I ended up countering for a salary that split the difference. The next day, the recruiter called me to say they were prepared to meet the counter, but directly asked me to confirm that I would accept this offer when it came and that I wouldn't use it to get a counter-offer from my current employer. Apparently this was something the hiring manager asked her to ask me.

It strikes me as rather naive of the hiring manager to ask me to confirm those things. To me, verbal agreements don't really mean anything in this context (apart from whether I'm willing to break them or not). Alternatively, it might go the other way and he's trying to make me feel compelled to accept once I have the offer.

I guess what I'm asking is - does this raise any concerns? Is this manager maybe a bit naive concerning hiring practices in the US (or is this normal and I've not experienced it)? Or does it feel somewhat manipulative?",Ligerowner,1,1.0,2,1709404049,2024-03-02 18:27:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4v01t/unusual_discussion_over_offer_letter_usa/,3,2024

1b4t5j9,Currently stuck in a roadblock,"I need some help with how to potentially change field entirely. I was working as a graphic designer, but my wife has had some complications and she can no longer work. As she is not a citezen of the country we live in she is not entitled to any benfits. The thing is i had to quit being designer as i am still early in my career (24yo) most entry level jobs pay less than what i make now as a hotel housekeeper. I know if i grind out as a designer eventually i would be able to make good money but as of now the average graphic designer salary isnt enough to finance 2 people in my city. While i am getting by as a housekeeper and have no issues paying my bills, but barely. There is absolutely no career outlook. Are their any fields where i can potentially learn at home to move on to something better so i can support my family, especially on one salary. ( to note i live in montreal, canada. The salary for entry level designers tend to be 18 to 20cad an hour and i make 24 as a housekeeper)

I am still doing a lot of a job of a project manager because the new PM they hired is just getting onboarded with so many things we have. In short, I am doing a lot of work!  
  
I know I am supposed to make sure things are submitted on deadlines, but client requests have gone crazy. I don't have enough lead time and everybody's overworked since we don't have enough staffing. The account director runs off to the COO whenever urgent requests are given extremely and unrealistic lead time to finish and not taken care of easily. I have been chasing up on people like crazy, but I also couldn't control if they're so oppressed themselves as the workload has tripled.  
  
I am good at making sure things are assigned and completed. But, lately, many people are already complaining to me that the work is way too much. I agree with them! I have been positioning it gently to people so that they won't quit, but here I am, I want to quit. People are wanting to quit but I am good at convincing people not to. Ironically, I am feeling the same way that they do.  
  
They did hire a new project manager, and even he has realised that the work is way too much. I asked for additional hires to spread work among team members, but I was turned down since they said we couldn't justify the cost yet.  
  
I hope I am not sounding to be whiny. But, I couldn't sleep properly. I feel so sad and down at the moment and I feel like I am useless. I am tired. I am very sick and have been experiencing chills, coughs and fever but I was totally blamed for items that I have already tasked out to people but the edits were delayed because of short time to do it and the client requesting edits when we are closed.  
  
The reason why I am doing this is because my parents are sick and if I quit, I just don't know how to provide for them in the next few months.

1b4s3z3,Did I make the wrong decision by choosing engineering?,"I'm currently a first year Computer Engineering student and I've started to doubt my decision of choosing this career path. The primary reasons for choosing this major were:

- Money
- Career Stability
- I like Math
- My father suggested

However, whenever I ask industry professionals and upper year students about their reasons most of them say that ever since childhood they loved ""building things"" and working with machines and stuff. They wanted to know how the computer works as a kid and so on. But I never had these motivations like I couldn't care less about how a computer or machine worked as a kid. In high school I was a huge Physics nerd and loved studying those concepts. I loved all the science and math subjects but I was never interested in machines or engines or building things for that matter. My father loved this kinda stuff and he would often open a laptop and show me the different motherboard parts and I'd get so bored quickly.

The reason why I didn't choose to pursue a degree in a pure science field like Physics was because the pay isn't great for the amount of work u gotta put in. With this degree I could either become a research scientist or a professor. I didn't wanna become a professor because I'm not fond of teaching and I find that job boring (no offence). I could've become a research scientist but the country where I'm from, it's really difficult to make a good living out of that job unless you're like a mega genius. It's very difficult to get funding asw and I figured that with the number of obstacles I'd have to face I'd probably start to hate Physics and be depressed. Also, I'm not an Einstein level genius so I probably wouldn't have researched anything great anyway.

This is why I shifted my focus to Engineering. Also because people told me that it had Physics so I'll get to study that as well. But they were wrong. The number of Physics courses are less than a handful and there's barely any advanced concepts being taught.

Also, now I've gotta take these hardware courses where u gotta work with machines and circuits and I don't really like that stuff. Programming is fine to me because it involves a lot of logic and I like that but working with hardware and machines is so boring. Idk what to do.

Did I make the wrong choice?",whysoserious011_,5,1.0,16,1709396740,2024-03-02 16:25:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4s3z3/did_i_make_the_wrong_decision_by_choosing/,3,2024
1b4s15q,How firmly do you resist time-wasting meetings?,"I am mad (at myself) because I spent several days this week coaching companies at an event that turned out to be a complete waste of time.  I am in a line of work (professional services) where I am paid by the hour, and I cannot be spending my time doing unproductive tasks.

So I looked at my calendar for the next few weeks and see:

1. One organization that I volunteer for keeps asking to have a ""touchpoint"" meeting.  There is no purpose; the organization's leadership just wants to check on volunteers. I declined the meeting.
2. I had contacted another nonprofit to pitch an event that another business contact would find useful.  This business contact is tied to the stupid company coaching event, so that's a waste, so I cancelled the meeting to discuss that other event.
3. A few unproductive business contacts had introduced me to a few people to meet.  They wouldn't lead to productive, billable work, so I am cancelling those meetings, too.

From now on, if a meeting won't likely lead to billable work, I will not accept the meeting.

Anyone else refuse to do unproductive meetings?  If so, do you have any kind of measurement or threshold as to what kind of meeting you will refuse to do, and how far you resist the meeting?

1b4rcc3,Bad Review,"Venting here, it’s been a bad week. 

I recently sat down for my annual performance review and was told that my performance for the last year was sub par. As a result, my annual bonus would be reduced by half. As you might guess, this was not a good conversation.  

Under normal circumstances, I would take something like this as an opportunity to reset. To step back from the situation, sort out what I might have done wrong, work out a plan with my supervisor to address the concerns and move on. It can be tough to do, but it’s the right thing to do in almost all cases. 

This isn’t normal circumstances.

For context. I have held this job for a number of years. About 30% of my income is based on an annual bonus, which is paid based on performance. Good or great performance, I get a bit more than the target 30%, poor performance I get less or nothing.  

Each year my reviews have been positive and I was paid my full bonus. In the 1st half of 2023, I received a special “retention” bonus and other perks due to great performance and receive a glowing review from my boss at the time. She then left the company.

One of my peers was put in charge until a new person was hired in November. During the interim period things moved along as normal. The whole department took some heat during this time, as the interim person was struggling in the temporary role. Nonetheless, my team still hit our numbers and our major deliverables we met. Feedback on my performance was positive and I was told I was doing what I needed to be doing. In fact, we had a couple of really big wins towards the tail end of the year that helped the whole company meet its numbers for the year. 

The new person came on in late Oct first as a contractor and then as the new department head in Nov. He had been hired to layout a strategy for the department and a plan for this next year. In reality, he was also the fix to the situation with my peer acting in the temporary leadership role and struggling with it. 

The new department head seemed ok with me and my department, no positive or negative feedback was provided. As part of his onboarding, I walked him through my team structure, key things we did, where we sat against objectives and so forth. Nothing unusual, and given the numbers were good, I didn’t really make much of it.

So, when I sat down with him for my annual review, I assumed I would get anything from neutral to positive feedback. While our numbers were positive and my department and personal performance targets were hit, I could see a new supervisor being conservative about feedback and performance reviews while still new to a job. So, I didn’t have high expectations, but I also didn’t have low expectations. 

I was stunned when I was told my performance was sub par. During the discussion I asked directly, what were the drivers behind this and was told that while my performance numbers were solid, I didn’t have the “leadership”  qualities he expected from my role. He further explained that some of the feedback he had received from others in the company had not been positive, although he wouldn’t provide any details on what feedback or from who. He stated he was willing to “lean in” and help me address the issue, if I was willing to myself, or that I should leave the company. 

I left it at that for the time being, as I was pretty upset and didn’t want to get into an emotional discussion.

I now have a real issue to sort through. I lost half my bonus irrespective of hitting all my targets for the year. It’s a big financial hit. Hitting the numbers for the year was not easy, and took a lot of work and personal investment to make happen. I am proud of what my team and I were able to deliver, under very difficult circumstances. 

On one hand, to be told my performance was sub par, despite clear facts and data that state otherwise is a problem for me. Losing half my bonus is a real problem for me.  

On the other hand, I have equity and other long term incentives that would mean leaving a fair amount of money on the table if I leave, and it’s a good paying job. Leaving a bunch of money on the table and walking away from a solid salary is also not great.

1b4pxii,Found my coworker throwing up blood next to me and I don’t know if I should stay.,"I’m (**24**) M and I’ve been working at a warehouse for about six to seven months now, but am thinking about leaving after what happened to my coworker.

To give some context, my job consists of me working from 4am to 2:20pm moving boxes into the warehouse, or a reciever. The company likes to vary the schedule, so startup time could be anywhere between 3am-6am depending on the workload.

I signed up to work the 6am schedule in particular, but found myself working overtime for the past couple of months. Working six days a week for 16/hr with two hours overtime (or 24/hr).

It’s been a tolerably easy job, but I find myself going home tired, unable to strike a work-life balance. Yes, I could take days off and the boss wouldn’t care or notice, but this doesn’t help much when I find myself exhausted and sad most of the time.  The job acceptance rate in my town is considerably low so I had to work with what I could get. But the more I stay at this job, the more I want to quit.

It wasn’t until recently that I found myself next to a coworker, around my age, that was bleeding from his nose. The coworker had just dropped some spray cans that exploded around him and was feeling nauseous from the fumes.  He kept telling me and everybody else that he was bleeding from his nose and felt lightheaded. Later, I would find him continuously go back and forth into the restroom, which I would later find a trash filled with bloodied up papers.

I wasn’t sure if the spray can and the blood were related, since the boss told me that this had been happening to him for a couple of days now.

So my boss went to go speak with my coworker and everything was fine. So I let it slide for a couple of minutes and found the guy bleeding from his nose and throwing up blood. This time he was crying, not bawling, but as if he was choking. I kept telling him that he needed to go and see a doctor, but he kept wanting to work and said that he “didn’t get enough done”.

The boss came back to speak with my coworker and told him that it’s up to him if he wanted to leave, that he couldn’t make him leave. The coworker kept telling my boss that he doesn’t feel good, but my boss continuously told him that it was his choice. He finally decided to leave, but I couldn’t stay there. I ended up leaving early because I couldn’t focus on my work after seeing that much blood.

Now I’m not sure if I want to go back after what just happened. I keep thinking about that worker possibly dying next to me. I know I shouldn’t have left or interfered like that, but I’ve never seem anything like that happen to someone before. I’m not strongly adept to handling these kinds of situations and get emotional real quick. I‘m too considerate of others, but my family told me that I should’ve stayed and not get so worked up over it. And I‘m sure they won’t fire me, but then again, I don’t think I could work there anymore. I would want to work into a different department, but from what I heard, it‘s hard for people to do so.

The only thing that worries me about quitting is finding a job in the area and being unable to commute anywhere else. That and dealing with the constant bickering from my family for leaving.",WhyMan587,58,1.0,76,1709390902,2024-03-02 14:48:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4pxii/found_my_coworker_throwing_up_blood_next_to_me/,3,2024

1b4od5e,Clinical nursing or corporate job,"
Long story short is that I’m an OR nurse who was recently recruited by a large medical device company (i.e., Phillips) because of my surgical background. I wasn’t looking to get out of nursing, but interviewed because of the notoriety of the company. I was offered the position, so I was just looking for advice in terms of what you would do? 
This is not a clinical position, so I would not be utilizing any nursing skills. Keep in mind that the OR is a very technical unit, so perhaps my “clinical skills” might differ from other nurses. This company has good benefits and I will say that I am worried about the longevity of bedside nursing in any capacity (the OR) because I am in my 30s & am already sometimes in pain lol

Do I let them say their price first? If so, how do I go about that? Do I just say what I really want ($2,800) and negotiate from there? Any advice on how to navigate this conversation is greatly appreciated!

1b4ngtv,Building services VS Power Engineering (UK),"Hi Guys  Bit of background on me - Been in building services for 5 years as a CAD tech and trainee electrical engineer throughout a completed apprenticeship & placement. Graduating in 2025 with a top grade Electrical & Electronic Engineering bachelors degree.  Got an offer from my placement company as a graduate electrical engineer with a promise of a fast track to engineer status in 6 months. It’s cool, but I’m not passionate about it. Discovered a love for power engineering/HV during uni, and it seems like it pays better, involves less grind, and has more global opportunities and exciting projects.  Thinking of making the switch, but worried about my building services experience going to waste. Anyone been through a similar shift or got advice?

I've always wanted to be a personal assistant for someone. In an office or something. Like an errand runner for someone who's too busy to do it themselves. I've been a babysitter but I don't want to be a nanny. I want to be the girl that handles the paperwork, makes the phone calls, books appointments for that person ect. I want to be up in an office looking hot with my 6 inch heels on typing up emails on a computer.

1b4mim1,Two great job offers...which to accept?,"After 4 moths of searching, I'm lucky to have two solid offers to choose from. I'm having a hard time making a decision and would love input.

For context, I'm a software engineer with 8+ years experience and I only applied to jobs that are fully remote.

Job 1: Work from anywhere in the world. Solid company in great financial position, $135k base salary + equity. Great culture, with lots of small benefits. Very little room for salary increases. Interesting mission. Medium size company.

Job 2: 4 day work week with a $175k base salary + equity. Company needs to fundraise within the next 18 months to survive, but has been around for 6+ years. I resonate with the people a little less here, but they have a great mission. Small company.

If all things were equal, I'd take job 1. But the 4 day work week with a high salary is *so* hard to pass up, even if it means I might be job hunting again next year. I hesitate with job 2 because of the fundraising situation, and slightly less appealing culture.

Which would you choose!

1b4jaks,How to approach this,"Gm,

I have been working for 4 years in several jobs, always looking for something which match for me in terms of money and interest.

To sum up: - 8 months production engineer (internship)

\- 12 months R&D engineer in a steel works

\- 12 months Data engineer and backend

All this previous ones in my country, which is in south Europe.

Now, I have one year working(1.5 taking into account I work at least 60 hours per week) as a project engineer in Saudi for a petrol company project. I really like this job, however, I am little fed up of the country.

So, actually I am thinking about to start a seeking for a job like this one but in Australia. Any advice to achieve my goal?

Thanks for your time.

1b4in3w,I (36F) had my annual review yesterday. I was basically told to smile more. How do I even act around my boss now? Should I even bring it up again for clarification? I'm frankly not sure how to move past this.,"Overall my review was extremely positive and my boss had wonderful things to say about me. We even talked about opportunities of where I can grow in the company.

But then, he tells me that with last year being so stressful, to let him know if I'm overwhelmed or stressed because sometimes I came off as abrasive in certain situations where I was under a lot of stress. I then asked for specific examples and he replied he didn't have any specific examples but that in some meetings I looked annoyed (????), to which I said: ""no, that's just my face.""  
  
Since taking this job I've make it a point to smile and laugh during all our meetings, and even use 'LOLs' and emoji reactions!  
  
An hour later I logged onto the platform to see the written review, and he said: ""Something I would encourage \[Diamondeyes7\] is to be aware of is in rare instances her written communication can be taken as slightly abrupt - I do not believe this is intentional at all, more a byproduct of working through some stressful situations and potentially dealing with some frustration around our ability to complete supporting work in a timely manner.""  
  
So which is it, my written communication or that I look annoyed during meetings? And I never heard this feedback from him prior to this. Why the hell didn't he speak up then?  
  
Despite my ""abrasiveness"", I got my full bonus and a merit increase, so it didn't knock anything down. What was even the point of that feedback?? I truly want to know why he would say those things, and then not have the balls to give any specifics.  
  
What do I do next? Before those comments, I was so excited with my review because we were talking about opportunities of where I could grow at the company and I saw myself staying for awhile.

1. We're going to a conference next week and he'll be there. I don't even know how to act around him. I don't even want to speak with him alone.
2. I'm tempted to Slack him with, ""hey there, I'm a bit confused because you mentioned I came off abrasive because I looked annoyed during a few meetings, but in the written review document, it says my writing comes off abrupt. What do you want me to do?""
3. I have multiple meetings with this guy every week and at least Slack everyday, and he's never brought this up before? Should I tell him I'm frankly nervous because he had multiple opportunities to tell me, waited until my review?



I'm still processing it, but yes, I'm hurt and upset. I thought he was an excellent people manager :(",diamondeyes7,6,1.0,27,1709364766,2024-03-02 07:32:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4in3w/i_36f_had_my_annual_review_yesterday_i_was/,3,2024

1b4h1b0,Boss was kinda nasty to me for the first time ever. Talk it out with her or let it go?,"So, I would say that I have a great relationship with my boss. She's a really nice, fun, upbeat, and respectful person, and is actually the main reason I took my job. 

I've got complaints about her for sure, as I'm sure she does about me, but one thing that is great about her is that she is super professional, courteous, respectful, and always willing to discuss things. She is just a very pleasant person to work for. 

I've been in my position for a number of years, and I like to think she trusts and respects my opinions. In that entire time, I can't think of a single time she's been unpleasant or shitty.

Last week some ideas were coming in from another department, and I had to shoot them down for safety reasons, even tho it pained me to do so, knowing I was being a stickler for rules and regs.

My boss stepped in with a replacement idea, and I gave her a ring, saying that from my departments perspective, it also wasn't the safest idea. Would it *definitely* backfire? Not at all. Probably a small percent chance it goes wrong. But it's part of my job to bring that number to 0. 

This is a very normal conversation between the two of us. She always takes it well, it's always very pleasant. Sometimes she listens to me, sometimes she overrules me, and I take it well too. 

Out of the blue, she snapped at me this time, making a reference to the fact that she knows what she's doing, and has been doing this longer than I have. Clearly something was off. She never snaps with that kind of insecurity, and never takes debate and discussion to be undermining her expertise or authority.

I have no idea what happened, and no idea why she reacted that way, and no idea what nerve I touched or how. 

Unfortunately, some more news came in mere minutes later, proving my concerns correct a little bit. I called to discuss and she literally refused to answer. She is *never* petulant and immature like that. She is a consumate pro.

Something is up. I don't know if she is pissed at me, was just having an off day, or was just tired of me shooting down this project over and over. Or all three. 

I'm not sure what I should do on Monday. How she acted is not considered OK in our office. But on the other hand I don't know how she'll react to being called out. I've never had to do it before. 

The way I see it I could: a) do nothing and let it be water under the bridge; b) explain that I was not ok with how she reacted as I was doing exactly what I have to do in my role; or c) approach as more of a friend and say ""hey are you OK - you seemed a little irritated last week.""

I'd really love to bury the hatchet. I honestly love working with her, and think she's great. It would really bum me out if I inadvertently cause an even bigger fight. 

Part of me wants to see if she's just her normal happy self on Monday, but part of me also hates leaving things like this unresolved. 

Really torn on what to do, and would love to hear some thoughts. ",mayormcskeeze,1,1.0,23,1709358951,2024-03-02 05:55:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4h1b0/boss_was_kinda_nasty_to_me_for_the_first_time/,3,2024

However, I’m an extremely anxious and indecisive person, fearful of taking risks and ruining my life. I’m still not sure what it is I value most — a strong career or a good work life balance. Below I’ll leave a short comparison of each offer and my personal circumstances. Technically, I’ve said yes to both offers (I know, it’s wrong) but have to make my final decision very soon.

  
**Company A: PR Specialist for Nonprofit**

  
**PROS**

* Salary 60k
* Benefits: Health insurance, paid vacations, holidays off
* Prestigious title for my resume; huge jump in career
* Greater career/salary prospects after leaving
* Racially diverse coworkers
* 20 min commute

**CONS**

* Met CEO and will be directly reporting to him, very dry and pushy
* All executives alongside me are male (I would be the only woman)
* Offered me 5k less than originally promised
* No PR department; basically one-man job
* Would be underpaid doing the job of multiple people
* Poor training; I’ve never had a leadership position & because I’d have no team I would have 0 guidance
* Fully in-person position
* Would have to find a caregiver for my disabled, very stubborn mother  


**Company B: Paralegal/Legal Assistant**

  
**PROS**

* $25/hrShort Hours
* Easy tasks
* Small, all-female team
* WFH in person — visits only twice a month
* Lawyer/Owner of firm seems very desperate for labor & excited to work with me; feel appreciated & needed
* Flexibility to be my mother’s caregiver (whom I adore), travel, & fulfill other hobbies

**CONS**

* Temp to hire possibility; full-time not guaranteed 
* Unsure of my workload, benefits, or amount hours IF recruited
* Paralegal career isn’t very financially lucrative; quick salary plateau 
* Boss’ political views are my polar opposite
* Not interested in going into law   


I can’t decide if I should be comfortable or take the risk. I value my family, leisure, and stress-free life immensely. But I also want to make money & learn new skills in this bleak ass job market!!

I’m in my early 20s, M, and feel very lost in life.

I’ve been working security for the past three years, which has left me feeling depressed. I have tried working in food and retail to no avail. About a year ago I began college for cybersecurity but I don’t know if I’m feeling it anymore despite constant comments about me making a great career choice.

I wanted a job with purpose. I had always wanted to be a police officer, but I saw the low pay, high hours, the military-like constraint on personal freedoms, asshole management /  coworkers, and I gave up on the idea.

I’m still not one to give up easy, so the main things that keeps me away are the pay and that I am not an asshole. I grew up poor and fear going through that or putting my kids through that again. I want land and a house a bit outside of the city. And I have worked around many cops in security and the military who inject so much emotion into their police work and so little into being a good person that they border psychopathy.

Despite being an almost eccentrically knowledge seeking kid, I never enjoyed school, and even now as an adult it is extremely difficult to continue. That and the technical content is making me doubt my cybersecurity choice.

I have thought about FBI cyber etc. but I don’t want to be staring at C-P all day stuck behind a desk with even higher personal constraint.

Just don’t know where to go from here. Might just pick a direction and start driving.

TL;DR: need a job with purpose but decent pay and decent coworkers

1b4eulv,Should a woodpecker peck 100 trees 1 time or 1 tree hundred times?,"I am 22. I have multiple interests. I mean, it kills me from the inside when I try to do one thing for a few months and watch someone do the other thing I am interested in. I feel like a fool to leave that thing. Most of the time they are some creative endeavors. I, for now, decided to focus on the money aspect of my life. So I started a business which is nothing at this point. I thought I would learn drawing and write blogs sometimes as they make me feel fulfilled. Because I am not able to give time to that part of me. 
Then I see someone doing great in drawing and writing powerful blogs, I feel like someone put a heavy object over my head. I feel guilty of now doing those myself.
But I am not that good at drawing. I used to do it as a kid and now I thought I should go back to it as a hobby.
The business idea looks so UNappealing to me all of a sudden. I am telling myself all the things that people told me beforehand about the scalability of the product in the city. That I am not good at building  the product I am trying to sell. 
(it is a healthy food delivery business where I am cooking right now but I have no experience in professional cooking. But I am getting better at it as I am doing it. But the cooking part is not very interesting to me as the building a business aspect is) 
So there are a lot of limitations in my theory about this business. That may be because the city is very small and I wouldn't be able to make much money in this because I am not passionate about cooking. 
So how do I manage this? The money needing aspect. The interests and hobbies aspect. To not waste time on the wrong things. 
For now, if someone could help me decide if I should quit this business and think of some other way to earn or persevere and stick to it and see if it is survivable in the small city.

Is this exploring or wasting time? I am trying to figure out if there is any chance the business could grow in the city. The reason I am doubtful about it is that nobody does it in the city. So maybe there is an opportunity or there is not much demand. I could only know that by trying right? And what about my other interests?",Tall-Explanation-476,1,1.0,0,1709351750,2024-03-02 03:55:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4eulv/should_a_woodpecker_peck_100_trees_1_time_or_1/,3,2024
1b4el37,Working 2.5 years in a contract and they refuse to hire me full-time,"WARNING: Long post, but I truly need some advice.

I need some advice. I am currently a contract project manager and have worked on the same team for about 2 years, but have been at the company for 2.5 years. I have been trying to get another full-time role at the company since the day I started. My manager and team have been seemingly supportive. But the problem is, I have applied for almost 40 roles at the company and have not gotten one. Some of these roles I have worked closely with the hiring manager, and have only received positive praise from my team and everyone that I work with (I literally ask for feedback and they say that everything is great). Over the past year, I have really been pushing myself, working crazy hours, and networking within the organization to no avail. I’m currently leading 3 international pilots where I built, managed, and launched a tool which over 50 sales reps use in addition to project managing these pilots. They have also decided to improve the tool that I built and have employed a dedicated developer and I am heavily involved in the product management process for this. I currently work long hours, take meeting in all 3 time zones, and have done everything I could to upskill to prepare myself for a role if it comes up. In the new year, the product manager for the tool went on vacation, and I covered for him. For almost a month I was doing my job (project management, data cleaning and analysis, and managing the pilots) while also completing all the responsibilities of the product manager (working from 8am-8pm with some international meetings sprinkled in after). When the Product Manager came back from vacation, he announced that he was leaving his role for another within the company. He is leaving in 3 weeks and he immediately started to train me to take over. I talked to my manager about it and he said I was a strong candidate and should prepare a job description proposal. I came to him this week with an elaborate proposal detailing our current organizational and team goals and crafted a role that encompasses what I do now, but tweaked it a bit to match to better match the current environment and team goals. He thanked me for my description and told me that this will be helpful in writing the formal job description, but that there was no guarantee that I would get it. He said that they are leaning on hiring someone from India, but if they do hire in the US that they would definitely put me through to the panel round. To say the least, I was truly disgusted and taken aback. The fact that I would have to interview to be the product manager of a tool that I initially built, managed, and launched and for a job that I have been doing for a month and have written the job description for was quite literally laughable. I am so incredibly insulted and am re-evaluating everything. When he told me this, I felt like I was gut punched. When I asked why he can’t do a direct to hire, he said that it wasn’t allowed. But like I said, I have applied to about 40 jobs within the organization and at least 5 of them, I was kindly reached out to by the hiring manager and told that I was qualified but that they were going to hire a contractor on their team and that the req was just open just for show. Now obviously, I know I am being taken advantage of here. If my eyes weren’t clearly open before, they are wide open now. I need advice on next steps. I have about a year and some change of living expenses in an emergency fund and can easily get a part time job with a family friend. This would be enough money to survive, but I would have to dip into my savings. I am saving to buy a house soon, and am wondering if quitting to prove a point is really worth me finally buying my own home. If I do decide to quit, I am debating between quitting on Monday and just leaving, putting in my two weeks, or waiting until before my contract renews in May. I know it sounds stupid, but I would hate to make enemies at a place where I have literally invested 2.5 years of my life. However, the thought of me waking up on Monday and doing a job that I know they are going to hire someone else and pay them twice as much as me makes me absolutely sick. My friends all say i should quite quit, collect money, and leave when I find a new job. This may even sound crazier, but the thought of me working so hard for years, only to slack off and for them to justify not hiring me all these years also makes me angry! I need any advice I can get.

Our company has been established for almost a century worldwide and have 25,000+ employees for background of it matters. If you live in America you absolutely know us. Needless to say we have a fairly large HR team due to our size and spread across the world. 


The drama started 9 months ago and has not stopped escalating. Basically it's ego based: one person believes they are in charge of design & copy while the other believes they are. Neither are. One is a legal proofreader and the other codes media ads & emails. We have a copy writer too but we also need our legal proofreader for... Legal stuff (So we don't get sued obviously) so their job is only to look at disclaimer language/contest rules etc. 


Both also take it upon themselves to use canva to make designs and send out to basically the world at this point which are not approved/seen by the design team and it's becoming a very big issue. The designs are never on brand regarding colors or fonts and use clip art when we have a robust image library. There also has been a multitude of media that has been recently sent out with spelling errors because media coder is writing whatever they want and sending it with no approval. They both have access to sending out media to our global customer base which IMO needs to be revoked by I digress. 


We have tried absolutely everything internally. We have gotten to the point someone called the whistle blowers hotline and HR swooped in. 


Basically, HR found that neither party has broken any discrimination policies and neither have been physically agressive so they told us it's up to our department to handle. This was so upsetting for us to hear because there isn't a single person who hasn't been effected by this drama. This week we all had a one on one with our vp and I can't speak for others but I definitely told our vp I am becoming very uncomfortable working with them/being in the office with them because of how intense they get. They told me I'm not the first person in these one on one's who has mentioned this. I asked what he thinks he's going to do and he gave me some corporate talk. 


After the one and ones we had a team meeting where they started up AGAIN. Back and forth back and forth. Then the managers got involved and defended each of them. I was seconds from walking out of the meeting because voices were being raised and I thought hands were going to be thrown. It deescalated when the vp slammed his hand out and yelled ENOUGH. 


I suppose I could go to HR or call the hotline since I wasn't the first to do so. I just don't think they're going to do anything again and this is going to go no where. 


Talking to either of them goes no where. One hates the other because xyz. They had a mediation at one point with both in the same room together with their managers present and we heard screaming all down the halls between them two. It's like two cats fighting. This was when someone called the hotline btw. 


Also I don't want to leave my job at all. I am not looking for new work. I just want to make that clear. Besides them my job is fine.

1b4e7k7,How important is growth in a position?,"I am 24 and making about $42k a year working for a non profit in a marketing role. It is an easy role but there isn’t much room for growth. I recently made it to the last stage of interviews for a different job with more potential growth opportunities and that is more aligned with my degree. It seems a lot more difficult and will be a lot more work with the same exact pay as I make now. I was told I have a good chance of receiving an offer. 

I am also doing freelance work on top of my full time job that pays $2,000 a month- it is work from home and I really enjoy the work. There is also opportunity in this role to take on more work with a higher pay. Because my current job is easy and slow, I can do my freelance work there and kill 2 birds with 1 stone. 

Ideally, I would like to continue my freelance work and take the other job since it is better experience. However, the pay is the same and I would be doing more work and unlikely to be able to do my freelance work on the job. If the new job offers me a position but they are unable to negotiate a higher salary, should I still take it?

1b4e419,Struggling to find a career to go into,So I recently graduated college with my degree in psychology.. I have been unemployed since i graduated. Honestly I don't want to work and I think that has to do with the fact that I have no idea what I even want to do or what my passion is. I graduated with a degree that I have no idea to do with. I also just don't know if working for me.. obviously i will need to so I can move out of my parents house and start my own life. I just feel like I have many interests but I am not sure if I would pursue any. I have always loved animals especially dogs but I don't know what I would do for a career from this. I would say vet but that is so hard to become. I have thought about dental hygiene because they make a lot of money plus I would just have to go back to school for two more years. I could see myself possibly being a teacher but they just don't make enough. I want to do something that will let me able to live comfortably and pays enough for me to do that. I have also thought about doing occupational therapy or becoming a clinical psychology. I also love art and taking pictures but I could not see myself going into these things as a career. I love binge watching shows like I could do that for a living if it were possible. It is just very overwhelming that I have graduated with still no clue of what career I would like to go into. Basically I just see myself with so many interests yet I feel like I don't know if I am built for those careers in the long run.,MeasurementWorking36,1,1.0,2,1709349429,2024-03-02 03:17:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b4e419/struggling_to_find_a_career_to_go_into/,3,2024

1b4a4vv,Move or Take Raise,"I've been with my company for over 10 years.  We are a large industrial company with operations in both Canada and the US.  I'm currently a manager at one of the Canadian operations.  The organizational structure of the business means that in order to reach the next stage of my career (regional managerl) I would currently need to obtain some experience in the US.

An opening came up earlier this year in the US and it's mine if I want it.  It comes with significant exposure and a very straight line to the next regional manager position when it comes available (probably 5 or so years assuming nobody leaves unexpectedly).  Its very much a lateral move designed to set me up for future success.  The pay is roughly the same as what I'm making now.  It's also in a HCOL area and money will be tight there.

When I informed my current manager of this, they offered me what amounts to about a 21% raise if I stay.  The issue with staying is that there isn't currently any further developmental opportunities without getting into the US.  That regional manager role comes with full conpensation that is about 68% higher than my current salary.

I completed 88 credits towards an English degree, but I dropped out with such a low gpa that I don’t think I’m eligible to go back. I have also completed all of the gen ed requirements, so raising my gpa at a community college doesn’t seem possible. 

I really want to get the monkey off my back and finish my degree. I have the money to do so, but I’m clueless what I should do next. I’m not even sure if it’s the right move, since I originally wanted to be a lawyer and it seems a bit late for that, given that it would require even more school and I wasn’t the most applied student.

 I do have an interest in teaching, though, but I’m concerned that teaching isn’t a lucrative enough job to afford things like a house or a family. Financial goals are just as important to me as professional goals. 

Should I pursue finishing my degree or go another route?

I am been unemployed (Product Management & Partnerships) for exactly 1 year now and I don't feel great. I've been applying to relevant roles daily - around 50 per day - and been customizing my application for my interesting opportunities out there.  
In 2023, I was getting interviews. I even had 3-4 extremely good roles where I went all the way to the final round with the hiring manager and the team expressing their excitement to have me onboard, until i got an email that the role was put on hold. Of course that hurt a lot, considering the effort i put into each with multiple round of interviews. In 2024, I've only got 2-3 requests for interview so far. I feel like nothing is moving.  
While at it, I've been studying to upgrade and reaching out to recruiters for introductions. They say sure, but of course nothing is happening. I started providing consulting for startups, but they seem to be struggling with fundraising so it is not sustainable. I opened an account on UpWork to get more projects and keep myself busy. I've had a disk injury which forced me to reduce my physical activity to light and moderate, which don't allow me to offload bad vibes fully. I started working on a idea which is currently in alpha stage. All these to keep myself sane. But I still feel stuck! I am tapping into my savings. I am emotionally fatigued. I question my value and expertise. I really need either a miracle or a support system that can help me get through this and secure something good. I need help to realize my next step and secure an opportunity. I dont even know how to pivot and feel crushed. Who can i get help from? and how?

I just came back to the US from a 2 week long trip to India to visit family. The first week I took off from work and the second I worked Indian hours.

It was a great trip but on the tail-end my younger cousin got engaged and she is now getting married at the end of April(abt 2 months from now!). My family is the only one here in the states but despite that, I am very close to my extended family and really want to be at this wedding since this is the last cousin that will get married.

Does anyone have advice on how to delicately ask for this time off without hurting my reputation?

1b44hdj,How to know the right time to start applying to other jobs as a recent(ish) graduate?,"TLDR: Unsatisfied with my first job out of college, but unsure whether to apply to new jobs because I'm worried (if I'm even lucky enough to get a new job) that it would look bad to have this job on my resume for only four months, especially when I'd be hoping to leave any new position I'm likely to get relatively quickly.

||

Feeling very lost and I would deeply appreciate any advice people have to offer. I'm currently at my first job out of college which I started in October of 2023. It's not in the industry I want to be in nor am I in the role I'd like to be in at any other organization. I took the job because I didn't have any other offers and because I figured generic white collar work experience might be worth something. I had applied to--and not received--jobs in a fairly niche industry (I can specify if needed but I'm trying to minimize personal information) where the entry level jobs won't have new openings until November/December of a given year. Those were pretty much the only (entry level) jobs I could find for what I want to do longer term. I figured that if my new job was as uninteresting as it seemed I could just tough it out for a year and reapply to those positions that I actually wanted in late 2024.

It's been a little over four months and I'm really unhappy. I don't want to sound whiny but I think the specific reason I'm dissatisfied is relevant to my question. I'm ok with my coworkers and boss--nothing notable one way or the other. I have the (admittedly common) complaint of finding what I do extremely boring. The biggest reason that I'm looking for a change, though, is that it just has nothing to do with what I want to do in the future. It's in the wrong industry (for a federal agency when I have no interest in working for the federal government or the relevant industry) and I don't want to be in the role I'm in at another organization. On top of that I also feel like the experience I am getting is not very valuable to the jobs I actually want because the pace is incredibly slow/easy. I understand that I can play it up in job interviews since interviewers won't know it's been slow, but I've always been relatively ambitious and motivated by success at a career that my issue is that this just won't help me succeed. Because of the slow pace I've tried to do my best with reading memos and watching recordings of old trainings just to fill the time but very little of that is relevant outside this organization and none of it is relevant outside this industry.

I find myself wanting to get out sooner than my original \~1 year timeline because this also required me to move across the country and I'm not fond of the new city and miss my family/social life at home. I've started looking for jobs back home and half-heartedly sent off some applications, but I'm not seeing anything that would be the kind of experience I want. Every posting I've seen would have the same problem as my current job where it would have nothing to do with my longer term goals besides generic white collar experience. If I got any of the jobs I've applied to/seen postings for, I think I'd just apply for the same jobs in November/December 2024 that I'm planning on applying to if I stay here. The only thing that could change that plan is if the job wildly exceeds the expectations I have from the description (meaning the role involves different things than the description, not just that I get along with my boss surprisingly well or something like that).

So here's my question. How bad would it look for the entirety of my post-college resume to be 4 months at my first job and 6 months at my second?

I (29M) am currently employed as a full-time data engineer in a consultancy firm (Italy) and, while i'm more than decent at what i do, i am absolutely tired of doing that. I am utterly demotivated and completely disillusioned about the whole tech industry tbh, but this isn't the point. I have 2 great passions: reading and playing videogames, and i feel like the mental/eye strain i need to endure everyday just doesn't let me cultivate them, and this makes me very sad. I'm also noticing i stopped working out and i can't seem to find the energies to go to the gym or whatever.  
I decided it's time for me to stop spending 8 hours per day doing something that makes me unhappy and i'm starting to think where to look at. Any ideas?  
It still can be in the tech sector, just not a ""stare-at-your-screen-the-whole-day"" type of job. All i could come up with is Project Management, but idk.

The office is also nowhere near where I live, so we would likely have to move closer or I would somehow need to get a second car.

1b42zoq,Used to be friends but I was desperate and asked if my friend was hiring. Now he’s my boss and feel like I’m always walking on eggshells around him.,"Been on his startup company for almost 2 years now..We were already friends on Fb, IG, and LinkedIn before he became my boss.

Initially, I approached him as a graphic design freelancer. No reply but on the second try, He asked if I liked to write and he emphasized the need for SEO. But me being a multipassionate pushover said other things and said I could do that and also do graphic design, some photo/video editing, web management, etc. whatever they may need. He was very adamant in explaining that they’re just a startup and they already wasted time and money in ex-employee - and dummy me also assured them I’m in it with them for the long run. (Now I just feel like I owe it to them that I have a job)

The remote work I do is alright, as I get to enhance my skills too and am learning a lot in the dynamic world of marketing.
Definitely overworked and underpaid, wearing many hats as the “Marketing Coordinator” team of one, using my own tech, no benefits 🥲 
there is still unclear boundaries on wth I am in charge with and often times I feel like I am not doing a good job cause I am not seeing visible results like in our social media (cause how can I make visible results if my focus is divided. I already have ADHD) but my partner and my boss has assured that I am doing a great job (and am just overly self critical.)

Okay- 
I am also working on my entrepreneurial dreams on the side and I want to share many things about my work, what I’ve been learning, what I’m trying to sell,etc.. but I haven’t done so because I am friends with him on social media and I don’t want him to think that I’m not doing work. (I work remotely). 
He has also lowkey criticized me before by making a joke that I like doing things for free and created a tshirt design instead of working on the company’s tshirt design. (1-I did that outside of work. 2-He knows I’m not an expert but even if I was, that wasn’t a priority to my understanding since I already had other tasks prioritized-that were in my scope of work) 
He also commented on one of my posts before saying that I should stop being passive aggressive but that really just confused me because that wasn’t even about him?? 
After that, I just stopped posting..but I’m feeling like I just trapped myself and cant even express myself on social media to build my own personal brand or share about my personal growth/related to entrepreneurship.

1b41bjx,2 job offers on the table... having severe job paralysis #HELP,"I have been going back and forth for the last week and desperately need help making a decision.... my family is so annoyed with me but I am having the hardest time, I'm not sure if this is PPA but it is truly paralyzing to me.

Job #1

Pros   
Salary $63,700  
Life Insurance, Extended Health, EFAP, LTDs - all premiums paid by the firm  
RRSP's after 3 years, firm will match contributions.  
Vacation - 12.5 vacation days this year, 4 weeks after 5 years and 5 weeks after 10 years.  
Sick Days - 3 days + 1 personal day  
Hybrid WFH model after 3 months depending  
Performance Improvement Plan

Cons - working for 2 lawyers remote is difficult. Also an area of law i'm not familiar with. They're hoping to move me into working for an in office lawyer when that lawyer has officially passed the bar, until then I'll be working remote for 2 lawyers.

Job #2

Pros   
Group Health Plan, LTD, Life Insurance, AD+D - premiums split between employer and myself  
Vacation - 13 days  
Sick Days - 10 sick days  
Performance based bonus at 6 months  
Profit Sharing  
Area of law I am familiar with and have under 2 years experience.

Cons - Pay is $24.50/hour at 37.5 hours a week which works out to $47,775 ish a year.

I like the idea of having a lawyer in office to review things with, my experience working remotely for my last boss after returning from mat leave was awfully difficult and ended sour because she would avoid my emails.. whereas when I worked in office I could pop into her office to review urgent matters.  Lawyers sometimes need to be babysat. My problem is the pay is quite low even if I have little experience in this area, the other firm I have zero experience in this particular area of law is willing to pay well right off the bat.

I desperately need help with my decision. It comes down to money vs. knowing what my role will be. 

Let me know your thoughts pleaseee :)

I currently work as a security guard and to be honest i'm so burnt out.  I've applied to so many different jobs, from the State Department, NGOs, Non-Profits, analyst type jobs, researchers, campaign jobs, international work, even internships.  Nothing.  Not even a job interview in over 8 months, and I can barely get even a rejection Email.  You'd think with Russia being as insane as it has become, or the election coming up there'd be some demand but I guess not.  I did my master's degree abroad, I speak Russian at a half decent level and spend a lot of time at work trying to improve.  I get so much down time I even enrolled in a Russian class at work.   I interned during my undergrad for an organization connected with the Democrats, did a lot of fundraising, data entry and event organization, but never got accepted for any others I applied to.  

I literally don't know what to do.  I'm the only one of my coworkers who have even been to college, and everyone looks at me like ""Why the hell are you here?"" 

I make around $23 an hour, and i'm more than willing to take a paycut to get even the most entry level poly sci job, but it feels impossible.  I should have studied something else, but too late now.  If anyone has any advice i'd love to hear it.

Cady is a UX designer, and in my opinion their UX desgins are poor. But not my problem, I'm not on the product team.   


Cady started making video content. I personally found the content to be at the level of a middle school project. It looks immature and poorly done, but my boss liked it so I put it in the content program. Then this person progressed to telling us all the chanegs she wanted to make to the website. That is supposed to be my job to oversee. I have been overseeing website updates but there is a lot to do, and the changes have been happening slowly over time. I guess Cady doesn't have anything to do for her role because she just undertook this without anyone from makerting overseeing her. My boss is thrilled of course.   


Now it's progressed to her calling me up, and telling me I need to do XYZ for our social programs, for videos, content etc. Cady has no marketing experience and is not a manager and is not even on the marketing team. I am tired of being bossed around by someone who is not my boss.

1b3ydzl,Questioning my current job’s business practice,"Hello Reddit!
Not sure if this is the right place for this post, if not please kindly redirect me with this inquiry!
So I recently started a new position at another outpatient physical therapy clinic.
I got hired on as a patient care coordinator to deal with insurance verifications and authorizations mainly and basically managing all administrative operations, except claims and billing.
For some background of the place, it’s a very small clinic with just 2 therapists. The entire staff is made up of 2 therapists and myself. 
And I’m running into a bit of confusion here, specifically with claims and billing, and I feel like something isn’t right.
From my work experience in physical therapy, I’ve been working in pt for 6 years now, my understanding of how billing occurs for small clinics, is that they’re usually billed under a group NPI. Most patients don’t see the same therapist and while each therapist has their individual NPI, for billing and claims purposes, it’s sent under a group NPI. When calling benefits, this one singular group NPI is either in network or not. 
This new group I’m with has 2 NPI’s, one for in network and one for out of network. Just so there isn’t confusion, these NPIs aren’t the individual therapists’ but they belong to two different “groups”, well businesses all together. When verifying benefits, one NPI I’m supposed state the business name as X and the other NPI I’m supposed to state the name as Y.
I was told to never share the exact names of each with patients at any point. When it comes to verification of benefits, which I’m supposed to do, I have to verify both in and out of network benefits (which I’ve done before and I’m familiar with that specific process). However once verified, I have to give the benefit form to the therapist and they have to tell me whether the patient will be considered in or out of network. This part I’m not familiar with and I don’t understand what they’re basing the decision to be INN or OON on. 
Now to make things more confusing, I had verified a patient with all NPIs (I was told to never give both to the same rep but I messed up-it’s only my 3rd week here) and the one that actually popped up in their insurance info was OON. The rep happened to ask me out of curiosity how are we submitting for these claims if we’re OON and the patient has no OON benefits. I said idk I just work here verifying benefits. I get another call from another rep from the same insurance company asking me for some more background information. Turns out the OON NPI belongs to some dude that doesn’t even work here and when the second rep noticed that he decided to go on the website to find out if it was an error (going back to individual NPIs) but saw that there are only 2 therapists listed on the website that isn’t the one who’s NPI was being used. Again I said I just work here managing the front desk operation and the only thing I deal with regarding insurance is verifying benefits. They said okay it could still be an error but that they’ll look into it more on their end. 
There’s waaaayyyyyyy more to this story, overall, just don’t want to write more than I have already. But based off those things alone, is this a normal way of operating that I’m just not familiar with or should I start applying for other jobs to leave this place lol 
Any insight is greatly appreciated as this and the other “sketchy” stuff has had me really on edge lately.

Grew up really poor and scared about money. But I feel like I am traumatized and will always be afraid of running out of money.  
  
Money: I have more than enough saved to live in this LCOL SEA country for 3 years (going for 1 year) + I will make some while I am in this country with an English teaching job which should cover all expenses. For backup - Plan A is a high yield savings account which will last me 8 months in Queens, NY. I also have plan B and plan C funds (brokerage & 401k) that I can tap into worst comes to worse.  
  
Responsibilities: Currently, my parents live with me. I have saved up enough for them to live on for a year or so - I have an older brother and they have property back home (another SEA country) if anything happens. I feel like as they grow older, I will have less chance to do this as they need more help from me. As well as I grow older, I won't be able to do dumb things like this either. I have no one else to say bye to in US. Which is part of the reason I want to go teach abroad make memories. Currently, I wake up go to work and come back tired, sleep, repeat.  
  
Coming Back Plans: I will probably start applying for jobs in US 3-4 months prior to coming back from this trip. If nothing pans out, I will also apply for some master's program to create buffer room. Rather get loan for school than be jobless sitting around.  
  
What else am I missing? Any other edge cases? I am 25 years old, immigrant who became a citizen - US passport. Extremely frugal and wish to live it up in a LCOL SEA country while teach English.

What do I tell my boss and what don’t I tell him?","I’m 25 and I’ve worked at an engineering company for 3 years, the first 2 of which were in college. The office is an hour north of my hometown, and I live between the two. I would like to buy a house in my hometown in the next 6 months. 

I started fully remote during covid and really enjoyed it. I think I would be very happy with a permanently remote role. Then they went to hybrid and my boss verbally communicated to everyone that we would permanently remain hybrid. A year ago right when I graduated, my boss said we would be fully in-person every day for a month or two since we were onboarding several people. We never went back and now my boss says we’re permanently in-person. I’m not willing to live an hour away if I’m coming in everyday, and I am actively looking at fully-remote options elsewhere and houses in my hometown. I have received 2 remote offers that match my current salary but didn’t turn out to be perfect fits for other reasons (and I’m not in a huge rush yet since my lease goes till May), which I declined. 

My performance review is tomorrow and as part of it I’m expected to give my boss feedback. I don’t think I should tell him I’m looking at other jobs or that I received offers. I don’t know if I should tell him I’m actively looking for a house in my hometown, as it would show I’m obviously not looking to stay nearby long-term. I’m wondering if I should inform him that the area I currently live in just isn’t working out for me or my partner and that we’re looking at moving further south and just leave it at that. 

I think they really value me but I think the cancellation of hybrid work came from higher up, so I don’t know if my boss even has the authority to change it. This is also the meeting where they inform me what my annual bonus and salary increase will be. I think it’s already set in stone and I don’t think anything I say can negatively impact the numbers, but it’s something to consider.

Has anyone had any experiences at an event such as this that can give me an idea as to what expect if I do go? ",Fantalmao,1,1.0,0,1709304236,2024-03-01 14:43:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b3vxfj/teamwork_online_job_fair_advice/,3,2024
1b3vwuj,Advice on picking a relevant class/certification to use a $3500 education credit employer benefit?,"(cross-posted)

(southeast US)  
  
tl;dr: Self-taught experience related to software development, project management, and business data analysis that I want to turn into data engineering, product management, or senior analyst career 'next steps'. What class/certificate should I use the ""continued education"" money on to help me achieve this goal?  
  
Management has earmarked \~$1500-$3500 USD per employee to use this year for ""continued education"" and recently, via email, all employees were strongly encouraged to register for the class/certificate program of our choice and get that information over to HR by the end of March. I am not sure WHY they want this done so abruptly and don't really care but DO want to use this benefit to my advantage.  
  
I currently work as a business analyst at a software development company and have no degrees or certifications beyond an unrelated hard science B.S. and the majority of my current marketable skills have been developed ""on-the-job"" as I went from Customer Service Rep>>>IT Helpdesk>>>BA two years ago. These skills are mostly associated with project management, SOP analysis, and analytics (bugs/tickets/cost-to-serve/usage) with a wide - but shallow - understanding of the various tools used in this type of work. Some examples would be spreadsheet and reporting tools \[Power BI, Excel, Qlik, Tableau, Smartsheet\], project management tools \[JIRA, Trello, Asana\], communication/collaboration \[Teams, Outlook, Slack\] software development tangential \[GitHub, Postman, Datadog, Swagger\], and I've picked up enough SQL and Python to get whatever info I need OUT of wherever it is stored \[relational database, api, and integration experience\], cleaned up, and INTO where it needs to go \["" ""\].  
  
I would like to either:  
\-Continue on the business analyst path, learn more about data science and how to effectively communicate information, insights, and/or technical product development updates to non-technical stakeholders  
  
\-Switch focus to the 'back-end' of the development process and learn about software architecture and data engineering...(I am conflicted about whether to focus on filling in my self-taught gaps with the fundamentals OR to focus on where the fundamentals will be shifting due to the rapid changes in data science tools over the last 1.5 years)  
  
\-Slightly change in focus and lean into product management. I don't mind chaos and like that every project is slightly different and ways of working need to be adapted each time.  
  
\-Leave the traditional 9-5/salary work and do independent contract work in either BA work or one of the three categories of work listed above.  
  
  
  
With this background information and future goals in mind, I am looking for any and all recommendations on how to use this ""continued education"" money to help me get a little closer to my next career steps.",__ineedathrowaway__,1,1.0,2,1709304192,2024-03-01 14:43:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b3vwuj/advice_on_picking_a_relevant_classcertification/,3,2024

It’s now March 1st and he is still saying that it’s all HRs fault and he’s been trying to push it through. Basically, he’s making it sound like it’s completely out of his hands.

1b3v84c,Interested in nutrition and sustainability what's my next steps? ,"I have a bachelor's degree in Nutrition and currently work as a Nutrition educator/supervisor for nutrition educators at the health department, working for WIC in the USA. I like helping people but my current job is a lot more people facing than I'd like, and I have found that helping with heavily medically needy kids can really drain me, so I've been very hesitant to further my education and get a masters in dietetics to become a dietician. 

I'm very interested in nutrition, food systems, and sustainability. I'm not afraid to go back to school for a masters or a second bachelor's or both. I do, however still need to work and put food on the table so jobs that require extended internships like the 9 month long 40 hour a week dietetic internship, is a challenge to say the least. 

Also not afraid to relocate to make this work. 

My career wishlist would be
- 10-30% of the day people facing, maximum. 
- Some creative elements to the job
- I love sustainability, and creating sustainable systems. 
- I love nutrition and food. 
- I am not interested in a job/career that you regularly have to work over 40 hours for. I need time for myself too or I burn out.
- I like helping people, especially under privelaged populations. 
-Some physical element would be nice, I sit in an office all day and I think it would be nice to get some more movement in during the day.
-No cubicle, I need private space or I don't function as creatively or freely as I'd like. 

Struggles
-I'm very introverted so talking to people all day drains me easily.
- I had a hard time in college with some of the higher levels of chemistry and anatomy, I'd be willing to work on it though. 
-Paying for further college might be tricky, but I still have a desire to go back. 
- If it requires an extended internship, I might not be able to put food on the table and I'm the breadwinner of the house. (Open to hearing about grants/scholorships/loans that could help woth this) 

Thank you in advance!

1b3rrz1,"Stuck in career, evaluating options","Hi everyone,  
I'm a 29-year-old with a master’s in Media Studies. I was happy to get a job working with Google products in advertising right after graduation, 2 years ago. Unfortunately, the wave of global layoffs hit, and I found myself back in my home country.  
I then started working at a startup as a community specialist, but the company faced some cash flow issues there. I was not making much either so wedeparted out ways. Seeking a fresh start, I moved back to Europe. However, I encountered difficulties due to resume gaps caused by moving around and the language barrier, as English isn't the native language of the country I'm currently in. To make ends meet, I'm currently working in a restaurant.  
I've been contemplating my next steps, considering online courses and exploring career paths, particularly in digital marketing and communications given my background. Alternatively, I'm thinking about a complete change in direction and pursuing a different degree. If any of you have experiences or suggestions in this regard, I'd love to hear them.  
To secure a job due to language differences with the country I am living currently has been a real challenge. I'm even contemplating returning to my home country, despite the challenging economic situation there. Any advice or insights you could offer would mean a lot to me.  
Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. 🙏

I ended up moving to a new country with my family to expose my child to their other culture and possibly provide a better life for them.   


This company has been nothing but supportive of buying me anything I need to setup this company and gives me anything and everything I could ask for. (except for a pay that matches what I am doing for this company) The owners are amazing and we all get along both inside of work and outside of work as if we were friends that grew up with each other. The parent company makes multi-millions a year and easily have cash to burn which is why I can get anything I want for the company I put together for them. My probation ends in roughly 1 month and I will be renegotiating my contract with them at that time as we all agreed that this lower pay was just for the probationary period and I accepted it with that understanding. (my pay will go up roughly 75% more after probation ends)  


Now the conundrum I have is that yesterday I had a big company offer me to be the Director of their Sales Department with an annual salary that would be 3 times more than what my current company is offering me. This amount of money could put our family into a comfortable position to live a lifestyle where money wouldn't really be a worry anymore and we could retire in 10 years.  


I really want to stay with my current company as it is extremely rare to find an owner that is as smart at running a very successful business as he is as well as find time to be personable to every employee he has. (No employee has ever quit from their job and only a few that didn't fit into the family were let go. The others have been with him since the very beginning.)   


Should I bring up this other company (not name specifics but enough so he know I am not BSing him) to the owner and let him know that I am being headhunted and they're offering me 3x what my current salary is? I want to give him an opportunity to reflect and consider paying me more when the contract renewal happens due to me bringing his vision to life for this company singlehandedly through months and months of blood sweat and tears.

1b3okoe,I'm 23 and at a loss on where to go from here...,"I’m 23 and stuck on what to do. I’ve been struggling to launch my freelance marketing business. Ironic, I know. I’ve always loved creative fields like music, video, and photography, but couldn't stick with just one.   
I finished college in 2018 for a Film & TV production and got a Level 3 Diploma. But, it completely killed my passion for anything creative.  Either way, I tried to get a video editing job. After about a year, no luck, even after volunteering at a number of places.  
End of 2019 I switched to digital marketing. The idea of it being remote capable and the ability to travel was a big driver behind this choice. Decided to setup as a freelancer in Feb 2020. Pandemic hit, marketing budgets disappeared, but still managed to land a client via a family member. Other than that fuck all happened that year.   
2021 nothing happened for my freelance stuff. I decide to search for a marketing job. 3 or so months later I land a £23K a year marketing job with work-from-home benefits. I’m fired after 5 days. Their reason? a manager ‘didn’t like me’ and I didn’t show up to an 'optional' work video call before my work hours. My confidence took a hit. Went back to freelancing.  
In 2022, spent the first half doing nightclub photography with an agency. It’s cool at first, but repetitive hitting the same clubs 2 to 3 times per week. Especially when you keep having to dodge people getting aggressive and nearly having my own camera smashed up. Due to UK cost of living my partner and I save up and trial digital nomad life. I redo my website and focused on my freelance marketing. The trial was one of the best feelings of my life. But, I couldn't build enough clients and savings ran out.  
2023: Back home, I keep trying to get clients but get little to no response. My girlfriend and I decide to leave the UK again. This time mainly on her savings which I’m not too fond of. I land one client at a heavily discounted rate (£175/month.) I delivered agreed-upon work, but they stopped advertising after 3 months. Leaving me with only my original client. I leave the UK again. Spending months in new countries  is great, but it’s mainly to leverage the lower cost of living while trying to get clients. Yes, traveling for months at a time is cheaper than living in the UK.  
It's now 2024, and I'm still outside the UK. I return in late spring if nothing changes. While I've grown a huge amount personally, I’ve gotten nowhere in 4 years. My love for music, video, and photography has come back, but I don't want to chase another dream for years to potentially get nowhere.   
Do I:   
1. Give up the marketing and pursue creative passions?   
2. Go to Uni or something else freelance?   
3 Or do I push forward knowing that I’ve only been trying marketing for a short while?  
I'm currently at a loss on where to go and what to do career-wise and any advice would be massively appreciated.

1b3naai,Which job do i choose???,"TL;DR: Brown vs WashU

I have two job offers to be a research assistant in a psychology lab. One is at washington university in st louis, mo and the other is a brown university in providence, ri. Im from st louis so the transition from college to adult life would definitely be easier, i could stay with my mom while saving for my own apartment. Plus, i kinda wanna be near my family. The washu job is 18/hour. Brown is super far from my family, but idk if i should pass on an opportunity to work at such a prestigious school. I have always lived new england, but im worried about the logistics of moving there. I’m a little concerned about finding friends there, getting an apartment, etc. Brown would pay 40k/year.

1b3m9o0,Just hit 25 and nowhere near where I'd planned to be. What now?,"I'm a Junior Software Developer and have been in this job for 4ish months. Prior to that I've done some basic freelance web development and about 10months as a Junior Developer for a terrible company that treated everyone poorly and was mostly a waste of a year for everyone involved. 

I have ADHD and was diagnosed at the end of 2022. Prior to that I had a really hard time with study and getting any qualification. I hated study because it was so difficult without medication to focus but managed to eventually get a diploma in IT. 

I'm in New Zealand and the pay is very low compared to pretty much anywhere else in the world. I make $60,000NZD ($36,540 USD) a year and obviously can't really save any noticeable money after my bills and living expenses. 

I had always planned to own a house by the time I hit 25 and to have moved out of New Zealand or at least the same city I studied/went to high school in. But I'm still here, with no savings and debt Im struggling to pay off and I don't even have a well paying job. 

I have been doing some freelance web development but it's difficult to have enough energy after a full day of work without negatively impacting my day job. Plus it's hard to know what 'side hustle' is most worth my time. 

What should I do? Do I stick with web development on the side? Should I try find remote work in another country so I earn more? 

I'm very stuck and all my goals feel so far out of reach. I don't know what to do

I've been at a huge loss trying to figure out where to transition to.

Current job (3yrs): 
PROS: dream job, lots of flexibility/ creativity, lead on many projects that I adore (e.g. running a garden, planning events, etc.), close to home (25 min walk), love my work and what I do
CONS: my manager is a micromanager and a bully, I was passed for a bonus even when I was the only one on a team of 3 due to vacancies and have always surpassed targets, awhile ago my manager tried to discipline me (she gave me a PIP even though nothing on it was factual but then HR told me it was not disciplinary - since then I have been given a performance appraisal and was told everything is great?) 

Job I was given a verbal offer for (awaiting paper offer - nothing signed yet): 
PROS: similar position (well qualified), much better support from management, potential for pay raise after 1 year to 2k above current salary then an additional 3k on top of that at year 3, flexible schedule 
CONS: pay decrease of 1400/yr for first year, transportation (travelling around with 1.5 hour bus communte one way on longer days), closest location is a 40 min walk, more evenings, more clinical work less creativity/ minimal opportunity for fun projects, was told I need a vehicle but can't afford one - they are aware but worried about this due to all the travel

1b3jf4a,What are some preventative measure to stop making mistakes at work?,"I started a new job a few months ago and it was a huge transition. I went from a big company and a slow-paced environment to a small company where I am the only person in my department and it's very fast paced. I'm 10 years into my career overall, but for some reason at this new job I keep making mistakes and it's really getting to me.

Here is what I have noticed: I am really good at the high-level strategic and creative aspects at my job, but the simple tasks are where I'm prone to make mistakes. 

Most of these mistakes are from quick-turn requests. I do proofread everything several times, but mistakes still slip through. I think in part, it's because I don't have the time to step away from an urgent request and come back to it with a fresh set of eyes.

The second area I notice mistakes comes down to simple misunderstanding. I get a client request and think I understand it, only for the client to tell me that my work is not what they wanted. For example, a client asked me to post a Reel, which I did on Instagram, but then they were upset that it wasn't on Facebook. It never occurred to me that they wanted it on Facebook. I really don't know how to prevent these mistakes because I'm not even aware of it. If I didn't understand the task, I would certainly ask questions. However these requests seem straight forward when I get them.

Lastly, I had severe anxiety early in my career. I worked at a very toxic company and was fired. The next job I was so anxious that I started making mistakes like this. Since then, I have really worked on building my self confidence and had several years where I wasn't making silly mistakes. However, my new job is really brining it out. I'm definitely not as anxious, but I totally panic every time I make a mistake at work and the fear of being fired takes over.

If anyone has solutions or ways I can prevent this from happening, please help!

TLDR: I have a new job in a fast-paced environment and I'm making several mistakes. How do I prevent this? I make lists, I'm very organized, I use grammarly, I proofread my work several times, but things are still falling through the cracks.

1b3j9yt,Going back to school at 30?,"Hey everybody.  
I have a couple of questions that I am hoping you guys can help me answer.  
To give you a little bit of backstory, I am a 30 year old male that recently had the fortunate opportunity of having immigrated to the United States, specifically California. My highest level of education is a high school diploma from an American high school in the UAE. After graduating from high school I served in my country’s military for 4 years due to mandatory military service and then I started working warehouse/retail jobs and made the mistake of not going to university because I was young and dumb. After moving to the states, against the unanimous and collective opinion of many friends and acquaintances telling me that I’m “too old to go back to school” and “it’s a waste of money”, I would very much like to go back to school and get a degree in something I am passionate about, which is engineering. My questions are:  
\-I’ve read that there is a program in place in California called the California promise program that helps California residents who are first time students get financial help to attend college, (which i desperately need) . Would I have to seek a specific college or does this program have a list of community colleges that I can choose from? Also, how would I go about applying for this program since the answers I’ve found online regrading this program have been split?  
\-Seeing that I graduated from a high school outside of the U.S, where would I be able to go in order to accredit my foreign high school transcript?  
\-Can someone explain the pathway to earn a bachelor’s degree? Will I have to study at a college for 2 years to get an associate’s degree and then transfer to a university and study another 2 years to get my bachelor’s degree or is there a different pathway?  
\-Its not too late for me and its not a waste to be able to get a degree at this day and age, is it?  
Thank you and have an awesome day.",Mk_180493,1,1.0,1,1709260931,2024-03-01 02:42:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1b3j9yt/going_back_to_school_at_30/,3,2024

I work at a startup that has less than 100 employees and am one of a few employees that knows enough about software development to take on software projects that are beyond a basic level. I did a ton of work that streamlined operations in various departments with automation, tooling for specific analysis operations, and report generation that otherwise would’ve taken days to sort through. I think I did a pretty kickass job for someone who had next to no mentorship or guidance. At some point I began to feel very lost and unsupported, so I had a conversation with our director of engineering. I told her about an idea of mine to create a small software-focused and explained there was certainly enough need for it. I offered to help develop that team and also to create some standards around software as a whole since we didn’t have any up until this point. She told me that she didn’t think I would cut it as a manager/leader, and that she didn’t envision a team like this for another 5-10 years. A couple days later it turns out she went to the COO with my idea and took complete credit for it. They loved the idea so much they wanted to implement right away. My new manager is now a part time employee that micromanages the crap out of me. He also asks me to do things like creating a long term road map for our team, define possible projects for everyone, and write up value propositions which all kind of seems like his responsibility. I am already underpaid and certainly am not paid enough to be handed managerial tasks by my own manager. What do I do in this situation?

1b3i1ee,Was promised a position but I am now being moved into different positions and another department without my input,"I (30M) work for a bioscience company that consults with med device and pharma product. I have worked for a couple years with this company and was told by my director that I would be moving into a cross functional project manager position. This conversation started in Fall 2023. I asked what the raise would look like and everything and they said that the details were still in the works.

I approached this opportunity cautiously as I have been burned in the past. I kept my current title and pay, but started working in projects for the company. I also started building relationships with key individuals and learning the process as much as possible.

Meanwhile we were having these meetings about what the role would look like; mind you, it would have been a high visibility role to help projects between companies and land revenue that was lost in the last year.

I reviewed past revenue data, looked at the customers, their products and projects and concluded that there were priority projects falling through the cracks.

I loved working with my consulting team as they're all very talented and knowledgeable individuals in their respective fields. They're also professional and personable.

After a couple months, I'm working under this new de facto title and assuming the responsibility of the job as well as worked with my director on the job description while I await the solid offer for this new role.

My director said that they let the CEO know I would be in this role and work with their team last month in a leadership meeting.

Then today, I get an invite to meet with my boss and their boss as well as another director in another department.

Long story short, the other department director offers me a PM position, but in Sales. There is almost no pay increase, if at all. And I would be working with a whole new team and everything.

I was blind sided to say the least. I thought my boss wanted to keep me under their team, who I have loved working with, only for them to tell me I will be reporting to a whole different department without my input.

I felt like it was a bait and switch situation all this time and I'm frustrated by it. I am grateful to have a job, but it was not what I had pictured at all.

What would you do in this situation? Should I just accept the new position even thought it's not something I was looking for?

1b3hl3l,Seeking Career Advice: Teaching to Corporate with a Side of AI/ML?,"I'm at a crossroads in my career and am really hoping for some of your wisdom. Here's the context:

After spending 5 years in teaching—3 of those as a computer science teacher (covering AP Computer Science A, intro to object-oriented programming, Python, cybersecurity, and software development) and 2 years as a special education teacher for students with emotional disabilities—I find myself contemplating a significant shift. On top of my teaching duties, I've started exploring master's programs in AI and machine learning, driven by a passion for tech and a desire to dive deeper into these fields.

A recent development has thrown an interesting wrench into my plans. A new business teacher at my school, who originally transitioned from a 25+ year career in accounting to give back, is now considering a return to the corporate sector. Her reasons stem from frustrations with the educational system's bureaucracy and the glacial pace of change. She's especially worried about the scheduling of her dual credit business classes for the next academic year, which she believes could negatively impact student retention and success due to a poorly timed schedule. This dissatisfaction has her leaning towards going back to corporate, and she's even offered to help me explore opportunities in the corporate world for computer science.

The idea is tempting. I'm genuinely passionate about my job and the impact I have on my students, but the allure of a higher salary in the corporate sector, especially one that could leverage my interests in AI and machine learning, is strong. My ultimate goal is to find a role that balances my love for technology, problem-solving, and programming with meaningful people interactions, without sacrificing the precious time I cherish with my family.

Here's where I need your advice: Given the new business teacher's direct approach (she's from New York and doesn't mince words), should I take her offer seriously and start exploring corporate opportunities? I'm wary of making any moves that might jeopardize the standing I have at my school or with her, especially considering her current frustration with the education sector.

I'm torn between the comfort and fulfillment of my teaching role and the potential for financial improvement and new challenges in the corporate realm. Has anyone here made a similar transition, especially with a background in teaching and a  interest in CS/AI? How did you navigate it, and what would you recommend?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences and insights.

1b3fqmc,Need some advice on asking for a raise after asking for a promotion,"Hello Reddit,

I’m a mechanical engineer in the aerospace industry working as a manufacturing engineer.  A few months back I found out we were hiring a mechanical engineer and only found out because I was one of the people to interview him.  I expected my boss to have at least asked us if we were interested in the role, but that did not happen.  A week goes by and I tell my boss that I would like to apply for the position.  He tells me they already sent out the offer letter, but will keep me updated.

A few days later, a different department coworker is talking to my coworker and I we’re talking about salaries and tells me I’m being severely underpaid (29 y/o making $76,220/year). 

Two months go by, so I asked my boss if I could stencil in some time with him to discuss my career growth.  We arrange something and I tell him this when I sat down…

“I want to start off by saying, I love my job, and everything I’ve been apart of for the past 2 years.

I’ve taken on various projects that range in difficulty, From ________ to _________.

i have gained more experience and knowledge of our product line and production faster than I anticipated in the course of this time. 

There is of course much more to learn as time goes on, but I really do feel like a productive member of the team here.

I’m a first pick for many when problems arise, and that makes me feel like I’ve built a reputation for myself that people trust.

With all that being said, I would like to challenge myself further and take on bigger projects that will make a larger impact on the company.

So how can become more valuable to you?”


He asked me what I was looking to do, and so I told him I want to do Design and more mechanical engineering up here with you guys (I work on the plant floor, not in the offices).  He tells me that we don’t have any positions open for that unless I wanted a managerial role, but doesn’t quite think I’m qualified.  So I said, though I’m not looking for a managerial role and it does sound challenging, not that I don’t think I can’t handle it, but it’s not what I’m looking for in terms of what I can provide to the business. 

He outlined that my technical writing skills could be improved, but otherwise I display a strong work ethic by dressing for the role I desire as well as work extra hours and come in on my days off to get work done.  

On a side note (me speaking here), I’m absolutely swamped with work.  I train the new guys on the job as well as do my own job, run the 3D printing labs, taking on various projects throughout the business and etc.   

I’m holding off until my review this month to talk to my boss about a raise that isn’t standard to typical 1-3% ‘some’ people get a year.  If happen to get a 3% raise every year until 2035 I will eventually make $100k/year.  

I guarantee my boss is going to tell me I’m getting a 3% raise, but how do I ask for $13k on my current salary when his mind had already been made up?
